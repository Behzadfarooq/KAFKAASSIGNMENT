<li><b>Delete</b> Delete it speedily. This is abusive of the system, and will deface the accreditations of this encylcopedia. It is a fictional academy? So what, lets create a wikipedia for Shakakan, Fresh prince television show keeps saying that word referring to some fake name. If you think shakakan should also be kept if an article like that existed then maybe this should be kept. But I dont think anyone will think that way.

Furthermore, KUCI 88.9 FM is <i>not</i> a national radio station; it is local to Orange County, and UC Irvine. In fact, it is specifcally called "Orange County <i>Community</i> Radio (emphasis added). This does not meet standards under point 11 of that list, since it requires the radio station to be <i>national</i>. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a></li>

<li><b>?</b>Is this what you guys do all day? I'm deleting my article with my own hands because I'd rather delete something myself than have people who base their opinions off Google News Archive hits and Allmusic.com do it for me. I don't think it is worth it to have to argue with you guys on a topic like this, because there is no point when your judgements come from the mainstream, not everything worth mentioning is from the mainstream. I'm sorry for attempting to make a page on one of my favorite musical artists and having you guys tell me its not worthy of a mention.

<li><b>Comment</b> It has five days' worth of discussion from the moment that Tariqabjotu nominated it. Responding to your suggestion of merging it with the article on Jerusalem - with all due respect, I think that's a fundamentally bad idea. Even fleshed out, this will still be a very long (unboundedly long, some might say) list, which is going to take up an awful lot of space in the Jerusalem article if someone puts it there. No other city article has a "list of places" attached, for reasons which I've always taken to be aesthetic as much as anything else. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 07:39, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I don't believe the article is linked from the <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> article anywhere (except in the template) and it's only linked from the template because the article exists. Several of the links in the {{<a href="../../../j/e/r/Template%7EJerusalem_8a53.html" title="Template:Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>}} template are links to categories that work perfectly fine.

The list also sorts things by <i>type</i> of landmark, collecting all of it on one page, the category system needs to divide it into a series of subcategories to achieve the same. I'll agree that the list probably ought to have some more annotations to it, but this does not make the presence of the list unjustified. In its present form, the list does serve a purpose as a navigational aid, although I won't oppose converting the whole thing into a navigation box (template for use on all Jerusalem landmark articles) if annotations are not forthcoming. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 11:26, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Lists and categories serve somewhat different though partially overlapping purposes. Any difficulties in maintaining a list are similar to the difficulties involved in maintaining the category; in fact, if you have one, it makes it fairly simple to maintain the other, and furthermore, if you have both, you are more likely to get a complete set including pages where somebody includes it in the list but doesn't categorize properly, or the other way around. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 15:50, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> A list has the advantage of having each type of place broken down, while we could do that with subcategories that would result in a fair number of categories with few entries.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> For all the good reasons mentioned above, plus for someone planing to go to Jerusalem it will give him/her a complete picture of what is of interest; I already found some articles that I didn't know existed.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> A category does not group things together, and to leave it in the [Jerusalem] article would make it insufferably long. (PS. Why do people always seem to fall back on the strict laws of whatever manual-of-style is "in" on the given week only when it is in regard with someone else's religion or icons thereof? Ever wondered?)<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/c/User%7ECockneyite_18c2.html" title="User:Cockneyite">Cockneyite</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/c/User_talk%7ECockneyite_95c4.html" title="User talk:Cockneyite">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cockneyite_d1c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cockneyite">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep but...</b> I would split this into two articles... one on "<a href="../../../n/e/i/Neighborhoods_of_Richmond%2C_Virginia_c34c.html" title="Neighborhoods of Richmond, Virginia">Neighborhoods of Jerusalem</a>" and another on "<a href="../../../b/u/i/Category%7EBuildings_and_structures_in_Jerusalem_9c15.html" title="Category:Buildings and structures in Jerusalem">List of buildings and structures in Jerusalem</a>" The rationale is that Jerusalem is one of these ancient historical cities where there may be articles about very specific notable places. Also, I believe there is a <a href="../../../e/s/s/WP%7EESSAY_6d64.html" title="WP:ESSAY">wikipedia essay</a> or policy on the difference between lists and categories and how both can be valuable in wikipedia if used correctly. <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 23:06, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As currently written, the article appears to just be a list of names in the category. However, it seems like it would be possible for the list article to be improved by, instead of simply listing the names, also listing some ancillary summary information next to each person's name such as where they are from or some notable performances, etc. By providing auxilliary information not found in a simple category listing the list article could serve to enhance the category rather than simply be redundant with it. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:23, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Possibly notable former Idol contestant. Pisspoor article which utterly fails <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. The only sources appear to be interviews with same, but principally chat and idol forum postings. I always find it amusing that this sort of articles frequently say "started singing at an early age", inherently unproveable, yet implying some sort of prodigious talent. I've tidied it up somewhat, but I think this is a pretty hopeless article and we might as well start from scratch.

<li><b>Delete</b> To answer Youngamerican's question above, most of the afds have resulted in deletion, and a handful have been kept. I can't speak for everyone, but my view is that per WP:N the question isn't whether or not the person won or lost the contest but is instead the quality and quantity of reliable published articles and interviews about them. To meet WP:N the article should have multiple, reliable independently published sources talking about the subject in a non-trivial fashion. This particular article doesn't currently meet that standard, though, since its references appear to either not be independent (eg her blog site) and/or not from a reliable publisher (eg an internet forum). That sourcing issue needs to be corrected for me to reconsider my recommendation to delete. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:48, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Blue's News (a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Reliable_source.html" title="Reliable source">reliable source</a>) source is not to a message board link, Blue's News archives have a message-board like format. Game was awarded Most Innovative of 2006 by an independent game news site that is also a blog. Lastly, TinyWarz is a notable independent game that is significantly different that other wikipedia-listed browser based games, over half of which have no sources (<a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution_%28MMOG%29_46e2.html" title="Evolution (MMOG)">Evolution</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Pardus_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Pardus (computer game)">Pardus</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planetarion.html" title="Planetarion">Planetarion</a>, Shartak ... etc.) see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_browser_games.html" title="List of browser games">wikipedia's list of browser-based games</a>.

<ul>
<li>Blue's News doesn't actually have any information about TinyWarz, and I see no reason to separate this weblog from any of the hundreds of thousands of other weblogs out there. Those other games that you've mentioned could also be facing deletion soon (though they're not relevant to this discussion). Notability is not determined subjectively- it has to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 05:23, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd disagree, Blue's News chose to recommend TinyWarz to their readership, that represents a notable achievement for an indie game - are you saying that if CNN were to provide a link to an unknown news site that simply read "Great News Here" that wouldn't be significant? Those other games are relevant to this discussion, TinyWarz was given 6 hours to demonstrate <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, the authors of those pages were given weeks, months, and even years to get them into shape (I don't want to pull out <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>, but something seems seriously wrong with this). BlKat</li>
<li>You have until this AFD is closed to bring the article up to standards. Furthermore, <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a> is not an argument. Finally, one will notice that in the past <b>day</b> this site has recommend in an identical fashion no fewer than <b>4</b> games, all of which appear to be "indie", as it is put. As this site seems to be nothing but a link aggregator of stuff they think is "cool", I can't in good faith think that being linked to in such a fashion is at all notable. So, I'll say <b>Delete</b>, as well. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 06:14, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>In fact, upon further searching, there appears to be something like 40-odd games recommended in this fashion, with no substantive comment, since the start of 2007.

<li>So your main gripe about this article is the citation? I'm sorry but for a game of TinyWarz' size official recognition is few and far between. The author used what he/she could find, but the rest of the information is about the game itself.

<li>I found this game originaly from that Blues News link. Blues news is a major link sight with comment. I even bought and wore out one of their T shirts. The Journalistic content of Blues News is their. I have seen Commenary and such that brought me back to that sight over and over, just to find out what Blues Dog had done now. I love Blues news and defenetly repect it as a great source of news and info. I really enjoyed the filter of links that he provides to both game and none game topics. There is so much on the internet that one can read, and the job of a good link sight is to tell or suggest to you what you might find interesting, and Blues News Does that for me in spades. 70.59.86.64 19:11, 28 February 2007 (UTC)Walterohdim

<li><b>Comment</b> - how is this any sort of argument for notability? A link, without any comment, from a site that links to many, many sites in a similar fashion does not notability make. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 01:43, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> As a newbee to Wikipedia, I have got a few question to the person who have proposed to delete this article.
<ul>
<li>Do you really believe, that games are not a part of our (human) culture and civilization? If you think that several web based games are irrelevant here, why don't you propose to delete the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a> article? It is not web-based, but still a game.</li>
<li>Do you really believe, that small things do not deserve placing here? Let's take an example of a small city of <a href="../../../z/a/b/Zabrze.html" title="Zabrze">Zabrze</a> in Poland. Do you really believe, that it should be deleted, only because the external links lead to something that was created by Poles, who are definitely not objective (like people from the Tiny Warz community), and so they are not reliable? Should we keep small, new things, especially if thay have something special (like TinyWarz 2D graphics interface)? I allways thought, Wikipedians want to be leaders, and not the followers. Or maybe I am too new here to understand the idea of Wikipedia?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Having read what you have typed, I think that the most serious problem here is that the TinyWarz is not important enough, to deserve being placed in the Wikipedia. Am I right? That is true, TinyWars is a mere entertainment, and does not pretend to be something as important as the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>. But we do have articles about other games and sports, that are also not so important, don't we?</li>
<li>One more thing: the same google query, as proposed by <a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a>, but with "-forum" modifier gives 80k hits. Moreover, it is more reasonable to expect some info about a game on website like pc.gamezone.com than at BBC, CNN or in the .edu and .gov domaines. In my opinion, in this case some .edu sites should be cosidered less reliable.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe, that information is not documented enough, maybe you could place the same warning as for the Vietnam War? Rafkory 20:17, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>The content itself has not been the subject of multiple and non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.</li>

<li>... "<i>could also be facing deletion</i>", "<i>probably will be deleted</i>" - can you be any more transparent?

<li><b>Comment</b> - you have until this AFD closes to bring it up to standards. If this topic really is notable, then you should have no problems doing that. If you <i>can</i> bring it up to standards, I would gladly rescind my objections to inclusion. As it stands, you have not made any serious progress towards doing this, and my objections stand. I also seriously object to any accusation of <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> - enforcing Wikipedia's guidelines in a civil and forthright manner is not "biting" anyone, and I find it tests the boundaries of my good will to be repeatedly accused of it in this discussion. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 05:05, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, lack of credible citations is listed as a problem which "may not require deletion" in the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Deletion_policy.html" title="Deletion policy">Deletion_policy</a>. Furthermore, the policy states that for deletion, the article must clearly violate the notability requirement. Tinywarz was cited by a popular game news website, and has over 30,000 external references (from google), so it's not <b>clearly</b> non-notable. In fact, looking at the pages that were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=0&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=0&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">deleted</a> for being "not notable", it seems this reason is used exclusively for entries which have no external references at all. The two obscure web-games brought up earlier also had <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Shartak_8b38.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shartak">deletion</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Planetarion_b9d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Planetarion">discussions</a> over notability, and both were kept. --<a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYaroslavvb_922f.html" title="User:Yaroslavvb">yaroslavvb</a>
<ul>
<li>From the deletion policy: <i>Articles and text which are capable of meeting these should usually be remedied by editing, but content which <b>fails inclusion criteria for Wikipedia</b>, is <b>incapable of verification with reputable sources</b>, or is in breach of copyright policy, is usually deleted.</i> Those other articles, while not relevant to this discussion, should really be renominated (they defaulted to a "keep" because of lack of substantial discussion). --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 04:34, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Again, we have <i>specifically</i> addressed this argument. This article does not meet standards under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, and therefore does not qualify for inclusion. The fact that <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a> has absolutely no bearing whatsoever on this - especially when the keep was procedural!

<li><b>REPLY</b> Is there a problem with having information in an encyclopedia? Why are you (you being the collective group of "editors") attacking internet games, vying for their deletion? Allowing SOME information in and deleting others based on arbitrary, albeit confusing rules seems to be more of a restriction of information. How are we supposed to fix the page when it's doomed from the get-go? Is there anything you could suggest that would be HELPFUL and not as negative as deleting it?Dr. Mordecai 04:37, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The rules are not arbitrary- Wikipedia cannot be a primary source. Only <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">attributable</a> information is allowed to be used. While this page might be "doomed from the get go", there are tons of other articles that need work.

<li>Echoing this, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> an indiscriminate collection of information. No one is attacking anything, and the rules are neither confusing nor arbitrary. To repeat, notability is <b>not</b> an arbitrary, nor a subjective attribute of topic.

<li>Find game reviews from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Most often, online games are kept because they have had a full-length review printed in a widely syndicated gaming magazine. If you can't find one of those, try and find full-length reviews from websites that don't contain user-submitted reviews/recommendations/etc. Articles in major newspapers too. The only catch with all this is that the articles must have more than a passing mention (ie, more than a short blurb). Reliable sources have some sort of editorial oversight and credibility to them; Wikipedia articles are only as credible as their sources- if the sources aren't credible, then the information isn't credible, meaning it should be removed. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 05:44, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>"The distinguished staff of TIGSource are a varied lot, culled from all over cyberspace to bring you all your indie gaming news, all the time.</p>
<p>Want to join the elite ranks of volunteers? Just pop me an e-mail telling me why you're fit to be a TIGSource editor. Probably the easiest way to get accepted to TIGSource is to have good writing skills - just because we're casual and fun doesn't mean that we type like monkeys! The second is enthusiasm. You gotta love indie games. Both should be reflected in your e-mail, so don't slouch!"</p>
<p>They may not be proffessional but they are an independent source and quite numerous. The main fact we're trying to get across is that this game does not have major recognition but does have unbaised reviews from external sources. Provided this page continues to exist we will continue updating and trying to gain more "appropriate" reviews for more distinguished sources. But you must understand that if you kill this site from the start than we'll barely have the chance to do so. Also Haemo, "obvious reasons" isn't a phrase I particularly like, these guides are very wordy and difficult to translate into real english. If you would care to properly articulate why this latest reference is unworthy, it would be appreciated. --Jester</p>

<dd>Well, from your excerpt: "<i>Want to join the elite ranks of volunteers? Just pop me an e-mail telling me why you're fit to be a TIGSource editor. Probably the easiest way to get accepted to TIGSource is to have good writing skills.</i>" Basically, anyone can become a "game reviewer" for the site provided they write well (which is really subjective judging from the entries). These people don't even have to be well-versed in anything online, let alone in games, which speaks piles about their credibility. It's the same as picking up someone off the street and asking them their opinion of the game.</dd>
<dd>I've done a pretty exhaustive search for good sources, and it doesn't look like the article has a chance of surviving. If you'd like, an administrator can have a copy of the article moved to your user page (or someone else's), sort of "housing" it until better sources (assuming they exist) come up sometime in the future. This is probably the best solution available right now- it won't have an article, but all the work on won't be lost. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 06:30, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I could become a writer for that website. I could make a post going "Hey I heard about this game TinyWarz. It's really lousy and awful, avoid it at all costs." I don't even have to prove that I've played it, and yet by that site's standards I could write whatever I feel like. Anyone can write for it- it's not a good source, and that should be pretty clear. Earth 2025 has won two Webby Awards, which clearly meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and has had multiple reviews (though only one is cited, I'll admit).

Its publisher has also been named as a featured publisher by <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_Media_8cf0.html" title="Right Media">Right Media</a>.

<li>Precedent is relevant because it saves time on discussion that has taken place already. Similar arguments were brought up for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Shartak_8b38.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shartak">Shartak</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Planetarion_b9d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Planetarion">Planetarion</a> and were not found sufficient, so the question is -- if they didn't work there, why would they work here? I believe you are trying to apply <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> too strictly. Looking at the first several dozen deletions due to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> in deletions log, they seem to be used for entries with no external references at all, not the case here. --<a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYaroslavvb_922f.html" title="User:Yaroslavvb">yaroslavvb</a>
<ul>

Most of it was spent bickering about "this number is big", which is not at all the main point in my nomination. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 00:42, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the problem is not notability, but lack of sources, why not use the <a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">Unreferenced</a> tag, and give Wikipedia community time to find some sources? After all, this entry is fairly new. For instance, that's what editors decided to do for <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_throne.html" title="Dark throne">Dark_throne</a> which also lacked sources at the time of AfD <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Dark_Throne_0cd2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Dark Throne">nomination</a>.--<a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYaroslavvb_922f.html" title="User:Yaroslavvb">yaroslavvb</a>

<li>This is a five day process. If sources can't be found in five days, then they likely won't be found at all. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 15:18, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Five days is too short. Another entry I contributed to (<a href="../../../m/o/r/Morphological_image_processing.html" title="Morphological image processing">Morphological_image_processing</a>) took several months before even one external source was found. In fact, I'm willing to bet that if you take wikipedia entries at random, most of them started as unreferenced descriptions, and had references added weeks or even months later. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYaroslavvb_922f.html" title="User:Yaroslavvb">Yaroslavvb</a> (<a href="../../../y/a/r/User_talk%7EYaroslavvb_495d.html" title="User talk:Yaroslavvb">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yaroslavvb_9760.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yaroslavvb">contribs</a>) 17:41, 2 March 2007 (UTC).</small>
<ul>
<li>Well internet articles tend to have internet sources. If they exist, and if any are found, I'm sure they can be mentioned on this article's new home on the Tinywarz wiki- there's no need to keep unsourced material here just for the sake of keeping it <i>just in case</i> some sources exist. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 00:43, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reason to keep unsourced material is because it was just added, and the wikipedia community hasn't had enough time to add sources. The argument here seems to be that the if the Wikipedia community doesn't find sources within 5 days, the entry must be deleted. That is against the spirit of Wikipedia, and you can find many entries for which the sources were added weeks or months after the entry's creation. Similar discussion took place over deletion of <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Throne_5a35.html" title="Dark Throne">Dark Throne</a> entry and the decision was to keep the article with "Unreferenced" template -- <a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYaroslavvb_922f.html" title="User:Yaroslavvb">yaroslavvb</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Furthermore, why would any editor produce an article in good faith that they knew did not meet standards? That violates not only Wikipedia policies, but the principle of the Encyclopedia itself. A hypothetical future source, which no one can find or produce, does not notability make. --02:59, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Editors are not paid, and you can't expect all the editors to always reference their information, that's why they put it on wiki where other people can add references. As far as notability, I think you are trying to apply it too strictly. I gave two examples which are very similar to tinywarz (in a sense that google doesn't give reliable sources) and for which discussion over notability led to a negative ( <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Shartak_8b38.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shartak">Shartak</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Planetarion_b9d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Planetarion">Planetarion</a>). If you look at the list of recent deletions over notability, you'll see that it's used almost exclusively to delete one/two paragraph entries with people writing about themselves, or things that can't be found on google at all. -- <a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYaroslavvb_922f.html" title="User:Yaroslavvb">yaroslavvb</a>

I don't know where you're getting this from- while it is sometime the case, it's certainly not exclusive.

<ul>
<li>I agree that it must be attributable, but just don't agree that five days is long enough for wikipedia community to find proper attribution. Five days is too short to delete it for lack of sources, number of internet references to tinywarz and people interested in this topic is too large to delete it for lack notability. --<a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYaroslavvb_922f.html" title="User:Yaroslavvb">Yaroslavvb</a>
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure of your logic here. You seem to be claiming that the 'number of internet references' and number of 'people interested' is 'too large', yet say you (or someone else) can't find a couple of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> when you're given five days. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 19:07, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's pretty typical of Wikipedia though. I'm willing to bet that most entries in wikipedia existed without any references for the first couple of weeks (just look at History for some random pages), and had references added later. You can't expect the original the first 1 or 2 editors to fill out all required information, that's the whole point of having the Wikipedia community to fall back on. All I'm saying is that we should tag the page with "Unreferenced" template as and give some time for the wikipedia community to fill in the sources (a month maybe?). --<a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYaroslavvb_922f.html" title="User:Yaroslavvb">Yaroslavvb</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It seams to me, that the problem editors are trying to point out, is the lack of the notoriety <b>that is confirmed by independent sources</b>, that are reliable from the editors point of view. In such cases, there are two solutions proposed: either to delete, or to <b>merge</b> with the article, that stisfies the criterion of notoriety. The same was propsed for the <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Monica%27s_Church%2C_Barre_f1d3.html" title="Saint Monica's Church, Barre">Saint Monica's Church, Barre</a>: "Merge into Barre, Vermont." Do the editors believe, that the article about the web games satisfy the standards? If so, we might just propse to move TW to that article, until the <i>right</i> sources are found.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Telling the true, due to the nature of the web games (all of them) they need a lot of time to become known to so called "general public", unless they have a big company supporting it, that is able to spend money on PR. If I may use the analogy, the same sittuation is with the SF books in Poland. Books published in big number of copies are not either mentioned by the "mainstream" magazines, that are sponsored by the Ministery of Culture, as there are not "serious" enough. Using this criterion, you would not be allowed to place any SF authors in Polish Wikipedia but Isaac Assimov, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_K._Dick_87c3.html" title="Philip K. Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem_c9b6.html" title="Stanisław Lem">Stanisław Lem</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Bulgakov_4d5c.html" title="Mikhail Bulgakov">Mikhail Bulgakov</a> and authors, whose books were used for making a movie picture. For all the other authors, the sources that exist are linked to SF community, and not the official 'literature' organisations, i.e. they do not satisfy the independence criterion .</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> this oddly feels like a continuation or expansion of the recent slate of afd's for various webcomics. if that is deliberate or accidental is a completely different debate. however, from what i have been able to glean from those debates, the afd should be the _second step_ after a request for sources hasn't been met. but, somebody will probably say if such is formal policy or just basic politeness. so base question, was that formal request for sources even made, or did somebody just light the primer cord on the article without even making the cursory attempt to start the process to fix it. 70.51.53.37 14:33, 1 March 2007 (UTC) steuben (fixing my spelling)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> WP:WEB is an invalid arguement in this case. tinywarz is a game not a website. it is a game that happens to played through &lt;insert browser here&gt;. if tinywarz was played through a downloaded and separate client then the WP:WEB arguement would not apply. so by extenstion neither does the WP:WEB here. unless Wafulz would like to expand on reasons for including the wp:web argument.70.51.53.37 16:35, 1 March 2007 (UTC)steuben</p>

<dd>You answered your own question. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> applies because you <i>don't</i> download anything to play. You said so yourself, you have to launch a <b>web</b> browser, go to the <b>web</b> site and play the game whilst surfing the <b>web</b>. There is no 'by extension', <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> applies to web sites, and this game is played through a web site. Or to put it another way, the website is the game and the game is the website. Very simple, no big leap of logic needed. Looking at your argument, what you have essentially said is: <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> doesn't apply because you play the game through a web site. If you had to download anything, then <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> would indeed not apply. It is then covered by <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> and this article would STILL be here in an AfD.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 16:38, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I disagree with such an argument for basically the same reasons. First of all, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> does apply, as per Kinslayer's argument. Moreover, <i>even if it did not</i> the reason for deletion is per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, which <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is a subset of - thus, a simple reductio argument shows that deletion is the proper standard in either respect. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 16:51, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I've said in discussions before, I can write an article on my <i>car</i> that would clearly be more then a directory, and source it to publicly-available records. (Accident reports are publicly available, I was rear-ended once, detailing the accident and sourcing it to the accident report would go beyond a directory.) At a very technical level, that would satisfy <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> (not my original research as it was done by a police officer, sourced to publicly available material), <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> (a neutral description of an event from a neutral, reliable source cannot be POV), and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (not a directory entry, not soapboxing, etc., etc.). What my car is not, however, is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>, because <i>unrelated</i> sources have not covered it in any non-trivial manner. The same applies here, from what I can tell, so I argue to delete. It should not be to us to determine what is notable, it should be to those who write secondary sources. As to your argument above, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notre_Dame_Cathedral_e852.html" title="Notre Dame Cathedral">Notre Dame Cathedral</a> may noy be in the newspaper today, but there are certainly plenty of books and other secondary sources available on it.

<dd>You are confusing notability with sources. Source it all you like, no-one is interested in your car. Whilst, a nineteenth century church connected with the history of a locality, operating a school (heavens, if I removed the rest and only mentioned a school it would be kept!) is obviously more than personal information. The problem with your criteria is it leaves us keeping passing internet fads which get mentioned in the media and then forgotten, but excludes perfectly verifiable information that will be of stable interest in 100 years time. It is a systemic bias, and it weakens the encyclopedia. And further, you still have given no reason why the encyclopedia benefits from removing this factual verifiable information, other than that it is the logical conclusion of legalistic pursuing of a supposed objective definition of notability. Objective standards of notability are a dangerous mirage - leading to foolish decisions. WP:NOT paper. No reason in policy or logic to remove this.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 13:41, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If the subject is genuinely of as much interest and historical value as you state, someone will have taken note and written a book on it (or have devoted significant mention in a book to it at least), or studied it in a scholarly paper about old churches or the region, or the like. The news media may be a reliable source, but they're certainly not the only reliable source.

<dd>Seriously flawed. If merging makes for better organisation of material, then merge. If it doesn't don't. I mean we might merge 6 articles on battles into an article on one war simply because we don't currently have much info on any other them - equally we split pokemon characters into separate articles because we do. Merging has nothing to do with notability. If the information is verifiable and encyclopedic, we keep it. We then decide how to organise it. If merging improves this information's delivery, and that of Barre, fine.

<li><b>Comment</b> The bottom line for me would be whether she's got multiple published articles specifically about her that didn't occur in the same few days. It looks at first glance at the references provided like she <i>might</i> meet that minimal standard, but I can't immediately tell. So I'll defer the verification to other editors and simply say that if her references checked out to what I described I'd probably give minimal support to keeping. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 19:04, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

Otherwise, it's like <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> said, she's <i>mentioned</i> in a lot of AI articles, but they're not really about her at all.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I see everyone's point, but I would contend that being a finalist on American Idol (note:this does not mean all or even most reality shows. AI is the exception, not the rule.) is enough to drag the subject across the threshold of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I would find this to be more of a candidate for having a tag requesting sources or expansion, not deletion. If deleted, I would urge the admin to note in the deletion logs something about deletion due to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> so that a future article on the topic that does address these concerns is not knee-jerk deleted via CSD G4. I would also make urge said admin to create a redirect to the season of the show in which she performed. (note: this is a cut 'n paste of my comment on Nadia Turner's AfD.

<li><b>Keep/Delete: both sides to this problem.</b> Agreement with person above. The authors specify that this was a rough outline/plot on Awyong Jeffrey's site. Well anyway, even if it does get deleted, Jeff has a point: if it's out in 2015, why not publish in 2013? That would be better for them, right? But they also said, on his page, that they didn't have a site yet! Professional work questioned... Bobbypirate12318:52, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I would have to say keep, as the etymology of words <i>and</i> names is worth knowing. Some may contest that, but since Wikipedia <i>is</i> an open-source encyclopedia it is up to interpretation what is important or not. If more <i>notable</i> information can be added to this article - importantly the origin of the name (what culture, what century, its first appearance in written text). As silly as it seems, names are important in view of the culture they stem from. --<a href="../../../o/z/g/User%7EOzgod_66f8.html" title="User:Ozgod">Ozgod</a> 06:01, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The etymology of words, proper nouns or otherwise, is lexicography. If you wish to do lexicography, the project that will welcome you, and any other similarly minded editor, is <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="wikt:Main_Page">over there</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:21, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete pending references and expansion</b> The key here is that the article needs to provide some information a dictionary entry doesn't. As it currently stands, though, the article isn't referenced and doesn't have any more background information on the name than, say, a Wiktionary article would. If the article can be expanded and sourced, though, to include some referenced historical information about the name then I'll probably change to "keep". <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 19:09, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> lists of people without explicit objective membership criteria. Lists are useful if membership of the list implies notability, and red links can show missing articles in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete pending expansion and references</b> It's ok to have both a category and a list on the same topic, but only if the list isn't just a copy-and-paste of the category. Otherwise there's no point to having both. So in its current form I'd say delete, but will reconsider if the list can be expanded so that it provides additional information about the individual entries that a category can't (ie make it an alamanc style list with some brief info about the people next to their names, and include references for verification). <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 19:13, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Cartoonists are not abundant enough to merit lists and there is no apparent relationship between a person's ethnicity or nationality and their ability to make comic books or cartoons.

<ul>
<li>True, but <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_cartoonists_f3aa.html" title="Category:Australian cartoonists">Category:Australian cartoonists</a> isn't up for deletion. In my opinion, that category is overcategorization. Australian artists seems good enough. Or even a category for Australian comics, since a cartoonist might be relevant to a certain Australian-based comic book. Like I implied before, there aren't THAT many notable Australians who work primarily as cartoonists. While we're at it, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Cartoonist%27s_Association_96f7.html" title="Australian Cartoonist's Association">Australian Cartoonist's Association</a> should go too. I would say the same for all other categories of ethnicities and occupations similar in fine detail to this. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 08:17, 1 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thank you for the clarification. I think, however, that the categorisation system should not be overgeneralised, as this makes categories unusable. There is a major difference between painters, musicians, and cartoonists, so I don't think it would aid navigation to lump them all together. Imagine if <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_artists_c75d.html" title="Category:American artists">Category:American artists</a> did not have any subcats: there'd be over a thousand entries to sift through--the category would become utterly useless. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 08:31, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Uh, Okay... Maybe you could try actually looking at the article one more time. I've formated the in-line citations to make it a little bit easier for you to read. You should delete articles when souces don't exist, <b>not</b> because they have been poorly formated. I'm starting to see why people feel compelled to write essays like "<a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_be_an_ostrich_6951.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't be an ostrich">Wikipedia:Don't be an ostrich</a>". -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 20:48, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

As a result of your reformatting, I hereby change my vote to <b>Weak Keep</b>.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> My dad went to this school so I thought I'd have a look to see if I could improve this. Sadly I don't think I can justify keeping it. The school has a website and an online prospectus <a href="http://www.montgomeryschool.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.montgomeryschool.co.uk" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This suggests that the school has a good <a href="../../../o/f/s/Ofsted.html" title="Ofsted">Ofsted</a> report plus a number of awards. However the awards are things such as <a href="../../../i/n/v/Investors_in_People_8f0a.html" title="Investors in People">Investors in People</a> which a great number of schools have, not enough to make this school notable. The website also mentions some press articles, but all of them are in the local evening paper.

<li>Well, I am the author of this page and am neither Daniel T Perkins nor a close associate. This my first EVER entry on wikipedia so heaven forbid that I do not get EVERYTHING right. I am simply a STUDENT, that believes that Daniel T. Perkins and more specifically his company MTS Technologies, Inc., has the potential to be considered a resource in its field. I did not create this for the sole purpose of benefitting Daniel Perkins or MTS Technologies Inc., but I did intend for it to be a reference that is useful to the community as a whole. I still consider this page a work in progress, so I would appreciate that those eager to complain about this page PLEASE bare with me as I make the necessary changes and am sure to write this article from a NEUTRAL POV. Patience is a virtue. Id like to see some of you do this, on the first try with no imperfections and flags on your page. I take all constructive critcism to heart and I will make sure to change any and everything that is not in agreement with wikipedia's policies. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 76.172.66.107 (<a href="../../../7/6/2E/User_talk%7E76.172.66.107.html" title="User talk:76.172.66.107">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_76.172.66.107_0f50.html" title="Special:Contributions/76.172.66.107">contribs</a>).</small>

<p>It doesn't seem like this article can be expanded, and has been listed to be Wikified for a while. Looking it up on Google defines it as an order to place an ad in a newspaper or other media - hardly seems significant for Wikipedia, especially if there's no historical background. Maybe better elsewhere, like on Wiktionary, but it doesn't seem to belong here. <a href="../../../k/i/w/User%7EKiwizoid_e81b.html" title="User:Kiwizoid">Kiwizoid</a> 07:34, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, unmaintainable and what is worse, the fact that one claims to be an actor having had a minor role would suffice to be in the list.

<li><b>Delete but Comment</b> I agree with the comments above about the list probably being unmaintainable due to its size. However, I did want to point out that a list does <i>not</i> have to only include people with Wikipedia articles. Someone can be worth mentioning in a list but not quite be notable enough for their own seperate article. Therefore this list could include actors who might not otherwise appear in the corresponding category. Moreover, I think the general concept of a "list of actors" might be worthwhile if the list provides some additional summary information about the actor next to their name to supplement the corresponding category. Thus while I don't think the current version of this list is useful, I do think it might be possible to come up with an alternative way to present some almanac style information about certain related German actors that would both supplement the category and be more manageable in size. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 19:25, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am highly concerned by the statement "list will never be completed" being used as a reason for deletion. Few categories will ever be completed. Wikipedia will never be completed. History will never be completed. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 04:26, 1 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You may have misunderstood what was meant by "completed." Out of curiosity, why is this so much of a concern? and to what end? But to respond to your comment, I would point out that by "completed" I mean "a majority of list elements having corresponding articles." A list of red-linked names with no other information is not helpful to anyone, and for that reason, if a list like this were to exist and serve a purpose, the names would have to have a corresponding article. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_people_2caf.html" title="List of English people">List of English people</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Germans_c6d1.html" title="List of Germans">List of Germans</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_French_people_3931.html" title="List of French people">List of French people</a> are all massive lists of somewhat equal proportion to this list, but all are "completed" (save maybe a few red-links here or there). This list will never be "completed" in the sense that those lists are because it is just plain impossible to make an article for every kinda-famous German actor and actress. Saying categories will never be completed either isn't at all analogous to this argument. A category serves the purpose of organizing already made articles. Lists serve no true organization purpose that a category couldn't handle. <small><a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a></small> 08:38, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Ah, I see now what you meant. I was referring to a different meaning of "completed" as in "no more information will be added to this list because it includes all persons/objects in its class past, present, and future". However, I disagree with your contention that "Lists serve no true organization purpose that a category couldn't handle." Categories organize alphabetically only. Lists can organize by other context-specific and relevant information. In this case, I am inclined to agree with deleting the article. However, I agree not because this is a list of redlinks (which is acceptable per <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> for development purposes), but rather because it's a list that does not provide any sourcing or additional information for the redlinks.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I also disagree with your reasoning that the redlinks "are German actors who are not popular enough in the English world to merit an article on the English encyclopedia". First, WP should <i>not</i> be <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">biased</a> toward the Anglophone world. Second, just as inclusion in WP is not necessarily an indicator of notability, not having a WP article is not necessarily an indicator of non-notability. If you will note, the proportion of redlinks falls over time in the article--it could just be that the mass of redlinks for the first half of the 20th century are notable actors, but in whom there is little current interest and/or easily accessible online sources. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 08:55, 1 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Before I respond to the comment I just want to clear up I'm not judging their notability by their lack of an article. I'm judging their notability because I randomly selected a few and looked them up. Obviously, tons of notable people don't have articles on wikipedia yet. In fact, because of the inherent prejudices of a lot of editors, we end up having tons of semi-notable people of some particular orientation and a lack of Universally-notable people.</dd>
<dd>Anyway...what encyclopedic value does a list of unknown (to the English-world) German actors serve on the English wikipedia? In a way, that's similar to having a list of characters from an American television show not aired in Germany on the German wikipedia. It serves no beneficial purpose. Of course the English wikipedia <i>should</i> be "bias" (I'm using this term in a non-negative way) towards the <i>Anglophone</i> world. Should we make articles for department stores that are really popular in Germany but completely unknown to the English-speaking world? I'm fairly positive an article like that would be deleted in a flash. Maybe a mention of the department store would be legitimate in an article on "shopping in Germany" or something like that. I'm not saying popular German actors CAN'T have articles on the English encyclopedia, I'm saying semi-popular German actors SHOULDN'T have articles on the English wikipedia because it interests probably two or three German-language-majors...and indeed, lists of an interest to a minority never pass on wikipedia; they are usually labelled as listcruft. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 04:22, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We should not have a list of semi-notable people regardless of whether they are Germans, Christmas Islanders, or Americans. However, we <i>should</i> have an article on a department store in Germany if the subject passes <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>.

I agree with your comments about <i>this list in particular</i>, but completely oppose any attempt to generalise it to apply to non-Anglophone topics.-- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 06:00, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Histories and politics of other countries are not "unknown" to the English-speaking worlds like a department store or TV-show would be. So because you think we should make an article for that department store because it passes <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> in Germany, then we should also make an article of an unknown (to the English world) German TV-show with all the details on it and its contestants. Each time you refer to "wikipedia" as in "wikipedia should be the sum of all human knowledge" you make it look as if the only wikipedia that exists is the English wikipedia. To me, wikipedia is all wikipedias, and indeed all the wikipedias do cover all the bases pretty nicely. The "Deletion guideleines" have a lot of overlap, like here <a href="../../../a/b/o/WP%7EABOUTEVERYTHING_0797.html" title="WP:ABOUTEVERYTHING">WP:ABOUTEVERYTHING</a>. Again, irrelevant to this list but just for future deletions, I would say things completely unknown to English speakers stay on their corresponding foreign language wikipedias. Otherwise this opens up a can of worms to let people literally translate every article they can find on a foreign wikipedia onto here. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 23:48, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your argument is inherently subjective, in trying to exclude things "completely unknown to English speakers". Who is to say they are completely unknown? I am more or less fluent in three languages and can reasonably converse in two others and have long held an interest in the histories and politics of countries across the world. I see nothing wrong with translating articles that meet WP policies and guidelines. Ideally, all the different-language Wikipedia's should have the same content, only in different languages. Your view of notability does not conform to <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, which requires the presence of multiple nontrivial sources, and is thus not limited by time or location (and no, I would not want all the contestants of the show listed, though the show should be included if it meets <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>--regardless of the language of the sources).</dd>
<dd>And how exactly do you define the "English world"? The English language is used by over 1 billion people worldwide. Is it just the 5 white Anglophone countries I noted above? Or does it also include India and Liberia? Does it include Germany, where a reasonably portion of the population can converse in English? Does it include a Rwandan Tutsi whose second language is English? I don't see why we should exclude material that obviously meets <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> just because an editor deems it not to be well known in the English-speaking world (whatever that is). That is more likely an indication that the topic is not well-known to the editor (see <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTKNOWIT_b3be.html" title="WP:IDONTKNOWIT">WP:IDONTKNOWIT</a>). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 01:01, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The people discussing it on the afd say they are completely unknown. This is how the system works. As I've already said "Histories and Politics around the world" are not "unknown" but a popular German TV show in Germany might be. All different-language wikipedias should have the same content? That is very idealistic and relies on a "perfect world" phenomenon. The English world is simply any nation who's primary language is English. There are minority speakers everywhere of every language. Things that are of an interest to a minority of people typically are deleted on wikipedia. There is precedent for that. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 03:00, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is an idealistic concept that will never be achieved (I'm a realist), but that doesn't mean we shouldn't even <i>try</i> to proceed in that direction. Being unknown has <i>nothing</i> to with whether a topic is encyclopedic. You define the "English world" as "any nation who's primary language is English". So, the English Wikipedia should have articles of relevance to countries like the US, UK, Ireland, NZ, Canada, Australia, India, Jamaica, Liberia, Ghana, Tanzania, etc.? That's seems rather a spotty selection not necessarily connected by geography or culture. Also, English is becoming a universal language, so it will not be too long before a large proportion of populations (at least those with access to education) in most countries will be able to converse in English (oh, and about 20-40% of a country's population--I mean Germany--is not an insignificant minority). I strongly oppose your suggested ethnocentric (no wait, more like linguo-centric?) approach and am surprised that you would want to create such a fragmented Wikipedia. I will, however, respect your views (even though I oppose any attempt to apply such views as the basis of deleting articles or content from Wikipedia). Let's leave it at that. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 08:41, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Fact is, if the Tootsi nation (making it up) of Burundi happen to have internet access and want to write an article about a tribal ritual only known to them in their native language, I'm sure it passes notability among their entire population, but it is completely unknown to English speakers and I will gladly nominate it for deletion; I'm quite certain people will gladly support deletion on the afd. Equivalently if the entire cast of actors of a semi-popular German soap-opera were given articles on wikipedia, I would nominate these for deletion too. This isn't happening so far. Nearly all the actors we do have on this wikipedia are pretty much in line with general notability, enough to merit an English encyclopedia, but your extreme stance on this is, in my opinion, is compromising the legitimacy of wikipedia as an encyclopedia and turning it into a dumpster for everything that attracted some attention in the world. That's bad. Sorry. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 16:39, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Really? Even if that "ritual" is the subject of multiple reliable sources published in Rwanda or Burundi (the common languages in those countries are English, French, and Kinyarwanda)? I'm not saying that subjects on Wikipedia should not satisfy the notability criterion, and please stop presenting my arguments as such. The cast of a soap opera will not meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, regardless of whether it's an American soap opera or an Andorran one! However, your argument is that <i>even</i> if a subject satisfies notability, it does not belong on WP <i>unless</i> it is "known" to "English speakers" (which, for some reason, excludes English-speaking Tutsis). I don't want "everything that attracted some attention in the world". I want everything that passes <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, which makes no distinction as to time or place (or ethnicity or race). And if you nominate perfectly legitimate articles (i.e., meeting <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for deletion for no other reason than a claim that they are "unknown" in the English world, that is a clear-cut case of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">disrupting Wikipedia to make a point</a>. No offense, but I'd rather not have the content of an encyclopedia determined based on what the majority of (apparently) white "English-speakers" know or do not know, or more accurately, based on the individual dislikes of editors. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:59, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I react strongly against the ethnocentric attitude of <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a>, and his/her views are not in agreement with any of the notability policies/guidelines on Wikipedia. Personally, I have no problem reading the German article if I want to know something about a German actor covered in the German-language but not the English-language Wikipedia. But if I would want to know something about Thai cinema or theatre, and the only articles on Wikipedia were written in Thai, I would not have <i>any</i> alternative. English is the global lingua franca. At least at this stage in history, English is the only language in which a truly universal encyclopaedia is likely to be written. <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharamond_ed49.html" title="User:Pharamond">Pharamond</a> 07:15, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Another point</b>: This isn't actually covered by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_actors_from_Germany_adc6.html" title="List of actors from Germany">List of actors from Germany</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/Category%7EGerman_actors_31ba.html" title="Category:German actors">Category:German actors</a>. It seems to be a translation of an outdated and incomplete version of a list of actors <i>in German-language films</i> at the German Wikipedia. These may well be Austrian, Swiss, or actors from some non-German speaking country who have played in German-language films (like <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristina_S%C3%B6derbaum_c66e.html" title="Kristina Söderbaum">Kristina Söderbaum</a> or <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fran%C3%A7oise_Rosay_f220.html" title="Françoise Rosay">Françoise Rosay</a>). I'm sure the English Wikipedia will eventually have a much more complete coverage of German and German-language cinema. The <b>actual problem with the list</b> is the somewhat arbitrary character of the selection, but that is something it seems to have in common with every other <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_actors.html" title="List of actors">list of actors</a> (that is actually a list of lists, but follow the links). If this list would have been based on some authoritative source, I think it would have been fine. As it is, it is still probably a useful list of red links showing missing coverage. Any chance it could be transferred from out of article space but still kept around somewhere? Isn't there a "WikiProject" for film that could store this as a to-do list? (The point of keeping it here, rather than just at the German Wikipedia, is that one can see which links are blue or red.) <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharamond_ed49.html" title="User:Pharamond">Pharamond</a> 07:39, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Subject's greatest claim to notability was being the editor of <a href="../../../c/r/a/CRACKED_9df3.html" title="CRACKED">CRACKED</a> Magazine for what appears to be only <i>two issues</i> prior to the magazine being gutted and relaunched. (The subject doesn't even warrant mention in the article for the magazine.) Only other stabs at notoriety are writing a handful of articles for a supermarket tabloid and running a non-notable memorabilia Web site.

<li><b>Comment</b> I am swayed on both directions on this.

<dd>No offense intended, but what you're doing is writing about yourself and contributing little else to the encyclopedia. Autobiographical articles are rarely permitted, and only so if they are about notable people and strictly adhere to the rules about maintaining a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. I nominated your article because I have my doubts that you are notable enough, based on the guidelines <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">here</a>. One other note, removing the AFD tags from a page is not permissible.

The only source for the latter is an on-line article in forbes.com which accuses "Darwinianists" of being "the most objectionable fundamentalists in the world today", but does not ever put the words "Darwinian Fundamen*" together in that order.

<p>This article is on a non-notable song, all it has is the number of the track on the album and tells us the title - not encyclopedic material at all <a href="../../../m/3/t/User%7EM3tal_H3ad_124b.html" title="User:M3tal H3ad">M3tal H3ad</a> 09:01, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Create a redirect to the album it's from - if interested editors wish to add the info from this stub to the article they can create a "Lyrical themes" section. If enough information on the song arises to warrant an article of its own, someone can then change the redirect and create the article?

<li><b>Delete</b> Notability not established. But I can't help but point out that I see no reference to anything remotely related to "visual art" in the article. There is mention of "art practices." But, what art practices? They sound like very sincere people doing very good work. But how is it visual art? <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 19:19, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Well, it's primarily performance art and public intervention, which is legitimate enough. The (lack of) notability factor comes in the lack of references or exposure beyond the local. Some or all of them may become notable, but they are presumably young, which I've noticed is a common occurrence here: young artists seeking notability through wikipedia, rather than being written about in wikipedia <i>because</i> they are notable. Wikipedia is a victim of its success, I suppose. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 19:31, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> A very odd question from bus stop. They say the "collective created a new and alternative downtown exhibition space". If they are not doing visual art there and in general, what are they doing? Poetry readings? Playing string quartets?

But I don't think an exhibition space is visual art. Do you? Is the creation of an exhibition space the same as making art? Why are we considering this article for deletion? We are supposed to be considering for deletion "articles related to the Visual Arts." If there is no mention of any specific visual art in the article, how can we bring our expertise to bear in our decision making process? <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 20:31, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The creation of an exhibition space can be "visual art": installation art, site specific art, art which critiques institutions. This is what they appear to be doing: creating an alternative space, or a space for performance, something along those lines.This all fits into the Rosalind Krauss notion of "an expanded field." But this isn't really about what is and what isn't art. I'm inclined to think of this <i>as</i> art, so I have no problem with it along those terms. My main issue regarding notability is as above. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 20:43, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

But I am not so open-minded as you and <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnbod_859e.html" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a>, that I think lack of specificity is acceptable. Whatever they are talking about, it has to be specified. If it is not specified, I don't accept that it is visual art. If it is specified, I may not accept that it is visual art. So, why should I accept that it is visual art, if nothing is specified?

<dd>You might have resolved your issues about what they were doing before saying it sounded like "very good work" above!

I was moved by the extent of their involvement in that, and by what struck me as genuine concern. That is what I had in mind when I said that it sounds like they are doing very good work. I do not know how they use visual art to advance their cause. That is not specified in the article. And, no, I do not consider an "art dealer" to be a visual artist, and I do not consider an "art lover" to be a visual artist. From where do you derive the understanding that these categories of people are visual artists? <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 21:24, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

They assert themselves as artists. This is an article within visual arts deletion. We are discussing the notability of the artists or in this case, the collective, not what specifically is or isn't art. As far as "not knowing what we're talking about," I feel confident that I understand where this collective is coming from within a history of performance and interventionist art. However, I do not think that they are notable yet in any art context. You may not like the work, or think of it as art, and as such you can recuse yourself, but I personally don't think that's necessary. I have taken part in deletion discussions about artists whose work I feel nothing towards, nor appreciate in any way as art, but I think I can distance myself enough to read it in a larger context of notability. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 22:10, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

And, I am not saying it specifically in relation to this article. This article makes so slight a reference to art, if any at all, that one has to wonder why we are considering it in this forum. This is, after all, a forum for consideration of articles concerning visual art. There is no assertion of quality or of authenticity vis-a-vis visual art in the article. It is a given that it is visual art. I see no reason to be run over by a steam roller with that assumption. Therefore I point out that not only is the collective of artists in this article not notable, but that it is entirely possible that we are not even talking about art. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 22:21, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

They are calling themselves artists, we have chosen to take part in debates on notability for articles within visual art, so this seems to be the only forum for this discussion.

But you have to make your case to me. You have to argue your point. You have to convince me. In that article there is no attempt to assert that anything being done is art.

<p>I think this is an example of an article that is a candidate for speedy deletion. That is because it is really not an article at all. Ostensibly it is an article about visual art activity. But there is no mention of any visual art activity in the article. Therefore it falls under the heading of patent nonsense. Notability is besides the point. The article is about nothing, therefore it should be deleted. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 03:46, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>And, to repeat: I think they are doing very good work in the social sphere. The article attributes to them what sounds like a sincere attempt to address homelessness in their area. I give them a lot of credit for attempting to tackle some of the most grievous problems in our midst. I think they should write an article about that work. Properly sourced, that could be a valid article. But mere allusions to artwork, without sources, is in my opinion just speedy deletion material. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 16:30, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Haven taken "Human Sexuality" in college we covered this topic at great length, so I understand its importance. Some countries do <b>not</b> allow for circumcision, while in some countries "female" circumsion (female genital infibulation) is almost required at a certain age. The article needs should be rewritten to cover this <i>history</i> of these policies and their origins and their modern days practices. --<a href="../../../o/z/g/User%7EOzgod_66f8.html" title="User:Ozgod">Ozgod</a> 12:56, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep'</b> Provided changes mentioned by Ozgod are made. Circumcision is a worthy subject, maybe revert it and stub it. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntinn_3c0e.html" title="User:Intinn"><b><font color="green">Intinn</font></b></a><b><sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EIntinn_fb01.html" title="User talk:Intinn">Talk!</a></sup></b> 13:40, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - In addition to the concerns raised by the nominator, the article is apparently based on a false premise. I am unaware that circumcision policy is formulated at the national level and the article does not support the notion that it is. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 14:13, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd agree that some <i>brief</i> quotes are needed in the <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">circumcision</a> article, but do we really need 14 mostly long paragraphs of quoted material? According to <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a>: "Inclusion of brief attributed quotations of copyrighted text, used to illustrate a point, establish context, or attribute a point of view or idea is acceptable under fair use. Text must be used verbatim: any alterations must be clearly marked. ... In general, extensive quotation of copyrighted news materials (such as newspapers and wire services), movie scripts, or any other copyrighted text is not fair use and is prohibited by Wikipedia policy." <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 19:07, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree, but there is a particular user (actually one current and a few dormant) who have a tendency to cherry-pick and make improper claims about those policies, so the only recourse at the time was to bring the entire text to prevent mischaracterization of the sources. Should this not be a problem, I too would be happy to shave it down; but that does not change the fact that this material properly belongs on the <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">Circumcision</a> page, and not its own article. Actually, I may do what I did with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionism_3913.html" title="Anti-Zionism">Anti-Zionism</a>, and bring a short paraphrase in the article and the extire text in the footnote. This should obviate all problems. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 19:18, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I merged the information, so I am now fine deleting this article. I do not feel that there should even be a redirect, as anyone looking for a policy will automatically go to <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">Circumcision</a> first. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 19:49, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> follows a false premise, no country among those in the article has established any policy, merely (voluntary) associations of some doctors have. Perhaps one could imply policies by statements of certain governments that they are Islamic replubics or follow Islamic law, but that's not the gist of this article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 21:55, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, there are no laws as far as I know ordaining circumcision, only religious and popular believes. I believe that we need references to the theme but not in a form that suggests that national governments either ordain or encourage it <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> 22:21, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - This article is absurd, since I know of no country which actually sets a policy regarding circumcision and the article (in spite of the title) does not show any national policies. Just a waste of bandwidth. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 22:23, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The heading in <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">Circumcision</a> reads <i>Policies of various national medical associations</i>, not the countries themselves. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 22:47, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Band with some local notability that fails central criteria of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. There are some real <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> issues here as well - the article is apparently autobiographical (<a href="../../../b/i/f/User_talk%7EBifftar_e0cf.html" title="User talk:Bifftar">this account</a> is a sock of the page's creator and is a member of the band). A lot of sources are given, but nearly all are either trivial mentions, self-published, or original research. Most of the notabilty claim seems to be built on a slender thread of secondhand connections with other groups that were notable in some way. <a href="../../../r/j/a/User%7ERJASE1_c81d.html" title="User:RJASE1">RJASE1</a> <a href="../../../r/j/a/User_talk%7ERJASE1_09fb.html" title="User talk:RJASE1"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 14:33, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Very Weak Delete</b> - long list of sources, but as the nominator says, some of them seem to be trivial mentions, self-published, or in some cases primary sources (e.g. pictures).

<p>Hello - re: self-published references - I thought the <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Demento_0de8.html" title="Dr. Demento">Dr. Demento</a> documentation, or the first (4) references, might be enough to show notability as those are national sources... I would contest there are multiple non-trivial mentions as the group has several notable ties that have been well-documented... The <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fripp.html" title="Fripp">Fripp</a>/<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belew.html" title="Belew">Belew</a>/Siggi/<a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradley_Fish_615b.html" title="Bradley Fish">Bradley Fish</a> connections all adhere to the wiki convention of notability if members have gone on to major notable projects...</p>

<p>I removed some of the self-published references and notes.</p>
<p>I still put forth that even without the Fripp/Belew/Siggi connection (which has to be notable and is well documented in various non-trivial sources) - member Dave Adler performs with and produces the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willy_Porter_85da.html" title="Willy Porter">Willy Porter</a> band (well documented) and also the <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Cheese_bbdb.html" title="Richard Cheese">Richard Cheese</a>/ Adler connection seemed strong.

<li><b>Keep</b> and tidy up a bit. It doesn't seem to be original research, it cites about 40 sources. The sources could do with being turned into links where appropriate and the article could do with being annotated to refer to them. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules1975_f2fe.html" title="User:Jules1975">Jules1975</a> 15:32, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This is a good essay, but it is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Userfy if the creator wants it. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 22:18, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b> or</s> <b>Userfy</b>. Claims of NOR have been made, but not proven with reference to any particular statements that are inherently unverifiable (see the definition of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>). That being said, I would highly suggest that the author include in-text citations. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 04:39, 1 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Revising my initial suggestion. This reads too much like an essay to be kept. However, it should not be deleted if the creator is willing to accept it. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 08:22, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I really don't believe that one <i>proves</i> that something is original research. Rather, articles <i>prove</i> that they are not original research by satisfying WP:V. In this case, it wasn't that there was no citation, but rather that it was a meditation upon a subject, an "essay." In other words, the citations served only in the purpose of an argumentative proposition. <a href="../../../u/t/g/User%7EUtgard_Loki_9cc9.html" title="User:Utgard Loki">Utgard Loki</a> 13:27, 1 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are right: the <i>lack</i> of OR should be demonstrated by sourcing. However, OR refers only to material that is inherently <i>unverifiable</i> (not unverified). There are many such statements in the article, I'll admit, but it <i>could</i> be the basis for a better article (at the least, it provides relevant sources). That's why I'm suggesting that it be userfied. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 17:42, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Note to the closing admin</b>. If the consensus is to delete and the article's creator is either unwilling to take it or does not express an opinion, I would like to receive the article into my userspace. Using the given sources as a foundation, I think an encyclopedic article could be written on the subject.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I always believe in what I see. What I saw here was a "biography" that looked like it came from a student who didn't know anything about the professor and had noticed the tattoo. That it failed as a biography was obvious. Most professors of most things at most good universities have awards and honors and publications, and so we need to look for the ones who really stand out from the background. There's no indication here that this fellow does (except for that tattoo!) <a href="../../../u/t/g/User%7EUtgard_Loki_9cc9.html" title="User:Utgard Loki">Utgard Loki</a> 13:24, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>In accordance to the Wikipedia:Notability for academics rules, three reasons why Kölling should stay in wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Rule 3</b> The person has published a significant and well-known academic work: Kölling has co-written a book that has been translated into at least four languages and is the core text for the CO320 and CO520 Computer Science modules at Kent University.</p>
<p><b>Rule 5</b> The person is known for originating an important new concept: The object bench was the subject of Kölling's Ph.D dissertation<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> and is key feature of the heavily used BlueJ and a concept that Microsoft have now adapted.</p>
<p><b>Rule 6</b> The person has received a notable award or honor: Kölling has received two awards for his work as noted in his entry.</p>
<p>I now quote the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28academics%29_2568.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (academics)">Wikipedia:Notability (academics)</a> page again:</p>
<p><i>"If an academic/professor meets any one of the following conditions, as substantiated through reliable sources, they are definitely notable."</i></p>
<p>Kölling satisfies at least three of these main points and therefore his entry should stay Tony Hunter 15:55, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> I'm between weak delete and weak keep on this one. He was a starting qb on a major Division I FBS team. But, it was a position he only held for a short amount of time with no further playtime in the professional league. Ultimately, if he had played for an entire year or more or had been an All-Something player, I might have said weak keep. But in the end, I'm going with delete on this one. ↔<a href="../../../n/m/a/User%7ENmajdan_9130.html" title="User:Nmajdan"><font style="font-size:11px; font-weight:bold; font-family:verdana, sans-serif;">NMajdan</font></a>•<a href="../../../n/m/a/User_talk%7ENmajdan_5041.html" title="User talk:Nmajdan"><font style="font-size:9px; font-family:verdana, sans-serif; color:#000000;">talk</font></a> 19:06, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment- Every starting quartback for a division 1a team do not deserve a wikipedia article. If a player, wins an award, sets a record (i'd even settle for a school record, like wins or touchdowns) or plays professionally, then he should have an article.

<li><b>Reply</b>: I don't know why you've got this vendetta against AJ. I think you don't really understand the college game. College QB's don't typically play four full seasons. College teams typically play a QB for a year or two and their backups "mature." It's a pretty common practice. Four year starters are much more rare than you'd think. I assure you that being a full season starter for an ACC bowl team is noteworthy.

<dd>I am not sure where my "vendetta" is. I am sure A.J. Suggs is a wonderful human being and I do understand the college game very well. I just don't want every Division 1 player to have a wikipedia bio, as it would create glut of unhelpful articles. Given that there are 119 D1 teams and many times 80 or so players on a team, I would hope any college football fan would agree with my statements. Even if you broke it down to the BCS conference teams, you still have dozens of teams with most of the players having biographies and other sources online due to the fact that college football is very popular (and a huge money maker for all the networks). We should wait until they play at the highest level of college for a consistent time period, set a major record (aka <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timmy_Chang_bed1.html" title="Timmy Chang">Timmy Chang</a>) or go pro to create Wiki-bios.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas.macmillan_a8c6.html" title="User:Thomas.macmillan">Thomas.macmillan</a> 22:46, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Closing notes</b></p>
<p><br />
There is some serious hoaxing going on here, perhaps by Duiek, or by Gillis himself.</p>
<p>Facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>User:Duiek said he is the same user as User:71.232.30.194, so I'll just refer to both as Duiek.</li>
<li>Duiek created the biography article for J.R. Gillis.</li>
<li>Duiek says he created this garden after he met J.R. Gillis, who told him his family history.</li>
<li>Duiek later says he has asked a friend and the friend says he has the book and has sent him scans of the book. So Duiek was working based on what Gillis had told him, before that.</li>
<li>When the forgery was found out by <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">User:Proteus</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittybrewster_2ff5.html" title="User:Kittybrewster">User:Kittybrewster</a>, and <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexTiefling_59d5.html" title="User:AlexTiefling">User:AlexTiefling</a> (good work), Duiek later says he checked the book in the library and agrees the scan is fake.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's possible that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Duiek is Gillis and lied.</li>
<li>Duiek is not Gillis and Duiek is telling the truth. Gillis lied to Duiek.</li>
<li>Duiek is not Gillis but Duiek lied about having been told about the Gillis family by Gillis himself.</li>
</ol>
<p>As far as I can tell, Gillis is indeed family name with a long history rooted in Scotland. Houseofnames.com sells Gillis family plaques and such. <a href="http://www.houseofnames.com/xq/asp.c/qx/gillis-coat-arms.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.houseofnames.com/xq/asp.c/qx/gillis-coat-arms.html" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> There's a book called <i>Gillis Family in the South</i> by Clayton Metcalf <a href="http://www.enterpriselibrary.org/Default.asp?ID=587" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.enterpriselibrary.org/Default.asp?ID=587" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>. There's even a whole web forum dedicated to Gillis geneaology <a href="http://genforum.genealogy.com/gillis/" class="external autonumber" title="http://genforum.genealogy.com/gillis/" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>. I'm sure they'd know about this baronetcy already if it weren't a hoax.</p>
<p>In the real world:</p>
<ul>
<li>W.M. Gulliksen Mfg. Co., Inc. is real, and J.R. Gillis is the owner and CEO of the company. I assume Gillis is a respectable person and wouldn't create a hoax like this.</li>
<li>I would like to assume good faith of Duiek. However, he is implicitly accusing Gillis himself of lying, a serious charge. We should assume good faith of Duiek, but on the other hand Duiek is a pseudonymous person and Gillis is a known semi-public figure, and we should also assume good faith of Gillis.</li>
<li>Gillis has been quoted in press, e.g.
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Nowadays you can do a search on the Internet and you can find everything, but you have found nothing, because everybody is just as good as everybody else," said J.R. Gillis, president of W.M. Gulliksen Manufacturing Co. Inc., a plastic injection molding company based in Boston. "How would you know who to talk to out of the hundreds or thousands of results returned by the search?" added Gillis. <a href="http://www.thinkglobal.net/Newsletters/2005_Q1/MA/ComNewsUSA_MA.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thinkglobal.net/Newsletters/2005_Q1/MA/ComNewsUSA_MA.html" rel="nofollow">[39]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Therefore, J.R. Gillis cares about what people find when they search for his name on the Internet. If Gillis himself is not the one creating the hoax, he might be interested in knowing about this incident. The contact information for his company is available on the Internet: 187 Gardner St., West Roxbury MA 02132, United States (617)323-5750, (617)323-3784 fax <a href="http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/product-compint-0000046194-page.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/product-compint-0000046194-page.html" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>, and also in the whois records for gulliksen.com.</li>

I do not understand how a list on 'people who have been pied' is ever going to be useful, to be perfectly honest. I also do not see why it should be on Wikipedia.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm also not emotionally attached either way, and I can certainly see your point, but it seems to me that while there's no overwhelming argument to keep this article, there's also (oddly enough) no real guideline for deleting it. It's not a neoligism, it's not original research, it's not unverified and because someone seems to have done a great deal of work, it doesn't even fall into those vague concepts behind the term "listcruft" (e.g. unmanageable, POV, etc). The closest valid guideline to delete that I can think of is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a> but even then I can see at least a vague argument that as a split off of <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pieing.html" title="Pieing">pieing</a> it's not necessarily "indiscriminate".</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> but delete any uncited examples (like the dubious one for the White House plumber (???). I agree that this should also be reformatted into the chart that was started. "Pieing" or whatever the term is, has become a notable form of protest expression with enough media coverage to warrant a list of examples. The intro could be expanded a bit to set criteria so the list is restricted to politicians or notable personalities who have been pied in public, otherwise we could start seeing names added of actors who have received pies in the face in the movies. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 17:55, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

A <i>heavily</i> modified and pared-down list of only the more significant 'victims' could be <b>merged</b> back in to the parent article but this list itself should not remain and is nothing more than a trivia repository.

Also, pieing (and incidents of pieing) apparently seems to receive quite a bit of coverage. I am unconvinced by arguments to delete, which so far have been WP:NOTUSEFUL (including the nom's reasoning), "no need reason to publicize and thereby encourage this type of assault" (I doubt people do things <i>just</i> so they can end up being mentioned on WP; it's much easier to just create a hoax article), and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>. The last one is rooted in a guideline, but even a cursory examination of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> shows this list does not qualify any of the 8 categories of articles that are listed there as inappropriate.

<p><b>Closing notes</b></p>
<p><br />
There is some serious hoaxing going on here, perhaps by Duiek, or by Gillis himself.</p>
<p>Facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>User:Duiek said he is the same user as User:71.232.30.194, so I'll just refer to both as Duiek.</li>
<li>Duiek created the biography article for J.R. Gillis.</li>
<li>Duiek says he created this garden after he met J.R. Gillis, who told him his family history.</li>
<li>Duiek later says he has asked a friend and the friend says he has the book and has sent him scans of the book. So Duiek was working based on what Gillis had told him, before that.</li>
<li>When the forgery was found out by <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">User:Proteus</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittybrewster_2ff5.html" title="User:Kittybrewster">User:Kittybrewster</a>, and <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexTiefling_59d5.html" title="User:AlexTiefling">User:AlexTiefling</a> (good work), Duiek later says he checked the book in the library and agrees the scan is fake.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's possible that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Duiek is Gillis and lied.</li>
<li>Duiek is not Gillis and Duiek is telling the truth. Gillis lied to Duiek.</li>
<li>Duiek is not Gillis but Duiek lied about having been told about the Gillis family by Gillis himself.</li>
</ol>
<p>As far as I can tell, Gillis is indeed family name with a long history rooted in Scotland. Houseofnames.com sells Gillis family plaques and such. <a href="http://www.houseofnames.com/xq/asp.c/qx/gillis-coat-arms.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.houseofnames.com/xq/asp.c/qx/gillis-coat-arms.html" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> There's a book called <i>Gillis Family in the South</i> by Clayton Metcalf <a href="http://www.enterpriselibrary.org/Default.asp?ID=587" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.enterpriselibrary.org/Default.asp?ID=587" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>. There's even a whole web forum dedicated to Gillis geneaology <a href="http://genforum.genealogy.com/gillis/" class="external autonumber" title="http://genforum.genealogy.com/gillis/" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>. I'm sure they'd know about this baronetcy already if it weren't a hoax.</p>
<p>In the real world:</p>
<ul>
<li>W.M. Gulliksen Mfg. Co., Inc. is real, and J.R. Gillis is the owner and CEO of the company. I assume Gillis is a respectable person and wouldn't create a hoax like this.</li>
<li>I would like to assume good faith of Duiek. However, he is implicitly accusing Gillis himself of lying, a serious charge. We should assume good faith of Duiek, but on the other hand Duiek is a pseudonymous person and Gillis is a known semi-public figure, and we should also assume good faith of Gillis.</li>
<li>Gillis has been quoted in press, e.g.
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Nowadays you can do a search on the Internet and you can find everything, but you have found nothing, because everybody is just as good as everybody else," said J.R. Gillis, president of W.M. Gulliksen Manufacturing Co. Inc., a plastic injection molding company based in Boston. "How would you know who to talk to out of the hundreds or thousands of results returned by the search?" added Gillis. <a href="http://www.thinkglobal.net/Newsletters/2005_Q1/MA/ComNewsUSA_MA.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thinkglobal.net/Newsletters/2005_Q1/MA/ComNewsUSA_MA.html" rel="nofollow">[47]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Therefore, J.R. Gillis cares about what people find when they search for his name on the Internet. If Gillis himself is not the one creating the hoax, he might be interested in knowing about this incident. The contact information for his company is available on the Internet: 187 Gardner St., West Roxbury MA 02132, United States (617)323-5750, (617)323-3784 fax <a href="http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/product-compint-0000046194-page.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/product-compint-0000046194-page.html" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>, and also in the whois records for gulliksen.com.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per original nomination. This list is actually <i>worse</i> than most of the "List of X" articles floating around. The scope of the list is extremely narrow, and with VERY few exceptions none of the listed characters has any importance beyond the movie in which they appear. These are horror films, after all, and the list of deaths is practically a rehash of the cast of characters in the individual film articles. This list serves no purpose other than to create a quick reference of deaths in a particular series of horror films - hardly something that fits in the scope of an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 20:09, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As an above argument for deletion stated, this list serves no purpose other than to create a quick reference of deaths in a particular series of horror films. However, this particular series of horror films is seminal, very popular, spans over two decades, and has been the focus of scholarly works ("Games of Terror" by Vera Dika is one that comes to mind). The list itself avoids common pitfalls we've seen on other horror movie death lists (pointless pictures, lengthy plot recapitulations, unnecessarily gory details) and meets the guidelines at <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>.

<p>Denialism: Orwellian words for the 2000's. This article opens an epistemological can of worms. This is not consistent with the purposes of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I believe this whole article is simply well-disguised original research. From the Wikipedia viewpoint, the article violates the WP:NOR as well as indeirectly violating the WP:POV policies (the existence of this article would seems to amplify "anti-denialism" propaganda, closing a self-justifying loop.) Also, reliable sources do not usually include mere blogs. From a functionalist viewpoint, the problem with "denialism" as a concept, and as an encyclopedic entry, is that it promotes poisoning the well: denouncing a view as <i>denialism</i> or its proponent as a <i>denialist</i> has the effect of leading to judgement before inquiry. Using <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuitter_aa83.html" title="User:Quitter">User:Quitter</a>'s own words against him:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Hence scientists and sciencebloggers have begun to recognize the phenomena of denialism in their interactions with those who use emotionally appealing or confusing arguments to cast doubt on well-established and supported theories.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>we see this very kind of thinking. "Well-established" <i>might</i> mean theories which actually are demonstratable beyond reasonable doubt, <i>or</i> it might mean uncontested propaganda. Which is which?</p>
<ul>
<li>Global warming is climatological / recent trend</li>
<li>AIDS is caused by/not caused by HIV</li>
<li>Holocaust was a systematic / happenstance killing of 6 / 2 million Jews</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just at a glance my main concern would be that I don't see much in the way of reliable sources for this article. Keep in mind that blogs don't normally count as "reliable publishers". Ultimately, the article has to provide some references to reliable publishers as described in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> in order to verify that the term isn't simply a neologism and that the information in the article about the term isn't original research and is also accurate. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:31, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>weak keep</b> It does need some references, but the references to use will inherently be NPOV on that particular topic, or else a recapitulation of the debate. The article itself need not be, for there are cases where the denialism is against something which turns out to have been false. A bad argument by bald assertion against the false can be denialism--either a stout denial that there is evidence for evolution, or a stout denial that there is evidence against--there can be both, &amp; one of them will be correct, regardless of how illogical the argument may be. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 00:04, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - it's a real term, and it very relevant to the current debate on Global warming, evolution, HIV "reappraisal", holocaust denial... and there's a well-established trend of the same people denying most of the above (like <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Inhofe_7654.html" title="Jim Inhofe">my senator</a>; <i>lucky me!</i>). <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 17:27, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

In other words, OR. Furthermore, as the nominator points out, this is a term that doesn't refer to a specific group or philosophy but is rather a way of deriding someone else's opinion, so the article doesn't seem accurate either. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 18:29, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: Seems to be a neologism. Regardless, the article itself is overly vague. It's not a specific concept, but rather a broad definition which could apply to several entirely different topics. It's also terribly sourced. Nothing gives us a distinct definition of denialism past the idea that denialism is about denying things. <b><a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User%7E.V._5c4f.html" title="User:.V."><span style="color:purple">.</span><span style="color:green">V</span><span style="color:purple">.</span></a></b> <sub>[</sub><sub><a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User_talk%7E.V._d46b.html" title="User talk:.V.">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_.V._ddc5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/.V.">Email</a>]</sub> 21:29, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This does not appear to be a congregation of a widely recognized denomination; from what I can tell from the article it is a small independent denomination although local in membership. As such it is subject to the rules of WP:ORG, which, at this time, specifically excludes congregations but includes denominations, without regard to size or geography. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 19:00, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I see no reference to congregations in <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> except where it says <i>For proposed guidelines on local churches and schools see: Wikipedia:Notability (local churches and other religious congregations) and Wikipedia:Schools.</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So reference to WP:cong is still perfectly appropriate. If WP:ORG were amended to exclude all articles about congregations, that would run contrary to the observed practice in AFDs and would be inappropriate and misleading, since many article about congregations have been kept. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 23:27, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>"Rejected" doesn't mean "totally meritless", it just means "didn't achieve consensus". If an individual editor still happens to agree with the ideas expressed in a rejected guideline, I see nothing wrong with a shorthand reference to that rather than a long posting of them in every debate they apply to. The closing admin is the one responsible to weight arguments accordingly. There's no prohibition against referring to something just because it's not a guideline or policy. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 23:33, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> I agree with Kevin M.--this might conceivably be a denomination--but I cannot tell, as there are no sources at all. The doctrines as stated look reasonably standard. Is an unaffiliated congregation with beliefs and practices the same as some other denomination(s) to be considered as a denomination of its own?

<dd>I would say 'no.' The notability of a denomination is based on the fact that denominations include multiple local congregations and have some sort of regional or national scope. Some individual non-denominational congregations have notability, like <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddleback_Church_d996.html" title="Saddleback Church">Saddleback Church</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willow_Creek_Community_Church_b6f0.html" title="Willow Creek Community Church">Willow Creek Community Church</a>. This does not appear to be such a church. Googling 'GateWay Church Reminderville Ohio' returns this Wikipedia article as the first hit, along with a map to a completely different Gateway Church in Chagrin Falls. It doesn't appear the church which is the subject of this article has a website of its own. <a href="../../../o/b/t/User%7EObtuseAngle_4728.html" title="User:ObtuseAngle">ObtuseAngle</a> 00:32, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A trip to the dictinoary puts me in agreement with Obtuse: <i>"a religious group, usually including many local churches, often larger than a sect: the Lutheran denomination."</i> Regardless this is an "organization" (possibly sect) and fits no case for special inclusion thus defaulting to WP:N, which it fails. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 15:41, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I understand your point about the difficulty in accurately searching for something called 'republic', however, even if it gets an occasional media mention, I'm not convinced that it's well-known enough to satisfy notability. Also, having notable supporters doesn't necessarily make a group notable itself. If prominent people support it, there more of a case for mentioning that in their own articles. So far as pressure groups go, this one seems to me to be a pretty insignificant one from the evidence I've found. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStringops_3dcb.html" title="User:Stringops">Stringops</a> 22:40, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> The first is a mention on a campaigns website, not a directory of notability. Does wikipedia have an article on Save Gloucester Mail Centre (Communication Workers Union - Gloucestershire Amal. Branch)? Should it?</dd>
<dd>The second concerns written evidence to a parliamentary committee. HMSO is <i>obliged</i> to publish all the written evidence it receives. If I were to submit evidence to such a committee myself, I would end up being quoted by the same website; that wouldn't make me notable enough for a wikipedia article! Indeed, if you look, you will find that the vast majority of the 96-odd published submissions are from non-notable individuals and organisations who quite rightly aren't mentioned on wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>The third link is Peter Tatchell voicing his opinion on his own website. Just because Tatchell is notable doesn't make any organisation he links to on his website notable! As I've said before, in the case of Tatchell, it makes far more sense to mention his support of this organisation in his own article rather than maintain a tiny stub in its own namespace. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStringops_3dcb.html" title="User:Stringops">Stringops</a> 02:36, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Keep</b>This is a topic of very significant consequence. People are advocating the replacement of the British monarchy with a republic, talk that would have gotten them spedily into prison in the nineteenth century and much of the twentieth century. The issue of republice versus monarchy is one that stocked the conservative ancien regime reaction against liberalism in Britain and on the European continent throughout the nineteenth century.</dd>

<p>It is rather remarkable that people are hurling charges such as sock puppet.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Westrimble23's unsigned comment was deleted by 24.137.96.117. As this is against Wikipedia policy, I have restored the comment. I note that in his most recent posting on the <a href="http://gradeyalexander.wordpress.com/" class="external text" title="http://gradeyalexander.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Gradey Alexander appreciation site</a> Daniel Yeoman identifies himself as Gradey23 and joins Westrimble23 in mentioning a Canadian author named O’Groussney (as Darren O'Groussny). As with Gradey Alexander, no books by Darren O'Groussny (or O'Groussney) are held in the National Library, the Toronto Public Library, or the various lIbraries of the University of Toronto and the University of British Columbia. The names "Darren O'Groussny" and "Darren O'Groussney" generate no ghits. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 17:02, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article provided zero reliable sources, hence the nomination. Note that the 'official website' is not reliable because it is not a third party source.

<p>The majority of these are just links to a site which is subject to a DMCA takedown notice.

<li><b>Keep</b> The links I tried were working fine when I visited the page; if someone is claiming copyright over stuff published in the 1860's, it seems more likely that it's an attempt to suppress uncomplimentary material than a valid copyright claim.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. The subject title implies that this is going to be an encyclopedia entry on the subject of early Jehovah's Witness writings, which would merit inclusion.

The publications listed here are all quite old. Are there copyright issues with the links here (which come from a variety of sources)? I'd be willing to work at re-writing the page to meet objections mentioned here. Are lists like this and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Watchtower_publications_2b14.html" title="List of Watchtower publications">List of Watchtower publications</a> not suitable material? Would it be preferred to create linked articles for each title? That could be done but would require some time.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is without prejudice with regards to the topic, the notability of the topic or the good faith and good judgment of the editors. It's normally reasonable to assume you're not linking to a copyright violation. I also want to emphasize that I am not taking a stand on either side of the main church vs the dissenters, theologically, or on the merits of their copyright dispute. I also have nothing against the Jehovah's Witness movement in general and I am very sensitive to deleting articles dealing with matters of faith. The problem as I see it is copyright. The article relies heavily on reexamine.info links and by our own policies, we need to remove these links -- and promptly. I am open to others recreating the article in the future if alternate, legally acceptable links are found. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia is replete with articles that are simply <i>lists</i>, so that alone is not justification for deleting the article. Whether the publications are out of copyright or not has no bearing on whether the publications may be <i>listed</i>. However, <u><i>links</i></u> to sites hosting material without permission that <i>are</i> still protected by copyright should be removed. Most of the listed publications are no longer protected by copyright. The article should probably be renamed "<i>List of</i> early JW publications" to make the intent of the article unambiguous. Another suitable alternative would be to merge with "List of Watchtower Publications" as a subsection. There is no valid reason for removing the information altogether.--<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffro77_a4f8.html" title="User:Jeffro77">Jeffro77</a> 08:13, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It is a list of publications that may be of informational interest to persons researching subjects related to Jehovah's Witnesses. It may also prompt editors to provide further information or create articles on some of those publications that may be of specific relevance. It therefore has some value.

<li><b>Redirect</b>: Only the protagonists of the GTA games got their own pages so far, while even major secondary characters that recur in several GTA games are only mentioned in the "List of characters" pages. With that in mind, I don't see a reason why Love Fist can't be limited to the <a href="../../../v/i/c/List_of_characters_in_Grand_Theft_Auto%7E_Vice_City_728d.html" title="List of characters in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City">List of characters in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</a> page.<br />
In fact, Love Fist already had an entry in the List page. I've enriched it with non-trivia information from the Love Fist page (such as credits and references to real-world events). So now, the Love Fist page should simply redirect to <a href="../../../v/i/c/List_of_characters_in_Grand_Theft_Auto%7E_Vice_City_728d.html#Love_Fist" title="List of characters in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City">List of characters in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City#Love Fist</a>. -- <a href="../../../r/i/t/User%7ERitchy_3c4d.html" title="User:Ritchy">Ritchy</a> 15:36, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article regarding two <i>Amazing Race</i> competitors. I first queried the notability of the article on the 27th, suggesting that unless there were improvements made I would eventually bring this to AFD. It was prodded by <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Spackman_9ce0.html" title="User:Ian Spackman">Ian Spackman</a> on the 28th as "sheer non-notable American cultural imperialism", Evrik later removed teh prod beause he felt they were notable.</p>
<p>To quote from my mesage on the talk page: My main problem with the article is that it is little more than a blow-by-blow account of their participation in each series of the Race - which is plainly unencyclopaedic. <i>There is little biographical information here that is a) not on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Amazing_Race_5_contestants_5db0.html" title="The Amazing Race 5 contestants">The Amazing Race 5 contestants</a> (in fact, much of the biographical stuff is plain copy &amp; paste from text I added to that article) or b) not suitable to merge into that article.</i></p>

<p>This page consists entirely of original research. Additionally, it was created by the creator of the alleged "rule", which violates the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html#Autobiography" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">autobiography</a> portion of the conflict-of-interest rules. Finally, it's not notable; there are literally an infinite number of "rules" that can be derived from algebra and some basic mathematical first principles, and there's nothing special about this one. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarcasticidealist_b731.html" title="User:Sarcasticidealist">Sarcasticidealist</a> 00:02, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom - per the author's own admission, this is original research. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 01:00, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ditto. Loniousmonk 03:29, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Despite the presentation, I am sure that this result, in correct, has been discovered and proved long ago. However, didn't we develop some kind of note or template to new authors whose first contribution was proposed for deletion, to explain the rules to them rather than just make them feel unwelcome? That would certainly be appropriate here. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 03:33, 1 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b>: Your suggestion to retain new users whose first contribution is AFD'd is a great one, and if no such note or template exists, somebody should design one. However, as to your comment about being sure that this "rule" has been discovered and proved long ago, it likely hasn't been just because nobody's bothered - the basic rules of mathematics are well understood, and finding new ways of making them interact with each other is generally just a waste of time. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarcasticidealist_b731.html" title="User:Sarcasticidealist">Sarcasticidealist</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/r/User_talk%7ESarcasticidealist_745a.html" title="User talk:Sarcasticidealist">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sarcasticidealist_ba7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sarcasticidealist">contribs</a>) 08:29, 1 March 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It's true, but naming it after a high schooler who supposedly (no way of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifying</a> this) wrote it out for the first time is just silly. I remember discovering in grade school that <span class="texhtml">(<i>n</i> + 1)<sup>2</sup> − <i>n</i><sup>2</sup> = 2<i>n</i> + 1</span>, does anybody propose we call this Veinor's identity? <a href="../../../v/e/i/User%7EVeinor_0082.html" title="User:Veinor">Veinor</a> <a href="../../../v/e/i/User_talk%7EVeinor_8b70.html" title="User talk:Veinor"><sup>(talk to me)</sup></a> 21:04, 1 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Veinor's point is well-taken, but let's not belittle the article-creator, either. Brad's Theorem was that the last digit of the fifth power of any (base-ten) integer is the same as the last digit of the integer.&#160;:) It seemed like a good idea at the time, and I am sure that if there had been a Wikipedia then I would have posted it, and been on the wrong end of this discussion. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 21:10, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
