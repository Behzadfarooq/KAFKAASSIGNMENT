<li><b>Keep</b> There are many types of pages that describe things from video games (and movies and books......). I don't think that it is a <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_guide.html" title="Game guide">game guide</a>. A quote from our page on game guides: <i>instruction books that contain hints or complete solutions to specific video games. The exact meaning of a "strategy guide" these days is very vague, as most could be easily ranked as "walkthroughs" or "hint collections".</i> It doesn't give hints, it just describes the classes. <a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrown1023_a728.html" title="User:Cbrown1023">Cbrown1023</a> 00:55, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is not a game guide, aside from a few iffy sections. It merely describes something that is characteristic of a game. The information is primarily an extension of the already existing WoW article, providing more details about the classes than can easily fit there. If you see anything that says something like "Taurnes make the best Shamans when they do this build" delete it, but the article itself isn't a problem.

<ul>
<li>That's not very informative. I asked about your encyclopedia threshold, not for references to what is a very ill-defined standard. The page you cited doesn't describe the difference between a game guide and information about a game at all, and IMHO, is close to outright uselessness. So I ask, where is the threshold for you (or for anybody else claiming it is a game guide, I'm not addressing this to you in particular) as to what is a game guide, and what is encyclopedic content about a game? Where do you, speaking for yourself, draw the line? What would shift the balance of this article to encyclopedic? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This article is essentially a summary of the WoW site on character classes: <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and the sub-pages of that page. In my opinion, that makes it analogous to a gaming guide. Suitable for a gaming wiki, not for an encyclopedia -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)"><b>Samir</b> <small>धर्म</small></a> 04:35, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree. While it certainly can be argued that this page is redundant to any number of pages on classes in World of Warcraft, that is not a reason for deletion. In fact, that's a good thing, since it means there are sources on it. Anyway, this is an article that has spun off from the main article about a game, and there's no question of deleting that. Nor does the information being about a game make it a game guide in the sense that I'd consider it inherently objectionable. So really, what makes an article about a game, or aspect of it a game guide? What do you feel would have to be removed or added to make this article encyclopedic? What do you feel about the other articles about character classes? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 04:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see much in terms of sources. The only <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is the link I listed above and its subpages. This article is essentially a re-hash of that particular guide to the character classes. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)"><b>Samir</b> <small>धर्म</small></a> 06:10, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Lack of sources is not itself a reason for deletion, and if you want to tag it as unsourced, go right ahead. There's no shortage of informative books about WoW, that's for sure. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 06:48, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, but this can fundamentally draw from only one source, right. In its ideal, it will be the players guide to the classes of WoW. That's what defines its (for want of a better term) cruftiness and non-encyclopedic nature -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)"><b>Samir</b> <small>धर्म</small></a> 07:34, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So in your view all articles not being the game/movie/book etc. should be deleted? Say example articles built on said main article; <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer_J._Simpson_dd4c.html" title="Homer J. Simpson">Homer J. Simpson</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandalf.html" title="Gandalf">Gandalf</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario.html" title="Mario">Mario</a>, <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excalibur.html" title="Excalibur">Excalibur</a> etc. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 10:59, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Fundamentally, almost all articles about an aspect of a creative media can only draw from one source. I don't think that means much. This article isn't existing in isolation, but is a daughter of the main <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> article. Since people what to know about that, this aspect of it needs coverage there. But wait, that article has become rather long. So a convenient section was spun-off. And while I suppose if you define ideal as "Completely exhaustive and informative about a subject" it might qualify as a game guide, but there's a difference between that and setting a goal as "ideal for Wikipedia" which would simply be informative to the extent appropriate for an encyclopedia. In this case, I'd say a sufficient description so that the uninformed person can understand what the classes individually mean in the game is what we should be shooting for. Where do you draw the line? Having no content whatsoever? Having one line summaries? Again, I ask, where do you draw the line? What should be added or removed? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:31, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, as I see it the seperate article is meant to summarize what the classes can do, and exists because doing those summaries properly would contribute to an existing <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_size_0593.html" title="Wikipedia:Article size">Article size</a> problem. Sad to say, the WOW main article is just that big. I don't see it getting smaller. Thus sections like this which can be treated independently are created, with more detail added as the size issue is not so much of an immediate problem. Talking about differences between the WOW classes and those in other systems is certainly appropriate for a different article, specific to the class, but getting into the differences might be considered original research. In any case, I'd strongly oppose this article being treated that way. This article is supposed to be about WOW classes, and should stick very carefully to just that. But feel free to bring up the issue on the existing class pages. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:30, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I won't go into detail here, but all those things have been done by other CPRGs or PnP games, albeit under different names. More on that in a minute. Afd is first and foremost critiquing articles' <i>current</i> status, not their <i>potential</i>. This particular article needs a better focus on what is new or different from previous games and/or fantasy worlds rather than providing the current grab-bag of new and old concepts <i>without identifying which WoW changed or invented</i>. Doing this would strip much of the generic class handling content (thus removing the "game guide" argument) and would clearly indicate the real world significance of WoW's classes to fantasy gaming as a whole, whereas right now the information only demonstrates its importance to WoW itself (which doesn't count when it comes to overall significance). <i>This</i> revision isn't that, however, so I'm still arguing for deletion. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 00:25, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You've never played WoW, have you? Yes, it's true that Paladins heal people. That is what we in the inside-top-secret-know call a "basic description of what the paladin class does." GASP! The wiki does not tell you HOW to heal, merely that it exists. Game guides generally have the criteria of "telling you how to do things." Seeing as this wiki page has none of that... As for sourcing, that's not anything to delete the entire page over.

They would be better off looking at all the official documentation for the game rather than the general purpose encyclopedia.

"Just because it's about pop culture or entertainment doesn't make it any less notable." No, it actually makes it easier for it to be notable and as such, the bar for inclusion into the general purpose encyclopedia is set that much higher. Start a fansite, start a WoW wiki if there is not one already, write a book about WoW, just keep this obvious fanboy cruft out of the encyclopedia. L0b0t 17:42, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

We give no advice as to what you should do as a class (which would be what we like to call "a game guide") but instead give a general overview as to what all the classes are - something perfect for an information depository such as the Wiki.

<li><b>Delete</b> This article, along with the professions article, doesn't feel right at all. It's so deep within the Warcraft universe, I doubt it has any basis on the rest of Wikipedia. The best case scenario, I'm thinking, is to just hyperlink the nine classes, mentioned in the main article, to the generic concepts scattered about. So that's nine different articles, about warlocks in general and warriors in general, etc, but not specifically about these Warcraft classes. NB, I just got here, so I don't know the entirety of the situation/quality of other WoW pages.--<a href="../../../h/t/m/User%7EHtmlism_e997.html" title="User:Htmlism">Htmlism</a> 18:58, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>The general articles are just sections with summaries of different classes from different games with similar names and one short paragraph describing a rough concept that doesn’t even ably to all the class listed.. There's absolutely nothing in common with, say, a druid in DND and a druid in WoW except the name. Moving all class information into those articles would create 9 over sized articles and make navigation difficult. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeano1_3dfb.html" title="User:Seano1">Seano1</a> 21:58, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Linking to other fictional archetypes of the classes is a good idea. Deleting the article over the lack thereof is not.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Not a horrible article, but it fails to provide any context outside of game-guide content. Specifically, most of the subsections are just descriptions which is akin to having a dicdef article. I might be persuaded to keep if the text explained how the classes compare to their real-life counterparts (where they exist), or at least how they compared to other fictional depictions of those classes. Of course, there's the "original research" problem, but at least it wouldn't be a generic list of classes confined to WoW. Sure, WoW is tremendously popular, but how far does that popularity extend?

<dd><b>Comment:</b> I believe you are misrepresenting some of the facts. They are associated with at least <i>two</i> indie labels: <a href="http://www.nocturnalart.com/index2.php" class="external text" title="http://www.nocturnalart.com/index2.php" rel="nofollow">Nocturnal Art</a> (the one that is likely a borderline notable label, been around for at least 12 years) and <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earache_Records_2af4.html" title="Earache Records">Earache Records</a> (one that is definitely notable, and has been around for about 20 years). They have at least two albums out through NA, and at least one out through ER. They have other albums out in addition to those produced by the two labels above. As for the article being written by the band, that is a possibility. It is also a possibility that it's just a fan of the band. Unless we have proof positive otherwise, we must <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> on the part of that editor. It might be more productive for people to go and edit the article than to just AfD it without even trying to clean it up (more than it already is, as it was cleaned up due to a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Choronzon_%28Music_project%29_bc93.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Choronzon (Music project)">previous AfD</a> in January 2006, and one for an article that was eventually merged into this one in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_P._Emerson_Williams_72ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/P.

<li><b>Keep contingent on rewrite</b>-- I agree with points from both comments thus far made.

<li>Fine, removed. I was suspicious because you've only had two other edits ever, both of which were nearly a year ago.

<li><b>Comment</b> Nyah, sorry about not being clear, I was tired at the time of writing and probably didn't make it much clearer, or possibly worse. My apologies. I still stand with that I think it's notable enough to be kept. Also, what I meant with "average scale" is that there are things that, as far as my knowledge goes, are less noteworthy but are considered notable. Once again, my apologies if I wasn't making much sense. (P.S.

<li><b>Keep</b> - While the comic may not have a significant Alexa rating, I believe it has been an influence in several similar gaming comics, and is highly unlikely to cause a cluttering effect on anything in particular. It may be helpful to trim the article to a somewhat reduced state, such that it shows the history of the webcomic rather than a high level of fluff (such as detailed character listings), but deletion may be over the top.

<li><b>Comment</b> We can't just take your word that it has been an influence on other gaming comics.

<li><b>Comment</b> There's no policy that says similar cases have the same notability, and actually, similar cases do not have the same notability (as explained in the essay <a href="../../../i/n/c/Wikipedia%7EInclusion_is_not_an_indicator_of_notability_abaa.html" title="Wikipedia:Inclusion is not an indicator of notability">Wikipedia:Inclusion is not an indicator of notability</a>).

<li><b>Delete</b> (edit conflict). So far I have seen no rationale as to why this comic is notable. Two people have said it "seems notable" with no evidence to back them up, and one person has opted to keep because the previous two did. AfD is more than a vote. If it seems notable, I'd like to hear why. I see the author has published one book, but I can't find <i>any</i> information on it, leading me to believe it might be minor or self-published.

<li>Winning this award is not a notable achievement. If it were, reliabel sources would cover the award winners.

<li>I disagree with this viewpoint, since I believe that the WCCA awards are the most prominent awards within the field of webcomics. If you are able to provide a more prominent example, I would of course be willing to re-evaluate that position. Furthermore, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> states that the award may come from either "a publication or organisation", which demonstrates that the award need not have a connection with print media. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 13:01, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've already mentioned the much more prominent <a href="../../../e/i/s/Eisner_Awards_9d5a.html" title="Eisner Awards">Eisner Awards</a>; the <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignatz_Awards_0755.html" title="Ignatz Awards">Ignatz Awards</a> are also much more prominent.

What <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> requires is that the site or webcomic <b>win</b> a <b>well-known</b> and <b>independent</b> award.

Keenspace"). Also, this webcomic has never won this award. It's just an award some non-notable webcomic artists decided they were going to give to each other, and reliable sources have largely ignored it. The awards themselves are dripping with non-notability, and their 125 nominations a year (over 25 categories, 5 comics nominations in each category) are no sign of notability at all. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 17:04, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>The Eisner Awards are exclusively for print comics, and as such, would not apply here. The Lulu Blooker Prize is no more notable than the WCCA awards, and if you're concerned about conflicts of interest, you may want to consider that Lulu Press is pretty much the printer of choice for print-on-demand bound collections of webcomics. The Ignatz awards seem significant, so I would accept them as evidence of notability, in addition to the WCCA awards. I'm also having trouble understanding your rationale for rejecting the award based on the voting body.

<li>The Eisner Awards are not "exclusively for print comics." For example, "In 2003, Justine Shaw was the first webcomic artist to be nominated for an Eisner Award when she was nominated for 'talent deserving of wider recognition' and her <a href="../../../n/o/w/Nowhere_Girl_6b3f.html" title="Nowhere Girl">Nowhere Girl</a> was nominated for 'best new series.'" This was covered by reliable sources, including daily newspapers in Oklahoma, as referenced in the article. Other webcomics have been nominated and have won Eisner Awards since. Nominations for non-notable awards like "Japanese Beetle has been nominated for a WCCA," are not covered by reliable sources, which is probably why there are no references to sources in the Japanese Beetle article. Your comparison of the WCCAs to a major sporting event makes little sense to me, and I'm not sure what your list of "members" is, as it includes no one listed on their committee roster <a href="http://www.ccawards.com/committee.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ccawards.com/committee.php" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. And again, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> has a criteria for sites that have won well-known and independent awards. You seem to believe that these WCCAs are well-known and independent, but surely we can agree that this comic has never won one. If you're still trying to make the case that being nominated for a WCCA award is a notable achievement, then just please cite a reliable, third-party source saying so, as I did with Nowhere Girl's Eisner nomination. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 18:02, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why is it notable? I can declare an article on my pet cat and it declare it, useful, notable, verifiable, etc... but it doesn't make it so. As someone who is advocating to keep the article, you must show <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">proof</a> of its <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">Notability</a>. Finally, on "harm".... it dilutes the value of other articles on the encyclopedia. To quote Wikipedia's founder: "Notability is important because we exist here to serve our readers. We want to give them useful, relevant information, not just a complete data dump.... It serves to give readers a quick essential summary of what they want and need to know. In order to do this effectively, we must exercise careful and thoughtful editorial judgment, and one part of editorial judgment is an understanding that treating irrelevant data as on equal footing with the essentials, is confusing and a disservice to the reader.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 16:32, 16 October 2006 (UTC)" --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 06:27, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Look at it this way: Suppose you had heard of The Japanese Beetle, but didn't really know much about it beyond the fact that it's a webcomic. When you type its name into Wikipedia, what sort of results should you get? An article about the subject you're interested in, or no information? Is there any advantage at all to giving users no information about the subjects they want to learn about? <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 21:35, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> meant to be a collector of all human knowledge. There are many items that fall into this category of thing that usually do not meet notability requirements--fan-fiction, most web forums, the vast majority of self-published books, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">unrecognised web-comics</a>, the majority of <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doujin.html" title="Doujin">doujinshi</a> titles, amateur movies, internet memes, game guides, your neighbor's garage band, etc. These things are relevant to a limited number of people. Including an article on every piece of fiction ever written would be a detriment to the encyclopedia. Wikipedia determines what should kept by its very loose notability guidelines. i.e. Has this work been recognised and written about by someone other than the creator or people affiliated with the creator? If there are <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">multiple, non-trivial sources</a> of recognition then, yes, we should have an article on the topic. No one has presented any information in the article or in this AFD that the subject of the article merits keeping other than the <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">"I like it" or "It's useful"</a> defenses. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 16:04, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>WP:WEB isn't a policy per se, but it's nevertheless cited by many people as a keep/deletion rationale. The very outcome of many deletion debates may hinge on that. I'd say if you want to reject specific notability criteria, you have to then explain <i>what other criteria you use to explain to keep the stuff;</i> if you reject a long-standing guideline that's cited by a lot of people as it is, you have to find other footing to stand on. We're open to ideas, of course, it's just that WP:WEB happens to represent a bunch of rather well-tried ideas. So I'd like to ask is this: If you reject notability criteria, what else do you propose we do to stop us from being flooded with completely insignificant content? How do you help people from telling apart wheat and chaff? How do you help people find the <i>remarkable</i> content? If you yank the carpet from under our feet, you need to put another carpet in its place or people will keep slipping around on the bare floor.<br />
Also be aware that AfDs that manage to change the established procedures are few and far between - you probably need some excellent deletion-lawyering to wriggle out of this one... <i>meanwhile</i>, I propose you edit the article to say how it fulfills the <i>current</i> criteria for inclusion. You won't change people's opinions overnight - or within timespan of a single AfD debate. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 10:05, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Take a look at other highly notable webcomics; <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a> for example states in the first paragraph that it <i>ranks among the most popular webcomics, and is the best selling original English-language manga</i>. <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerkcity.html" title="Jerkcity">Jerkcity</a>, on the other hand, makes no assertions of notability. That's why I nominated it.

<li>Changing my&#160;!vote to <b>neutral</b> since the NOW claim is questionable (and is a very vague claim in the first place). She certainly can't be described as a leader in the LaRouche movement (see my comment below). Perhaps this could be deleted on the grounds that it can't be expanded beyond a stub? Incidentally, looking around for precedent didn't provide anything useful. We kept an article on <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erica_Hardwick_91fc.html" title="Erica Hardwick">this girl</a> (<a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Erica_Hoesch_f0ef.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Erica Hoesch">VfD discussion</a>), whose only claim to fame is having dated a much less notable political extremist than LaRouche. We seem to have kept the article on Al Gore's youngest son five times now (see <a href="../../../a/l/_/Talk%7EAl_Gore_III_4ddd.html" title="Talk:Al Gore III">Talk:Al Gore III</a>), but Gore is notable for reasons beyond his candidacy.

<li><b>Delete</b> In response to the above voters, there's no great mystery about what a budget game is: They're simply games released at a significantly lower price point than "major" games. A typical budget game costs $10-20 when first released, as opposed to $40-50 for a major game. Budget games do not count major games that are discounted after release, and are something of a genre unto themselves. Nor are budget games anything new: they've existed for computers since the early 80s.

<li><b>Delete</b> for being unhelpful and poorly defined. No clear definition has been given (are we talking actual budget re-releases such as the Platinum range, or just games that have slipped to a lower price-point?). Also: budget games where? America?

<dd>I'm not sure we should encourage stubs on each of these wars just to make them categorizable (yes, we can technically categorize redirects, but that's not well-known). Lists are good at compiling groups of data that would not individually rise to the level of encyclopedic worth; see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Bundestag_Members_5984.html" title="List of Bundestag Members">List of Bundestag Members</a> for an example. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 17:16, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I also asked for categorization, but just to be clear, I asked only for those battles considered worthy of having an article to be categorised. Anything else should only be mentioned in the relevant article. If people might search for this fictional war, then create a redirect under that name pointing to the relevant article, and categorise the redirect in the appropriate category or, better still, create an anchored link to the relevant section of the relevant article, and put this anchored link directly on the category page (in the bit at the top), effectively creating a list at the top of the category page for "fictional wars without an article is still covered by an article". This workaround is needed because redirects can't point at article sections. For example, the list currently has "Centauri-Narn war" in the Babylon 5 section, but no article. Now, have a look at <a href="../../../b/a/b/Category%7EBabylon_5_wars_86bc.html" title="Category:Babylon 5 wars">Category:Babylon 5 wars</a>, where I've added Centauri-Narn war in the way described above. I have also added the redirect to the category to show how that could work (but it currently doesn't because redirects can't point at sections within articles). Wars without articles or sections can still be listed in the category. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 18:02, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Any work of fiction might reference dozens of fictional wars, especially a work in the science fiction and fantasy fields. If the wars referenced are important enough to be cataloged in a list rather than merely mentioned in the article about the work they appear in, they should be important enough to have a stub. Whether a stub is worth having or not is a good measure of whether they're important enough to be here in any form greater than as a footnote of the work where such war is fictionalized. Using a category for this would function as a sort of self-regulating "importance" test in place of an unmanageable article, yet offer this particular article's authors another method of proving their contributions valid in this particular marketplace. Further, the category page itself can contain some of this list without creating individual stubs for them, and they could be linked to the parent work of fiction. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 18:18, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wars are a significant subject in fiction, and organizing their depiction in lists is a sensible way to organize that information. All of the problems above are issues for cleanup—using an appropriate limiting concept for "war" so it doesn't just include any story with a hyperbolic or catchy title,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cybil-War-Betsy-Byars/dp/0140343563" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Cybil-War-Betsy-Byars/dp/0140343563" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> and sourcing and annotating appropriately to verify that it was actually a depiction of a war. There's also no need to include wars that are merely <i>mentioned,</i> so the "shallow plot backdrop" can simply be trimmed out. Maybe I'm being overly optimistic in thinking this can all be worked out, but I think it's a worthwhile list of fictional depictions of a single subject to maintain. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 04:23, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This was put up for proposed deletion with the following reason: "Reads like CV, no assertion of notability, Google doesn't know this one too well." I disagree with all these reasons, but I think the article may be a good candidate for deletion based on how unimportant the subject seems to be in the grand scheme of things.

<dd>First of all, what's with calling the contest "Miss Potatoland"? That is rude and uncalled for. She might have been the runner-up but regardless, she did hold the title. Another in a similar position is <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashley_Litton_208d.html" title="Ashley Litton">Ashley Litton</a>. Conflict of interest? Well you haven't told us what that is. Slagle appears to have started the article, but had she been a more recent titleholder I would have started it myself (again, see <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashley_Litton_208d.html" title="Ashley Litton">Ashley Litton</a>). I didn't because I don't have time to right articles about titleholders from 1997 as what little time I have is spent on more recent ones. As for the ghits... this is extremely obvious. She reigned in 1997, when the internet pageant scene was in its infantcy. Had she been a few years later, I would have been able to gather information from <a href="http://www.tftj.com" class="external text" title="http://www.tftj.com" rel="nofollow">Turn for the Judges</a> but that site only starts from 1999. Similarly to my earlier point, if she was more recent there would undoubtedly be some news articles on her but we are going back 10 years and its unlikely there's anything on her still available on the internet now. As for the name thing -- check out any list of pageant titleholders and you'll see most include (often multiple) middle names. I generally get rid of them per the naming conventions. However some do go by their middle names as well and I assume I'm not expected to remember all of this. -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 05:45, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agree that "Miss Potatoland" wasn't called for. As to Litton-I'm not sure she's even really notable enough to stay, but at least with the one writeup as the winner she's at least much more borderline. Still very few ghits though. This one, however, is even less notable then she is. Unfortunately, the argument seems to be "She was a state titleholder", but I don't see anything in the bio qualifications that winning a state beauty pageant (especially not even really winning it) makes one notable without any further consideration. If this were Miss America, that would be quite different-even the finalists in that would be likely to achieve notability. But state competitions? Should we include the winners of state spelling bees? Little League championships? There are lots of state competitions, winning one doesn't by default make one notable. At a national or world scale that's likely different-a Miss America winner would be notable just by virtue of winning. Since there's generally little information beyond the short winner-bio on many of these, perhaps a list and short bio of winners would go better on the state pageant's page, and link to the winner's page if one does become notable? <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 06:01, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

FWIW, the United States Playing Card Company's <i>Official rules of card games</i> prefers the less derogatory "Black Lady".

<p>I know there's various games that can be played with WP, but "Seekipedia" does not appear notable enough for its own article. I could find barely anything but Wikipedia and its mirrors during a Google search. Perhaps this is known under a different name, but if someone wants to keep it on WP my suggestion would be to find a way to fit it on <a href="../../../f/u/n/WP%7EFUN_02a6.html" title="WP:FUN">WP:FUN</a>, or possibly create something like list of Wikipedia games (but ONLY if references exist).

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article is not "an article about a person, group of people, band, club, company or website that does not assert the importance or significance of the subject."</li>
</ul>
<p>The importance is, after one of the worst catastrophes in human history (Katrina), happened in New Orleans, the sheriff of a near by parish said in so many words that black folks weren't welcomed there. It was major news. I was surprised that the page didn't exist to begin with. This is a government official being openly racist towards poor black folks who had just experienced one of the worst disasters in history - not only the hurricane, but the criminal lack of action by the federal government to help the victims.</p>
<p>I don't understand what the problem is? Clearly this guy isn't some "nobody" that no one's ever heard of. There are entries on much more insignificant people here.

<li><b>Comment</b>- At <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_02d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity">Wikipedia: Vanity</a>: "conflict of interest is not in itself a reason to delete an article, but lack of notability is." So Badlydrawnjeff is technically correct that vanity is not in itself a reason to delete. I should have more exact in the word I used as primary reason to delete. It is non-notability...in the form of autobiographical vanity. In this case vanity is a valid reason to delete insofar as it is an autobiographical article about someone whose notability is not at current on an encyclopedic level. Article therefore does not and cannot meet basic standards. A clean up may make article itself more encyclopedic, but has no effect on lack of notability. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_hornet_0ed2.html" title="User:Green hornet">Green hornet</a> 18:30, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or at the least <b>merge</b> but do not delete- worldwide perception regarding OBL is varied and reveals a lot about the society that perceives him. He continues to be the symbolic leader of worldwide Sunni terrorism, and a great deal of terrorism is fueled by how certain societies view him as a hero, rather than by his direct action. On the other hand libertarians can argue that Western perceptions of him make him a larger than life force of evil that has resulted in a loss of personal liberty due to the militarisation of government. Whatever your own perceptions of him are, it can be shown the varied perceptions of him are an important topic of study. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_hornet_0ed2.html" title="User:Green hornet">Green hornet</a> 05:42, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Whining about how bad the sources are is silly when you're talking about a topic like this one, since it could easily be the topic of a serious and straightforward article with better sources. Poor sources is not a reason to AfD unless the sources are inherently poor due to the topic. This is quite obviously not the case here; this topic is written about in a variety of sources and has been for years. Anyway I don't think this is the best topic for an article, I'm for merging whatever might be here that isn't already on the OBL article, or for having an article on this but with a different title and focus. There is plenty to record about how OBL is perceived worldwide (in fact, a list of polls on the matter would be extremely helpful), but I'm not sure this is the way to do it.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 08:31, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I broadly agree with the reasoning behind the delete motions, however to my understanding a merge is the correct process to use (as the article has the potential to be informative, even if it isn't currently). However if during the merge process there is little new content to add (as seems to be the case here) then, for all intents and purposes, you are left with either redirecting or deleting.

<dd>While I do agree in the majority of cases (normally I don't comment like the above in an AFD!), I do believe that in light of no improvements since the last AFD, it is not likely to be salvageable.

<dd>Well, it's not likely to happen during the AfD. Five minutes of research would make this a better article, but I don't care to do it myself at this moment, and particularly not under the pressure of an AfD.

<li><b>Comment</b> Let's see. I looked at the article, read the sources and reviewed relevant Wikipedia policies, making reference to the criteria by which the article deserves retention. Then I did some additional Google News Archive searches verifying the information, and expanded the scope of the article with references. You came up with "vanispamcruftisement". I'd say knee-jerk is pretty accurate.

<li><b>Comment</b> Do you have a subscription to WSJ? Because without one, it's impossible to verify the "Wall Street Journal" link to provide (really a BradsDeals page which ostensibly reprints the article). And that's all this guy has so far; even then, I still don't buy the relevance of the other (local) sources. And just because an article is up for AfD doesn't mean it can't be speedied. In my opinion, it meets the G11 speedy standard (which is sometimes called <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">vanispamcruftisement</a>) and should go. A "strong keep" vote, on the other hand, has zero justifiction given the tenuous sourcing. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 19:17, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Tenuous, like <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">WP:VSCA</a>? While it means that you will actually have to do some work, the full text of the article is not available online to non-subscribers. That it exists, refers to the individual in question is undeniable, and there is no requirement of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> that requires a link that will pull up the article in its entirety (nor has anyone ever provided one of those concocted sources that says so). The link provided in the reference is an accurate copy of the full article as it appeared online and corresponds exactly to the article that appeared in the Eastern Edition of the <i><a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_Journal_599f.html" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a></i> on page B8 of the <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_4.html" title="January 4">January 4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> issue of the paper.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm glad you're referring to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, which does not define "non-trivial". <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> provides the definition of trivial coverage as <b>Media reprints of press releases, other publications where the company or corporation talks about itself, and advertising for the company. [or] Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report extended shopping hours or the publications of telephone numbers and addresses in business directories.</b> This standard is more than satisfied by teh sources provided. The article in the <i><a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_Journal_599f.html" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a></i> and the coverage on <a href="../../../w/l/s/WLS-TV_3d2c.html" title="WLS-TV">WLS-TV</a> (the ABC flagship affiliate in Chicago) far exceed the non-trivial standard required, as they cover the individual, his business and the industry at length and in detail. I'd suggest taking a look at a print copy of the Journal, which does NOT print "fluffy" articles. You can use that argument if there was only one article in one local publication, but the pattern of coverage in national publications demonstrates full compliance with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>, using non-trivial sources from major media that meet the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> standard required by <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> JMHO, you're <a href="../../../w/l/_/WP%7EWL_5eab.html" title="WP:WL">WikiLawyering</a>. The items cited including the WSJ articled are non-critical (and, yes, IMHO the WSJ has a POV to push, and can be as gullible as any other media outlet). Like the hot dog stand guy, this fellow obviously has media friends to get this much coverage on what amounts to yet another coupon/referral site that gets most of its business through paid search-engine advertising and doesn't handle any actual merchandise. I don't think skillful media manipulation should necessarily equal notability. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 22:14, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> JMHO, but your <a href="../../../w/l/_/WP%7EWL_5eab.html" title="WP:WL">WikiLawyering</a> charge is offensive and ignores the facts. All you can come up with is an appeal to <a href="../../../w/l/_/WP%7EWL_5eab.html" title="WP:WL">WikiLawyering</a>, which the article itself defines as "pejorative". My definition is that stooping to charges of <a href="../../../w/l/_/WP%7EWL_5eab.html" title="WP:WL">WikiLawyering</a> is what individuals do when Wikipedia policy does not fit their own arbitrary personal interpretation of what they have decided, based on their own personal research, to be the "right thing". While I have pointed to multiple major media references and explicit Wikipedia policy, all you can come up with is your entirely unsupported supposition that there has been "media manipulation", skillful or otherwise, of the "media friends" that he "obviously" has. As to your utterly pointless concern regarding the fact that it "doesn't handle any actual merchandise", isn't that sort of like the <a href="../../../e/b/a/EBay_4cc0.html" title="EBay">EBay</a> business model?

<li><b>Comment</b> You've taken a first step, refering to an actual Wikipedia policy as an excuse for deletion. Unfortunately the policy you refer to <b>Blatant advertising.

<li>While I do not wish to label this as "vanity" or "spam" or anything like that, I believe that the person is just not notable enough to be included in an encyclopedia. The person described is a very succesful businessman, apparently, <i>but nothing more</i>. Wikipedia cannot have articles on every successful businessman. The article is a short resume of his achievements, but does it contribute much to the general knowledge? Or think of it this way: can this article be significantly expanded by someone <i>not</i> connected personally with Brad Wilson or any of his enterprises? Can this ever become anything close to a featured article? I think not; if kept it will forever remain what it is, a directory entry. It's true that the Wall Street Journal is a reputable source, but simply being interviewed by the Wall Street Journal does not yet constitute notability. <a href="../../../e/k/j/User%7EEkjon_Lok_8b74.html" title="User:Ekjon Lok">Ekjon Lok</a> 17:08, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that the Wall Street Journal is a reputable source, and it is not the only unimpeachable, independent, non-trivial source, as listed above and in the article. I have alrady edited this article and will continue to do so, expanding the article using the multiple available sources. I'm unfamiliar with your "successful, but nothing more" or the "potential featured article" standards, and you aren't making reference to a specific Wikipedia standard that is not being met. It's very difficult to defend an article against original research and gut feelings
<ul>
<li>I do have understanging for all the "keep" votes, but my vote still stands for "delete". As I have said, the person in question is indeed a very successful businessman, and I do not doubt that he is much admired by all around him and generally regarded as a pillar of society, but there really must be something more than that to make it into Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gates_65fa.html" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a> is notable. <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Jobs_f8a1.html" title="Steve Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Wozniak_b111.html" title="Steve Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a> are notable. I am sure the person in question, Brad Wilson, has achieved much and made a very valuable contribution to society, but I just don't feel he is significant or exceptional enough to be included in a general knowledge encyclopedia. After all, we do not include every high school teacher, however much admired by his (her) students, or every church minister, however much loved by his (her) congregation. I urge everyone to stand back, for a moment, and look at this project (Wikipedia) as what is aspires to be: a general-knowledge encyclopedia, a free counterpart to Britannica, Encarta, Columbia etc. We must maintain at least <i>some</i> standard for inclusion of entries. Simply being a successful businessman, founding successful companies, getting millions in revenues, and being interviewed by the Wall Street Journal, is just not enough, in my view. <a href="../../../e/k/j/User%7EEkjon_Lok_8b74.html" title="User:Ekjon Lok">Ekjon Lok</a> 03:12, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. Deletion is not cleanup. This is a perfectly good and valid central point to chronicle the "non notable" bands published under the label.

<p>This is a strange article, explicitly labelled as the index/contents listing of a book published in 1990. I have no doubt that a list of significant people in Tudor England is both useful and appropriate for wikipedia, but I am unsure about the acceptability of an article which is simply the contents listing of a book which is still in copyright. Is it a <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">copyvio</a>? Are there other policies it falls foul of? I'm unsure, so I make this nomination without a recommendation either way (I may make a recommendation later on if some persuades me in one direction or the other). <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 12:05, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hmm, interesting one. Not many redlinks here - it actually functions as a pretty good index within wikipedia on a topic of quite wide interest. Perhaps it could be developed along those lines and the references to the book phased out? I don't think a list of names could be a copyvio.

<li><b>Comment</b> There is the concept of compilation copyright, which as I understand is both a bit fuzzy and rather weak, but that's what I had in mind when suggesting a possible copyvio. However, it sems to me that if the book index is used as one of the sources, rather than being drectly reproduced, we should be okay.<br />
However, more work is need to make it into a useful list, because it lacks annotations: it should say something like "Edward Smith, papist heretic from Glossop; Joe Smith, online mead merchant from Much Hadham" rather than just "Edward Smith; Joe Smith"). Quite a few of the liks point to dab pages, and it may be unclear which (if any) of the names on the dab pages is the right one. Coukd this perhaps be best considered as a very long stub? --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 18:55, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> This page has a lot of promise. In addition to identifying who the names are, I'd suggest adding dates (since the list is largely ordered by date).

<li><b>Keep</b> - Ah I've been away. Yes an index is not a copyvio by nature, that's why I did it. Indexes are protected as "minor extracts", which is why a library can cite all the chapter headings of a work in its catalog by the way. The extract doesn't go "to the heart" of the work, and doesn't copy an inordinate amount of detail. Also the distinction here, vs Stammer's comment just above is that this is an actual work published, whereas Stammer's examples aren't. Not that I'd be opposed to "Who's who in German concentration camps" but the majority of course would probably fail Notability. Anyway, I'd glad the community decided to keep. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 07:33, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>keep. <s>delete.</s> WP is not an index for other written work. Such list trivia, where it belongs, is surely better represented by a category.

It's fan speculation based on tenuous rumours and unconfirmed statements. If it transpired to be a massive hoax, then it would be article worthy. As it stands, leave your speculation for the various fan message boards. Wikipedia is not for reporting rumours and drawing conclusions.

Wikipedia is not a crystal ball, but that doesn't mean that diablo 3 has not had discussion or cultural relevance. Being a crystal ball would be to assert it exists, or that to speculate on content. Much like windows "longhorn" was never a released product, it was still a valid target for documented information. There's at least one solid reference on the page.

<li><b>Definitely Keep</b> - Up till Richard A. Knaak's interview, you could argue it's only rumors. Not now though. If you apply the same logic there should be NO <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_Vista_dc35.html" title="Windows Vista">Windows Vista</a> article. For all I care, it's only rumors - it has been announced, delayed, postponed, announced again. I haven't seen the box, have you? Of course, there will be inaccuracies at this point but the disclaimer at the top addresses that.Krasimir 21:25, 3 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Then please give me any sort of proof other then a sentence made by Knaak where he said "<i>I am not writing for a dead world... but a world with dead. 'nuff said!</i>" which means nothing really. Besides, bringing up Windows Vista is flawed seeing as it was announced in the form of a press release ages ago, even before the name Vista was given to it. There is a difference between unsubstantiated rumors and facts from the company making the announcement. Blizzard have said nothing in the form of fact yet. Thus the article is suffering the crystal ball syndrome. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 13:45, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am changing my vote to neutral per the new links, but not keep because while NYTimes comes up with 3 hits, which isnt much in 24 years of archives, BBC and CNN come up with none at all, making me wonder if the term is really notable or widely used enough to warrant an article. I will do some more research on other news sites I find to be reliable and change my vote accordingly. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 17:59, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Changing back to delete, I checked two local papers and 2 more WP:RS sites that contain archives and couldnt find this term anywhere other then on NYTimes, which makes me wonder if its based more on the person they interviewed or on the fact that they use the term, meaning did they ask for it be stated in that term. I appreciate Edison's efforts but its obviously lacking notability and possibly should just be transwiki'd to the dictionary wiki thingy. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 18:02, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Retain:</b> As the main author, I would naturally argue that this article should be retained. This type of website is important. As mentioned in the article, it is only medium which in the event of a grievance, puts ordinary people on a more level platform with big business, bearing in mind that litigation is often ruled out as an avenue for redress because of the costs involved. One contributor has suggested a conflict of interest but any such information and/or links can be deleted rather than deleting the entire article. I would just add for the record that I have no involvement in any business of any kind. Websites in which I am involved are all entirely non-commercial with no subcription charges, donations or paid advertising. User: Johnadonovan. 1 November 2006</li>
<li><b>Retain:</b> This is a great article about how complaints are voiced in the 21st Century. At the minimum this site could be moved to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gripe_site" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gripe_site" rel="nofollow">Gripe Site</a></li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Retain:</b> First, I should mention that one of the websites mentioned in the article, WillowBendMallSucks.com (more commonly known as TaubmanSucks.com), is mine. I'm bringing that up not only as a warning that I may not be impartial on this issue, but as evidence that I have some expertise in the matter at hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>To state my position up front: Rather than deleting the article, I feel that it should be revised and strengthened, and allowed to remain online.</p>
<p>A "sucks.com website" is a specialized kind of "complaint website" (you could think of sucks.com sites as being a "subset" of complaint sites). Their distinguishing characteristic is that they communicate their complaint as part of the domain name itself, typically in conjunction with the name of the organization (often a business) that is the subject of the complaint. This succinct and stunningly effective use of domain names allows a complaint to be communicated without even requiring the viewing of the website.</p>
<p>Because the portion of the domain name that precedes "sucks.com" is often a trademarked name, sucks.com sites have engendered a rash of lawsuits, in which businesses typically charge site owners with trademark infringement. For years, decisions (court and arbitration) were uneven (and perhaps even capricious), as no lower-court decision was binding on any other jurisdiction. However, my case was the first sucks.com case to reach the level of the US Court of Appeals, which definitively ruled that a non-commercial sucks.com site was purely an expression of free speech, and as such was not subject to trademark law. The decision by that Court has been adopted as precedent by other circuits, and is well on its way to becoming established law throughout the US.</p>
<p>The point I'm trying to make here is that sucks.com sites are the bleeding edge of the ongoing struggle for free speech on the Internet. I recognize that the crudity of their names makes many Internet purists uneasy, in that they would rather fight the Internet free-speech battle on a less-offensive front line. But I still feel that the concept is an important one, and eminently deserving of a Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>I should point out that the US Court of Appeals weighed in on the issue of the importance of sucks.com sites when they said, in their decision on my case:</p>
<p>"Taubman concedes that Mishkoff is 'free to shout "Taubman Sucks!" from the rooftops....' Essentially, this is what he has done in his domain name. The rooftops of our past have evolved into the Internet domain names of our present. We find that the domain name is a type of public expression, no different in scope than a billboard or a pulpit, and Mishkoff has a First Amendment right to express his opinion about Taubman, and as long as his speech is not commercially misleading, the Lanham Act cannot be summoned to prevent it."</p>
<p>I couldn't have said it better myself...&#160;:) -- HMishkoff</p>
<p>The above highly informative comments by Hank Mishkoff should in my humble opinion be included in the article in an appropriate manner. User: JohnaDonovan: 1 November 2006</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Nowhere in the opinion is the phrase "sucks.com" used. It's still an unencyclopedic neologism. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 07:09, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>That's not correct. In the opinion, the judge said, "In Internet parlance, a web name with a 'sucks.com' moniker attached to it is known as a 'complaint name,' and the process of registering and using such names is known as 'cybergriping.'" He also specifically indicated that by adding "sucks" to the domain name I differentiated my case from an otherwise similar case in which "the defendant used the plaintiff's trade name as a domain name, without the qualifying moniker 'sucks,' or any other such addendum to indicate that the plaintiff was not the proprietor of the website. In contrast, 'taubmansucks.com' removes any confusion as to source. We find no possibility of confusion and no Lanham Act violation." In other words, the opnion clearly states that the fact the my domain name included the phrase "sucks.com" significantly contributed to the fact that I won the case.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not familiar with the Wikipedia culture, and so I don't know if "neologism" is some kind of code word -- but I'm puzzled by your contention that the fact that sucks.com is a neologism (a "newly coined term") would disqualify it from inclusion in Wikipedia. "Internet" is a neologism. "World Wide Web" is a neologism. "Wikipedia" is a neologism. In fact, it seems to me that one of the strengths of Wikipedia (in contrast to convententional encyclopediae) is the ease with which it embraces neologisms. So while I agree that "sucks.com" is a neologism, I think that argues for its inclusion in Wikipedia, not its exclusion. HMishkoff 20:06, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>With the permission of Mr Mishkoff, I have used his comments above to expand the Sucks.com article. The article name could be changed to gripe.com or some other appropriate title rather than losing informative content material to the electronic age which has made Wikipedia possible. A number of multinationals and famous individuals (and their PR agents) will no doubt welcome the deletion of this page but this is probably not a criterion appropriate to take into account.

<li>From the "Good Timing" Department: This showed up in my inbox a couple of days ago as part of an Intellectual Property newsletter to which I subscribe. (The URL of the complete story is <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=270395" class="external free" title="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=270395" rel="nofollow">http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=270395</a>.) In the article, the author says, "Brands are frequently mocked in parody advertisements, and some Web sites vilify companies. (Go to Google and type in 'sucks.com.' You'll get about 250,000 hits.)" I tried it, I got 231K hits. The point I'm trying to make is that the sucks.com issue is hardly "non-notable," as it's been described in this discussion. In fact, if you'll go to the "News" page on my website (<a href="http://www.TaubmanSucks.com/news.html" class="external free" title="http://www.TaubmanSucks.com/news.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.TaubmanSucks.com/news.html</a>) you'll find links to something like 75 articles that have been written about my case alone. Some of the articles are "newsy," but many of them are serious pieces written by attorneys to discuss my case and the sucks.com phenomenon. So YOU may not think that the sucks.com issue is notable, but intellectual property lawyers seem to disagree. HMishkoff 22:09, 4 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Where did I say that it's non-notable? I said that ti's an unsourced, spammy neologism. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 22:24, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As correctly pointed out, the article has been described in this discussion as "non-notable", not by you, but by another contributor. It seems logical to conclude that you at least concede that the article is notable which is surely an important factor. Sources have been added as a result of the comments fairly made and more can be done if deemed worthwhile. The article has been improved as a result of the various issues raised. The point about neologism has already been covered by HMishkoff. User: JohnaDonovan: 5 November 2006.
<ul>
<li>He ignored that the reason why neologisms are not welcome on Wikipedia is that Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">does not allow original research</a>. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 17:10, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I've lost you. What do the issues of "neologisms" and "original research" have to do with each other? Sounds like apples and oranges to me. Every article that has anything to do with the Internet (and especially with the Web) will address a neologism, by definition, and it may or may not include original research. The point is that "sucks.com" was not a phrase that was coined for this article, it's a notable phrase (judging by the amount of press and other attention it's received) that's been around for a few years. How long do we have to wait until it's old enough to be included in Wikipedia? HMishkoff 19:33, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I believe the technical term or legal term for a sucks site is "gripe site", maybe just move this whole article there? <a href="../../../r/o/u/User%7ERouter_8564.html" title="User:Router">Router</a> 04:27, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I didnt try to be convoncing using appearance alteration. Just happend to be the same time i was checking the account preferences. Anyway I guess its better to leave the judgement for those who moderate the site. I mentioned my point. at the end of the day there wont be a third case, either kept or deleted.

<li><b>Comment.</b> According to <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, "trival" coverage refers to the like of simply reprinting directory listings, "announcement of club meetings" or "store hours." The articles on this organization are long and involved and credit a reporter... not just "store hours". Time Out New York has a huge readership in New York City, and Next Magazine has a wide circulation in New York City's gay community. Being from the gay press doesn't make something trivial. Per <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>, these are not "internal documents".</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> It is the largest club of its kind in the United States. Plus, minority-based organizations are inherently smaller, but no less significant.

<li>Quick <b>comment</b> - if this route is so important, perhaps you could bother to ensure that articles assert this in future. There are SEVEN lengthy paragraphs that describe the route the bus takes. These paragraphs are not assuredly encyclopaedic information. There is then a paragraph on the frequency of the bus route - this is travel information, and is best served with a link to the bus companies website, which already provides this information, and is guaranteed to be up to date. It is neither Wikipedia's responsibility nor its remit to provide that. I have had a go at revising the article so it makes sense. I have also <b>withdrawn the nomination</b> - ok, it's notable, but the article needs reworking. I confidently expect my changes to be revetrted ASAP. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 09:56, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'm think essentially the utility of the route along with its history and recent and future changes as well as key destinations along its way will be enough along with an infobox just like it was done with route 99 before it was canned.--<a href="../../../j/f/o/User%7EJForget_e21d.html" title="User:JForget">JForget</a> 03:17, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> I don't know if there is still a chance that this will be deleted after the folk who proposed the deletion had withdrawn the proposal, but I do think that the network of roads and transit routes are an important background to many articles about the national capital area, just as the names of buildings are perhaps more important in some circles in ottawa than the actual addresses.

The reason I have marked all these articles to discuss for deletion is twofold. The first one is the <b>question of copyright</b>. Every article I have tagged has a <a href="http://www.samurai-archives.com/dictionary/A1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.samurai-archives.com/dictionary/A1.html" rel="nofollow">single source</a> (<a href="http://www.samurai-archives.com/dictionary/A1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.samurai-archives.com/dictionary/A1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.samurai-archives.com/dictionary/A1.html</a> or later pages in that same source - for now I have only tagged the A's). In most cases it is also an uncited source. Regardless, the text of each of these articles is merely an exact duplicate with a few words changed around. In nearly every case, the content (meaning) and order of the content (meaning) is the same, even if some words have been changed. Whether this is blatant copyright infringement or not may be questionable, but that is not the only issue.</p>
<p><b>Quality of scholarship</b> The second issue is quality and scholarship. All of these articles only have that one source - the <a href="http://www.samurai-archives.com" class="external text" title="http://www.samurai-archives.com" rel="nofollow">Samurai Archives</a> website. In many cases, if not most, sources are not cited on that website. Therefore, we can not verify the validity of the entries on that website. One of the requirements of Wikipedia is that articles include information that is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>. Information taken from the Samurai Archives is not verifiable. The simple fact of the matter is, aside from it not being verifiable, if there are any errors in information on that website, we are now propogating them all over the internet. This is because all of the articles I tagged are created only from information on the Samurai Archives website. That is just plain poor scholarship, and has been noted on other discussions regarding this, adding articles such as the ones I have tagged cheapens wikipedia and it cheapens the work that we do in adding information to it. Another issue is that many, or possibly most, of the articles I tagged, have not been added to for months, which tells me that there is little information out there that can be used to supplement them. So the issue of both verifiability and scholarship leads me to feel that these articles need to be eliminated. The articles I have tagged are of low quality, and of almost no academic value, and I back that statement up with what I have written above.</p>
<p>There are over 100 articles almost identical in situation to the few that I have tagged here - and you will also notice that it is the same contributor on every article Darrin Fidika - he apparently been made aware of the situation many times over, but continues to blithely post articles of identical poor quality as those I have marked below. That worries me. He has been talked to many times according to his talk page, but he never stopped this activity.</p>
<p>Sorry it took me so long to figure out how to go about all this, I have always been happy to just anonymously add information to wikipedia from work during slow times, but this issue, first brought forward a few days ago, really caught my attention as a major quality control issue that all of us who contribute to wikipedia need to pay attention to. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Monkeyheadster (<a href="../../../m/o/n/User_talk%7EMonkeyheadster_3583.html" title="User talk:Monkeyheadster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Monkeyheadster_62d0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Monkeyheadster">contribs</a>) .</small> 20:07, October 30, 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> After looking through several of the articles listed above, I can see that one of the main sources was definitely Samurai Archives. However, <b>all</b> of the articles I looked at had <b>more</b> information than found in the Samurai Archives, leading me to believe there was at least one other source for the information. As all of these articles are quite short, it's understandable the information would be presented in similar ways—there are only so many ways to write 2-3 sentences. I do think the articles need to be sourced, however, so it can be more easily determined what information came from where. ···<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe"><font color="darkblue">日本穣</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese">?</a> · <small><a href="../../../n/i/h/User_talk%7ENihonjoe_488b.html" title="User talk:Nihonjoe"><font color="blue">Talk</font></a> <font color="darkblue">to</font> <a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">Nihon</a><a href="../../../j/a/_/WP%7EJA_dc61.html" title="WP:JA">jo</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><b><font color="darkgreen">e</font></b></a></small></sup> 21:10, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Frankly, I disagree - what you are seeing is "fluff" added by the contributor - throwing in that such and such was a lord of such and such province because the province is mentioned later in the text. It is one contributor, one known for this sort of thing, and frankly, I do not believe it can be argued that the only source is not the samurai archives, because it plainly is the only source - most of these articles only exist in the english language at the Samurai archives site, and I am most definately sure that Darrin is not translating his own information. Here is a good example:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>Marume Nagayoshi Here is a good example of a typical "entry": <b>Samurai archives</b> - Nagayoshi was a retainer of the Sagara family of Higo Province. He is said to have met the wandering swordsman Kamiizumi Nobutsuna and studied under him, later forming his own school of swordsmanship on Kyushu. <b>Wikipedia</b>: Maruma Nagayoshi (1540-1629) was a retainer of the Japanese clan of Sagara of Hizen province during the Sengoku Period of the 16th century, extending to the 17th century of the Edo Period. It is said that Nagayoshi ran into the famous swordsman known as Kamiizumi Nobutsuna and began training under him. Nagayoshi later established his own school of swordsmanship at Kyūshū.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>They are obviously the same. You can see how he adds fluff by stating that it took place during the sengoku period - that most definately does not indicate an "alternate source" - he even goes so far as to add incorrect information to hide his plagiarism - he changes Higo province to Hizen province.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I challenge anyone here to come up with another source, preferably a book rather than the internet, due to the sad fact that Samurai Archives information has been propogating due to wikipedia all over the internet. If there is a belief that multiple sources have been used, I challenge someone to provide one.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, that is only a small part of the issue - the issue of poor scholarship is much larger. My argument above about poor scholarship stands. The unfortunate fact here is that we have let this go for 10 months now, and it has created a monster. People seem intimidated by having to remove over 100 articles, but any one of these articles on its own would be a solid candidate for deletion. We shouldn't let the volume of articles get in the way of objectivity in this matter. --Monkeyheadster 21:18, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep for now and tackle the problem differently</b>: there does seem to be a potential plagiarism issue here, but I do not think that AfD is the right way to tackle it. Five days is simply not sufficient time for people to check so many articles and confirm that your claim that they are <i>all</i> problematic. The AfD process was not designed to handle large-scale cases like this, and we run the risk of throwing babies out with bathwater.<br />
It would IMO be more appropriate to open a centralized discussion of the matter, possibly as a subproject of Wikiproject Japan, to give the full set of articles a proper consideration, establish which can be cleaned up and which cannot, and resubmit the unsalvageable articles for deletion with more than one editor's word for the claim that they need deleting.<br />
For example, it appears that in many cases there are articles on these people on the Japanese Wikipedia, which certainly will <i>not</i> be based on the Samurai Archives website, and which could thus almost certainly be used to salvage the English articles. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 21:45, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It took me a mere 2 hours to confirm it. Not only is 5 days plenty of time, but this is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. There are nearly 100 more articles that are the same as the ones I have already tagged. It is time that we take care of the issue that Darin Fidika has been allowed to create. This has been discussed to little avail on LordAmeth's talk page and on the Japanese Military History task force talk page. Someone should have caught this months and months ago, and furthermore, the lone contributor must be brought to task for his actions.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>All of the articles listed are identical in format, and from the same contributor. None of them use more than once source. This is specifically why I chose these to tag. Because they are all essentially the same. I believe they should be removed until such time as interested and responsible wikipedians can go through and create new entries with multiple sources.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As it can't be disputed that the tagged articles are rewrites of articles from the samurai archives and no other sources were used, I do not believe this can be considered fair use of the material. These articles duplicate the information from the samurai archives while not adding anything new to them - they are mere copies with different wording. This has gotten way, way out of hand, and I think removing the articles until such time responsible and interested parties come along to do actual orginal work is best. --Monkeyheadster 21:50, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The precident is set</b> - You will notice that the article called Hinarasu has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Hinarasu" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Hinarasu" rel="nofollow">deleted</a>. The author (a contributor to the samurai archives website) tagged it for copyright violation, made his case on the talk page, and it has been removed. His article is representative of <b>every</b> article I have tagged here, and this precident should show that I am correct in my request for deletion of these articles. Yet again this was an article added by "Darin Fidika". --Monkeyheadster 22:06, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>In Summary</b> - I will summarize my points here, with detalied information standing above as the detailed talk.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>It can't really be argued - Darin got nearly every piece of information in the above articles from the Samurai Archives site, from the page I have listed. (See above quote from Marume Nagayoshi as an example).</li>
<li>I do not belive this is "fair use" of the samurai archives information. "Fair Use" of information includes using multiple sources to pull together an orginal article - using any one source as a mere reference - "one among many". These articles are not original. They are copies of the Samurai archives, with some changed words, and a little "fluff" (see above) to make them look different. Hoever, the content (ideas) is nearly identical, as is the presentation of the order. These are not original articles by any reasonable stretch of the imagination. Furthermore, after checking the Samurai Archives forum, it has been made clear that all further research activity will stop on the page because of the wholesale gutting of the page by Darin Fidika. Understandable, I wouldnt want my hard work to be simply copied, pasted, and then a few words changed around and have it called an original work.</li>
<li>The Hinarasu article. (see above) That article on wikipedia, placed here by Darin and taken from the Samurai Archives, was identical in form to all of the articles that I have noted here, and that one has been deleted. That sets the precident that these articles are justified in being removed. In fact, the author of the original article who requested it be removed pointed out that Darin also incorporated errors into his wikipedia article in his attempt to "hide" his plagiarism. He did the same with his copy of the Marume Nagayoshi article I mentioned above. Notice how he changed the province name to Hizen province. This guy will go so far as add wrong information to hide his plagiarism. That also needs to be addressed. I believe this could even be considered <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism</a> and could potentially invalidate all of his "contributions".</li>
<li>Scholarship issues. Since these articles all do come from the samurai archives (with minor fluff and a few changed words), and they have not been edited hardly at all since they have been posted to wikipedia, that tells me that either there are no other sources to pull together, or at this time there is no one interested in doing so. Therefore, I believe that it is in the best interest of wikipedia to delete them until such time as more responsible and interested users can pull together multiple sources to create new, original articles. No one has added information in 10 months, so it is highly unlikely that enough, or even any, information will be added to change the state of these articles.</li>
<li>Error propogation. Any errors made by the samurai archives site has now been moved to wikipedia, because no other sources have been used. There are references to "Uzu" castle, an accidental mistake on the samurai archives (recently brought to attention on that forum), and now "Uzu" castle has made it's way to wikipedia - and from there, all over the internet. It is actually "Uozu" castle, but wikipedia has secured it's place in hisotory now as "Uzu". Not to mention Darin Fidika adding false information into the articles he copies to help hid his plagiarism.</li>
<li>Verification. One of the requirements of wikipedia is that included information be verifiable. The samurai archives for the most part does not cite sources. Since Darin has been using the SA exclusively, he is essentially using an unverifiable source. This is not good, and throws into question the quality of wikipedia itself if such articles are allowed to stay. Even where sources are listed, since Darin is only using one source (the samurai archives), the info he is pasting and changing words on has not been verified by him. His "addition" of Hinarasu further goes to show that he is not above adding errors into his articles to hide his plagiarism.</li>
<li>Darin Fidika. Darin has a history of problems as evidenced by his talk page. It is very clear that he is incapable of utilizing sources correctly, and has a documented history of plagiarism. He is unfortunately incapable of creating an original article using multiple sources. Is he a "bad" person? No, I don't think so. Is he misdirected? Probably. What can't be disputed is that his information comes strictly from the samurai archives - he has stated as much on his talk page, saying "I did not realize that meager articles needed citations", and has also said he has taken from the samurai archives. Comparing his articles to the link to the samurai archives I provided shows that he just copied it, and changed words around. Like I mentioned, he has a history of questionable behavior, and has admitted to taking info from the samurai archives. As far as contributors go, he appears incapable of scholarship, and that alone throws any of his articles into a questionable light.</li>
<li>Wikipedia quality. Keeping these articles would be a severe disservice to wikipedia, and also sets the precident that it is OK to steal, as long as you try to hide it by changing some words around. <b>Maybe</b> what I have tagged is not true <i>outright</i> copyright violation (most are certainly plagiarism), however my other points alone are more than enough to justify removing these articles. It is the right and moral thing to do.</li>
<li>Precident. We need to set the precident that scholarship and research is expected, and that plagiarism and unverified information is not. It states clearly that "Content that violates any copyright will be deleted. Encyclopedic content must be verifiable. You agree to license your contributions under the GFDL." on the edit page. We need to stand by this. We have allowed this to go on for 10 months, and now we have to deal with a monster - over 100 uncited, unverifiable, plagiarized, low quality articles. It would be a simple matter if this had been tackled long ago, but we are dealing with it now, and qualms about the number of required deletions should not cloud objective judgement.</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe that each and every one of my points have merit, and and every one alone justifies removing the pages. Please don't try to debate a single point while ignoring the rest. I believe, however, that removing the articles is the right thing to do, again, until such time that responsible and interested parties can come up with orginial article from multiple verifiable sources. I believe we should be working together here to make wikipedia a good place for information. I hope my belief that we can and should make wikipedia a better place for information is justified. Because, by leaving these articles copied by Darin up, we are hurting the quality, and the reputation of wikipedia - both as a source, and as a place where plagiarism and bad scholarship is not tolerated. --Monkeyheadster 22:30, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> - This is absolutely ridiculous. Such blatant plagarism should be stamped out. This is copyrighted work.

<dd>I'm not sure why you "worked 3 or 4 days to bring this to someone's attention," when a simple post on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Japan_9136.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Japan">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Japan</a> page would have gotten someone's attention. Almost all of the articles you mentioned are listed as part of the project on their talk pages (and have been for months). Additionally, I think you're hurting this AfD by posting a novelette in explanation when a few concise statements would have sufficed. Most people who participate in AfD don't want to have to spend 15 minutes reading the AfD, and I don't know any who want to spend 2-3 hours perusing and comparing <i>all</i> the articles that are part of just this one AfD when they have many others to go through daily (have you ever spent time going through the AfD pages?

So do most of the people who take time to go through AfDs, and I can tell you that many people will just skip over an AfD that's so huge right at the beginning. Maybe you have all the time in the world to spend here, but the rest of us have jobs, families, and lives outside of Wikipedia, and don't spend all our waking moments here. Therefore, my point was that it is a good idea to try to keep your reasons for posting an AfD concise so that it receives more attention from more AfD patrollers. It was just a friendly suggestion to keep in mind, so please don't take it negatively. I've adjusted my comments above to be more clear on what I meant. ···<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe"><font color="darkblue">日本穣</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese">?</a> · <small><a href="../../../n/i/h/User_talk%7ENihonjoe_488b.html" title="User talk:Nihonjoe"><font color="blue">Talk</font></a> <font color="darkblue">to</font> <a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">Nihon</a><a href="../../../j/a/_/WP%7EJA_dc61.html" title="WP:JA">jo</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><b><font color="darkgreen">e</font></b></a></small></sup> 01:01, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

For all intents and purposes, even if he changed the words, the articles are identical.

<li><b>I agree - delete</b> Funny, the night I decide to create an actual login after contributing tidbits here and there, I am shown that I have been a moron. Rather than researching facts, I should have been taking a source, change some words around, and create a new article with it. Yeah, that's the ticket! These articles should be deleted. The arguments for deletion by all involved are pretty much ironclad. I think that if the user had done the exact same thing, but had put it within a larger article, that probably would have been acceptable. However, this user didnt do that. He started countless articles from one source, which is plagiarism in my book. I've only looked at a few, but the ones that I have looked at have not been touched in months, except for the occasional additon of Japanese in the entry. I think this user really wanted to increase his standing by creating all sorts of articles. I think it must have been calculated, because it appears that he has also been adding in fake or false information in his wikipedia entries to cover his tracks. That is simply dishonest. I hope this issue is taken care of, I've had fun contributing, but this sours me a bit on wikipedia. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBranePan23_2b4e.html" title="User:BranePan23">BranePan23</a> 04:26, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete (and possibly relist in JapMilHist)</b>. This is not prejudice for recreating the articles in the future, but this is honestly poor research and plagiarism in the highest degree, because of the amount that was taken from one source. If it pulled together the original sources to create these articles, that would be a different story. (Having a single source is also problematic for notability issues.) I'd rather wipe these and restart afresh, this time taking proper care. This might mean a smaller amount of material in a longer amount of time, but it also means safety for Wikipedia. However, this does bring up a different point - since Wikipedia is so large, is it possible that many different articles by different editors will pull enough material for there to be a copyright violation based on amount of material pulled? <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 16:10, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Mangojuice. Check the user who added the Hosokawa bios to wikipedia. Yep. Same user who stole the rest of the above. Look at the Samurai Archives site (biographical dictionary). You will see them on the site. Members of the Samurai Archives have been copying and pasting that work into the SamuraiWiki, which is OWNED by Samurai Archives. Therefore, you just claimed that Darin Fidika had original work concerning these biographical entries that have been on the Samurai Archives site, copyrighted 2005. I see a major problem there....Do you know why wikipedia articles are older? Because Darin copied and pasted them from the Samurai Archives site months and months ago, while the SamuraiWiki is a new venture, where the old S-A information is being transferred over. I would know...I've been a part of the transfer. So that would be great if you could remove that information you just added. In case you don't believe me, check the Samurai Archives detailed update log. Here is a copy of pertinent information: " 01-15-2000 -Added descriptions for Hattori Hanzo, Hosokawa Fujitaka, and Goto Mototsugu".

<p>These biographies, which have been online at the samurai archives for at least 6 years, were the ones that have been recently moved to the samurai wiki. Since <b>I</b> own the copyright, I have full right to move them. I research Japanese resources, I would <i>never</i> even consider taking any of the worthless information from wikipedia, as most of the info on wikipedia is here by my or my associate, by proxy. These are the original articles that you 'claim' were taken from wikipedia, when the reality is, they have been on my website for 6 years, researched by me and my associate:</p>

<li>Yes, I have been corrected in my mistake by Nagayeri. My response to him was, basically, oops. I acknowledge that the material in question is clearly not stolen from Wikipedia, more like the other way around. I was simply going on the assumption that the history link on one of those particular files on the Samurai wiki was the true revision history of the file there, but that was false, so I apologize. As I said to Nagayeri, I am happy to assist in deleting ALL of these copyright violations once the AfD comes to a close. In this case, I had some evidence that I was mistaken about, and I apologize for that, but it was an honest mistake. (I would have amended my comments on the Samurai wiki too, but I've been blocked there, so I guess I can't.) Truly, this is not so much a failing of Wikipedia as it is an example of the nasty consequences of copyright violations in the first place. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 18:29, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

I am willing to eventually go in to wikipedia and contribute- and if you look at my contributions, I in fact have made a few contributions in the past, but I absolutely have to protest when our work is stolen wholesale and not even attributed. I am perfectly fine with having my work used as a resource among many, in fact I would be honored that my website could be one contributor among many (a term used here before, I see), but I protest my work being stolen.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm all for the delete, but I think it's important to note that notability is context related. In my <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_DC_0dbd.html" title="Washington DC">hometown</a>, a shooting like this would probably not make the evening news. If, on the other hand, it happened in <a href="../../../v/a/t/Vatican_City_edb3.html" title="Vatican City">Vatican City</a>, CNN would have live coverage for days.

<li><b>Comment</b>, Wikipedia is not the newspaper. If this incident leads to new legislation, or someone notable is involved maybe. As it is, I can't see a reason to have this in the encyclopedia. L0b0t 02:24, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Although this got national play it isn't considered as serious as, say, the Dawson College murders in Montreal. We can't have articles on every incident of this nature; they have to have some national or international notability. So far, this incident doesn't. The best I could suggest is referencing it in the main article on Edmonton in a crime subsection. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 03:39, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If I am not mistaken, Wikinews is under <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_95b5.html" title="Creative Commons">Creative Commons</a> rather than the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>, thus disallowing Wikinews to replicate Wikipedia content. If an article on Wikinews were to be started on this subject, then it would have to be started from scratch, i.e. rewritten so as not to violate the GFDL. metaspheres 00:43, 4 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I wasn't aware of that at all; excuse my ignorance. Reading over the WikiNews licence, it appears the issue is that WikiNews uses the <b>by</b> licence (attribution only), whereas GFDL is most similar to <b>by-sa</b> (see: <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_licenses_d4d4.html" title="Creative Commons licenses">Creative Commons licenses</a> for info). <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindmatrix_3c6f.html" title="User:Mindmatrix"><font color="#8B4513">Mind</font></a><a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindmatrix_738b.html" title="User talk:Mindmatrix"><font color="#EE8811">matrix</font></a> 18:48, 4 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure what you mean. The following page on meta pretty much clarifies everything: <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikinews/License" class="extiw" title="m:Wikinews/License">m:Wikinews/License</a>. According ly CC-By content has one-way compatibility with GFDL, i.e. Wikinews content can be incorporated into Wikipedia, but not vice versa, and CC-SA is totally incompatible with GFDL, which is probably why they decided to go with the other one. I have no idea how solidly these licenses are followed, so I can't say whether or not there would be any objection on Wikinews if Wikipedia content would be posted there and if anyone would care about that, but technically it would be "against the rules," so to speak. For instance, there was a great deal of objection to <a href="../../../g/e/t/GetWiki_cbd5.html" title="GetWiki">GetWiki</a> (a fork of <a href="../../../m/e/d/MediaWiki_8838.html" title="MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a>) being released under CC rather than GFDL, but no further action was taken.

<p>I'm going to nominate this group of articles since I think we'd first need consensus before going ahead and creating such articles. Personally I feel that most info here that can be salvaged should go into the history section of the club, or a seperate history article if one exists. Only when the history article gets extremely long should we contemplate splitting of articles like this. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacoplane_198a.html" title="User:Jacoplane"><font color="#AE1C28">jaco</font></a>♫<a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacoplane_6d73.html" title="User talk:Jacoplane"><font color="#21468B">plane</font></a> 15:43, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Articles <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brad_Wilson_4afa.html" title="Brad Wilson">Brad Wilson</a> and BradsDeals have just been nominated for deletion. The largest part of this school article was about Brad Wilson. Following the deletions, the article has been edited to remove him. However, I have serious doubts that this school actually exists for these reasons: (1) The article itself has practically no information, not what one would expect from such a high octane institution. (2) The school's own website has clearly not been updated for many months (i.e. since before it was supposed to have opened last July). (3) The school's calendar on the website is empty. (4) The press article cited actually links to the school's website where it is presented as a PDF file, and (5) the articel itself only mentions TWO potential students. (6) And that article itself is from March 2006. Perhaps there is someone who has some local knowledge who could help with this. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 16:16, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> That Kipp is a "major national manager of nearly fifty charter schools" is an argument for having an article about Kipp not an article about this specific school.

<li>Some interesting discussion points, but to go back to my original nomination - I simply want someone to verify that the school actually EXISTS. Its website suggests not, based on currency. Nowhere else that I have looked says that it is open (the KIPP directory merely says new in 2006, not that it opened). The quality of the KIPP programme is irrelevant (as a teacher, I personally have my doubts). I suspect this school was planned but never opened. SO again I ask, in hope, is there anyone in the area who can verify this one way or the other; if not <b>Delete</b> as non-existent. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 22:42, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I added links from Ball State University and the Indiana Department of Education that appear to confirm that the school exists. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 02:36, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Proving that the school exists or not would require original research, probably (and most reliably) a phone call to the Office of Charter Schools of Ball State University at 765-285-1336 or to the Indiana Department of Education. I can argue that, based on the evidence in the article, and based on the fact that I haven't seen any evidence that the school closed down or failed to open, it is more likely than not that the school exists. The school's web site being out-of-date is most likely just another case of "brochureware", where the site is created by a designer, uploaded to a hosting provider, and then neglected, in part because the organization that commissioned the site doesn't have access to the editing software or doesn't know how to use it. But <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a>'s suspicions could be correct. I would encourage someone to make a phone call or a visit to answer the question, and then the evidence can be reinterpreted in the light of the results of the phone call or visit. I think there are enough people who dislike charter schools and Ball State University's involvement with them that a crash-and-burn of any of Gary, Indiana's charter schools would be widely reported. That having been said, I think that a charter school that closes down because of mismanagement, fraud or politics ought to be written about so as to provide a better understanding of what can go wrong with charter schools in general. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 03:41, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>You would not, in fact, have found your answer, for the simple reason that the previous incarnation of this article, forking (prank), gave different information about this prank, that directly contradicts what this article says. Both articles cannot be true, and, in the absence of sources that you can use to check the article, as a reader you have no way of knowing which incarnation is true, or even that either is true at all. (If you find the article from the <i>Chilkat Valley News</i>, by the way, you'll find a <i>third</i> set of claims about this prank, which contradicts <i>both</i> of these articles. It is reporting one person who claims to have discovered the information from "the Internet", incidentally, so it hasn't been fact checked.) <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 22:09, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm a big fan of the Elder Scrolls series of games, but this is such a minor aspect of what is a very expansive game that I don't see any reason for a stand alone article here and I'm not sure it is even important enough to suggest a merge to the main Oblivion article.

<li><b>Delete</b> The play isn't really significant to the game. The connection to the character from the previous game is interesting as a trivia item, but hardly warrants its own article -- maybe a brief mention in the main article, maybe not even that.

<dd>Absolutely, we relist. Absent an overwhelming consensus (roughly 75% or more), success at DRV only means that the item is undeleted and relisted. DRV is mostly a forum for <a href="../../../c/l/o/Cloture.html" title="Cloture">cloture</a>, and rarely is DRV the final stage of a debate. Clearly, this matter was disputed; although relisters obtained a majority, they fell far short of an overwhelming consensus to undelete outright.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Benson was notable and newsworthy before she ran for the Senate as an artist and writer.

<li><b>Keep</b> Though I would argue that her chief notability is in her artistic/cultural contributions and that her current political ambitions are of secondary and limited notability; and that of course significant news coverage and "newsworthiness" is not automatically a conferrer of encyclopedic notability. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 01:34, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>'<i>Keep</i> I question the wisdom of deleting major party candidates, especially for high office. Without an article, it will always appear that the incumbant is challenged by a "nobody"; which is a disservice to voters and political scholars. In past elections, losing opponents can be embedded in the winner's article, but current campaigns deserve separate pages. Of course, a separate page should be maintained post-election if there is notable professional accomplishment outside of and in addition to politics.</li>
<li>Although there seems to be quite a few people interested in keeping this article, <i>nobody</i> has yet to show that she satisfies <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>: In particular, we <i>still</i> have no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> indicating any of the following:

<li>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.</li>
<li>The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field.</li>
<li>Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work.</li>
</ul>
None of the existing links satisfy this: They are either not independent of Benson herself, or else mention her only obliquely. The exception is <a href="http://www.turtletrack.org/Issues01/Co02242001/CO_02242001_Play.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.turtletrack.org/Issues01/Co02242001/CO_02242001_Play.htm" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> which does not, to me, appear to be a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, and in any case we are missing the "multiple" part of the requirements above.

<dd>I just don't see why "greenlighting southpark" makes one notable in and of itself. Does the bean-counter who gave South Park the ok 'deserve' a bio page? The key grip? Everyone who appears in the credits of every episode? Every executive at the company? Sure, greenlighting South Park is a counter towards notability, but I don't see it as a full payment. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesup_c788.html" title="User:Jesup">jesup</a> 17:22, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I see a simple difference of opinion. I favor verifiable fact as the primary criteria and notability is secondary or less. Notability is inherent in the <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7Everifiability_9db2.html" title="WP:verifiability">verifiability</a> of the topic, and I don't see any particular problem if the bean counters, key grip, or any other credited staff have articles here, as long as they're researched and documented properly with references cited. I'm not concerned at all with impressing the "Random Page" surfers, nor do I care if a topic is "too dry" or "too boring". However, this person's influence in a major media corporation has far more impact on society than almost any published musical artists who have sold the roughly 5000 copies of their work that is "notable enough" in that field. Definite keep if verifiable. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 18:17, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Note that nominations were general SouthPark episode nominations, not individual - all people working on it and executives involved are included. The articles inserted were basically "she left Comedy Central". Those publications are RS, but mention there doesn't mean notability per se. And those are trade mags that report on "so-and-so was made under-VP-in-training". More to the point, those searches basically show lots of "title, executive producer foo, writer bar, director xyzzy", etc. The only links not like that were "she left CC", and a single quote about SP.

<dd>Daily Variety and The Hollywood Reporter and very important news sources read by almost everyone in the entertainment business and not in any way excluded from WP:RS. I actually agree that some of those articles are "mentions" of Liebling, so I inserted three articles that she is the "primary subject of" into the WP article. Very much passing <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<dd>As I said, those are <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, but being mentioned in them doesn't necessarily mean that the subject is notable. It depends on how they're mentioned. WP is an encyclopedia, but not a list of all facts, which is why Notability is important. Correct me if I'm wrong, but her nominations for emmy's weren't for her; the episode was nominated and she (along with all the other staff) were therefore considered nominees. Would you consider all group emmy nominees to be notable per se? I imagine not. So the question goes around again to what makes her notable. Also note that even searches at the trade pubs barely come up with any refs other than "she left CC and was involved in SouthPark, and was an executive at Fox" - so how will this article ever get beyond a stub? <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesup_c788.html" title="User:Jesup">jesup</a> 00:58, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, when show gets nominated for an Emmy (it was the entire show, not just an episode), it's in fact the creative staff responsible for that show who is nominated. And I in fact do think that <u>all the writers and producers nominated for an Emmy and responsible for and extremely popular show are notable.</u> If you don't think that, that's okay as that's your POV. At least three articles (beyond what <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> considers "multiple") demonstrate notability. If you don't think her being an important executive at <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_Century_Fox_3a0c.html" title="20th Century Fox">20th Century Fox</a> is notable, again that's your POV.

<dd>Oakshade is referring to me; please see the Talk page and changelog for why I felt the reference was redundant (all viewable text part of the first citation). Citing that might be useful here in arguing over notability, though I'd say it doesn't help the argument, but there's no reason for the citation to remain in the article regardless of the results of the AfD.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Non-notable. BOBBY's arguments don't hold up. <i>"Well published scholar":</i> Five books (none listed and I can't find them), and as far as I can see, they are not 'scholarly' publications. She has apparently been published in 12 magazines, but only one is notable enough to have a Wiki article. "<i>Her academic achievements surpass those of average professors</i>": No they don't, she holds a doctorate which makes her pretty average for an academic. And she's not a professor, she's an assistant professor. (And my understanding is that in USA professor just means university teacher, it is not indication of staus or merit.) My biggest concern though is that the article was created by User:Nikitchenko , who has a history of being blocked.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Now that the article has been expanded, I agree it's worth keeping. I would also point out that this same effect could have been obtained by just expanding it after the {{<a href="../../../l/o/c/Template%7ELocal_b40a.html" title="Template:Local">local</a>}} tag was added to it, rather than going into a revert war and eventual AfD. I recommend that in the future, when articles are flagged with the "local" tag, that it be treated as a normal expansion request, rather than as some kind of censure. Then if the article is not or cannot be expanded within a reasonable amount of time, its information can be merged into a more appropriate location, such as the chain's article, and/or the article about the local community where the establishment is located. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 18:40, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> - Hi Brownie1212! In the future, please use ~~~~ to sign and date your posts. The issue with your article's deletion isn't factual accuracy (in my mind) but <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">notability</a>. Please read over the guidelines qualifying an individual for inclusion and see if Jenn brown fits them. Also, based on your user name, it sounds as if you might not be the best editor to write an unbiased article on Ms. Brown. My advice is to wait until Jenn achieves the requisite notability, and then I'm sure her followers will get an article up here pretty quickly. Hope this helps. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">-</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">o</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">y</em></a> 21:50, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> Thank you for your response and help, I very much appreciate it. This is all so very new to me and I was just intersted in seeing what this very interesting website was all about. If the powers that be feel this is not sutible for your site, then I am sure that is what is best as they would know. The article was created directly from Jenn's website's Bio page. Maybe there is a better format...or maybe she just needs to have someone that is more familiar with your site submit her. Thanks again. Brownie1212 22:01, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong and Speedy Keep</b> - I just spent an enjoyable and thought provoking 20 minutes browsing the listed article. I saw no NPOV issues, and learned quite a bit which I would not have gleaned from any of the other China related pages. It is one of the best cited articles on Wikipedia, and should absolutely be kept. I'd like to get this debate wrapped up quickly so the Deletion tag can be removed.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm concerned about original research here; for example, it does use facts about China, but the facts are meant to be persuasive about its influence, not informative. There's also a concern about the reliability of some of the sourcing (forexblog, an expat blog, is used even though expats unless they're also reporters are not reliable sources on China, and the source is actually presenting opinions as weasel-worded facts, see reference 110.) My suggestion is 1) slap an NPOV tag on it, 2) cut it down to a more reasonable length and clear out all the OR, and 3) monitor it carefully for edit wars. I'm not sure if deletion is the answer, as there are many sources. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 23:07, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Rewrite</b> or <b>Delete</b></dd>
<dd>I agree with ColourBurst. Deletion is the last resort solution to the OR problem in this otherwise well-written article. The OR problem is that the parts that are verifiable are the facts and this article appears to synthesize the facts into a comprehensive theory. This makes it a good piece of writing but OR nonetheless and therefore inappropriate for Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>What needs to be verifiable is that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> X believes that factors A,B,C are reasons why China is an emerging superpower and reliable source Y believes that factors D,E,F are reasons why China will have problems in the future. In other words, the author(s) do not need to prove that the factors A,B,C,D,E,F are true. They need to prove that reliable sources, X,Y,Z believe that these factors are relevant and significant to the question.</dd>
<dd>Surely there are books written on the subject. Cite them.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> (with some minor reservations) - I will accept that, at first sight, the title gives the impression of crystal-balling. However the article doesn't engage in speculation - it is an accumulation of sourced facts bearing on China's international power. I have some concerns over layout (the points for/against) and, given its title, there is the risk that it will encourage POV/OR editing. However I offset this against the number of excellent editors who are doing a creditable job in keeping it clean.

<li>These articles (China/India/EU) have gone through a number of variations on a theme of 'potential superpower' or 'emerging superpower' - either way the title looks crystal-ballish (even if the article itself isn't). I don't really have any alternative suggestion (sorry) but I think that any emerging/potential/possible/future title is bad and should be avoided. <a href="../../../x/d/a/User%7EXdamr_c318.html" title="User:Xdamr"><span style="font-family: Times"><span style="font-size:18px">X</span><span style="font-size:14px">damr</span></span></a><sup><a href="../../../x/d/a/User_talk%7EXdamr_0a9d.html" title="User talk:Xdamr">talk</a></sup> 18:19, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's all crystal ball-ish. However, so are a number of articles related to global warming. This kind of prognostication is important and therefore encyclopedic. I would focus less on the title and more on getting the article to survey the opinions of reliable sources rather than trying to be a reliable source in itself. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 18:24, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It used to be China as a potential superpower, but what's the point of making an article just because a nation has potential. Then we would have less reason to delete articles made by people who just wanted to make their country look good, as many countries have "potential", to be "emerging" is a state of actual movement to the status of superpower and is harder to make an article on. <b><a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkblue">Noble</font><font color="darkorange">eagle</font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/b/User_talk%7ENobleeagle_accc.html" title="User talk:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkred" size="0.2" face="Arial Narrow">[TALK]</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nobleeagle_dfb1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nobleeagle"><font color="darkred" size="0.2" face="Arial Narrow">&#160;[C]</font></a></sup> 05:16, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>:While I am not particularly fond of the insane , militant and oppressive Government of the People's Republic (though they have calmed down somewhat thanks to Xiaopeng and after) it is a fact that the PRC is an emerging superpower, both militarily and economically. Lots of sources support the claim that PRC is an emergent superpower. Regardless of the quality of the article the subject of PRC as an emergent superpower is noteworthy enough to warrant an article on wikipedia. If the nominator feels that the article is "too much like an essay" then he is free to try and fix it.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 05:28, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rewrite</b> The basic idea is fine. The problem is that the article needs a lot of work to get up to scratch. It should have separate sections for the main topics <i>once</i> - then there can be for/against views inside.
