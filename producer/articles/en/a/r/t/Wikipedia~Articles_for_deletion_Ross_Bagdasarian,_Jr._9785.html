<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'd heard of him before I read this. He took over the Chipmunks franchise in the late 70's from his dad and launched the saturday morning cartoon show. I belive he also did voice work on the show. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">DaveTheRed</a> 08:06, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, concur with Rick. The article seems to confuse the two. His dad is notable, the son doesn't appear to be. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 08:35, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How are they being confused? Ross Jr. created the show <i>Alvin and the Chipmunks</i> which aired in 1983. His dad had died in 1972. The only fact on this page that I can not verify with google is who founded Bagdasarian Productions. But I know that he currently heads it. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">DaveTheRed</a> 08:58, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong keep.</b> Frankly I find this nomination hard to understand. Unless the <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Bagdasarian_51c3.html" title="Ross Bagdasarian">Ross Bagdasarian</a> article is wrong on the date of his death, his son had a major input to the chipmunks, and is clearly encyclopedic. We even got them here in Aus, records, TV shows, comics, the works. Alvin: <i>We've almost got you, Theodore.</i> Theodore: <i><b>Almost</b> doesn't count. That big hole almost got me, too.</i> <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 11:22, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> with the Chipmunks. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 13:49, Feb 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> definitely a notable figure. I'm not even a Chipmunks fan, but both him and his father's names are instantly recognisable to me, and I suspect to many other people too. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:59, Feb 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Merge</b> as per Radiant!. Just because he's got a notable franchise doesn't mean he's done anything notable with it. His dad seems to be the big cheese here, not him. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 18:02, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</s>
<ul>
<li>But he <i>did</i> do something notable with the franchise. He revived the chipmunks in the 80's. If it weren't for him the Chipmunks would be chiefly known as a 60's fad. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">DaveTheRed</a> 19:32, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>After reading your and Starblind's comments, I'm sold. Change to a solid <b>Keep</b>. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 00:52, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as a notable figure. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 21:50, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Just so we're all clear on this: Ross Jr. isn't some executive-producer figurehead type. He also did the voices of Alvin (the main Chipmunk), Theodore, and Dave Seville in nearly every Chipmunks production from 1972 onward, as well as producing and writing many of them too. This includes their big hit TV series that ran through the 80s for nearly a decade, their feature film, and several videos. He's not as important as his dad was, and most of us probably wouldn't recognise him on the street, but virtually everyone in the civilized world has heard his voice at least once. It's impossible to imagine why he shouldn't have an article. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 22:38, Feb 25, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, he does Alvin (in the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red.html" title="Red">red</a>) and Simon (in the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue.html" title="Blue">blue</a>). His wife does Theodore (in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green.html" title="Green">green</a>/<a href="../../../t/e/a/Teal.html" title="Teal">teal</a>). --<a href="../../../b/_/t/User%7EB_Touch_5595.html" title="User:B Touch">b. Touch</a> 23:51, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Extreme keep</b>. Obviously encyclopedic. —<a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadman1_1309.html" title="User:Radman1"><b>RaD Man</b></a> (<a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadman1_76e9.html" title="User talk:Radman1"><i>talk</i></a>) 02:34, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep on the basis of others' verification, above - needs verifiable reference links, however - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 13:53, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, but slap a "stub" on it until the article gets fleshed out some more. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDale_Arnett_0a47.html" title="User:Dale Arnett">Dale Arnett</a> 00:57, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, <b>Alvin and the Chipmunks</b> is still culturally significant, and he manages the franchise. That's notable enough for me. --<a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKitch_5ab1.html" title="User:Kitch">Kitch</a> 06:15, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>. Doesn't seem to have any notability independent of <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin_and_the_Chipmunks_850a.html" title="Alvin and the Chipmunks">Alvin and the Chipmunks</a>. It would seem to make sense to merge/redirect the info in this article to <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin_and_the_Chipmunks_850a.html" title="Alvin and the Chipmunks">Alvin and the Chipmunks</a> since this person's life seems to have centered on developing and marketing the "franchise" created by his father (plus voicing one of the chipmunks). There seems to be a whole category of little articles (<a href="../../../a/l/v/Category%7EAlvin_and_the_Chipmunks_691b.html" title="Category:Alvin and the Chipmunks">Category:Alvin and the Chipmunks</a>), of which much the same could be said. Is there a prize or something for racking up the article count? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 19:05, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. It doesn't matter if he has notability outside of the chipmunks. There are many notable people who are nonetheless only notable for one thing. The chipmunks themselves have notability, and as the driving force behind them post 1972, so does he. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">DaveTheRed</a> 00:43, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> per BM's argument. Should be discussed in context. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 06:43, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Recycling_Troll_5389.html" title="User:The Recycling Troll">The Recycling Troll</a> 09:43, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. An important person in the fields of <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animation.html" title="Animation">animation</a> and children's music. We should be able to see Bagdasarian Jr. in the <a href="../../../v/o/i/Category%7EVoice_actors_8d55.html" title="Category:Voice actors">Category:Voice actors</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/c/Category%7ERecord_producers_f733.html" title="Category:Record producers">Category:Record producers</a>. I revised both this article and <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janice_Karman_1d3b.html" title="Janice Karman">Janice Karman</a> (who also should have her own article, she co-produces with her husband Ross Jr. and voices Theodore and The Chipettes). Google tho I might, I couldn't find any birthdates, though...just lots of interviews and articles by and about them--<a href="../../../b/_/t/User%7EB_Touch_5595.html" title="User:B Touch">b.
