<p>I feel that this article isn't very significant, and doesn't deserve a place in wikipedia. Simply an article that advertises/tells about the game. Website does not generate many visitors.

<li><b>Delete</b> as hosting on Newgrounds does not count as a non-trivial source, being pick of the day is.. nice, but then there's a pick of the day every single day. Even if it has been viewed 5 million times, what exactly does that mean? At best it means someone has downloaded that particular flash game that many times, presumably many will be players accessing it multiple times. It's a free game on a site designed to pull punters in by sheer volume of 'phree stuff', people go to get a little rest for nowt then go take a shower or whatever. Imagine if a load of bakers marched across cities all over the world offering free slices of chocolate cake, then declared it amazing that they've shifted x million slices. Well of course they will, I'd have no difficulty in passing out £5 notes and chart CDs either. If someone can show that the 'feature of the day' is significant or that there's some notability citations out there, I'll gladly change the vote, but these flash games etc. seem to be taking liberties. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 09:26, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Note that FileFront is not considered a non-trivial website, since anyone with a FileFront account can upload material on it. Claiming notability due to having a file on FileFront is no different than having a website on Geocities or having a flash cartoon on Newgrounds. --<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 02:00, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Authraw, I'm concerned that much of the current content in the article is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. What I mean is that you didn't <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite</a> any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable third-party sources</a>. That's not really a delete concern (I'm going to figure out whether something like Gamespot/Download.com is considered a content distributor, but my feeling is that it is.) but I'm not sure that the current article's contents can be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 17:28, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Doesn't the site speak for itself as far as verification? I mean, if its mention on Gamespot and Download.com makes it "notable", can't the information about the site come from the site itself? That being said, I'm not certain (and never have been) that the highlighted maps are notable in themselves--but the rest of the article seems fine to me as far as being verified.

<dd>Yes, I know. But I provided two instances where Download.com and Gamespot posted Gametoast material (<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/starwarsbattlefront/download.html?sid=6116771" class="external text" title="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/starwarsbattlefront/download.html?sid=6116771" rel="nofollow">Gamespot</a> and <a href="http://www.download.com/Star-Wars-Battlefront-Gametoast-map-pack-3/3000-7453_4-10367959.html" class="external text" title="http://www.download.com/Star-Wars-Battlefront-Gametoast-map-pack-3/3000-7453_4-10367959.html" rel="nofollow">Download.com</a>).

<dd>I believe the small section in WP:V was meant for a way to get little bits of information in an article that wouldn't otherwise have it.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I am the author of this version of the article. I created it about half a year ago because of its notability from the Rise of the Mushroom Kingdom series, and because its Alexa rank back then was fairly high. It started as a stub, and hoped that it would get expanded; however, it didn't much. Things just got worse for the popularity when the presence of malware started showing up more and more on the site. That is what likely dropped its Alexa rating and lowered its popularity. I'm not sure if what I just said was going anyhere, but that was just my say. --<a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyingPenguins_a1ed.html" title="User:FlyingPenguins">FlyingPenguins</a> 02:15, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In that case you could kill the redirect for being un-used. When I read the article on the show it appeared to me it was in a far state of development and ready for broadcast in the near future. As soon as there's verifiable info on films we also get articles as long as we know for sure they'll be released (most often meaning they need to be announced by major studios). I didn't go into detail about the show, but I think it should be judged similarly to such film articles. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 10:32, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think quite a few people do not understand the context of how this article was created. It did not just come up out of thin air. It has been in the O'Reilly article for a long time but was quite a long list so I just provided a spin off article. If the Letterman article had a huge list of who he thinks are hot, then someone might end up making that into a separate list (which I'm sure would be afd'd also). I am not trying to proclaim that these lists are worthy of the label "encyclopedic" since so much cruft survives here or seriously fighting for the inclusion of this specific list. I guess I caused quite a stir here by doing this. There was no point I was trying to prove, but this discussion does enlighten as to what is really necessary to put into an article. I would like to invite people who commented here to look at the Bill O'Reilly article itself and see what can be improved. It is "B-class" right now but some imput could make it into a "Good Article." <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMurph101_c20f.html" title="User:MrMurph101">MrMurph101</a> 19:04, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It is extremely informative about O.'s positions and therefore his bias. <b>Especially</b>since the second adjective in this article is "journalist".

<li><b>Delete</b> no merge. We really do not need a separate list of the people each and every loudmouth talks about. Yes, it was cluttering up the article. The solution was to remove it from the article as cruft, leaving a few notable examples with some discussion in detail so that readers will understand O'Reilly, which is the purpose of the article.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I believe what AWA up there meant was other wrestling promotions' sites - not that the entry was meant to act as promotional material. Either way, I don't think the article should be deleted on merit that this information is relevant to people like myself who write reviews or might want to know about a performer who I have never seen before, but would want to learn more about.

<dd>I disagree. I came across this page in February this year when I was searching for trivia puzzles, as I was planning a trivia night. I wanted information about different types of trivia games and came across logo extraction.

<dd>Sure, but Wikipedia isn't a web directory or a search engine, it's an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article is about "class of printed or online games", so I don't see how it is inherently promotional. Inappropriate advertising can and should be edited out of the article, as Bricks J.

<li><b>Delete</b> Tran seems like a talented, accomplished and admirable person, but she has no meaningful level of support or following, receiving roughly 5% of the vote in a party primary. She is a not a leader in the state of Washington. Her limited voting support seems to have been a protest against Cantwell, and not support for Tran specifically. At best, an article about Tran is of local interest, and not appropriate for Wikipedia (there is already an article about the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_United_States_Senate_election%2C_2006_94ce.html" title="Washington United States Senate election, 2006">Washington United States Senate election, 2006</a>, as well as an article about <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_Cantwell_801b.html" title="Maria Cantwell">Maria Cantwell</a>). --Nottingham 02:08, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep.</b> I have been the primary author of this article for the past few months. The deletion proposals seem to be in regard to the notability of the subject. Hong Tran was cited in multiple respected publications as Maria Cantwell's main challenger for the Democratic nomination, and was regarded as the standard bearer for the solidly anti-war contingent of the Democratic party in the primary. She recieved a considerable amount of press during the primary campaign, including mentions in multiple articles and one feature article in the Washington Times (in Washington, D.C.), a mention in the New York Times, articles in major newspapers throughout the state of Washington, and feature audio interviews on NPR as well as others. She received endorsements from the Democratic caucuses in four of the legislative districts in the state, including the sole endorsement in Cantwell's home district, the 32nd LD. She is the first Vietnamese-American to campaign for Senate in the state of Washington, and likely in the entire country, according to the Northwest Asian Weekly newspaper. She may continue to influence the outcome of this U.S. Senate election with her endorsement or lack of it, and any other words or actions during the general election, and she may also remain a public figure and run for another office. Hong Tran also passes the Google test, with about 16,800 hits for a search of ["hong tran" senate].</p>
<p>Both Nottingham in particular (Bobblehead as well) have put a lot of weight on the fact that Tran only got about 5% of the vote in her second-place finish in the primary. I have argued that the size of the vote alone does not determine the significance of a campaign or a candidate. Ralph Nader never even got 3% of the vote, yet was a notable presidential candidate. Neither raised or spent lots of money; both ran grassroots campaigns for the purposes of making statements about the political system, about the parties, to influence the political debate and party platforms, and to allow voters an avenue to express their conscience. Some people understand the significance of this; other people don't. I would consider a pro/con style insertion into the Hong Tran article where both sides of this could be heard (with propertly balanced language); I think this is a common way of dealing with these sorts of controversies in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the article has received <b>considerable</b> modifications (about 110 edits) since Nottingham began contributing five days ago on the morning of Sept. 19th (which also happens to be the day the primary election occurred, or the night before, in Washington state time). Bobblehead made this AfD request in response to ongoing "edit wars," mostly over was constitutes NPOV or relevant info. In response to what I consider uncivil treatment and improper edits, I have been attempting to seek neutral mediation for over the past few days. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalse_Prophet_d778.html" title="User:False Prophet">User: False Prophet</a> from the Mediation Cabal had accepted the case for mediation just prior to Bobblehead's AfD request. Assuming the AfD request ends up being evaluated, I will be posting a link here to my preferred version of the article, such that it will show some of the information and citations that have been either deleted or severely modified in the name of "NPOV", "Streamlining", significance, privacy, or any number of other reasons why this article has been trimmed. In some cases, supporting info has been trimmed away and then the original content subsequently deleted for lack of support.<a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 03:36, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Technically the AFD was submitted because the edit war was due to a question of notability of the subject. What better way to determine notability than send it through AFD? If it survives the AFD, then the subject is notable, if it doesn't survive, then the subject isn't notable. Either way, problem solved. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 06:52, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A large amount of the edit war was over disagreement over statements that were alleged NPOV problems. The article was supposedly in the process of being adjusted to better conform to NPOV, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> standards; I had been trying to work with Nottingham too cool off, set some ground rules, and seek mediation, while still recieving uncivil treatment such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hong_Tran#Emcee_said_7" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hong_Tran#Emcee_said_7" rel="nofollow">here</a>, where he says, "You have no sense of facts or standards, and you do not understand the difference between facts and opinion. . . Grow up, learn to read and learn basic academic standards." Your response to this was to put up the article for deletion, rather than noting Nottingham's uncivil statements, trying to defuse the situation, and seeking some external mediation.

<dd>And how does one characterize a 'joke candidate'? The WA Dem primary had a person named Mike the Mover that runs in whatever is the highest available position that year and another candidate whose campaign stump was the need to create habitable space stations to house the planet's growing population. Neither one of these candidates consider themseleves a 'joke candidate'. Both also get more hits via a google search than Hong Tran.

<dd>Just because habitable space stations guy doesn't think he's a joke doesn't mean he's right! I think it's pretty clear that Hong Tran is hardly a joke candidate: she ha[s/d] a serious platform. Anyway, in the absence of a consensus policy on candidates, I think erring on the side of inclusion is pretty harmless. Indeed, the whole initiation of this debate -- Tran supporters and detractors fighting over facts about the campaign -- seems to indicate that there is more interest in Tran than, say, <a href="../../../u/s/-/US-54_a81a.html" title="US-54">US-54</a>. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 06:30, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The desire to group Hong Tran in with "joke" candidates like Michael Goodspaceguy Nelson and Mike the Mover is a fairly obvious stretch; I'm not sure why Bobblehead would still try to advance that theory. Someone who campaigns about the Iraq War, PATRIOT Act, free trade agreements, etc. is clearly a serious candidate compared to those whose voter pamphlet entries talk about space colonization or going to war with British Columbia, neither of which has to do with the Democratic party platform or anything else that is considered a significant issue in this election. There was also an entreaty from the Cantwell campaign to Hong Tran to have her join their campaign (which she interpreted as a job offer, based on the context of the call right after the other challenger Mark Wilson had been hired), and which all of the political commentators that I've seen have regarded as a "buy-out" offer (as they still regard the Wilson hire). This is further evidence of her political significance; I severely doubt that Cantwell offered jobs to Nelson or Mover.<a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 19:10, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I also forgot to mention that Nelson and Mover both: had no campaign websites (albeit some almost uncommented blogs), reported no campaign contributions to the FEC, made no campaign appearances, gave no interviews, and had no feature articles on them in the press (local or national).

<dd><b>Comment</b> You earlier talked about Tran's "detractors". Who are her "detractors"? Who has made negative statements about Tran? I have expressed no opposition to her as a person. You now talk about "strong POVs". I do have a POV that she is "a talented, accomplished and admirable person" (I said that at the top of this page). I have never made any edits that say that she is not talented or lacks the ability to succeed in government. That isn't the issue. The issue is that she clearly isn't notable. She lost in a party primary in a landslide, by more than 85% of the vote. There is no evidence that she had special or unique support -- even the newspaper quote of a local Democrat who gave her a shared endorsement was "it wasn't a slap against Cantwell, but also it was kind of a feel-good vote, in that at least (people thought) 'I've said something about what's going on in Iraq' and stuff. It wasn't even about 'we shouldn't be there' but rather about how (the war) has been handled."! Notice that he didn't even mention anything about Tran. Tran's own campaign web site does even appear to have been updated since several weeks before the primary vote. She isn't a leader of the anti-Iraq War movement in the Democratic party. She simply filled the role of "not Cantwell" in the primary, and even in that role she barely received 5% of the vote. --Nottingham 20:50, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would agree that a lot of Nottingham's criticisms have been directed at me, even more than Hong Tran, and that the edit war seemed to be as much about winning/losing as it was about the interests of Wikipedia and its articles. I am not an innocent party to the edit war, but I don't think this is an appropriate direction for the dispute (as I mentioned, I was trying to seek mediation and defuse this). I do believe Nottingham's edits and deletions in the article themself evidence a strong POV, even if it was founded in something other than an evaluation of the candidate. Examples: adding, "Tran has not identified any Democratic candidates who are more electable than Cantwell, who won the Democratic primary with an overwhelming majority of 91% of the vote."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Tran&amp;oldid=77225789" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Tran&amp;oldid=77225789" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>; "Nevertheless, Democratic voters supported Cantwell overwhelmingly in the primary, with Cantwell receiving 91% of the vote, and Tran receiving less than 5%."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Tran&amp;oldid=77262197" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Tran&amp;oldid=77262197" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>; and repeatedly deleting the info box and date of birth, on the justification that is was necessary to protect the candidate's (and her husband's) privacy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Tran&amp;oldid=77536548" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Tran&amp;oldid=77536548" rel="nofollow">[18]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Tran&amp;oldid=77535455" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Tran&amp;oldid=77535455" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> which had Nottingham edit summaries as follows:</dd>
<dd>"(Info box is repeated in bio. Should her husband, who to my knowledge is not a public figure, have his name listed on Wikipedia?)"</dd>
<dd>"(Why is Tran's date of birth being repeated openly on Wikipedia? Perhaps her age is relevant, but DOB can lead to identity theft.)".</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> You said "I don't know what else to say about that." It seems that what you should be saying is "I'm sorry, I didn't know Wikipedia policy". From Wikipedia's own guidelines: "Wikipedia includes exact birthdates for some famous people, but including this information for most living people should be handled with caution. While many well-known living persons' exact birthdays are widely known and available to the public, the same is not always true for marginally notable people or non-public figures. With identity theft on the rise, it has become increasingly common for people to consider their exact date of birth to be private information. When in doubt about the notability of the person in question, or if the subject of a biography complains about the publication of his or her date of birth, err on the side of caution and simply list the year of birth rather than the exact date." See <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biographies_of_living_persons.html" title="Biographies of living persons">Biographies of living persons</a>. I had suggested that just Tran's age was appropriate instead of her birthday. That suggestion is in line with Wikipedia policy. You appear to make light of the issue of potential identity theft. However, I agree with Wikipedia's guidelines on this matter, and I follow them. Regardless, this has nothing to do with the AfD, although it is another example of how you ignore Wikipedia guidelines. --Nottingham 21:39, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As I mentioned in the talk or edit summary, DOB is on the public secretary of state election filings, her husband's name is on the current campaign web page. Both are on this older campaign page:<a href="http://www.campaignsitebuilder.com/templates/displayfiles/tmpl26.asp?SiteID=1096&amp;PageID=17570&amp;Trial=false" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.campaignsitebuilder.com/templates/displayfiles/tmpl26.asp?SiteID=1096&amp;PageID=17570&amp;Trial=false" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. Political candidates make themselves public figures and a lot of information is known about them. The reason I mentioned this is because the edit war that birthed this AfD has become relevant to the AfD debate itself, but I will agree to leave it to the interested reviewers to take a look at the edit history and talk page for the article in question from here on out.<a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 21:53, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The irony is amusing, as The Washington Times is a very conservative paper that likes tweaking Democrats (just like some liberal media like tweaking Republicans) by trying to create news when there is none. Regardless, The Washington Times article in question is the only article that has multiple references to Tran that appeared in a newspaper published outside the state of Washington. However, the article mentions nothing unique or notable about Tran except that her claim that she was not being treated fairly by the state and national Democratic parties, and that Tran is opposed to the Iraq War. The article even claims that voters for Tran appear to be making protest votes against Cantwell by voting for Tran, i.e., not voting for Tran because of Tran's own qualities. "But several voters here said they will issue a "protest" vote for Mrs. Tran, a lawyer with a nonprofit agency, to send a message they are frustrated with their senator." There already are Wikipedia articles on the election and on Cantwell. There is nothing notable about Tran that merits a Wikipedia article. --Nottingham 21:49, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

At least it's a good <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> for you to use. Yes, as that NY Times article had TWO instances of the name "Tran" in it, even though the article isn't about Tran (it was published BEFORE the primary, yet it was all about Cantwell's pending race with McGavick). I suppose my comment "The Washington Times article in question is the only article that has <b>multiple</b> references to Tran" should be modified slightly. The Washington Times article is the only out of state newspaper article that focuses on Tran or does more than mention her in passing. --Nottingham 22:11, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, for awhile you decided that anyone with less than 5% of the vote was not-notable -- until you discovered that Tran had 5.1%. Why don't you tell us what would make Tran notable?

I notice that Emcee has neither a normal User Page nor a normal User Talk page (the User Talk page for Emcee says "Welcome from Redwolf24"). Since Emcee just made the exact same false claim as you, it makes one wonder. You just made the false claim "for awhile you decided that anyone with less than 5% of the vote was not-notable". I never made such a statement or had such a standard, yet Emcee made the exact same spurious claim as you, and was unable to support it when called on it. It could be that you simply read what Emcee writes and repeat it. But, then again, you seem to have an inordinate interest in this topic, just like Emcee does, so, if the shoe fits . . .

<dd>Nottingham: My user page is empty because I've never taken the time to put anything on it; not an uncommon thing (I see yours is empty too!).

If I were to theorize about sock puppets, I think it would be more likely that I would be Sdedeo's sock puppet rather than vice versa, since he has a lot more contributions on a lot more articles than I do, and also created his account before me.

<li><b>Comment</b> This page has become absurd. Bobblehead nominated the article for deletion, not me. Emcee has made many edits to the article in question for several weeks. Emcee has turned this page (the AfD) into a vendetta against me (not that it matters much, after all, it is just an Internet discussion with people who don't know each other). Emcee has carried on and on and on, including hearsay and false accusations of personal attacks, to the point where he/she has created the false impression that I started the AfD when in fact all I did was write a comment. Period. That's it. One comment. It was only after numerous comments by several people back and forth that I offered responses. Absurdity. This page is about deleting a page about a person who lost by more than 85% of the vote in a political primary, about whom there is nothing noteworthy, and it is a situation where the election itself has a page that references the person. This page is not about me, it is not about Emcee, it is not about Bobblehead. It is an AfD for the Hong Tran entry started by Bobblehead. That's all this page is for. I have made it clear on this page and the Tran entry and its Talk page that I respect Tran's talents, accomplishments, and character. However, those are not the issue. The issue is notability, and Tran is simply not notable. Incidentally, the Tran page itself as Emcee has edited it violates the spirit and arguably the strict letter of Wikipedia's own guidelines by revealing DOB and spouse's name. No one on this page even seemed to care about the privacy and safety of Tran or her husband, even though Wikipedia explicitly mentions this in its guidelines. But, there are far greater tragedies in the world that the existence of a article on a non-notable person.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would like to express public thanks to Dennisthe2 for apparently realizing that at least some if not most of what Emcee has written on this page is not accurate. Quoting Dennisthe2 from above: "I didn't have all fo the facts before I shot my mouth off. Not knowing what to make of this mess, though, I'll remain neutral." As one can see, Dennisthe2 has retracted his vote to Keep the page. --Nottingham 21:58, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I will leave it up to any interested readers to take a look at Nottingham's talk page (make sure to view the history, since he has already partially or completely blanked it in 3 times in recent days, including twice since his block was ended) and the edit history/talk page of the Hong Tran article where he encouraged deletion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hong_Tran#Nottingham_said_2" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hong_Tran#Nottingham_said_2" rel="nofollow">on Sept 22</a> and immediately prior to the edit-war-motivated request on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hong_Tran#Emcee_said_7" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hong_Tran#Emcee_said_7" rel="nofollow">Sept 25</a>. I never said that he submitted the AfD nomination himself, but that he was (I quote), "a prime motivator for this AfD nomination." I agree with Dennisthe2 that this history is a mess, and I assume most people don't have the time to dig through it all. I cited Nottingham's recent block and surrounding behavior because I believe it is a quick way for reviewers assess the credibility of his arguments. I would also like to note that although he is now restraining himself from direct personal attacks on others, I have witnessed no remorse for his previous actions, and the sarcasm that remains in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASnottygobble&amp;diff=78128219&amp;oldid=77832566#Hello.2C_my_friend" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASnottygobble&amp;diff=78128219&amp;oldid=77832566#Hello.2C_my_friend" rel="nofollow">his communications</a> with longstanding user and admin Snottygobble I do not believe are in line with community standards of respectful communication. <a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 00:16, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think you need to take a deep breath and step back. This page is about an AfD for the Hong Tran entry. That's all. You have no respect for the AfD process and no respect for the Wikipedia community when you bring in other matters. It appears that you believe that by filling this page with non-AfD matters that you can stop the article from being deleted. I cannot understand why else you keep diverting the subject of this AfD page. --Nottingham 00:28, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> My concurrence was that the history of the Hong Tran article was a mess, due to the edit war. It was heavily redacted during the days leading up to the AfD request, which made it difficult for people to see what the article actually consisted of, and how much press she had gotten. I'm sure it's also difficult for people to sort through all the issues of the edit war itself, which is why it should have been in mediation instead. If you were saying something different than that, then I don't concur. I certainly don't concur with Nottingham's analysis of what you wrote -- just because you said you didn't have all the facts, I didn't conclude that you thought I had given inaccurate information. If you do, please specify, because I believe that everything I have said is accurate. I'm not dealing with Nottingham's allegations anymore at this point because I don't feel it is productive; I would be surprised if anyone who views his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nottingham&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nottingham&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">talk page history</a>, with it's repeated blanking of admin comments, would give his allegations any credit at this point. My contention was and is that this AfD never should have been nominated in the first place, because it was an edit war issue. In that sense, I agree with your second opinion (the switch to Strong Keep, because it is an edit war issue). I think it is appropriate for the AfD to end, as long as the article is kept; but there is no reason why another one should be started. I would expect that a second AfD would have similar results anyway. I also think that this AfD has shown that there is a significant number of people who think that Hong Tran has sufficent notability to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, which is the technical basis upon which Bobblehead was submitting it, even if the practical purpose was to end the edit war. Anyhow, it seems that the whole purpose of AfD (since we are in the process, regardless of whether it was proper or not) is to reach consensus. I will propose <b>Keep</b>, with a scheduled re-evaluation after the Nov. 2008 U.S. Congressional elections. <a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 06:02, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Of course, this ignores that you poisoned the AfD process by making this page about me, and constantly talking about me. Several Keep votes reference directly or indirectly your constant remarks about me on this page. You don't like me. That's fine with me. You appear obsessed with me, and I am raising complaints with Wikipedia about your Wikipedia stalking of me. I suggested, in accordance with Wikipedia guidelines for resolution of disputes (namely that involved parties should try resolution first amongst themselves), that you start an entry called somethinig like "Nottingham is a bad person". Put it on my User Page if you prefer. --Nottingham 16:40, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It should be noted that regardless of an edit war over the article (which Emcee is as much to blame for as Nottingham) the AFD submission was about the lack of notability for Hong Tran outside of the Senate race. It should also be pointed out that the content in the Senate race portion of Tran's article is already covered in the Senate Race article and if that duplication is removed, there's nothing even remotely notable about her. I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AWashington_United_States_Senate_election%2C_2006&amp;diff=76799914&amp;oldid=76712383" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AWashington_United_States_Senate_election%2C_2006&amp;diff=76799914&amp;oldid=76712383" rel="nofollow">proposed</a> on the Washington Senate race talk page prior to the start of the edit war that the article (and that of the other primary losers) be either turned into redirects to the Senate race or submitted for AFD. I'm also curious of the opinion of othes on how better to handle a content dispute that is based solely on the notability of the article subject than to send it through AFD? This isn't the first time an AFD has been sent through in the midst of an edit war and many of them have been deleted at the end of the AFD. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 16:32, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Emcee keeps making an AfD about the Hong Tran entry a discussion about me (Nottingham). That has grossly tainted the AfD process -- after Emcee's repeated mentioning of my name, a few comments came in as Keep that implicitly or explicitly mentioned me, clear evidence that the AfD process has been tainted by Emcee's repeated discussion of me on this page instead of the merits of the AfD subject itself. --Nottingham 12:15, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that Dennisthe2, who seems to be an active and neutral Wikipedia observer, has the right idea. Simply start a new AfD fresh. I will gladly not participate other than reprinting my original comment (see top of page; in brief, Hong Tran seems to be talented, accomplished, and admirable, but not notable and therefore the AfD should be deleted and redirected to the election entry). I suggest that Emcee participate in a new AfD without mentioning me at all. If Emcee would like to write 25 paragraphs on the new AfD, as long as they don't mention me, then he/she should do so. I told Dennisthe2 I had no concern with how he/she voted before and during his vote changes. That is clear public record. Nevertheless, I suggest to Emcee that Emcee should show more respect to Dennisthe2 and to other Wikipedia community members by treating the AfD as an AfD, and not make misleading comments about any person's stance to Keep, Delete or Abstain. Emcee is welcome, as far as I am concerned, to start a Wikipedia entry called "Why Nottingham is a Bad Person" or to put such entries on my User Page. I have no quarrel with that. However, I do not understand why Emcee has taken it up him/herself to apparently misrepresent Dennisthe2's opinion. Dennisthe2 has said his choice is Abstain. If he chooses to make his opinion known as Keep or Delete, I am sure he will do that. However, it seems inaccurate and misleading for anyone to quote his prior opinions of Delete and Keep. --Nottingham 12:15, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure what benefit would come from an immediate restart of the AFD process. The mess that this AFD became is still fresh in the involved parties' minds and a restart will only extend the agony. I'm content to let this AFD run it's course (and probably end up in no consensus) and wait until after the November election to send it through AFD again. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 16:32, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It doesn't appear that most people evaluated this AfD based on the edit war or Nottingham's actions anyway. The only "Keepers" who even mentioned it are Roninbk (who mainly addressed the media coverage), and Sdedeo (who wasn't even addressing it in his initial "Keep" analysis). If anything, the edit war only biased reviewers unfairly against the article, as the first several viewers only got to see it in its highly redacted state (before Rebecca reverted it back to a semi-complete version). The last several reviewers all gave a "Keep" rating. Personally, I think re-sending through AfD in November would be an abuse of the deletion process; I'll leave it to the closing admin to weigh in on this. <a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 17:21, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Once again, Emcee continues in personal attacks on me, instead of discussing the AfD. Emcee talked about "Nottingham's actions anyway". There is no reason I should be the subject of this page, and Emcee is presenting a biased, non-NPOV attack by characterizing my "actions". He/she consistently violates the spirit and letter of the Wikipedia guidelines with constant attacks on me on this page, and for turning an AfD into an attack page against me. --Nottingham 13:31, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I just want to point out Nottingham's use of the term NPOV above. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is a policy that applies to WP articles. Talk pages, AfDs, etc. are places where we express our own viewpoints on the article content and related issues. Saying that my contributions to an AfD page are non-NPOV is meaningless. Furthermore, I am absolutely not issuing any personal attacks against Nottingham; I have noted specific instances of uncivility and his blocks, and pointed people to his writings on various talk pages so that they can review them for themselves to help evaluate the credibility of his arguments. <a href="../../../e/m/c/User%7EEmcee_02c9.html" title="User:Emcee">Emcee</a> 16:28, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> What are you talking about? NPOV is a common abbreviation that has nothing to do with Wikipedia. Wikipedia uses NPOV in the context of its guidelines. Regardless, Emcee has repeatedly made false, non-NPOV accusations against me up and down this page. Instead of it being an AfD, it has become Emcee's diatribe against me. Emcee has not stopped stalking me all over Wikipedia, and leaving messages all over Wikipedia about me. It is sad and pitiful. I offered a solution that Emcee start a page with a title such as "Reasons Why Nottingham is a Bad Person". Instead, Emcee persists in posting non-NPOV attacks on me instead of letting the AfD be an AfD. If this AfD is "Keep", then there should be another one, as per the suggestions above, right afterwards that should not include Emcee's editorializing about me and attacks on me. I am not the subject, the Tran article is. If the AfD is "Delete", then obviously there is no need for another AfD. --Nottingham 20:12, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've not checked but it's unlikely that any of the few paid Wikipedia staff said that, what is likely is that another editor (just like you) said it should be tidied up. And <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warriors_%28book_series%29.html" title="Warriors (book series)">Warriors (book series)</a> certainly does need a good clean, but its length really isn't a concern - it's non-encyclopedic tone certainly is. Consider "<i>Plot summaries.

<p>Creating AFD discussion as my prod was disputed. Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought and that's what this article is. There are no verifiable references to cite. We certainly don't need an article about this. I think its mention in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannon_fodder.html" title="Cannon fodder">cannon fodder</a> or <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redshirt_%28stock_character%29.html" title="Redshirt (stock character)">Redshirt (stock character)</a> is more than enough. Also, it should not be shorted to a simple definition either, wikipedia is not a dictionary. I know it's a cliche in use, but just because something is noteworthy doesn't mean it's appropriate for wikipedia. Please see <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> for info on this. Also, one could argue that the stormtrooper effect is a neologism without verifiable sources and thus an innapropriate article. When and if there are good sources to make an article for this phenomenon I'd encourage it, but as it stands this article is not appropriate. See <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid_neologisms</a> for further info. Crypticgeek 03:43, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

I pointed out the quickest tests for objectivity weren't met by Kacey, which means the notability criteria will likely be statements such as "I've heard of her" and "she's all over the place".

Furthermore, if you had bothered to read the talk page, which you failed to correctly move together with the article, you would have seen that this was already discussed there and no consensus was reached.

<p>Contested prod (which I'd added, if anyone needs to know). Basically, what we have here is a high school student who seems like a talented young man and probably has a bright future - the key word being "future", as in not right now. The closest thing to notability is a collection of awards for public speaking and the fact that he spoke at a ceremony for an important religious figure. As a speaker and debater myself, I know it's not easy to win those sorts of awards, but they don't really equate to notability I don't think. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 04:22, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Response</b> It seems that you think this article is merely opinionated and unverfied, and you can believe that, but if you took the time to look up this you would see this is all correct. This isn't a fairytale and i cant believe how hard it is to do PR. Im not your run of the mill exec. I can have this put onto this site by other means of this administrator of someone of higher authority. Im not sure you actually see how you are preventing me from doing my job. This is no "speculated artist" or well, i can just have the President of Warner give the administrator a little talk.SoulRiverUSA 05:07, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>If mis-using Wikipedia as a hosting service for advance publicity material is your job, then I suggest that you change to another job, because your current job now has the attention of other Wikipedia editors, who will make it impossible for you to perform that job by removing your contributions of publicity material. Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia, not a publicity vehicle. If the president of Warner calls the Wikimedia Foundation and demands free web hosting for artist publicity, an event that I suspect to be highly unlikely given (for one thing) that the president of Warner almost certainly knows a lot better, xe will be told the same thing. No, you <i>cannot</i> have your advance publicity material "put onto this site by other means", and everyone that you talk to will tell you this. Please confine your PR activities to <i>your own</i> web site. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:36, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Wikipedia doesn't need your permission to delete the article any more than we care who "authorized" it. That's not how Wikis work.

<li><b>Reply</b> I guess so. I have now looked up the word. So I would say to you all: relax. Your venom is unbecoming. If each of you is worth a user page AND a talk page here, this person is worth one page.

<li><b>Reply</b> I was kidding. On a more serious note, notability requirements on Wikipedia are an important way of keeping it from being completely inundated by random information about all 5 billion plus people on the planet, rendering it completely useless. As it is, "How come I can't have an article when they can!" is a constant refrain from every person that can drink a glass of beer really fast or stand on their head or got straight A's once. The line has to be drawn somewhere, and hubris popping is sometimes part of that. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 17:43, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Leave</b> It seems worth keeping to me. There are articles about small towns of interest to a couple of thousand people. I am sure she is of interest to more than that.

<li><b>Comment</b> If that's really how the WP:WEB guideline worked, every one of Newgrounds' 300,000 animations would have an article, as would all 40 million DeviantArt submissions, all the pictures on Flickr, all the videos on Youtube, etc. Wikipedia is not a web guide, and does not seek to catalog content on other sites, even popular ones. If there's been significant media attention or some evidence that this flash file has been the topic of academic study, that might change things. Otherwise, it's just one of millions of silly web files. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 15:35, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is fairly well-known among the Flash community.

<p>I was debating whether this article should be deleted for lack of notability, and while my feeling is that we should <b>keep (weakly)</b> it, I decided to AfD it to see what the consensus is. As I see it, reason for deletion would be non-notability. He's far less notable than the lengthy term as a legislator would suggest, as not only were "mainland representative" legislators in that era not subject to elections, but they were rubber stamps for KMT central government policy with little influence themselves. However, the lengthy service itself might make him sufficiently notable. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 08:06, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> – You know, it’s generally considered civil to inform the creator of a page that you nominate its deletion. Anyway, yes, 16 hits are not much.

<li><b>Comment</b> sorry for not informing you. Can you quantify "EOA is pretty big" for us - perhaps it meets the notability criteria in some way we're missing, but otherwise its obscurity in terms of google hits is all we have to go on. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPercy_Snoodle_b005.html" title="User:Percy Snoodle">Percy Snoodle</a> 08:47, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> – Hm. I wouldn’t know how I can accurately ascertain just how important an organisation is. If you ask me, such a thing is completely subjective. But Empires of Ambition has made a lot of projects, including a movie, a Dawn of War mod, a tabletop game... Which already makes it much more than just a website. I admit that EOA does not meet the notability criteria as far as I know, but you have to remember that that is just a guideline, not actual rule. On top of that, it is rather disputed, if you look at the talk page. Think about it: “Any content which is distributed solely on the internet is considered, for the purposes of this guideline, as web content”. Makes sense. Then, it says that websites needs published works to be notable? Why does an organisation that by definition works purely online, need to have published works that are not on the web? It doesn’t make any sense. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrobtak_4896.html" title="User:Grobtak">Grobtak</a> 14:44, 27 September 2006

<li><b>Comment</b> this isn't the place to be discussing the validity of the notability guidelines; rather whether Empires of Ambition meets them. However, your comments on the guidelines would be welcomed at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28web%29_b1bd.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (web)">the guidelines' discussion page</a>. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPercy_Snoodle_b005.html" title="User:Percy Snoodle">Percy Snoodle</a> 08:48, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_criteria_219a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability criteria">notability criteria</a> are guidelines. No, that doesn't mean we should ignore them. "Arrr, they be more like guidelines, really" isn't an argument which establishes that EoA is notable. Perhaps you could give some indication of why you think EoA is notable, rather than criticising the criteria by which AfDs are judged? <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPercy_Snoodle_b005.html" title="User:Percy Snoodle">Percy Snoodle</a> 08:47, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> – I can only say what has been said: it is a guideline, not an actual rule. Empires of Ambition has been on the internet for over a year and, whilest it's population has oddly not expanded much, regardless of our attempts at advertisement, I can easily clarify at as "Pretty big".

My comment included results of a quick Google search and not a thorough research per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> <i>guideline</i>, but at least I'm not an <a href="../../../o/s/t/WP%7EOSTRICH_1864.html" title="WP:OSTRICH">ostrich</a>. As a Last.fm user, I usually check the artist's page on the aforementioned website, as the site is very widely used and is WP-notable, and also because I'm curious. Is there a specific reason why I shouldn't report the listener count here (and not have my entire comment belittled because of it)? Also, your band seems to have only 424 listeners, despite the fact that it's streamable through the site - unlike Arghoslent, seems to fail the Google test when searching with album titles, and I doubt you are well-known in your own genre, have a 16-year-long career and are a subject of controversy. So what is the reason for comparison? I must also quote myself from the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Grand_Belial%27s_Key_9a10.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Grand Belial's Key">Grand Belial's Key Afd discussion</a>; <i>it's not fair to assume that Allmusic.com and Amazon.com want to cover bands associated with nazism</i>. In fact, I don't think even bigger <i>metal</i> medias and labels want to associate with these bands. As for what they are or what they represent, they seem pretty notable to me. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProlog_962f.html" title="User:Prolog">Prolog</a> 08:55, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Wow, you did your research!

<li><b>Comment</b>. Like I said, I'm a curious person!

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. As stated, the band is hardly obscure, being that they have shared members with one of the most popular black metal bands of all time, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Belial%27s_Key_7d4c.html" title="Grand Belial's Key">Grand Belial's Key</a> (who, in addition to another well known band, Haggard, are signed to the same label as Arghoslent, Drakkar) and have been covered on notable third-party metal e-zines such as <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockdetector.html" title="Rockdetector">Rockdetector</a>, Maelstrom, and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronicles_of_Chaos_633e.html" title="Chronicles of Chaos">Chronicles of Chaos</a>. They have also accumulated considerable controversy, going so far as to have their record label boycotted. They are a prominent American band in a largely European dominated genre. They have done national tours America and Europe. While they don't sell lots of records or win Grammy's, what metal band does these days? A pretty relevant band in the genre, if you ask me. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ep282 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ep282_b09b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ep282">contribs</a>) .</small> <sub>This is their first edit ever. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="red">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="blue">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="green">ka</font></a> 03:41, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</sub></li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I fail to see why what they use to host their website has to do with their notability. What about the tons of notable bands that are using a page on MySpace as their main website these days? What about popular bands that don't have an official website altogether? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.250.246.75 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.250.246.75_174f.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.250.246.75">contribs</a>).</small></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. 15 year old career, signed on Moribund Records, two full-lengths released by labels, several EPs, covered extensively by metal zines all around (as listed above). If Turisas survived the vote for deletion with having only one full-length album, or if Grand Belial's Key is on here, so should Arghoslent. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Morrigan Targaryen (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorrigan_Targaryen_bb0e.html" title="User talk:Morrigan Targaryen">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morrigan_Targaryen_2ff2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morrigan Targaryen">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I created this page because I thought they deserved one. A simple, rough outline page on the Metal Archives simply isn't enough. I'm sure there are plenty of other pages on Wikipedia that are just as worthy of deletion for whatever reasons, yet this one gets targeted mainly because the band members are racist? If anything, the band needs an intelligent page such as this to get across what they are about, since most people probably don't like the idea of trawling obscure metal message boards for snippets of information. At least on here, all the info, and links to anything else of relevance, is in one place and people interested can check it out. The article is written in a way so as not to offend people, it simply outlines the bands ideologies and music, if people don't like it, then they don't read it. I didn't create this page to force it down people's throats, I created it to inform those who wished to know. Their fanbase and general popularity on the underground is rock solid and sure, they've attracted a fair amount of criticism and controversy, but who hasn't these days? What's different from Arghoslent singing about Jews to Madonna performing to thousands whilst hung on a crucifix, pretending to be Jesus?</li>

The article, written in July 2006, tells us that this song has not been published yet, but "hopefully" will be published in September 2006. It hasn't been. The article tells us that this is part of a forthcoming album called <i>Curious</i>. The only actual thing that is curious is that 17 (Chrishan album) <i>also</i> claims to be the forthcoming debut album for this artist, and makes no mention of this song.
<p>In fact, this article, 17 (Chrishan album) (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_17_%28Chrishan_album%29_c745.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/17 (Chrishan album)">AfD discussion</a>), and Chrishan (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Chrishan_459c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chrishan">AfD discussion</a>) are all part of a systematic mis-use of Wikipedia for a publicity campaign by 3mgworld (<a href="../../../3/m/g/User_talk%7E3mgworld.html" title="User talk:3mgworld">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_3mgworld_1b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/3mgworld">contribs</a>) and SoulRiverUSA (<a href="../../../s/o/u/User_talk%7ESoulRiverUSA_ac36.html" title="User talk:SoulRiverUSA">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SoulRiverUSA_9781.html" title="Special:Contributions/SoulRiverUSA">contribs</a>) that extends back as far as May 2006. (See the history of Chrishan, which I have undeleted for the purpose of this discussion, and notice how the names and release dates of the "forthcoming" songs, movies, and albums have changed as the months have gone by, just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=He_Ain%27t_Gonna&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63969499" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=He_Ain%27t_Gonna&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63969499" rel="nofollow">as they have in this article</a> in fact.)

<li>Chris Dotson is the kids name as well as his father's. Read your stuff first. First as you should know in the music industry things are subject to change such as JoJo's album "The High Road" and many others. NOTHING in the music industry is exact. Omarion's album was scheduled for Oct. 3 now its Oct. 17. There were songs on JoJo's page that aren't even on her album anymore that were produced by Ryan Leslie. Chrishan is also friends with JoJo and Omarion so I dont think he would talk to them if he were a sham. Chris Dotson is the <b>CEO</b> look up and don't talk before you know the facts.

<li><b>KEEP</b> -- How much traffic must be enjoyed before this program is deemed "Substantial" by <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIrongargoyle_444b.html" title="User:Irongargoyle">Irongargoyle</a>? And is this the only objection to the article's existing? Hopefully the fact it's a political satire isn't the underpinning argument against keeping it up, as the show enjoys a considerably substantial listenership. The reasoning behind "local programming" being nixed seems rather vague as well, considering the station the show airs on has it's own entry. If "local programming" is too small to warrant its own entry, then why would the station broadcasting such programming be worthy of an entry? It's too "local" to be noteworthy then. That seems to be the logic that's following. But if the station itself and the individual programs ARE worthy of a wikipedia entry, why wouldn't the shows themselves be, as it follows the shows would have the same audience as the people listening to the station. -- PDXnut 11:01 25 September 2006</li>

It has been put forward that AlQoraton asked members to post their views on this debate via the TeamLorio.net web-forums. However, as he didn't write this article, it should be understood that rules and regulations regarding the posting of Articles on Wikipedia are unclear to him as, obviously, he has previously had no reason to have read them. However, as I seriously doubt the members of the TeamLorio.net forums will be deterred from defending this article merely by the notice posted above, I must also stress as the sModerator of the Forums in question that NOBODY from TeamLorio.net simply makes an account to tip the scales of this debate. This achieves nothing. This message has also been posted on the Forum itself.--Jamino 17:57, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well at first glance, that would suggest it actually fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> which states that <i>Content that is distributed by independent online sites will almost certainly satisfy the first criterion. However, this criterion ensures that our coverage of such content will be complete regardless. For example, Ricky Gervais had a podcast distributed by The Guardian. Such distributions should be nontrivial. Although GeoCities and <b>Newgrounds</b> are exceedingly well known, hosting content on them is trivial.</i> --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 17:44, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>it's not, but Wikipedia has over a million articles there are ALWAYS articles here that should not be. The fact that those are here and maybe should not be, just means that nobody has gone around to AFDing them. However now you have raised their profile to the community, I'm sure that if they are not notable they will be AFD'd shortly (which is generally the result of someone saying "hey what about article X!"). I'll be checking them out myself when I get a moment later.--<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 19:56, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Vanity? Where? Is the Salad Fingers Wiki also up for deletion due to vanity? How about the World of Warcraft Wiki? The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Wiki? Any Wiki describing another product of entertainment? No. This Wiki simply disects another product of entertainment, one known as Team Lorio. At NO point during the Wiki does it claim that Team Lorio is the best, or better than anyone else, nor does it even claim to be GOOD beyond what results have provided proven facts to subtantiate. Also, if you're going to post in this debate then at LEAST provide a comment that supports what you're saying, rather than just insulting something that need not be insulted. Wiki-Management, I challenge you to find any form of vanity in this article. If it exists, which it does not, I will remove it. I wrote this article, and great care was taken to ensure all guidelines were met. Therefore is there ARE any breaches then this article should be flagged for ALTERATION, not deletion. That is absurd.

<dd>First of all: the Attention sign is what we post whenever it appears that someone outside of Wikipedia is attempting to sway the vote. In that case, we remind them that what counts is the strength of your arguments, not the number of bodies you can muster. Wikipedia, after all, is not a democracy. Second, you're getting too worked up over this; please review <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">what we have to say about civility on Wikipedia</a> before you post next. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 04:29, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I know what the sign is ment for, I can read. But in that case: why does the sign specifically say <i>If you came here because you were told so at the <b>teamlorio.net forums</b></i>? This is just an insult to teamlorio.net's integrity. They are not telling anybody to come here, so to keep this discussion as fair/clean as possible I would strongly suggest to remove that particular reference. And second, I already reminded Charlesknight to stop posting a new policy every time to make your story plausible.

<li>Added references. They're weak, in the sense that they're relatively off-hand mentions of the theory in each case, the books and article are not really devoted to this theory per se - but, again, I think they're enough, given that our article is relatively critical of the theory. If you don't want to search for the two books, which may be a bit obscure, you can search for "La Merica" using Amazon "search in this book" and Google Books.

It's just a theory, a fairly hokey theory, and our article says as much - I haven't checked the edit history in detail, but wouldn't be surprised if you wrote much of the criticism section, if so, good work. It's not controversial mainly because no one takes it seriously. But it's also an existing theory that is referred to; therefore, as the world's largest encyclopedia, we really should say <i>something</i> on it. We're by no means endorsing the theory, we're just saying it exists. The references clearly say there is such a theory. If you want to delete individual unreferenced items from the article, fine, but the article as a whole should stay.

<li>Given that none of the references are used to cite any given statement, I could delete the entire article line by line, and we would be left with a blank page.

<li>OK... you obviously care enough about this article for it to be kept for now... so the nomination is <b>withdrawn</b> for the moment ... however, to keep me from re-nominating it, you are going to have to put a lot of work into the article.

<p>I suggest simply changing the word from Theory to hypothesis till there is enough citable evidence to support it. The word hypothesis supports this much better and can resolve this whole argument. I do have to say that there are places asking for citations that do not need it. I would ask the editor, and challenger to go back and rethink if you want regurgitation from some supposedly qualified article, or if you want the evidence to be substantial and still follow the hypothesis base.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have no problem with changing "theory" to "hypothesis", but that does not solve the problem with this article. The primary problem has to do with the fact that the article does not meet the standards set out in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. The article does not even say <i>who</i> came up with this theory or hypothesis. Since starting this AfD, several editors have posted to the talk page, expressing a desire to keep the article, but none of them have been able to supply even a basic citation to verify the statements. Note that I am not looking for "proof" that the claims made in the article are "true"... I am talking about simply providing citations to show that the claims even <i>exist</i>! In fact, no one seems able provide a citation to show that the Title term "La Merika" exists! Who coined this term? Without a citation, even the TITLE of the article becomes OR. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 14:26, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think it is extremely important to KEEP Londeix.

<p>I'd just like to say that I considered this entry's previous content, a listing of all of all known professional wrestling promotions around the world, an unprecedented and indispensible resource for English-speaking wrestling fans everywhere (which, of course, is the very type of content a user-modified encyclopedia should strive to provide).

Keep arguments included <i>it is important to sikhs to learn about what their holy text tells them. It is important to convey this message to sikhs</i> (sorry, no, Wikipedia exists to convey information to a general audience, not doctrine to a given faith). We have an article on Sikh diet, which is where what verifiably neutral information on this topic should go. We also have this article on the Shabads from Guru Granth Sahib (SGGB) on meat. Sikh diet is hard to understand, poorly formatted and so on, which does not help, and I am afraid I do not understand either article well enough to perform the merge. Those who do, evidently have no interest in doing so.</p>
<p>Above all, this article, "SGGS on meat", is both an apparent POV fork of Sikh diet, which says that meat is acceptable to some Sikhs, a position disputed by this article by reference to the Guru, and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, a mixture of polemic and quotes from the original source, including in non-Western scripts referenced in each case to the primary source.

<li><b>Comment</b> Guy, I am sorry but I disagee with you. What you say here is not correct. SGGS on meat as the name suggests is an article dealing with what the SGGS says about meat. As I am sure you know, <a href="../../../s/g/g/SGGS_affa.html" title="SGGS">SGGS</a> is short for <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Guru_Granth_Sahib_838c.html" title="Sri Guru Granth Sahib">Sri Guru Granth Sahib</a> which is the living <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru.html" title="Guru">Guru</a> or spiritual teacher of the Sikh, who are the fifth largest organised religion in the world. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. Sikh diet is an article which is about what the Sikhs are allowed to eat or not eat and other dietary habits of the Sikhs. The articles do overlap but are concerned with separate and independent issue relating to <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikhism.html" title="Sikhism">Sikhism</a>. This is no OR as it is an article based on quotes (facts) from the Sikh holy book as are the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parables_of_Jesus_f336.html" title="Parables of Jesus">Parables of Jesus</a> for Christanity, especially ones listed here and also <a href="../../../f/a/b/Fables_and_Parables_7d27.html" title="Fables and Parables">Fables and Parables</a>. Let's be fair and non-discriminatory in this matter. I believe that we need to revert to my last edit of this article - see my comments below. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a> 04:00, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>As a Sikh and interested party oin Sikhism I would have agree about deleting this, namely because the biased nature of the article. The meat issue is dealt elsewhere within the wiki and Sikhism, there is no need to include a specific one for SGGS and Meat. If this is to be allowed then current ammendments that are being undertaken by our memebers at sikh-history.com should be allowed. --<a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikh-history_70b0.html" title="User:Sikh-history">Sikh-history</a> 15:42, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is an important issue for Sikhs and for others. To understand dietary habits of Sikhs (and of other religions) is of significance to life and the importance of diet cannot be denied. Diet plays an key role in the lives of all and it is a matter relating to an important religion of the world. Don't you think that the world would be interested to know about the dietary habits of the Sikhs? We have similar dietary articles for <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_vegetarianism.html" title="Christian vegetarianism">Christianty</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetarianism_in_Buddhism_e2e0.html" title="Vegetarianism in Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, etc. and so I think if this article is deleted then in fairness those others should also be deleted.<br />
The article has been vandalised by <a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikh-history_70b0.html" title="User:Sikh-history">User:sikh-history</a> who has a set agenda - See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Sikh-history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Sikh-history" rel="nofollow">his contributions</a> which all relate to <b>only one-set-POV</b>. He has since 23 September been changing various articles to his POV in relation to diet and Sikhism. He is not like a normal user adding to a range of articles in the best interest of Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b>: The above comment says that "Evolution is a full, 100% functional game with 3100 active members. Like Gmail, Evolution is undergoing frequent updates &amp; improvements that necessitate the beta term." This is not the case, as shown by this game's bugs, down time, and the fact that most of the 3100 active players are inactive. I also think it's unfair to compare Evolution to Gmail because Evolution's been a beta since 2001 if I'm not mistaken, and very little has changed since that time. The chances for Evolution to be fully completed are slim to none.

<li><b>Comment</b> what basis in fact do you have for these statements 71.104.31.159? 5 major code revisions, major new features added in each, plus bug fixes all throughout. Downtime is a reflection on the hosting company and has nothing to do with the article - also no basis in fact as the only downtime experienced in recent memory has been due to scheduled maintenance on the servers. Due to the game's structure the 3100 active members are active since July 19th 2006 when the round started. All inactive accounts were removed at the end of the last round. 15:43, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is the logic I have come to hate about Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chron_X_17c2.html" title="Chron X">Chron X</a> was a similar sized game, now pretty much defunct - gets a page, <a href="../../../e/v/e/Eve_Online_1f60.html" title="Eve Online">Eve Online</a>, not really notable, small community for the age of the game and the advertising that was put behind it - also insignifcant compared to <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> or <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> - gets a page. A small company with no funding, based around a community of players, steadily growing over 5 years (most games begin declining after their 3-4th year peak), can't get a page because someone thinks creating something like this community "is not notible". Creating a web based game of this complexity and depth is notible in itself - to keep it running and consistantly grow the community for 5 years with no money is notible in intself. Wikipedia is becoming too elitist and who decides, and at what point is a community based around a game created by a 15 year old is notable enough? 5,000? 25,000? 100,000? 500,000? I'm sorry these comments are not soley based on impartial facts, and I agree there's more work to be done on the article, but it makes me angry both when the above occurs and when I took another article, changed it to fit Evo, and expanded on it signifcanly - yet it's not good enough for Wiki. All because people who may no nothing about programming or games, and who have most likely never taken a look at it, deem it "unnotible" or "crystal ball gazing". Again, I'm sorry, but I feel strongly about this. The amazing thing is, I didn't even know about the game until it was featured on Digg a week or so ago and I can see the importance of it after playing it for a short time.

<li><b>Comment</b> There are no reliable, independent sources for Evolution. <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digg.html" title="Digg">Digg</a> doesn't count, because the content is user-supplied, and the guy who wrote that article clearly was connected to the MMOG. The Evo Wiki obviously isn't independet. While I didn't check EVE online, I could easily find an external review to add to the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chron_X_17c2.html" title="Chron X">Chron X</a> article (and if I hadn't been able, I would have nominated Chron X for deletion, too). If something similar could be found for Evolution, I might change my opinion - but right now, the article fails too many of Wikipedia's guidelines - see <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. --<a href="../../../h/u/o/User%7EHuon_18c0.html" title="User:Huon">Huon</a> 13:10, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Ok, taking a step back, I can understand it doesn't have sources to cite other than random blogs that mention it such as <a href="http://www.robocrow.com/?q=node/2" class="external free" title="http://www.robocrow.com/?q=node/2" rel="nofollow">http://www.robocrow.com/?q=node/2</a> however traditional media would never pick up a story about a non-commercial game unless it was a blowup sucess. I suppose I have an issue with the wiki rules more than the fact this article is up for deletion. The rules seem to only want to document information that has money behind it in one form or another.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The reference was to the fact that Planetarion wins awards, making it notable, whereas Evolution has won nothing, and has not one single claim to notability. 'something that a 15 year old created that is followed by thousands around the world.' (your words) is the best description you can come up with, and your this articles biggest (and only) defender. Thousands across the world equates to less than .001% of the total net population, and even less of the worlds population.

<li><b>Keep</b> - <a href="../../../5/-/m/5-Methylindole_25a6.html" title="5-Methylindole">5-Methylindole</a> is notable as an interesting system under UV photoexcitation experiments.

These compounds have novel sorts of conical intersections and nonlinearities from an experimental and theoretical perspective. I won't go into the technicalities here, since it's just an AfD. There is nothing to worry about a host of compounds being added to Wikipedia under this blanket definition of "interesting" - there is only a limited class of compounds under consideration at the moment. One would not include something like "2,3-dichloro-cis-butenol" - ab initio methods for calculating the UV spectra for that system would simply be intractable in the current state of affairs. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 15:40, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Although I am unfamiliar with these particular compounds they do not seem arbitrary. It seems that a couple people here have references to be added to teh article. Remember AfD is a time to improve the article if possible and if you bother to research it add what you know and the reference.

<p>Jayron, you are obviously not a mathematician. IMO is not about doing problems, it is a place where mathematicians gather to prove theorems and come up with new ideas. Speed has nothing to do with it.

If he is notable as a mathematician, the article needs to furnish proof of such by citing references to his work in a peer-reviewed journal or some equivalent. What work has he done that merits that level of notability? If he is <i>notable</i> as a competitor, then where is the proof required under this guideline:</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
"Third party verification from a reliable source outside of publications by sponsors of the sport or activity should be provided to demonstrate that the subject is widely recognized as performing at the highest level."<br />
If he is a competitor, we need to see evidence that he is <i>widely recognized</i>. I will warrant that merely finding third party sources that state such would be fine. Are there articles by outside sources that review his performance at IMO? Are there articles out there that talk about his performance as a math competitor? If so, cite them. If not, his notability is unverifiable by wikipedia standards.<br />
Under BOTH claims, (that he is a notable mathematician, OR that he is a notable competitor), this subject fails the litmus test. If the article can be proved with valid citations to verify his notability as a mathematician OR his notability as a competitor, I will change my vote. However, until and unless that happens, this guy still doesn't pass the notability litmus test. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 01:49, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

And let's get real--this kid is still in <i>high school</i> and he is already taking <i>graduate</i> level math courses at a university! The claim that he is an "up and comer" is obviously justified. The article does need to be corrected that "Arnav Tripathy is considered by many to be ... one of the top mathematicians in the world." Obviously, that is not correct.

<p>Not totally true. You do not have to be a student to make IMO, and 1/12 is not a definite number. Also, you ignore how hard it is to even make the US team for IMO. 6 out of over 200,000 initial AMC applicants make the IMO. That's definitely noteworthy in itself.</p>

<li><b>Reply</b>. In response to <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickReinckens_8aaa.html" title="User:RickReinckens">RickReinckens</a>; the fact that he is in high school and taking graduate level math classes is irrelevent to his worthiness to be included in Wikipedia. Being a really smart student is not a valid guideline for notability under <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>, nor are any of the claims that MIGHT make him notable are verifiable under the <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a> policy. Look, I am sure that this guy is a really nice kid, and I am positive he is very smart, but if that was all that it took to get an article, the Wikipedia servers could not hold all of the articles that would appear here. Articles, ESPECIALLY biographical articles, need to go through a vetting process that assures that the persons included therein are have really done things worthy of noting. This guy has not. The threshold question for notability is: Do sizeable groups of people <i>know</i> this person who has not <i>met</i> this person. No one defending this article has produced any proof that that is the case. Lets look at the TWO claims that are made for his inclusion: 1) He is a mathematician. If so, cite his published work as a mathematician. If he has not published any work, than he is not a <b>verifiably notable</b> mathematician. 2) He is a competitor of the highest level, on par with other competitors in such endeavors as sport. If so, cite a third party source that has noted and reviewed his performance at said competitions. A local newspaper article merely noting his participation and placement doesn't really qualify. Have math competition journalists noted his performance? Did math competition analysts review the problems he worked, or the theorems he proved or whatever? Was he featured in an article on the top Math Competitiors? Has his math competition techniques been included in the popular math competition press? If <i>any</i> of these things are true, then all you have to do is cite the sources so everyone can see his notability. ALL of the things that people have said so far about this subject may be TRUE, but if they are not <b>verfiably notable</b>, then he does not warrent inclusion in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 05:16, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Jayron, I think at this point the only plausible reason for inclusion is reason #2. If you visit the Art of Problem Solving forum, the largest forum of professional and amatuer mathematicians, you will not find a single person who doesn't recognize his name. As for what you asked, there are no real math competition journalists or analysts. His techniques have been featured on AoPS, and the top two mathematical societies in America have recogzied him in their newsletters and journals (I added sources just now). This is a huge thing, because if you read the rest of the articles in these newsletters, you will see on what a great scale Tripathy's acheivement was.</p>
<p>Please consider changing your votes after viewing the additional sources I added. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysmartmouth_fee6.html" title="User:Mysmartmouth">Mysmartmouth</a> 02:25, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Being won over slowly, but still delete</b>. OK. I checked out the two new websites. They mention Arnav Tripathy's participation in the event, and even his winning a gold medal. But they are little more than press releases. The MAA site doesn't even mention him beyond the picture caption, and the AMS site mentions him in a single sentantce. Mere paricipation, and even placement, in such a competition does not prove that mathematicians find this guy noteworthy. Look, on the web you can find my participation in the National Academic Quiz Tournaments national championship for 1997. That doesn't prove anything about my skill in acedemic compeitions. Could you please provide a link to the AoPS forum, especially threads relevent to Tripathy's performance and skills as a problem solver <i>vis a vis</i> his noteworthiness as a math competitor of the highest degree? If indeed the discussions that you say are going on are <i>indeed</i> going on there, that would provide a relevent to Tripathy's notability. THAT would show that he is thought of as a top mathematics competitor by people who follow the field. I will concede that THAT is what is needed to prove his worthiness. Provide the link, and if it says what you say it does, I will change my vote. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 20:45, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I don't want to make too strong of an appeal to authority but I am a mathematician and frankly most of our community doesn't pay much attention to the never-ending flow of <a href="../../../w/u/n/Wunderkind.html" title="Wunderkind">wunderkinds</a>. Yes the kid is probably good, probably even excellent and has a decent chance of having a nice career in a notoriously difficult field. But let's face it, the article is not and cannot currently be built around reliable independent third party sources. For instance, the first sentence is:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>Arnav Tripathy is considered by many to be the best high school mathematician in the United States, and one of the top mathematicians in the world.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Now, come on, let's please stop the nonsense. And the sentences</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The American Mathematics Society, the largest organization of professional mathematicians in the US, as well as the Mathematical Association of America, recognized Tripathy in their newsletters.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>and</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Also, Triapthy was honored by Congress for his success in the 2006 US Physics Team</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>are laughably misleading. The AMS and MAA don't <i>recognize</i> Tripathy, they just report (in passing) that he is one of the contest winners. Good for him and I wish him all the best. Congress did not <i>honor Tripathy</i>. A few well-intentioned congressmen honored the members of the US Physics team. As for the argument that he's just as notable as an athlete competing at a high level, I'm sorry but I fail to be convinced by that argument because, like it or not, even talented mathematicians do not get the same kind of exposure as athletes. Quick, name <i>one</i> winner of a math olympiad of the past 20 years? The debate should not be over the value of his achievements (which is undeniable) but on the possibility of making this an article of encyclopedic value based on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Sure it's as hard, if not harder, to win the math olympiad than to be a college quarterback but it's also very hard to raise five kids when you're on welfare and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is not about how impressive the person's achievements have been. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 18:33, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Reply</b> Thank you Pascal for helping me to make my point. The trouble with this subject is that it is, by its very nature, hard to verify notability. Wikipedia has a far greater capacity for articles than a print encyclopedia, but it DOES have certain standards of <i>notability</i> and <i>verifiability</i>. I am trying to give the supporters of this article the opportuniy to prove that. So far, all attempts have been seriously lacking. The things I mentioned about the "math competitions press" were half tongue-and-cheek. Is the subject worthy of an encyclopedia article? Who knows, maybe he is... Can you prove his worthiness, even if he was so? For this guy probably not. The standards set in place for inclusion in wikipedia are <i><b>verifiability</b></i> and <i><b>notability</b></i>. Even if he is notable among mathematicians, that notability is not verifiable. Again, I point to the WikiPedia <i>policy</i> that the <i><b>suporters</b></i> of this article have cited. It actually works against the arguement they are trying to win:</li>

<p>The closest we have is third party verification of participation and placement; and even that is weak. So far we have no proof of the <b>widely recognized</b> threshold. A few dozen of his buddies at high school know about him. A few hundred people he faced at his math competitions have heard of him. I would figure "wide recognition" ought to include more people than could fill a gymnasium... I am not making light of his accomplishments. I have <i>personally</i> been involved in accademic competitions for a large part of my life. That doesn't mean that I think that the best accademic competitors need to be part of wikipedia. The nature of the competition itself lacks notability. Is that fair? Probably not, but we don't live in a society that places that rewards academic success or brain-power in that way. Wikipedia is <i><b>not</b></i> the place to change that. Wikipedia should only reflect the values of the society it reports on. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 23:37, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Even though I feel that the arguments in favour of deletion have been much more rational and in line with the existing guidelines and policies, we might end up keeping this article as a no-consensus. If that is indeed the case, the article needs a definite rewrite to be neutral and verifiable. In particular the quotes I mentioned earlier have to go as they are clearly misleading and not based on fact. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 13:05, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You can browse around, but I sugggest creating a topic such as "Have you heard of Arnav Tripathy" or "Give your opinions on Arnav Tripathy" or anything of that nature, and gauge the responses. Obviously, I've never seen something like that used in an AfD, but the results will show you what percentage of the top math students and mathematicians know Tripathy. EDIT: If you scroll down that page and look at Pakman2012's post, it shows an example of the reverance shown toward Tripathy (though by itself it is an admittedly weak example). However, I'm sure if you look around you can find more posts like this. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysmartmouth_fee6.html" title="User:Mysmartmouth">Mysmartmouth</a> 01:09, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>1) the AfD process is expressly NOT democratic. The adminsitrators use these discussions to inform their decisions, but winning a mere tally of up/down votes is not enough to keep or delete an article.<br /></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>2: I checked out the forum. If, as you say, I must ask around to find out about Mr. Tripathy's skill, then his skill isn;t notable to prompt discussion in absentia of my hunting around for what people think of him. Merely some guy mentioning that he'd like to compete on his team isn't enough to verify notability.<br /></dd>
<dd>3: External sources implies that people OUTSIDE of the competitions have noted his performance WITHIN the competition. Even the discussion on the forum you gave seem to consist entirely of people who are themselves competitiors. By analogy, any forum where people play a game and talk about other competitors would be enough to meet the threshhold for inclusion in Wikipedia. Certain competitions (soccer, tennis, auto racing, and even poker, and some could claim spelling bees) have fans OUTSIDE of the competition. There are people who watch and know certain, say, poker players who they have never met and indeed, the <i>fans</i> of poker may not even <i>play</i> poker at a competitive level. There are poker tournament journalists, and a poker press that reports on poker players performance, skills, etc. Thus a poker player DOES make the notability threshhold merely for being a good professional poker player. Math competitions do NOT make this threshold. The competition ITSELF may be notable, in that the IMO might, as a competition, make press. However, since no one outside of the competition are really fans of the competition, the participants of the competition themselves are not <b>verifiably notable</b> in the sense that there is widespread press coverage of their performance. Is this fair? Probably not. But, society has determined that poker players are notable and math competition players are not. The utter lack of coverage of these competitors proves that. Wikipedia is built on <b>societal concensus</b>. This consensus (as determined by society as a whole) is that kids who compete in math competitions aren't that notable. Thus they aren't notable on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 03:16, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comments</b> First, I'd like to make it clear that what I said about rewriting is not simply "reasonnable" as Mysmartmouth put it but it is a necessity per policy. Furthermore my personnal opinion is still that this guy does not meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I did a search for Arnav Tripathy on the forum and what I come up with are trivial references to his name. In fact, he's one of the users so people often call him by his real name. The whole idea of establishing his notability through the fact that people on that forum know him is like saying that <a href="../../../c/a/n/Can%27t_sleep_clown_will_eat_me.html" title="Can't sleep clown will eat me">Can't sleep clown will eat me</a> should be an article not on the Simpson's joke but on the Wikipedia admin <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECan%27t_sleep%2C_clown_will_eat_me_7058.html" title="User:Can't sleep, clown will eat me">Can't sleep, clown will eat me</a> (<a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECan%27t_sleep%2C_clown_will_eat_me_00a3.html" title="User talk:Can't sleep, clown will eat me">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Can%27t_sleep%2C_clown_will_eat_me_ffd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Can't sleep, clown will eat me">contribs</a>).

<li><b>Strongest Possible Delete</b>. I rarely insert adjectives in front of "keep" or "delete", but I feel I should this time. Arnav Tripathy may be an absolute genius, but he is <i>not</i> notable under Wikipedia guidelines. The article makes numerous unjustifiable statement from the very sentence: "Arnav Tripathy is considered by many to be the best high school mathematician in the United States, and one of the top mathematicians in the world". Well who are these many people? Where is the source for this information. To make such a statement, one must have quite a great deal to back it up. If one removes such statements, the article becomes nothing more than a collection of math competitions that Tripathy has won and lost. Math competitions are very well and good, but winning a few does not make you notable. If Tripathy had some sort of presence in the national media, he might well be notable, but winning math competitions is not an inherently notable feat. As for his participation in the International Math Olympics, Tripathy didn't even finish in the top 10. If indeed he is "one of the top mathematicians" in the world, why couldn't he manage to even place in the top 10 at a competition essentially designed for high school students? If Tripathy is notable, I would venture to say that the star players of every US state championship football team are notable. I could go create 1000 such articles now, but that would be a gross violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. In any case, if Tripathy is notable so are about ten or twenty million other people.

<p>for emulators, I think looking at multiple emulation review sites, and hobby development (such as "demos") sites gives a good indication of how an emulator "ranks". review sites have people who try emulators, and given them a rating, and a comment/opinion. sometimes they also have user voting. another thing is the author of KiGB, one of the most accurate and known GB emus, has a selection of what he considers "best other emus" on his site, for benchmarking purposes: <a href="http://kigb.emuunlim.com/compatibility.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://kigb.emuunlim.com/compatibility.htm" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>. these things show there's a few GB emulators which are "in the race", or most popular, "best", etc. i think such things count as <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer review</a>, according to wikipedia's guidelines. a rough selection, in no particular order, is: no$gmb, bgb, visualboy advance, kiGB. I think inclusion in linux distribution is a less good thing for emulators because it biases towards GPL emulators, and linux distros have to look at "everything", not just emulators. while i listed a number of review sites considering bgb to be the best, on BGB's talk page, it seems that's irrelevant, and bgb (54000 google hits for bgb gameboy) is worth less than eXboy (84 google hits for exboy gameboy), and wzonka-lad (1110 google hits for wzonka-lad gameboy)Bewareircd 13:18, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>some people from a gameboy hobby community (#gameboy on efnet): dox: is a coder of demos, tools, and an emulator (hash). bgb is his emulator/debugger of choice. site: <a href="http://www.slanina.pl/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.slanina.pl/" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>. lord nightmare, involved in gnuboy. has done research on sound chips including the GB's. uses bgb. &lt;LordNLptp&gt; the fans and authors of a select few, typically bad, emulators tend to be the ones which get put on wikipedia. &lt;LordNLptp&gt; gnuboy is pretty much dead, the main site is down and i have probably the last remaining copy of the 1.0.4pre sourcecode &lt;dox&gt; bgb came a bit too late.. when gameboy was already dead &lt;dox&gt; ppl used no$for dev. but it was a bit buggy. martin knew about bugs and problems, but never fixed them....

So I'd say the author is notable. The problem with this article is that it's longer than the article about the book <a href="../../../r/o/z/Roza_Mira_018f.html" title="Roza Mira">Roza Mira</a>. This content should be merged into that article. There is much longer article about the book on the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A0%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B0_%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B0" class="external text" title="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A0%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B0_%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B0" rel="nofollow">Russian wikipedia</a>. The book was supressed and not translated until 1997, so evaluating its notability in English is sort of dicey. It would take me some time with the dictionary to verify that the Igva article isn't nonsense using the Russian one. (Might be good practice though.)

<li>Hello,</li>

<p>I am Arthur. I have started the article myself. I agree to the anon. before me and i would like also to mention that Cordless Larry has immediately tagged the article as "non sense" just as it was posted. He didn't then mention anything about google searches. It seems that he is not neutral in his essential desire to abolish this entry as soon as possible. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_B_c853.html" title="User:Arthur B">Arthur_B</a> 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I nominated it for speedy deletion, and now I'm nominating it under AfD as the previous nomination was contested. I don't have any bias against this kind of article - I'm going by is the fact that a Google search returns very few results, and the high number of red links in the article. I haven't edited or nominated for deletion an article on this topic before. I was just patrolling new articles for notability, and came across this. I'm not sure how the Paris Hilton/Aldous Huxley comparison is relevant. Paris Hilton may well return more results that Huxley, but they both return many results, whereas there is only one for "Minkowski Challenge", so I hardly think the comparison is valid. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECordless_Larry_72b4.html" title="User:Cordless Larry">Cordless Larry</a> 17:16, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As far as I know, editing without an account was allowed back then. The IP is mine, anyway.

<li>I don't really think that has anything to do with the page being deleted. It is still a very large game and if other online games are included then there is no reason for Dark Throne to be removed. It would be one thing if the Dark Throne page was just advertising the game, but it isn't, it explains the game and how it works.</li>
<li>Look at all the games of this type on Wikipedia. Not all of them are as big as runescape or Dark Throne, yet they're still on Wikipedia. If you remove Dark Throne all of them should be removed too.

<li>Oh OK, and while you're at it might as well get rid of all other pages on betas since that is your main reason for wanting to delete the Dark Throne page.

<li>I agree. If the only logical reason you can come up with is that it is in Beta testing, then there are probably 1000 articles that should be deleted. Dark Throne is a very popular MMORPG. And if it is proof you need that there are 300,000+ players, then i submit this pice as evidence. The below information is on the lowest ranking account in the game: "sirmendez is a level 1 Human Assassin Overall Rank: 342,689." (i did delete the extra space) This proves thus that are are over 342,000 players in this game, way more than a lot of text-based MMORPG's, and as mentioned above, way more than many of those that are directly competing with Dark Throne, for players, ads, and more. Also, one question comes to mind reading these arguements. If the best two reasons that you can come up with are that the game is in Beta testing, and that the game when Googled can only come up with a handful of sites, then why do you even argue? <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Phoenix2009 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Phoenix2009_2bbd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Phoenix2009">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<dd>Because it fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, something you've chosen to ignore. The article (in terms of describing the game not the band) has existed for 18 months yet not a shred of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> has been established. The amount of subscribers is completely irrelevant, even more so as Dark Throne is free to play - if it didn't have a lot of subscribers it would have been AFD'd on sight long ago. A lot of the beta products mentioned above are some of the most widely reported on software packages in the world, which is why they're different. Being in beta stage is not the issue, being in beta stage whilst using Wikipedia as an advertising medium is. I would be delighted to change my vote if someone somewhere could come up with some verified information on this game, but so far there's been nothing but fluff about Dark Throne somehow being able to dodge WP's rules 'just cos', which is no reason for keeping the article. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 23:55, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Outwar , Kings of Chaos , and Earth 2025 are all similar games to Dark Throne, except for the fact that Dark Throne has a larger userbase than all of them combined. Unless planning to delete the other three, that are Dark Throne competitors, do not delete this entry. Wikipedia is not supposed to be biased. Don't compare it to other games like WoW or Runescape. Compare it against games and listings for similar games on wikipedia. All three games above are listed with no notice of deletion. Just because the "Beta" tag is on Dark Throne, doesn't mean its less finished or important than the others.

<li>Earth 2025 has been awarded a Webby award, meaning it's established notability. Kings of Chaos is tagged as not citing its references, it may be sat on at a later date. Outwar doesn't appear to establish notability and could also find itself in trouble.

<li>If the user base is so large, why isn't that information in the article? Can it be verified? Where are the cites to write-ups about the game from other sources? Outwar and Kings of Chaos at least have been running for years. To me, however, they're much more notorious for the amount of spam their users generate in looking for inbound links. Remember: Wikipedia is not a primary source. This game has to establish notability in the world to get an article here. I wish you luck with that. If it happens, we will gladly have an article about it. —<a href="../../../w/r/a/User%7EWrathchild-K_cab0.html" title="User:Wrathchild-K">Wrathchild</a> <sup><small>(<a href="../../../w/r/a/User_talk%7EWrathchild-K_6125.html" title="User talk:Wrathchild-K">talk</a>)</small></sup> 12:10, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Why should Beta be a notation of Wikipedia worthiness? There are many products and websites that are in Beta but don't publically announce it.

<li><b>Delete</b>, no notability established, game still in beta stage yet no sign of any non-trivial coverage. Google search for "Dark Throne" and Lazarus produces nothing but the main site, some links from free online game sites (you know, the advert funnels) and of course the Wikipedia entry. I can understand fans of the game wanting this article here, but until some notability is established it is just advertising. Regardless, hope Lazarus make a go of it. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 08:56, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Alexa rank of 4,353 (very good), but WP appears as one of the first links and after trawling through several pages I could only find links from blogs, forums, message-boards etc. Dark Throne players have waged a very successful advertising campaign for this game, something Lazarus is probably grateful for, but that's all the WP article seems to be.

Now in the case of a lot of these webgames etc. we aren't talking about the designer/publisher providing the information - it's the game's fans. The result however is fairly similar - articles being used as adverts, a lot of noise and bluster without any hint of WP's policies and guidelines being satisfied etc. Please look at the nature of DT (it's a game laid atop a system of using the gamers as advertisers to draw in traffic) when considering the Alexa rank and <i>then</i> take a look at the total lack of citations in both the article and this AFD.

<dd>Thanks. I had a look on that site but couldn't find a direct reference to the game (I searched Dark Throne in the box but it didn't come back with a Dark Throne piece, so perhaps the link-to was from an article within the website posted by a user? I'm not sure even if it did that mmreviews.com would be considered non-trivial. Ideally a review from a good MMOG site would be a good start. I'll have another go with wholinkstome at some point to see if I can find one.

<li><b>Keep</b> Agreed about <b>keeping</b> this page. As already mentioned, the game has over 300,000 members actively playing, and over a million users who have played at some point before. It IS popular, and just because it's in a testing stage does not qualify the article for deletion. The article is very-well written, and the full, nontesting version of the game comes out "soon".

Much information on the game is missing (such as the actual meaning of the powered-up versions of soldiers, how many citizens are created through houses etc.), yet there's plenty of needless details about the website and the IRC channel, a plug about charitable donations without any evidence at all etc. etc. That document has not been shown to be 'published' by the University, just that the writer is a student or affiliate of that university. That the writer of the case study chose Dark Throne most likely because they are a Dark Throne player - this is not some stamp of notability but a 'cushy number', nice for them to be able to write about one of their hobbies, no use as notability. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 21:59, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Quite the opposite, the reasons for this AFD are stated by the contributor who listed, my reasons for supporting the deletion have already been stated (repeatedly). Clean-up is a seperate issue. If the article is kept, then clean-up can and will be happening anyway - I've already started. That doesn't mean that the article passes <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, that anything resembling notability is presented in the article or has been presented here on the AFD or that I've changed my vote.

<dd>You are not making sense. What 'vote' are you talking about? "this is not a vote". Dark Throne has been played by millions of people, ran a charity to help sick kids, had an article written about it by a college, is bigger than most other games of its type on Wikipedia, and you think it should be deleted? I don't understand what more you need. You ask for something, we show it to you, you say it's not good enough. If the Dark Throne pages is deleted then there are hundreds (if not thousands) of other pages that would need to be deleted as well. The only thing that needs to happen is the page be changed a little to include information about its size, the charity, and more explaining about the game with less out-of-game information (IRC channel info and some other things) --<a href="../../../j/o/w/User%7EJowan2005_8d52.html" title="User:Jowan2005">Jowan2005</a>

<li>sigh*. Reading again I can see why you think I'm being needlessly obstinate, let's go through this again.. That document has not been published by a university, it was found on a forum site. It was written by a student, an undergraduate. It's research. It's research that has not been given a critical review by a university or journal or anything else, it is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, IE speculation. It is not profesionally published, it is trivial and offers a POV about the subject that hasn't been stamped by what would be considered an objective organization. Adding content from that, no matter how much time the writer put into creating it, is no different than writing "according to Stanley, my elderly neighbour...". It isn't usable, it's no good, it's not what we've been looking for, it isn't even directly about the subject, it uses DT as a case study to evaluate something else. This isn't about "your efforts aren't good enough!", this is about all the pages given thus far not being up to the standards laid down in the guidelines and policies, which are quoted about this discussion like confetti. I feel more than a natch deflated that after all this discussion you seem to feel that I'm just trying to get in the way for the hell of it. All I have ever been interested in is that DT's article can stand up to the same scrutiny that every article on the WP has to or will have to in the fullness of time - 18 months is plenty long enough to find something. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 14:29, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

The institution is listed right on the document, and I could easily type Southeastern Oklahoma State University. I didn't think the university I was referring to was in question. Anyone reading it knows that I was referring to the University listed on the article, so please do not be condescending. I am not giving you a hard time, and I am not causing problems. I am following your steps to try to keep this article up. I asked another question which was still not answered: "Additionally is there anything we can get Lazarus Software to verify, so this page can be kept?"

<dd>Regarding the document, it hasn't been shown that it is published in a journal etc. and thus regarded as something which can be regarded as non-trivial. It is a case-study, part of a student's workload, rather than something that has been held up to scrutiny in terms of being published. As it stands it is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> which is completely unusable. To put it another way, if I lifted parts of that document and inserted them into the article, particularly about the DT community's belief and acceptance that widespread cheating happens, I would be challenged. Contributors to that article would ask exactly where the information came from and (rightly) rip it to bits and label it as an attempt, by me, to attack Lazarus and to show DT in a dim light. Due to Lazarus trying to pull in the punters with promises of 'prizes', such accusations (if shown to be substantiated) could be extremely damaging. Now whilst it is quite fair that such things shouldn't be used to push an agenda, by the same token they are not usable to establish notability.</dd>

<dd>With Lazarus providing info, there lies the rub. We're a tertiary source, taking our information from secondary sources. General information about the game could (and IMO should) be able to come from the primary source, but the whole point of establishing notability is that 'non-trivial' sources have provided information/opinion about the subject from which we can make an article. I have been looking around some more, trying to find a site which says something, anything about the game rather than just providing a link. Up till now, all MMOG sites I've found via Alexa or the site provided by Jowan have been nothing more than message board posts pointing to the site (of no encyclopedic content whatsoever) or simple links from MMOG funnel-sites, perhaps with a few lines of text giving viewers an idea of what DT actually is (again, non-notable source which doesn't even offer any context regarding the game's qualities or attempt to offer anything other than another gateway for their users). So far I found one site which actually talked about the game here: <a href="http://www.online-rpg-game.com/games/darkthrone.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.online-rpg-game.com/games/darkthrone.php" rel="nofollow">[63]</a> Notice the asterisk at the bottom of the page - the first glimmer of hope I get and it's taking info from WP -.- .</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I haven't stopped looking for info on this game yet and I'm just as happy to argue for the article being kept if some decent info can be found, but I must admit I'm struggling to find any mention of DT at all on many MMOG funnel-sites, which is even more surprising considering DT's high Alexa rank. I'm left with the distinct impression that Lazarus have done extremely well out of WP, but I'm curious as to why it's taken over a year and a half for this article to even come under the microscope. This issue with MMOGs/Flashgames etc. and notability should be hammered out somewhere, it's a hell of a lot larger than we can discuss here. Oh, dang nearly forgot, does anyone have a link to info about the charity donations Lazarus drummed up/donated? I don't think there was one but such info deserves to be on their article. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 07:46, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Taken from the source of the paper on DT:</li>
</ul>
<p>"We are a website community devoted to literature, Role-playing, and general chat amongst a lively community of friendly people. All are welcome at Amber: writers, gamers, quiz freaks and spammers alike. We also play host to Heaven's Gates&#160;: Darkthrone's first clan, who have their own section of the forums."</p>
<p>It's a forum site. There is no evidence that this piece has been published by the university, this site hosts a DT clan. Just because it exists and has been submitted as part of a course doesn't mean that it's anything other than <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.</p>
<p>Even after looking myself and everyone's had time to do the same, not a single piece of anything even remotely connected to establishing notability has surface, despite it repeatedly being said that there has.</p>
<p>Every time I try to look something up on Google I get WP on top of the results. This article claims that Lazarus has done these charity runs - where is the evidence? I'm not seeing any (and I've tried). Where is Lazarus' homepage? There's none listed, again I've looked for it, nothing there. There are plenty of things need verifying, yet precious little to verify them with. It was given a 'please add citations' tag <s>nearly</s> over two months ago, there's a message on the talk page asking for some cites dated the 1st of August. If those actually tending the article can't find anything it's hardly surprising that nothing's come up during the AFD.</p>
<p>The article reads like an advert, even giving details of the IRC, how to log in etc., the web address stuck in amongst the text at the top, plug for Lazarus' charity work in the DT article instead of in the Lazarus article (not that there's any evidence of Lazarus existing beyond DT). There is something <i>VERY</i> wrong with the DT article and the Lazarus article accompanying it, I'm no longer giving it the benefit of the doubt. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 17:46, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe <a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/press.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/press.php" rel="nofollow">[64]</a> is the charity mentioned, also uses the term 'run', the NY Children's Hospital is listed there and it is focussed on gamers and game companies helping kids with donations - I like it. Whilst there is no mention of Lazarus on there, it fits the bill (though some confirmation of this fact sure as heck wouldn't hurt). With all due respect to the article's editors, if this <i>is</i> the right charity, why on earth has it taken me to find it, after this information was added to the article on 19 October 2005? After issues with cites were brought up 2 months ago?

</ul>
<p>We are pleased to announce that, once again, we will be holding a charity drive to support Children's Hospital. Last year we thought it would be a great idea to hold a charity drive and raise money to help those who are sick and less fortunate over the holiday season. Players managed to raise over $10,000.00 for Children's Hospital in New York.</p>
<p>Like last year, players will have the ability to donate via paypal or the mail, and everyone who donates will receive one of three new charity medals that will appear on your profile page. Players will also have the ability to win a variety of prizes which will range from game testing, to console games, dvd's, and more.</p>
<p>To help us announce this year's charity drive, we got Cash Cunningham, the Board Chairman of Children's Hospital to thank players who donated last year and tell you a little about this year's charity drive:</p>
<pre>
   Dear “Dark Throne Players”:
</pre>
<pre>
   On behalf of the Women &amp; Children’s Hospital of Buffalo, please accept our heartfelt thanks to all of you who went online and made a donation in last year’s charity drive to benefit the hospital. As a group you successful raised $10,363; a portion of which we gave to the Child Life Department to use for the purchase of toys for patients spending their holiday in the hospital. The remainder of your donation went to the help the Hematology/Oncology Unit; a unit which cares for 98% of the patients under the age of four diagnosed with some form of cancer or blood disorder.
</pre>
<pre>
   We are most appreciative of your efforts on behalf of the young patients we serve and would like to thank you in advance for participation in this year’s charity drive. Please know that by supporting Lazarus Software in their benefit for the hospital you are enabling our doctors, nurses and health care professionals to provide the very best care for the more than 45,000 patients who are treated here each year.
</pre>
<pre>
   On behalf of the staff at the Women &amp; Children’s Hospital of Buffalo Foundation and our Board of Directors a most heartfelt thank you.
</pre>
<pre>
   Very truly yours,
</pre>
<pre>
   Cash Cunningham
   Board Chairman
   Women &amp; Children’s Hospital of Buffalo Foundation 
</pre>
<p><br />
For more information about this Hospital and the foundation, please visit <a href="http://foundation.wchob.org" class="external free" title="http://foundation.wchob.org" rel="nofollow">http://foundation.wchob.org</a> and look for our official Charity Drive page to go up on Dark Throne very soon. On this page we will be including all of the important information such as mailing addresses, contact information for the hospital, and specifics about how to donate online.</p>
<p><br />
anymore credibility needed to that fact? if so, i am sure a little digging in the archives can bring up some more info. I belive that in the 2005 Charity Drive, a little over $12,500 was raised, but don't hold me to that amount. Phoenix2009 01:42, 3 October 2006 (UTC)Phoenix200 DT Supporter</p>

<dd>It's still sourced from DT as opposed to outside, but thankyou for providing the link - should the article be kept then it will make a great starting point to verifying the info.

<p>Apparently a bunch of the stories told by the writer's teacher. Originally listed for speedy deletion as patent nonsense. I had the following conversation with the writer on the page's talk page:</p>
<p>What's your beef? How can you say this is patent nonsense if you don't know who he is? Alfons, my DT teacher often tells us stories of his life, and has pictures to back his stories up. He also tells us he invented funk in general, however, can't back this up, so i haven't written it. dig?<br />
• A teacher's random stories aren't notable, are unverified, and have no place in an encylopedia. Wikipedia:Patent nonsense. Clamster5 17:44, 25 September 2006 (UTC)<br />
• I beg to differ. He's played a large part in the bass community and the development of slap techniques. They aren't random and are varifiable.<br />
• Then list web sources on the page that reflect that. Unverified and possibly made-up material isn't accepted on wikipedia. Clamster5 17:50, 25 September 2006 (UTC)<br />
• I might add that word of mouth is just as an effective and reliable source of information than any old website. No doubt any sources i give you will be debated for their reliability purely because of the nature of the content.<br />
• I'm going to list this on AFD so you can debate this out with someone else. Clamster5 17:55, 25 September 2006 (UTC)<br />

<p>A primary school is never notable just by reason of existing, nor even by being verifiable. It must be notable of itself and that notability must be asserted in the article. Every school is not sacred. UK primary schools are ten a penny. This article is linked to by no real article, and has no real content. Fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an indiscriminate collection of information. There are no sources referenced. Note that Oftsed, if cited later as a source, has little relevance, because every UK state sector school has an Ofsted reference. I prodded it. Ironic was the statement when deprodding <i>deprod obviously notable school</i>, since the article has this simple line in it: <i>Lapal Primary School is a primary school which situated in Halesowen, West Midlands, England.</i> That is it. There is no notability. The school just exists. Period. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 19:11, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> There are so many problems with the above I don't know where to begin. I see at least three issues. First the matter of a questionable premise - the repeated assertion that all schools are notable even though most people don't think that. Two the irrelevant tautology- obviously everyone agrees that verifiable sourced <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> schools should be kept but to claim that is a policy is simply wrong (in fact, if something were agreed to be notable but not meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> it would be removed. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> overides pretty much everything). Third, this once again has the usual buzzwords about organic growth which I have yet to see a defintion. What does this mean? How is organic adding anything to the phrase, and how is this somehow relevant? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 03:02, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Any claim that the Ofsted report is trivial cannot be based upon actually having read it. It is 16 pages long, and contains a lot of detail, ranging from local historians visiting classes to parents' dissatisfaction with notices of closure.

It contains a name, address, and 1 sentence of description. It's a directory entry. The triviality restriction in the PNC is aimed directly at excluding such directory entries, raising the notability bar such that it must be shown that there is <i>more</i> than a simple directory entry's worth of source material available. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 22:25, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>DELETE</b> Regions have cuisine: Kentucky is not a region but is a part of at least 2 regions. Those regions should have cuisine articles. Applachian portion of the state would have had Appalachian cuisine, Southwest area would have had cuisine typical for the south and Bluegrass region probably a mix of midwest and South. This article certainly doesn't inform about the differences. Steam power did not turn the native forest into arable land. Not relavant to this topic. This article is not cited and is poorly written. This article seems to have been started as a joke and other people seem to be unintentionally playing into this joke. This article doesn't seem to acknowledge the 20th century and modern grocery stores. Fast food corporations shouldn't be considered part of an area's cuisine. There are lots of chinese restaurants in Ky that doesn't mean they came about because of the area's cuisine. Just because Whitecastle started here doesn't mean that is the cuisine. That is a corporation. This article isn't worth fixing because if you remove all the errors, irrelavant material, slander, and non-neutral pov there wouldn't be anything left.<a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunchy_Numbers_8121.html" title="User:Crunchy Numbers">-Crunchy Numbers</a> 20:38, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I see plenty that could be salvaged, such as "Dishes or recipes of note in Kentuckian cuisine", and if other sections were redrafted, they could include a good deal of encyclopedic info. I agree that "Fast food" should definitely be nixed. Further, we don't delete articles just because they don't include citations. I am a Kentuckian, and I see enough in this article that rings true.

<li>Comment: "Dishes or recipes of note in Kentuckian cuisine"- Is Ale-8-One a dish or recipe? Beer cheese-this is the first time I've heard of it. Bourbon balls-my mom made those once from a recepe in Southern Living magazine. Johnny Cake-saw those in a movie one time. Stack cake-never heard of it. Maybe I should have set this up as a merge with the Kentucky article: The minor portion left after cleanup could be a paragraph or two in the main article. Then after people add more it could be branched off again. There would also be more light shed on some of these difficult to verify "facts" if it was in the main article. In the meantime I'm finding these wikifiction gems all over the net in articles copied from here.

<li>I've heard of beer cheese. I ran into a couple beer cheese makers at the Kentucky Crafted show in March. At any rate, many items in this list are hard to source, but experiential things are usually hard to source; that is, Kentuckians most likely contributed to that list from experience, so I don't think we should discount it lightly. Further, I see no issue with having a small article, if that's what we have left after modifications. It would be more than a stub, and certainly, it's a topic that will be expanded. Apparently, the consenus will be to keep, so merging it would be considered bad form. It causes no damage to sit as a separate article. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><font color="green"><b>Stevie is the man!</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 16:21, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

I wonder how the people in Louisiana would feel if someone added twizzlers and slim jims to the list of Cajun foods because a new slim jim factory gets built there. Or maybe the contents of a local 7-11 should be included. I would like to propose a challenge to anyone who can find reliable sources for this article. I will cook them a gormet dinner of squirrel liver with fava beans.<a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunchy_Numbers_8121.html" title="User:Crunchy Numbers">-Crunchy Numbers</a> 16:35, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article has a few facetious or unsupported lines in it, which will doubtless be edited out. There would be lots of verifiable, notable and encyclopedic content left. There is indeed cuisine peculiar to Kentucky. It can have its own cuisine and still be related to 2 neighboring regions. Yum, sweet tea and barbecue, catfish and hushpuppies. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 22:39, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It needs work, like every article on Wikipedia, but it has worthwhile information. Citations will be hard to come by for some of these facts, but I don't think it's preferable to delete the article rather than marking it as unsourced. I had never heard of burgoo or beer cheese until I came to Kentucky, and they are pretty popular foods here. Kentucky has a foot in more than one region, and it would be a disservice (and inaccurate) to simply say that Kentucky's cuisine is a hodgepodge of Midwestern, Appalachian, and Southern food. Finally, I think some editors object to the mention of squirrel and other antiquated dishes - I don't know anything about this, nor where to look it up, but that doesn't mean it wasn't true at one point. This article has already been posted for deletion (for the same reasons) and the consensus was to keep it. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELamontacranston_0a5f.html" title="User:Lamontacranston">Lamont A Cranston</a> 11:54, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Comment: Thanks for reminding me about the previous deletion nomination: all those people who voted to keep it then proceded to do nothing for the past year. I never suggested to say that Kentucky's cuisine is a hodgepodge of Midwestern, Appalachian, and Southern food. What I said was that the Appalachian portion of the state is Appalachian. The South western portion is mostly Southern. These days the differences are less and less. I've lived in both places and others and back in the days when people cooked I went to lots of dinners at people's houses. The Kentucky article already points out that Kentucky is part of these regions. I don't object to the mention of squirrel. I find it offensive and deceptive however when things are taken out of context. For example comparing the diet of people from Kentucky in 1825 with modern day America. People today who eat squirrel are called hunters and they have to buy a liscense. And forget about getting their wives to cook it for them; if it isn't wrapped in plastic with the name of a grocery store stamped on it, it isn't edible. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunchy_Numbers_8121.html" title="User:Crunchy Numbers">-Crunchy Numbers</a> 15:18, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Lack of attention by Wikipedians isn't very pertinent in this case, as the article is not <i>that</i> bad. It's clearly salvageable, and some improvements have already been made.

<li>Fried chicken is typical of southern cooking. But the first Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant opened in Salt Lake City. Have you seen the Kentucky Fried Movie? I went to France last spring but couldn't find French Fries on the menu. They had heard of Freedom Fries but wouldn't serve them. Bourbon is a product of Kentucky. It seems to be most popular in Chinese restaurants at the malls where they pressure you to take a sample of bourbon chicken on a toothpick as you walk by. But they do that at the downtown mall in Indianapolis also. I didn't realize that the regions of America are so vaguely defined. I wonder how Kentucky Fried Squirrel would go over as a brand?<a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunchy_Numbers_8121.html" title="User:Crunchy Numbers">-Crunchy Numbers</a> 15:42, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Deletion again??? BAO Team represents the hacking/carding culture in the Philippines. How come some of you posted that this is just a little IRC war. How come warez/hacking groups are welcome here? Zaphyr damn it! YOU are a Filipino. If there's something wrong why don't you just edit it. Are you related with User: Mike Abundo? If so, I supposed you just like to sabotage or retaliate. or Mark Cacho (user: kurenai jiku)? the alleged carder.</p>

<p>A rather lengthy and pointless list that clearly shows bias. The fact that there are (Deceased) tags after many of the people listed are clear signs that someone is trying to discourage smoking. This information is irrelevant to the list itself. It also contains some people who are obviously not "iconic". Who decides what is "iconic"? The list clearly needs major revision and possible deletion. <a href="../../../g/s/h/User%7EGShton_263f.html" title="User:GShton">GShton</a> 22:27, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Significant problems with neutrality, relevance, objectivity, etc. Too many editorial comments about other characteristics or traits of those listed that have nothing to do with the "article". The introduction offers no clear criteria as to who ought to be on the list. Matter of opinion as to who is "famous" or whether someone is "clearly recognized" as being identified with smoking. Too many unsubstantiated statements as well. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 23:57, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> for clear NPOV and soapbox. If this were genuinely an article about examples of media portrayal of smoking or something (which might be OR anyway), it wouldn't make a point of detailing the health problems of each individual. Look at the Colin Ferrell entry, which ends with the weasel sentence "he is also said to have a bad smoker's cough" or the following Kevin Federline entry 'mentioning' that he has bronchitis (with no citation or evidence of causality for either entry). I have no problem with someone doing a study about the effects of smoking, and the nice thing is there are many groups that HAVE done such studies, and have posted the results on their websites. Wikipedia is not the place to make a pointed anti-smoking article. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 00:14, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I thought the <i>deceased</i> tags are useful in a mixed list of living and dead people, but I have removed them. I agree it could use another thorough revision. (look at the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_iconic_smokers_7bad.html" title="Talk:List of iconic smokers">talk page</a> for some of the previous efforts.)

<li><b>Keep</b> - Keep, but modify to remove the health aspects and deceased markers. I believe that NPOV is the only issue with this list, and by making it an objective list, it will be more encyclopedic. People like Edward R. Murrow and Jean-Paul Sartre are iconic smokers -- it is part of their image -- and should be listed with others. --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGuroadrunner_7eb9.html" title="User:Guroadrunner">Guroadrunner</a> 04:44, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: the additional problem is determining an "objective" standard. By what criteria is someone iconic, and by what standards do we determine that smoking is part of their identity or "image" (especially further back in time when there were far more smokers as a percentage of the population)? Given the prevailing norms of the past, a list of "iconic" non-smokers would be shorter. In fact, how is "image" defined? With your two examples, I doubt "smoker" is the identifying characteristic that leaps to someone's mind. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 19:24, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I made some more changes to the entry for DTS (9/28/06). I was able to find the tv broadcast, but the rest of the newspaper articles require a subscription. I fixed the footnote format issue and I also deleted a couple of words in the body of the text to try to make it sound more neutral. Please let me know if anyone else has any other suggestions.

<li><b>Keep</b>. He sounds like a really interesting scholar.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Well, if you're implying that I'm only out to get Alfred de Grazia's goat, please let me assure you that I'm not. I agree that he's an interesting (if rather obscure) figure, and it's because I wanted to know a little bit more about him (from a more or less NPOV source) that I came to find Wikipedia's article on him. But I was disappointed, because the article just parrots (or plagiarizes?) Mr. de Grazia's own biography on his own site: <a href="http://www.grazian-archive.com/autobiography/DeGrazia/degrazia.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.grazian-archive.com/autobiography/DeGrazia/degrazia.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.grazian-archive.com/autobiography/DeGrazia/degrazia.htm</a>. Besides that, the phrasing and the inclusion of irrelevant minutiae strikes me as vain. So I took it to be a vanity article, based on <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Wikipedia's vanity guidelines</a>:<br /></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"Vanity information is considered to be any information...that might create an apparent conflict of interest, meaning any material that presents the appearance of being intended to in any way promote the personal notoriety of the author, or one of the close family members or associates of the author."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"...if [the vanity information constitutes] an entire article, the article is then usually submitted for deletion. ... Those that offer some claim of notability, however remote, are usually sent to Wikipedia:Articles for deletion."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Even in the cases of decidedly famous people, these people's unrealized aspirations, thoughts, and hobbies are seldom included in Wikipedia, unless they are directly salient, and, more importantly, verifiable. Wikipedia's policy on verifiability prohibits the inclusion of things that are not verifiable from independent sources."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"...the best rule of thumb while determining whether or not any such edits may contain vanity materials, is to ask oneself, "Would this same type of material normally be found in a print encyclopedia?""</p>

<p>Do you still disagree that this is a vanity article? Ers00 22:52, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It is written a bit vanity-like, but de Grazia is (was, as of Aug. 31) a thinker who was published in scholarly magazines, and who published his own journal, backed by no less an authority than SAGE Publications. Besides, he's fascinating. Keep it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Susan Stanich (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Susan_Stanich_ee05.html" title="Special:Contributions/Susan Stanich">contribs</a>) 16:32, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> I disagree that it is a vanity article. De Grazia's scholarly accomplishments are serious; while much of his thinking is outside the mainstream, that is part of what makes this entry interesting and relevant. The man has often been way ahead of his time; to give just two examples, he proposed using computers to study social networks in the early 1950s, and developed ideas for scholarly citation indices (and why they were forces for conservatism) in the 1960s. JeffUbois 13:37, 2 October 2006 (UTC) JeffUbois</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> I am the author of this article. 55 books officially listed, published by the likes of Alfred Knopf (Public and Republic), Doubleday (Eight Bads, Eight Goods), Wiley, Scotts Foresman etc. should qualify anyone. Alfred de Grazia is the founder of the AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST, still in existence, and one of the most respected magazines in political science. He has been listed in past editions of Who's Who in America and Who's Who in the World (no less...) He has taught at prestigious universities like U. of Minnesota, Brown, Stanford, NYU and others, yet his activities have reached far beyond academia. He is a prime example of a very rich and productive American life of the XX century. At 86, he is still fully active. Including, in the past three years, two fiction movies and one book...
