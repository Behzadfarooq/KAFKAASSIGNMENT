<li><b>Comment</b> Care to give a reason besides 'useful'? I don't find them all that useful. And good they certainly are not. I hate deletionists too, but with these articles, it's really pretty justified. Most of the /truly/ notible soundtracks are already listen somewhere in the game music article, and unlike say, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_important_operas.html" title="List of important operas">List of important operas</a> or similar lists, there's just not enough OUT THERE to prove anything is notable over another. Maybe if someone could find a few notible articles, and use them as reference for ONE list, that would work. But as they stand now, they either have to be all inclusive (that is, replicating the list of games per system and adding composer info), or deleted. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelodia_4ad5.html" title="User:Melodia">♫ Melodia Chaconne ♫</a> 18:11, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Although I wouldn't have nominated this type of article, I agree with above points that it is difficult to provide an arguement as to why they should stay. Maybe a single article with just tracks from all consoles over time which have been most notable, but as for the current articles, Wikipedia isn't the right place for them. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBungle44_50ba.html" title="User:Bungle44">Bungle44</a> 17:53, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> So these articles need a little bit of work, okay. When I was a baby I needed improvement, too. Should my parents have deleted me? Are these articles actually hurting anyone? Or can they just be tagged with whatever original research or sources tags in the meantime until more information can be dredged up? So, yeah.--Lairor 02:16, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Most of these articles were created in 2005, so are over a year old, and a couple have had "sources needed" tags for over 6 months, so I'm not sure if they're really "babies" in Wikipedia terms. I wouldn't object to an article on "notable game music" (stuff like won awards / multiple articles from major publications or websites that praise it / soundtrack release sold a zillion copies), but I personally think such an article would be basicly be a rewrite from scratch, rather than trying to retrofit some sort of notability criteria onto what's basically a "list of game music that random Wikipedia editors think is good". <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredOrAlive_8809.html" title="User:FredOrAlive">FredOrAlive</a> 23:53, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Despite being a game music fanatic, I'd been considering nominating all of these for a while now. The problem begins with the lists' statement that "the following games were noted for their music". Noted by who? Where are the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a> saying that all of these have been "noted"? What are the criteria for a game/series having been "noted", besides someone deciding to insert it into the list?<br />

<li><b>Delete, unreferenced and POV issues</b> While I don't have a problem with articles about video game music in general, this particular lists are entirely unreferenced and suffer from the POV problem of deciding whether or not a game is "known" for its music.

<li><b>Delete all</b> - hardly complete, not _really_ notable (I could understand discussing the engineering of certain effects that were new to the time, such as the ET voice clip on the Atari 800 cartridge or the voices on the 8-bit Kennedy Approach game WITHIN those articles, but not a list).

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, games have become famous on the basis of their music and the music indepently won awards for it. The quality of the music played is often mentioned in reviews of games, frequently new music is composed just for the game.

<li>That isn't the issue here. It has nothing to do with liking or disliking VGM; it has to do with the fact that these articles are unverifiable original research listcruft.

<li>Did I mention anywhere that I like music in video games? Or even that I like music full stop!

<li>The Point is, as it stands now, the articles are basically all POV pointlessness. An article that's well sourced with a list of notable game music would be a totally different story (again, check out <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_important_operas.html" title="List of important operas">List of important operas</a> for how it can be done), but as it stands, it's probably hard to find enough sources for such an article, unfortunetly.

<li>I get a lot of your points, however you have put up a massive big pile of them to be deleted at once. If they had been done one at a time then I too would have been voting delete for a fair few of them, while the others (very few admittedly) that could be worthwhile I'd vote for keep. But as it stands now I can't vote for delete simply because most of them are crap, this is a case of throwing the baby out with the bath water! <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 10:01, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Uh, every one of these lists is the same thing. A statement saying "these games have notable soundtracks" and then a list of games. Not one of them have any sources that establish what is meant by a notable soundtrack, or back up the claims that the games listed have notable soundtracks.

<li>I'm not the one who put them up for deletion. I just support it (which if one checked my contribs, is usually the opposite of what I say when I add to a AFD.)

<li><b>Comment</b> - actually I have soundtrack albums for several games over in my CD rack. I have nothing against game music articles being on Wikipeida (and it's not like I've nominated the main <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_and_video_game_music.html" title="Computer and video game music">Computer and video game music</a> article), it's just these lists just don't work. There may be a list of notable game music to be made, but these are just lists of games with music random wikipedia editors like. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredOrAlive_8809.html" title="User:FredOrAlive">FredOrAlive</a> 15:23, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. The current criteria- "quality" as determined by random passerby - is clearly unsustainable. However, it's vaguely possible that new criteria could be set that is not POV, for instance "Video game music composed by noted composers" or the like- <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Gregson-Williams_064c.html" title="Harry Gregson-Williams">Harry Gregson-Williams</a> (Metal Gear Solid 2) is a well-established movie composer, <a href="../../../y/u/k/Yuki_Kajiura_16a9.html" title="Yuki Kajiura">Yuki Kajiura</a> (Xenosaga II &amp; III) has done lots of animes, <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremy_Soule_b771.html" title="Jeremy Soule">Jeremy Soule</a> while mostly doing video game music has received a ton of acclaim and orchestrations, etc. It'd need vigilant watching and cleanly set out guidelines so that the POV part doesn't transfer to "which composers are notable," but that's an easier question. For starters, something like "the composer should have a bluelink and at least two pages of content in their article that aren't simply lists of works" would seem passable, though people who know the music industry better are certainly free to suggest something better. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 18:32, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> That still doesn't cut it. For starters, the size of the Wikipedia article has absolutely zero direct relation to notibility. Furthur more, there's plenty of games out there with well-noted music by otherwise non-notable composers (can you name who wrote <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katamari_Damacy_7d86.html" title="Katamari Damacy">Katamari Damacy</a> off the top of your head? How about <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Metroid_d7dc.html" title="Super Metroid">Super Metroid</a>?). Whatever, I gave the better argument above, and there's basically NOTHING in any of these articles that's more than a list, so making a new general article instead of trying to keep an clean these up is a lot better choice, either way. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelodia_4ad5.html" title="User:Melodia">♫ Melodia Chaconne ♫</a> 18:53, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Psst, Super Metroid might be a bad example because <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenji_Yamamoto_fcea.html" title="Kenji Yamamoto">Kenji Yamamoto</a> isn't actually <i>that</i> obscure. <a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVoretus_d72f.html" title="User:Voretus">Voretus</a> 20:59, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, yes. I'm proposing a refocusing of the list, since "quality of score" seems like a POV magnet. And I agree with what you say about Wikipedia articles not being the be-all and end-all of how notable a person is, but they are a start, and they're easy to check. I've seen a similar requirement used for listing artists from a topic with tons of (graphical) artists- only list artists with non-trivial WP pages <i>at the least</i>, since if they don't even have that, they probably don't matter. Anyway, it's not a huge deal, but there could be non-trivial history in these lists that could provide a start to someone trying to make a proper article, so if deletion is decided, at least redirects to "video game music" would ensure that the history could still be checked and used. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 21:34, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure if the lists can really be "refocussed" myself, as I've said before, you'd basically be trying to retrofit a set of criteria onto the existing lists. IMO it would be better to create a set of criteria then researching the soundtracks that fitted them. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredOrAlive_8809.html" title="User:FredOrAlive">FredOrAlive</a> 23:49, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - possibly, for <i>some</i> of them I could go through and find reviews that state the music, but a) I'm too lazy and b) this is pointless; if it had good music, the article should say it in 'reception'. otherwise you end up with huge funnel lists. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Fuchs_e635.html" title="User:David Fuchs"><b>Dåvid Fuchs</b></a> (<small><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Fuchs_fab2.html" title="User talk:David Fuchs">talk</a></small> / <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Fuchs_d754.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Fuchs">contribs</a></small>) 02:23, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
