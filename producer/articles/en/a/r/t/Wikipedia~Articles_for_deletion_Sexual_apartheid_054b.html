<p>Yes, it's Another Apartheid Afd. However, unlike <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a>, this one doesn't look at all like a widespread term. It says <i>"Sexual Apartheid is a term used by some <a href="../../../l/g/b/LGBT_social_movements_dccb.html" title="LGBT social movements">same-sex rights</a> advocates"</i>, but the references don't back this up, as the three external links all refer to <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Tatchell_6e4b.html" title="Peter Tatchell">Peter Tatchell</a>. So if this article was rewritten to fit its sources, it would say "Sexual Apartheid is a term that <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Tatchell_6e4b.html" title="Peter Tatchell">Peter Tatchell</a> used a couple of times", and having articles on every political catchphrase under the sun would be unnecessary forking. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 12:24, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Reductio ad Googlum</i> is the weakest argument possible. In fact, Google Books search does not establish the notability of the term or its meaning; extensive research using reliable sources is required to do either. The books where this phrase is found may use in various meaning, and Google search certainly says nothing as to how widely the term is accepted or whether there is any agreement regarding its meaning.

<dd>I'm not sure that Google says nothing about whether there is any agreement regarding its meaning. The only hit I found for <code>"Paul Hoch" "Sexual apartheid"</code> speaks volumes: <i>"Sports transcends social divisions and brings diverse people together --- with one important exception: routinely sport separates women from men. Paul Hoch coined the term "sexual apartheid" to describe this near-universal phenomenon."</i> <a href="http://www.zonalatina.com/Zldata117.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.zonalatina.com/Zldata117.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<li><b>Delete, reluctantly</b> For reasons stated by Zeq and Moshe, the obvious motivation behind the creation of this article (i.e. as part of the overall attack on Israel) persuades me that this article should not be kept at this time. "Reluctantly" (or "weakly" if you prefer) because I do not believe the phrase "sexual apartheid" (which to me, would mean a policy to keep gay etc. people separate from straight people) presents nearly the degree of difficulties that "Israeli apartheid" does. For one thing, "Israeli apartheid" is a specific, direct attack on Israel; it says right in the title that "apartheid" is being practiced by Israel. "Sexual apartheid" does not name a culprit. It implies that <i>someone</i> practices "sexual apartheid" but does not say who. Some might believe that "sexual apartheid" is practiced by all those who practice discrimination based on sexuality or those who express anomosity toward others based on their sexuality, though I think a strong argument could be made that they are not synonymous. All this is by way of saying that I do not think "sexual apartheid" is a hateful term, as "Israeli apartheid" obviously is. Sorry for the length of the comment, I just think this one is slightly more complicated. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 16:37, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>You should be judging based on the merits or demerits of the article in question itself, not on what you think of other articles or what you think the motivation in creating the article is. Homey 16:49, 2 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm pretty sure I don't need you to be telling me what I should be doing, especially when you are the one who created these articles (gender/sexual/global apartheid) just so you could justify keeping a "disambiguation" page referring to "Israeli apartheid" and giving the latter equal billing with actual apartheid. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 18:07, 2 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Given that you've admitted you're not calling for deletion based on anything in the article itself but based on external factors I thought it prudent to advise you that you are supposed to be voting on the merits of the article, not because you're opposed to a completely different article. <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Apartheid (disambiguation)">apartheid (disambiguation)</a> will stand or fall on their own merits, what happens to this article will have no bearing on that - so why take out your anger at Israeli apartheid on an innocent little article on a completely different topic? Homey 19:12, 2 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Homey, let me ask <b>you</b> a question. Given that I was, by my count, at least the <b>sixth</b> person to refer to your reasons or motives for creating this article (including those who cited WP:POINT)while voting to delete, why I am the first one you choose to "advise" in this manner? I did not think of the argument myself, I am just agreeing with others. Am I being singled out for attention because I made the foolish mistake of acknowledging that I have reservations about my vote? Maybe the next time I won't be so foolish, but I would think that the expression of second thoughts is something Wikipedia would want to encourage in other to have a full and open discussion. I don't feel very encouraged right now. I probably should have just said "Delete per Zeq and Moshe," and then you wouldn't be bothering me. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 19:29, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Why? Because you express moral qualms about doing the wrong thing and were right to do so. Do you actually have any reason to vote delete based on the content of the article itself? Homey 19:34, 2 June 2006 (UTC)
