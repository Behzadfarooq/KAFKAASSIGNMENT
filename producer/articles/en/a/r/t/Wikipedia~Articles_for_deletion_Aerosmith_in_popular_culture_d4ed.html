<li><b>Delete</b>. While I don't think this is original research (no "random event x in show y may be a ref to Aerosmith"), I don't see the need of a extensive list of Aerosmith appearances and references.

<li>By original research I'm referring to items like <i>A rock band of elves resembling Aerosmith is featured in the movie The Polar Express performing a song called "Rockin' on Top of the World." Steven Tyler sang the lyrics in the song, yet the rest of the band was either not featured in the song or not given credit, meaning it is likely one of Tyler's few solo works.</i> I mean, it's not "theory of everything" style OR but still. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 05:02, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge or weak keep</b> to <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerosmith.html" title="Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a>. I know this is probably where the article started, but I'm sure most of what's in the article is verifiable, even if not currently verified. I suggest merging non-trivial popular culture references to <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerosmith.html" title="Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a>, tagging them with {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} and deleting them if they remain unsourced for more than, say, 2 weeks. I think this could be a stand-alone article, but it would require adding a lot of context, performing a great deal of cleanup, and sourcing every claim made. Possible, but hard to do--that's why I write "weak" keep. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 05:47, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete or Incredibly Weak mini-Merge</b>, as per the precedent listed above. I would actually consider an article like this even less encyclopedic than a list of Rush references - Aerosmith is just too gigantic for something like this. It would be similar to the color blue in popular culture, List of country songs about loving someone, or List of UPC codes divisible by two. A few of the more defining uses (i.e., the earliest known use of an Aerosmith song in a mainstream movie, some factoid involving <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolution_X_c2c1.html" title="Revolution X">Revolution X</a>, and the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_First_%28Aerosmith%29_8dca.html" title="Head First (Aerosmith)">Head First (Aerosmith)</a> download) could be placed in the main Aerosmith article. As a side note, the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolution_X_c2c1.html" title="Revolution X">Revolution X</a> trivia blurb is a prime example of how <b>not</b> to write trivia - the game came out for several consoles at once, and the "focus" of the blurb should probably be on the arcade game, which came first and was the most successful.

<li><b>Keep</b> What's with the Aerosmith hate-fest lately?? I sense some extreme bias against this band on Wikipeida and it disgusts me. We can have an article for every song the Beatles wrote, an article chronicling Madonna saying the F-word on Letterman, an article about the Beatlemania, a list of Christina Aguilera's B-sides an unreleased material, and even AC/DC can have their article about pop culture, but God forbid Aerosmith (a band that's been around making music for nearly 40 years and sold more records than any other American rock band) has a few specialty articles. Considering many kids today only know of Aerosmith because of their soundtrack contributions, their being featured in a rollercoaster attraction, and their appearances on Saturday Night Live, I think it's important to have this section. Otherwise, the band's history section is going to become incredibly long as we incorporate (merge) many of these important items into the band's history section, making the Aerosmith article, which is already too long, even longer. But who am I to say anything. I simply want to expand knowledge on Wikipedia, the rest of you seem to want to hinder it. --<a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAbog_81bb.html" title="User:Abog">Abog</a> 04:35, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>First off, I am unaware of any "Aerosmith hate-fest" on Wikipedia. I am aware of two articles relating to Aerosmith being nominated for deletion recently, this one and one about outtakes. That does not amount to a "hate-fest" under any reasonable interpretation. Second, you are expected to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> of your fellow Wikipedians and accusing them of orchestrating a campaign against your favorite band fails to do so. Finally, if you believe that articles on Madonna's swearing of Aguilara's b-sides or whatever else do not belong on Wikipedia, then put them up for deletion. The existence of one crap article does not justify the existence of another crap article, so arguing in favor of this one by pointing to other shitty articles is a poor argument. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 06:06, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Did I ever say that I thought they were all shitty articles? No. Don't imply. I think they are all good articles and should stay, especially considering how prominent these musicians are in pop culture, and the fact that their main articles would be incredibly long if they weren't broken into these sub-sections. Aerosmith is no different, and it seemed as since their articles were all being gone after at the same time, like people were suddenly denying Aerosmith's importance or notability. And that's where I took issue. But now that I realize this is an artist-by-artist thing, I'll back off a little. Since many of these bulleted items already appear in the main Aerosmith article, I'm backing off a bit, and I think that we should just merge most of the rest, either into the Aerosmith article, or into the appropriate song articles. This isn't a matter of shitty articles, it's a matter of what appeared to me to be double standards. --<a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAbog_81bb.html" title="User:Abog">Abog</a> 00:03, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> for the same reasons I support the afd on Stephen Hawking in Popular Culture. I would make the argument that <i>any</i> article with "in Popular Culture" in the title should be deleted. Such articles are going to necessarily be original research and you have the added (and significant) problem of defining what, precisely, constitutes 'popular culture.' Essentially, "Aerosmith in Popular Culture" equals "Aerosmith in American Culture." This is unencyclopedic and US-centric (or at least Western-centric). If there is anything encyclopedic in the article then it should be merged into the <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerosmith.html" title="Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a> article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 08:17, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wow, finally we can agree on something for once. I applaud you for your efforts. I had had this idea too, and knew that many of the factoids had been incorporated into the article already.
