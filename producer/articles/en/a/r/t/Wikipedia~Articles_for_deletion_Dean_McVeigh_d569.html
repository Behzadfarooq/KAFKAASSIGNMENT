<li>Okay, Capitalistroadster has done some good work on this article.

The most relevant issue with McVeigh is his prominence, illustrated by many press articles and his involvement in newsworthy events. The issue of the quality of the article is a separate matter, it should certainly be improved as several users have noted. 59.167.73.44 05:16, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Obviously this article was started by someone with a direct involvement in the MUSU matter, and equally obviously it has been attacked by others with some other kind of involvement. Since Wikipedia allows anonymous editing it really can't complain when this kind of thing happens, and it will go on happening at an increasing rate, as Wikipedia becomes better known, until something is done to tighten up the rules on who may edit. That being said, the MUSU case is a major story in Melbourne, and McVeigh is a fairly major player in it. It may be that all the allegations against him are bunk (I have no idea), but that doesn't alter the fact that they have made him newsworthy and notable. Obviously if the article is to be kept it needs vigilant editing to keep out everybody's POV. I'd also like to know <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">User:Ambi</a>'s rationale for blocking <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUnitypigdog_c0fc.html" title="User:Unitypigdog">User:Unitypigdog</a>.

<li>I reiterate my view that the article should be kep, that is clear but equally clear is that those editing have a point of view. I certainly do.

</ul>
<p>One assertion by Capitalistroadster contained the assertion that one of McVeigh's targets "fled overseas" to escape "charges." No part of that is true and nor is it even claimed that "charges" were laid. Presumably if the target in question, Andrew Landeryou, had fled and then returned nearly a year ago, he would have been punished for doing so. If Wikipedia is sensitive about defamation as some suggest, such claims should be considered carefully.</p>
<p>The only Police investigation confirmed is into Dean McVeigh's actions, which is supported by a document that was at one stage linked to I see but is now deleted.</p>
<p>McVeigh's actions as Liquidator of MUSU, particularly the contempt of court issue is a big deal and needs a separate treatment from any article about the Student Union. They are very different subjects. I have been reading through the Wikipedia rules and notice the mandate to assume good faith. I see very little of that here and what seems to be my some a manic determination to make political points. There are real issues of controversy here and they should be addressed correctly. I would like to contribute to that and I would hope a compromise could be achieved. 59.167.73.44 12:31, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Response</b> liquidating the Melbourne Student's Union and "worldwide fame for successfully defending Simpson" seem to have different levels of notability.

<p>I acknowledged the difference in scale. We have articles on local councillors, even though they are not as notable as presidents and prime ministers.

<dd>I think the defence of OJ Simpson, moreover the successful defence, was pretty remarkable, not merely a service for a notable client. More than 10 years later that trial is memorable and, although I have extremely little interest in US celebrity news, I would be prepared to discuss at a backyard barbecue ( but perhaps not stop a barbecue) on the subject "how come Simpson was not convicted?" No one got Skase, but I do not recall McVeigh's name in connection with Qintex. No doubt he was involved, I don't disbelieve the <i>Age</i> assertion - but not prominently. I think we should write the articles on the two professional bodies first and then look for prominent practitioners. As Ambi put it, the poor chap who is "<i>just a random insolvency practitioner who had the misfortune to run into some vengeful student politicians with a lot of time to spare</i>" should not be our choice of prominent accountant in Australia.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 06:38, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Merging is an inadequate solution</i> as it would delete all references not relating to MUSU, which while the principal reason for his notability would exclude reference to a highly unusual event, his removal by a Supreme Court judge in the Rug's Galore case and his involvement in other interesting Melbourne insolvency cases.
