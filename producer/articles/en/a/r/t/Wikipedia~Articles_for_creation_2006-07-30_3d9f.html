<p>Jon Paul Steuer had his first speaking role as Alexander son of Worf on Star Trek: The Next Generation when he was six years old. He had a few other bit parts here and there before getting his first big role as Quentin Kelly on Grace Under Fire. He also had a small role in Little Giants. In Grace Under Fire's last season, he lost his job to one of his Little Giants costars, Sam Horrigan when, in an attempt to improve sagging ratings, the writers tried making Quinton a more athletic ladies' man type of character and Steuer was considered too small to convincingly play this role. Since giving up acting, Jon Paul (who now goes by Jonny P) has become the lead singer for the metal-punk band the Soda Pop Kids. They recently released their first album which was somewhat successful. He wears wild cloths, tons of makeup, and is dating my friend Lina.</p>

<p>Building Services Engineering (BSE) is an interdisciplinary profession. It involves the specification, design, installation and management of all the engineering services associated with the built environment. For example, building services engineer is responsible for the design, installation, operation and management of the heating, ventilating &amp; air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, fire services systems, plumbing &amp; drainage systems, electrical services systems, lighting systems, vertical transportation (e.g. lifts &amp; escalators), gas &amp; steam supply systems, security systems, communication systems, refuse disposal system, and so on.</p>
<p>BSE is about designing, installing &amp; servicing everything that is needed to make buildings comfortable, safe &amp; convenient. With the growing complexity of engineering services in modern buildings and the significance of energy conservation and pollution control, the role of the building services engineer is becoming more and more important. Moreover, the need to provide an internal environment that balances the comfort needs of the occupants with the functional requirements of the building, using increasingly sophisticated technology, calls for engineers with a wide range of knowledge and skills.</p>

<p>Photographer Omer R. Cordell, AKA "The Impson" From Vancouver BC now living in Toronto Ontario has been noted for photographing such metal acts as Fear Factory, Strapping Young Lad, Meshuggah, Mnemic, Apocalyptica, Threat Signal, The Devin Townsend Band and more. His live and promotional photographs are exceptional pieces of work. His career as a music photographer began back in 2001 when he shot the Devin Townsend Band album "Accelerated Evolution" and shortly after the acclaimed return of Fear Factorys "Archetype".</p>
<p>Cordell is known for being the "film guy" in photography as to this date he has not shot on digital format saying that he believes that true photographic art is captured on film. To quote: "I believe that Photography can be about slowing down the world in order to observe and to reviel what is of value for us. Shooting film enables this experiance to come alive!"</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../a/t/r/Atrisco_Land_Grant_ce4e.html" title="Atrisco Land Grant">Atrisco Land Grant</a> is one of the few remaing <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_grant.html" title="Land grant">land grants</a> left in the United States. During the period of Spanish rule over the American Southwest, various monarchs of Spain would create land grants to reward their subjects or for the purpose of creating common land for settlers. In 1692 <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Charles_II_3251.html" title="King Charles II">King Charles II</a> of Spain created the Atrisco Land Grant as a reward to Don Fernando Duran y Chavez. Don Fernando Duran y Chavez was responsible for putting down an uprising of <a href="../../../p/u/e/Pueblo.html" title="Pueblo">Pueblo</a> Indians. It originally consisted of 41,533 acres, but in 1760, an additional 25,958 acres were granted in an attempt to calm land disputes.</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican-American_War_f1a1.html" title="Mexican-American War">Mexican-American War</a>, land grants in the territory ceded to the United States in the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Guadalupe-Hidalgo_1677.html" title="Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo">Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo</a> were to be respected by the United States Government, however because of the language barrier and unscrupulous government officials, many land grants were essentially stolen. However, the Atrisco Land Grant remained intact.</p>
<p>In 1967, the Legislature of New Mexico granted permission to the Atrisco heirs to form a private corporation, the Westland Development Company, which manages the land. Each of the heirs received shares of the company, and today, there are more than seven thousand heirs. These shares can only be transferred among other heirs.</p>
<p>The future of the Atrisco Land Grant is uncertain. At this time, the Westland Development Company is attempting to sell the land. The city of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albuquerque.html" title="Albuquerque">Albuquerque</a> is growing quickly, and the Atrisco Land Grant is the most desireable area for the development of new residential areas. While many of the shareholders are enthusiastic about the sale and the income it would bring to each of the heirs, others are reluctant to part with their 300 year old patrimony.</p>

<p>The Shield of Achilles W. H. Auden</p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
   She looked over his shoulder
           For vines and olive trees,
    Marble well-governed cities
           And ships upon untamed seas,
    But there on the shining metal
           His hands had put instead
    An artificial wilderness
           And a sky like lead.
</pre>
<p>A plain without a feature, bare and brown,</p>
<pre>
  No blade of grass, no sign of neighborhood,
</pre>
<p>Nothing to eat and nowhere to sit down,</p>
<pre>
  Yet, congregated on its blankness, stood
  An unintelligible multitude,
</pre>
<p>A million eyes, a million boots in line, Without expression, waiting for a sign.</p>
<p>Out of the air a voice without a face</p>
<pre>
  Proved by statistics that some cause was just
</pre>
<p>In tones as dry and level as the place:</p>
<pre>
  No one was cheered and nothing was discussed;
  Column by column in a cloud of dust
</pre>
<p>They marched away enduring a belief Whose logic brought them, somewhere else, to grief.</p>
<pre>
    She looked over his shoulder
           For ritual pieties,
    White flower-garlanded heifers,
           Libation and sacrifice,
    But there on the shining metal
           Where the altar should have been,
    She saw by his flickering forge-light
           Quite another scene.
</pre>
<p>Barbed wire enclosed an arbitrary spot</p>
<pre>
  Where bored officials lounged (one cracked a joke)
</pre>
<p>And sentries sweated for the day was hot:</p>
<pre>
  A crowd of ordinary decent folk
  Watched from without and neither moved nor spoke
</pre>
<p>As three pale figures were led forth and bound To three posts driven upright in the ground.</p>
<p>The mass and majesty of this world, all</p>
<pre>
  That carries weight and always weighs the same
</pre>
<p>Lay in the hands of others; they were small</p>
<pre>
  And could not hope for help and no help came:
  What their foes like to do was done, their shame
</pre>
<p>Was all the worst could wish; they lost their pride And died as men before their bodies died.</p>
<pre>
    She looked over his shoulder
           For athletes at their games,
    Men and women in a dance
           Moving their sweet limbs
    Quick, quick, to music,
           But there on the shining shield
    His hands had set no dancing-floor
           But a weed-choked field.
</pre>
<p>A ragged urchin, aimless and alone,</p>
<pre>
  Loitered about that vacancy; a bird
</pre>
<p>Flew up to safety from his well-aimed stone:</p>
<pre>
  That girls are raped, that two boys knife a third,
  Were axioms to him, who'd never heard
</pre>
<p>Of any world where promises were kept, Or one could weep because another wept.</p>
<pre>
    The thin-lipped armorer,
           Hephaestos, hobbled away,
    Thetis of the shining breasts
           Cried out in dismay
    At what the god had wrought
           To please her son, the strong
    Iron-hearted man-slaying Achilles
           Who would not live long.
</pre>

<p>In this film we catch a glimpse into what Ishmael Bernal's ouvre would prefigure for the industry: it is a scene showing an aspiring actress (played by the late Rita Gomez) pondering on dreams blooming in deserts of desolation and dying out in a mirage that painfully conjures images of squatter colonies and sordid lives. The bold star stares out into the landscape and scans it, with the camera acting as her surrogate, but finally framing her against the embarrassingly majestic Cultural Center. The scene captures it all: the decadence of the Martial Law regime, along with its perverse aspirations to art, has doomed the destinies of Filipinos.</p>

<p>Rifles of the IRA is an Irish folk song written by members and followers of the Irish republican Army.</p>
<p>Lyrics</p>
<p>In nineteen hundred and sixteen, the forces of the crown To take the orange white and green bombarded Dublin town But in '21 Britania's son's were forced to earn there pay When the black and tans, like lightning, ran from the rifles of the IRA</p>
<p>They burned their way through Munster, and layed Leinster on the rack Through Connaught, and through Ulster, marched the men in Brown and Black They shot down wives and children in their own heroic way but the black and tans, like lightning, ran from the rifles of the IRA</p>
<p>They hanged young Kevin Barry high, just a lad of eighteen years Cork City's flames lit up in the sky but our brave lads new no fear The Cork brigade, with hand grendes in ambush wait in lay. And the Black and tans, like lightning, ran from the rifles of the IRA</p>
<p>The tans were got, taken out and shot by a brave and valient few Sean Treacy, Dinny Lacey, and Tom Barry's gallant crew. Though we're not free yet, we won't forget until our dying day How the black and tans, like lightning, ran from the rifles of the IRA</p>

<p>The Minolta XE-5 is a 35mm SLR body that features a Copal-Leitz metal blade shutter with stepless speeds in "AUTO" mode and selectable speeds in one-stop increments in manual mode. Maximum shutter speed is 1/1000th of a second. The XE-5 is similar in nature to the XE-7, however the XE-5 lacks the built-in viewfinder shade and the window to view the current aperture in the viewfinder. The XE-5 was developed in conjunction with Leica, which shows in both fit and finish on the production cameras. The XE-5 can be fired without a battery in "X" mode where the shutter speed is locked at 1/90th of a second, which is also the maximum flash-sync speed for the copal-leitz shutter. Bulb exposures can be fired without a battery, this makes taking pictures of star trails or other long time-lapse events ideal with this body. The XE-5 can use all MC and MD mount lenses in Auto(Aperture priority) and Manual mode. Stop-down metering is available for lenses that lack the aperture control ring found on the MC and MD lenses.</p>

<p>Jessica Marie Keranen was born in Sudbury, Ontario on July 6th, 1987 (11 days before Landon Ryan). She was the third of four daughters, and most definitely the cutest. People argue that Donna should qualify as the cutest because she's the baby, but they're mostly the people who haven't met Jessica.</p>
<p>Jessica was educated at R.H. Murray Public School in Whitefish, and graduated as valedictorian (well, co-valedictorian anyway, but Andrea says that Jess is the better orator anyway) in 2001. She then entered Lively District Secondary School in Lively, and spent four years alternately fending off unwelcome advances from the boys in her grade (who outnumbered the girls in their grade 10:1 at least), playing sports and studying her lovely behind off. The latter activity is what earned her an award from the Knights and Ladies of Kaleva upon her graduation from LDSS in 2005. (Although she went all the way to NOSSAA for tennis in 12th grade.)</p>
<p>Jessica currently attends Carleton University in the engineering program. Her interests include photography (it's more of a part-time hobby that she dusts off when she's bored), astronomy, memorizing entire Disney movie dialogues with her best friend Leah, and visiting with her blue-eyed boyfriend, Billy.</p>
<p>She likes shiny things, stars, piercings and coffee, or any combination of the four. (Coffee that comes in a shiny star-shaped cup that comes with a free piercing coupon!!!)</p>

<p><i>From Apology to Utopia; The Structure of International Legal Argument</i> (first published 1989) presents a critical view of international law as an argumentative practice that attempts to remove the political from international relations. It is shown how international law is vulnerable to criticisms of being either an irrelevant moralist <a href="../../../u/t/o/Utopia.html" title="Utopia">utopia</a> or an apology to <a href="../../../r/e/a/Realpolitik.html" title="Realpolitik">Realpolitik</a>.</p>
<p><i>The Gentle Civilizer of Nations: The Rise and Fall of International Law 1870-1960</i> (2001) has two agendas, first of which is to develop an intellectual history of international law, and to offer a critique of that history. The second is to offer a sociology of the profession of international law, using biographical studies of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hersch_Lauterpacht_1f51.html" title="Hersch Lauterpacht">Hersch Lauterpacht</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Schmitt_71ba.html" title="Carl Schmitt">Carl Schmitt</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Morgenthau_4ebc.html" title="Hans Morgenthau">Hans Morgenthau</a>.</p>

                Manchester City Centre Management Company 
                             PRESS RELEASE 
</pre>
<p>27 July 2006</p>
<p>Canal Street goes continental</p>
<p>Photo opportunity - Monday 31 July - 6pm at Taurus, Canal Street, Manchester city centre New screens in place on Canal Street, extended tables &amp; chairs Roger Barberis, Manchester City Centre Management Company Chief Insp. Mark Lee, Greater Manchester Police</p>
<p>Launch of Canal Street goes continental on Monday 31 July 2006 at 6pm for 6.30pm at Taurus Bar, 1 Canal Street. Refreshments will be available from 6pm until 7.30pm.</p>
<p>The unveiling of the new outside seating areas on Canal Street is finally here.</p>
<p>Monday 31 July sees the launch of a new look to licensed drinking areas on Canal Street, developed between Manchester City Centre Management Company, the Village Business Association (VBA) and Manchester City Council. Each bar and restaurant on Canal Street will have a clearly demarcated area, defined by new screens, which will add to the look of this picturesque canalside street.</p>
<p>The new scheme will enhance the ambience of the area and embrace a more continental style of al fresco dining and drinking; with these designated areas the whole look of the street will be visibly lifted and improved, creating an even more pleasant and welcoming area for the customers and residents alike. It will also mean that the 'no street drinking' regulations will work more simply and will reduce street nuisance in the area even further.</p>
<p>In addition to these improvements, Manchester City Council has introduced a road closure on Canal Street at busy times, which will mean the street is a safer place to eat, drink and socialise. Manchester's Gay Village is famous for being a unique, friendly and well visited area, and this is due to continue for years to come.</p>
<p>Gordon Reid, Chief Executive, Manchester City Centre Management Company said "The Village is a distinctive and very special part of the city centre's identity and we are pleased to be working with businesses in the Village to promote a quality offer though this imaginative scheme. Manchester's Gay Village is a significant destination and attracts visitors from around the world. This scheme will really inject a new lease of life into Canal Street and by working together we can continue to develop this vibrant area of the city centre."</p>
<p>Phil Burke, Chair of the VBA said "Thanks to the work of the City Centre Management Company, all the businesses have come together to ensure that this scheme is of huge benefit to the area. With the regeneration in other areas of the city it was important that The Village didn't stand still – and these new attractive and user friendly spaces, adding to the already existing range of exciting and lively bars and restaurants, mean the Gay Village is once again a leading light in Manchester's social scene."</p>

<p>· The consumption or carrying of alcohol has been prohibited by law in Manchester city centre since 2000.</p>
<p>· The extension of traffic restrictions on Canal Street has enabled the extension of the tables and chairs area outside premises.</p>

<p>Howard Clinton Zahniser (1906-1964) was executive secretary of The Wilderness Society from 1945 until his death in 1964. In his capacity with The Wilderness Society, Zahniser wrote the first draft of the Wilderness Act in 1956, which was introduced that same year into the U.S. House of Representatives by Congressman John P. Saylor of Pennsylvania, and into the U.S. Senate by Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota. Zahniser was the main proponent of the Wilderness Act over the subsequent eight years that it took to finally pass the legislation, including overseeing numerous rewrites and attending all 18 public hearings on the bill.</p>
<p>Zahniser died of heart failure in May of 1964, just a few months before President Lyndon Johnson signed the Wilderness Act into law in September of that year. The Wilderness Act established America's National Wilderness Preservation System, which today permanently protects more than 106 million acres of the nation's federal public lands for the benefit of future generations of people and wildlife alike.</p>

<p>"Dear aunt, let’s set so double the killer delete select all" is an Engrish phrase produced by Microsoft Vista in July 27, 2007. Vista product manager Shanen Boettcher gave a demo to showcase the simplicity of Vista's new speech recognition technology. The idea was to show how easy it would be to write an simple letter in Microsoft Word. Unfortunately the demo did not go well and when Shanen said "Dear mom [comma]" the software understood it as "Dear aunt [comma]." Next Shanen spoke "fix aunt" and the software understood this as "let's set." Shanen next spoke "delete that" and then "delete that" and then "delete that" once more which the software wrote out as "so". Next Shanen addressed the audience by saying "I think it's picking up a little echo here" followed by an immediate "delete select all," which the program promptly wrote instead "double the killer delete select all."</p>
<p>The total wording by Vista's speech recognition technology came out as "Dear aunt, let's set so double the killer delete select all."</p>
<p>It is quite possible that this saying or the part "let's set so double the killer delete select all" will go down as the next "All your base are belong to us," a popular Engrish saying throughout the internet made possible through a poor translated video game called Zero Wing.</p>

<p><b>Pyramid Spiritual Societies</b> Movement was started by Brahmarshi Patriji in the year 1990, with the sole mission of creating intense awareness amongst all the people of the world about the Science of Meditation and its primary role in providing Physical, Mental and Intellectual Health and Well-being to all.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Brahmarshi Patriji</b>’s dedicated efforts, since 1992, have resulted in hundreds of Pyramid Spiritual Societies being established throughout India, beginning with the States of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.</p>
<p>Under the auspices of the Pyramid Spiritual Societies movement, thousands of Pyramid Meditation Centres have been started in several places. Pyramid Spiritual Societies and Pyramid Meditation Centres serve individuals in their quest for spiritual wisdom and right living.</p>
<p><br />
<a href="../../../m/e/d/Meditation.html" title="Meditation">Meditation</a> is the finest way to increase one's personal energy. Meditation is easy and not difficult as usually thought to be. It is a knack, which can be mastered by anyone and everyone with regular practice. Meditation begins with 'Ana-pana-sati'.</p>

<p>Roland Mann is a writer/editor of comic books. He began his writing career in 1988 with a series entitled CAT &amp; MOUSE published once by EFGraphics and then later by Aircel (Malibu Comics). With the help of artists and friends Steven Butler and Mitch Byrd, Roland began the packaging company Silverline and packaged several titles for publishers. In 1992, Roland went to work as an editor for Malibu Comics where he edited The Protectors, Dinosaurs For Hire, Ex-Mutants and others. In 1993, the Genesis line was cancelled and Roland became an editor with the Ultraverse. In 1994, Roland was named Managing Editor and then became a Marvel employee when Marvel Comics bought the entire line of Malibu titles. In 1996, Marvel shut down the entire Malibu division. Roland then revisited Silverline and began publishing the titles himself. Silverline last published THE SCARY BOOK in 2000.</p>

<p>Andreas Huebner is an Evangelist. He is frequently visiting the United States and Canada. He is traveling around the world conducting "Mass Miracle Crusades". Andreas Huebner has reached millions of people with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, especially in third world nations, such as Pakistan, India, Indonesia and many nations of Africa. He is also holding faith conferences to encourage the believers to reach the world with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Especially Andreas Huebner's crusades in the Third World are accompanied by supernatural "miracles", including the healing of the blind, crippled and those impaired of hearing. Andreas Huebner claims that God fulfills the promises of the Bible if people confess them with their mouth and believe them with their heart. He proclaims that by his death and resurrection, Jesus Christ has made healing possible for all those who believe. Although his teachings often sound like those of famous Word of Faith teachers like Kenneth E. Hagin, Kenneth Copeland, Frederick K.C. Price, Creflo Dollar and others, Andreas Huebner is conducting his crusades in co-operation with churches from all biblical denominations. Many people compare his style of preaching to that of german evangelist Reinhard Bonnke.</p>
<p>On His website, Andreas Huebner encourages his visitors to send him their prayer requests, but he also states: "Do not stop taking medicine or undergoing treatment before your physical healing has been verified by a medical doctor."</p>
<p>Quotes by Evangelist Andreas Huebner:</p>
<p>"There are no religious denominations in heaven. God is not interested in the name of your church, but rather if we have received Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior and follow him with all our heart!"</p>
<p>"I refuse to think in low dimensions. I refuse to pray in religious modesty. God does not call this kind of prayer 'humble' but rather 'of little faith'."</p>
<p>"If I do not expect anything from God, I will not be disappointed – but I will not be blessed either."</p>

<p>Selkirk Communications Limited was among Canada's largest broadcasting group owners until its sale in 1988, with 14 radio stations (Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Blairmore, Lethbridge, Grande Prairie, Elkford and Vernon), television stations (CFAC-TV in Calgary-Lethbridge, CHCH-TV in Hamilton and partial owner of CHEK-TV, CHAN-TV and CHBC-TV in BC), a half interest in CABLE-TELEVISION systems serving Winnipeg and Ottawa and a 7.5% interest in Canadian Satellite Communications Inc (CANCOM).</p>
<p>Selkirk's other holdings include interests in radio in the UK; cable television in the US; the marketing of broadcasting advertising in Canada and the US; and radio news services in Canada. Selkirk also owned R-Tek Corporation, an international manufacturer and distributor of phonograph records in 7 countries, and Westwood One Canada, a distributor of syndicated radio programs in Canada and the US.</p>
<p>In 1986, the total assets of Selkirk were $227 million, with revenues of $172 million. Amid controversy SOUTHAM INC gained 47.3% of Selkirk's nonvoting shares and 20% of its voting shares in early 1988. Southam sold its interest to rival Maclean Hunter later that same year, and MH sold the western broadcast holdings to WIC Western International Communications Ltd in Dec 1988. The remaining portions of Selkirk were swallowed by MH and the company ceased to exist.</p>

<p>Richard Alan Diespecker (1907-1973) Dick Diespecker was many things to many people. Son, husband, father, poet, school teacher, radio program producer, veteran, newspaperman and public relations practitioner and even that description may not suffice to describe this man’s life.</p>
<p>As to radio, Diespecker spent almost twenty years at CJOR in a variety of positions in news, current affairs and drama. His broadcast career started in 1937 – the highlight – a hair raising jaunt up a cat walk on the newly constructed Lions Gate Bridge by doing a live broadcast to his radio audience.</p>
<p>He received the following awards for his work: 1947 Beaver award - distinguished service to Canadian radio 1948 University of Ohio “Columbus” award for cultural programs 1949 Canadian radio award for documentaries – ‘Battle of the Fraser’ - coverage of valley flooding of 1948.</p>
<p>Dick was born March 1, 1907 in Adstock, England and received some of his education there, in South Africa and in Victoria. He attended both Victoria College and the University of BC. He tried teaching but moved quickly to newspapers with Vancouver Star in 1927, Vancouver News in 1932, and the Victoria Colonist in 1934. The Second World War saw a brief radio career put on hold as Dick was off to the army ending that part of his life as a Major seconded to the radio bureau in Ottawa. Best known to veterans for his “Prayer for Victory”. Once the conflict was concluded it was back to CJOR and drama production and current affairs reporting. Later he was hired by The Vancouver Province as radio columnist and commentator. As a writer he produced “Between Two Furious Oceans” 1944, Elizabeth, an ode to his mother in 1950, ‘Rebound’ 1953 and Three Windows West 1956.</p>
<p>Radio and audiences were changing… Rock and Roll was on its way. Diespecker left for the USA in 1958 to start new jobs in advertising and public relations. He became an American citizen in 1964 and died in San Francisco nine years later. He was 65.</p>

<p>For a period of time around 1980-'81 I worked as a pilot for Ernest Bennett the father-in-law of Baby Doc and it was his daughter Michele Bennet married to Haitis' Ninth President-for-Life and while I never met Michele Bennet personally it is verifiable from history sources in Haiti that where ever a picture Baby Doc appeared, which was nearly everywhere including the offices of Ernest Bennet, on the post picture of the President was also photo of the beautiful Michele Bennet beside him.</p>

<p>The source I list would be anyone with knowledge of Haiti at the time of Baby Doc as these posters were printed in large numbers showing Michele Bennet with the President and there should still be some around somewhere. There should be some objective source in Haiti including the U.S. Embassy there to verify the information. There are also pages on reputable websites about the man I worked for Ernest Bennet and he later re-entered Haiti and with a group of other men was arrested and there were pleadings filed before the United Nations over his supposed illegal jailing and these reports on Ernest Bennet can be found by putting in his name at www.google.com</p>

<p>İsmail Cevheri, or İmam Cevheri, is a Turkish intellectual and scientist who was interested in Arabic language and literature, Arabic calligraphy, natural sciences, mathematics, physics and theology. He was born in the mid 10th century. He traveled to Iraq, Damascus, Hicaz to excel his knowledge of Arabic language and culture. He finally settled in Nisabur, in modern Iran, and became the teacher and the imam of the Big Mosque in the city. Here, he also wrote one of the most extensive Arabic dictionary to that date, called, Kitabu-s Sihah.</p>
<p>He was also carefully observing the different flight styles of birds in the sky and was making calculations which are not available today. Some time around 1002, he appeared at the porch of the minaret of the Big Mosque in Nisabur and addressed the public claiming that he discovered a unique novelty and also stating that an example for the future generations was unfortunately not available. He tied two appendages to his body and threw himself into space proclaiming that he would fly. The appendages could not carry his weight and he hit the ground with great speed gettıng kılled immediately. His move was considered extremely odd at the time and some people thought he had gone crazy. However, it is now widely accepted that he has been an inspiration to later fliers like Lagari Ahmet Çelebi and Hezarfen Ahmet Çelebi. He is regarded as the first Turkish air martyr.</p>

<p>In 1947 Whipstock was created and designed by Louisianian Country Harris. Whipstock would be a faster and more efficient way for oil companies all over the world to drill and distribute oil. Before Whipstock, oil companies used a method called, "straight hole drilling". Straight hole drilling required more time and effort. Whipstock would make this procedure more efficient by allowing the drill bit to drill diagonally saving valuable time and money.</p>

<p>Roland Mann is a writer/editor of comic books. He began his writing career in 1988 with a series entitled CAT &amp; MOUSE published once by EFGraphics and then later by Aircel (Malibu Comics). With the help of artists and friends Steven Butler and Mitch Byrd, Roland began the packaging company Silverline and packaged several titles for publishers. In 1992, Roland went to work as an editor for Malibu Comics where he edited The Protectors, Dinosaurs For Hire, Ex-Mutants and others. In 1993, the Genesis line was cancelled and Roland became an editor with the Ultraverse. In 1994, Roland was named Managing Editor and then became a Marvel employee when Marvel Comics bought the entire line of Malibu titles. In 1996, Marvel shut down the entire Malibu division. Roland then revisited Silverline and began publishing the titles himself. Silverline last published THE SCARY BOOK in 2000.</p>

<p>Jesus Was A Communist Jesus Was A Capricorn was written and preformed by country singer/songwriter Kris Kristofferson. The song starts with a bit of a "lesson" on Jesus."Jesus was a Capricorn he ate organic foods/he beleived in loving peace and never wore no shoes/long hair bared and sandals and a funky bunch of friends/ reckon majors made him up if he'd come down again. The song's main point is that you have to have someone to hate on.</p>
