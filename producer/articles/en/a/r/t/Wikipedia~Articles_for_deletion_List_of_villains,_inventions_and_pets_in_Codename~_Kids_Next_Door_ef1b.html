An indiscriminate list of non-notable, apparently mostly single appearance items.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Contents would not be appropriate as individual articles, but as an aspect of an existing show that is notable, description of them is quite valid content on Wikipedia. Complaints about cruftiness indicate a need for clean-up, not deletion. In fact, that is language I would avoid in an AfD. Can you use different, less offensive language instead? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:21, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I don't find "cruft" offensive in the slightest. If you object to "cruft," then go with "indisciminate list of non-notable, apparently mostly single appearance items." Not everything that appears on a television screen is notable, even if it appears on-screen during a notable program. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 02:28, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm sure you don't find use of the term cruft offensive, you used it. However, I find it offensive, and I ask you to respect that feeling. It's derogatory and should be avoided. Is there some reason you couldn't have used some more neutral language instead? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 06:10, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Getting back to the subject at hand, since these things are hallmarks of the series, I can't understand deleting them. These things are often intrinsic to the plot of the episode they are in, not just minor things like gas stations. It's clear to me that if you're writing an article about the episode these things are in, you'd include them, so I have no problem with it being presented in this other format. So, I have to ask, are you familiar with this show? Because it seems to me that deleting this would be akin to deleting an article listing aliens in Star Trek, or places Sam Beckett jumped to in Quantum Leap. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 06:10, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I very well might vote to delete such articles depending on how I felt after reviewing them. I would <i>definitely</i> vote to delete an indiscriminate list of one-off ST aliens and pets and I'd vote to delete a list of, say, one-off outfits, cars and siblings-of-leaped-into people from QL. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 14:10, 10 January 2007 (UTC
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't, because AFD is not a vote. I also wouldn't argue such, as that kind of list would be highly informative about the show. Personally, I wish <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Quantum_Leap_characters_5a68.html" title="List of Quantum Leap characters">List of Quantum Leap characters</a> had a description of the leapees instead of just names. I'm glad <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Trek_races_8de7.html" title="List of Star Trek races">List of Star Trek races</a> does. And perhaps you should review them, and consider this list in that context. Now I don't think every car in QL should get an article. I can't think of any car that would even warrant a description. In KND the vehicles do matter though, a lot. Again, are you familiar with this show? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 16:51, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh dear god, are you really going to get all Peter Pedantic because I said "vote"? I <i>know</i> AfD isn't a vote and you know as well as I do that any number of people refer to the process casually as voting. And as I've been trying to explain, my objection to this list is that it is <b>indiscriminate</b>. It lists villains AND inventions AND pets indiscriminately, and it lists items which appear in a single episode and are otherwise completely lacking in notability either within or outside the series. I would not object to a list of Star Trek aliens. I would object to an indisctiminate list of ST aliens AND pets AND whatever, and I would object to an indiscriminate list of QT outfits AND cars AND siblings. If the individual villains are notable, make a list of villains. If the individual pets are notable, make a list of pets. If the individual members of this list aren't notable then slapping them all together on a list doesn't make them notable. Note them in articles for the episodes if they exist or get rid of them. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 18:29, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, but did I offend you by noting that an AFD is not a vote? I didn't mean to do so. I've had people chide me for the same mistake. I realize that it is one, but I try to resist being irritated by having my mistakes pointed out. It is hard though, so I understand if you were offended. My bad. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:17, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Back to the article, this isn't an indiscriminate list, not in general, as the episodes of Codename: Kids Next Door are about these very things. I think the problem is, you're confused by the list title, which I can see is misleading. That may be part of the problem. I should have realized this sooner, my bad. What this is, is a list of the things used by the bad guys in the show. I'm not sure of a better title, but I do agree it needs one. However, given the nature of the show, I can understand why a list might be important. But it is not as much like the example you gave of ST lists and QL lists. There's actually a pretty solid connection there, but if you aren't familiar with the show, you might not recognize it.</dd>
<dd>Which leads to me repating my question though, are you familiar with this show? I've asked several times, but I can't find a response by you on it. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:17, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The criteria for notability is universal, not relative to the issue it pertains to. For instance, just because 1. Quantum leap is notable and 2. The description of leapees in Quantum leap is important to the show Quantum leap, does not mean that a description of leapees in Quantum leap is notable. Same goes with local issues- if an issue is only notable to a particular subset of people, it doesn't meet the notability criteria. Although "Codename: Kids Next Door" may be a notable television show, that doesn't imply that every aspect of the show is notable. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnpseudo_5ea4.html" title="User:Johnpseudo"><b>johnpseudo</b></a> 19:47, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This isn't about every aspect of the show, but a particular aspect of it that is as definitive as Star Trek's Aliens or Quantum Leap's leapees.
