<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is <i>not</i> consistant. Arguments of "We have articles on those insignificant things, so we must have an article on <i>this</i> insignificant thing" are very wrong in my opinion.

<li>If being a candidate in any location is the same, then candidates in any location should actually be treated the same when their articles show up on Wikipedia. But they're not. Unelected Canadian candidates get AFD'd; unelected American candidates get kept. "We have articles on those insignificant things, so we must have an article on <i>this</i> insignificant thing" is a blatant mischaracterization of the real issue; it's more accurately described as <b>"these two things of precisely <i>equal</i> significance to each other are being treated <i>differently</i> from each other based on some criterion not communicated in Wikipedia guidelines"</b>. It's <i>entirely</i> understandable in such circumstances that some people might suspect the mystery criterion to be "American vs. not-American". <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 19:53, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> First off, not all candidates are equal. As a denizen, I can elucidate that running for the NDP means the candidate has no chance whatsoever to get anywhere close to being elected. The NDP prides itself (and why not) on running candidates in every national riding, but frequently must resort to nn students and the like, since in no-hope ridings like, oh say, every single riding in Quebec, few else can be bothered. Some seem to be putting the cart before the horse with respect to the notabilty of these candidates. Running for election because an individual has achieved notability is one thing, and certainly a number of candidates who lose are, in other respects, notable. But running for office, in and of itself, is not grounds for establishing notability. Finally, <b>shame</b> on any Canadians who hide behind systematic bias as a basis for inclusion. That is unworthy. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 17:23, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

It is a guideline and not a hard-and-fast regulation. The candidates are in the middle of their 15 minutes of fame. Right now they are big news (locally and in Canada), people want to know about them, and they want to tell people about themselves. However, the vast majority will disappear in a few weeks.

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Merge</b>. I really don't understand the argument that candidates of major parties deserve their own articles simply by virtue of running for election, given that in this particular case, this guy's only apparent claim to fame once the election is over is that "he is an avid enthusiast of the Metro". I agree with <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a>'s comments. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 19:35, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The "merged candidate list" solution creates problems of its own, but to date it's the only workable solution anybody has found to balance some people's concerns about the notability of unelected candidates against other people's equally strong concerns that selective inclusion constitutes a political bias.

<li>Why would redirect to multiple pages be necessary?

There doesn't seem to be a problem of them popping up between elections. As for the internal wikilinks, they would need to be made in context of the discussion, to not wikilink to a redirect.
