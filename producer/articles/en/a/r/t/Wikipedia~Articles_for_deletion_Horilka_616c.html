<p><b>Comment</b> I find it absolutely inacceptable to discuss this issue without notifying people who could shed the light on the issue, namely Ukrainian wikipedians. So far it is a competition of amateurs doing original research, with the exception of Russian wikipedians who may be biased. Therefore I notified Ukrainian, Polish and Russian notice boards and suggest the <b>extension of the voting period</b>. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 16:43, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Can't you read what I have written? "Horilka" means <a href="../../../v/o/d/Vodka.html" title="Vodka">vodka</a>. Even your linked article says so; quoting for lazy readers: <i>I could never understand why people drink horilka (horilka is Ukrainian for vodka)</i>. Of course, vodka is a notable and verifiable cultural drink in Poland (called wódka or gorzałka there), Belarus (водка, гарэлка ), Russia (водка), and Lithuania (degtine). `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 03:39, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I quote from the reference: "a story of horilka, Ukrainian vodka". It may mean generic vodka, but in the Ukranian language and context it refers to the Ukranian vodka; even the WP <a href="../../../v/o/d/Vodka.html" title="Vodka">vodka</a> article mentions the Ukranian variety. Hence it is not just a translation but part of the Ukranian culture, per the reference, which does a good job of putting it in perpective. If there are equivalent sources describing local beverage varieties in other countries, they would be includable also. I guess the issue is whether it merits its own article vs. being merged into <a href="../../../v/o/d/Vodka.html" title="Vodka">vodka</a>, which is of course an option. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 03:48, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is a fairly common trick to slip in some national words to add some national flavor. Even in "brotherly" Russian language sometimes Ukrainian words are used, eg. "divchina" (a <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girl.html" title="Girl">girl</a>), to stress that we are speaking about an Ukrainian maiden, as, eg in the song "Chernobrovaya divchina" ("Black-eyebrowed Girl"). But of course I hope no one will come up with a crazy idea to write an article "divchina", despite 42,700(!) google hits and despite the fact that divchinas are a quite distinctive subclass of <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girl.html" title="Girl">girls</a>&#160;:-).`'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 09:46, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think you'd agree that generically, <a href="../../../v/o/d/Vodka.html" title="Vodka">vodka</a> is at least as famous as <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whiskey.html" title="Whiskey">whiskey</a>. If whiskey can have separate articles for many of its famous national varieties (<a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotch_whisky.html" title="Scotch whisky">Scotch</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_whiskey.html" title="Irish whiskey">Irish</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bourbon_whiskey.html" title="Bourbon whiskey">bourbon</a>, <a href="../../../r/y/e/Rye_whiskey.html" title="Rye whiskey">rye</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_whisky.html" title="Canadian whisky">Canadian</a>, as DvonD notes below), why can't vodka? Just because this is the English Wikipedia doesn't mean that Eastern varieties get lumped into a single article while Western varieties warrant individual articles. This is not a <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICDEF_eedd.html" title="WP:DICDEF">WP:DICDEF</a> issue, as <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horilka.html" title="Horilka">horilka</a> has significant cultural connotations, per <a href="http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20052/156" class="external text" title="http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20052/156" rel="nofollow">the reference</a>. The only issue is justification of separate article-hood vs. being shoved (merged) into a one-size-fits-all 'vodka'. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 13:41, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Didi you notice some significant differences betweeen <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotch_whiskey.html" title="Scotch whiskey">Scotch whiskey</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_whisky.html" title="Canadian whisky">Canadian whisky</a> etc. and horilka? First, all of them are "whiskeys", and "Scothch" is a just a popular shorthand. Second, I cannot imagine a sentence like this: <i>To be called Scotch whisky, the spirit must conform to the standards of the Scotch Whisky Order of 1990 (UK),</i> in horilka article. Horilka <b>is not a brand</b>. See eg. <a href="http://www.members.shaw.ca/mburianyk/horilka/ggate.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.members.shaw.ca/mburianyk/horilka/ggate.htm" rel="nofollow">this horilka pic</a>.

Also, I understand that horilka has political and nationalistic connotations in Ukraine, and while I do not know much more about these myself, it is an area of the article that could yet be added. <a href="../../../d/v/o/User%7EDvonD_6d1e.html" title="User:DvonD">DvonD</a> 11:42, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's not bullshit, but it is light writing. The author covers a lot of oral folklore, unfortunately without sources.

<dd>The "journalism bullshit" is from a tourism and cultural journal with an editorial board that fact-checks articles (that's what a journal's editorial board does). It has international distribution in English-speaking countries with over 200,000 of each issue printed. Calling it "journalism bullshit" is much like calling the New York Times' webpages, editorials, or articles bullshit.

Usually this happens to sockpuppets who are forgetting that they are writing under new account and start acting as aged editors. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 04:00, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>delele</b>. No solid evidence provided that horilka is anything else but vodka (which may be flavored, as the <a href="../../../v/o/d/Vodka.html" title="Vodka">vodka</a> article says). May I also bring to your attention the fact that when googling for "horilka" in the first several pages (of not co big number of hits, by the way) I didn't find any manufacturers or importers of this drink. Whereas "vodka + ukraine" immediately gives plenty links to "Manufactureres, Suppliers, Factories, Exporters" and of course, brands.</li>

<dd>And recent addition about "traditions" is simply funny: a tradition to get drunk on a good occasion is worldwide and is certainly doesn't make "horilka" something different from vodka. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 18:06, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I think ridiculing or belittling a national custom is contrary to WP rules. The source clearly mentions Horilka as part of the Wedding tradition. It doesn't say 'Vodka'. Someone reading that article, who is not sure what Horilka is, could then click on 'Horilka' in WP and learn all about it. This is WP's mission. Remember the only issue for us to decide at an AfD is "is the subject's notability well sourced". IMO there is little doubt that Horilka is notable as the Ukranian variety of Vodka. And per above, lumping all Vodka varieties inside one <a href="../../../v/o/d/Vodka.html" title="Vodka">Vodka</a> article because it is an Eastern European drink, while all Whiskey variants get their own articles because they are Western, runs counter to WP's mission to inform all people about all cultures, not just focus on Western culture. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 22:25, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please describe the the <b>national</b> custom I ridiculed from which it is clear that hiorilka is something different than vodka. Drinking dead during weddings is <b>not</b> a national custom. The article you quoted about "tradition" merely lists a purchase of various food for wedding, with vodka just one item. To call a feast after wedding a "<b>national</b> tradition" is ridiculous. It is a worldwide tradition. Please provide reference where it describes that horilka is something else than flavored vodka, i.e., horilka is a <b>brand</b> of vodka like <a href="../../../c/h/a/Champagne.html" title="Champagne">champagne</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabernet.html" title="Cabernet">cabernet</a>.

Many nations have a favorite drink, often several local varieties. The national varieties often are similar in different countries, but they are not identical, and they have a national characteristic and identity. As long as a given country has well sourced notability for its own local drink variety, it is acceptable on WP.

<p><b>Comment</b> I also find it absolutely ridiculous to discuss thi issue without notifying people who could shed the light on the issue, namely Ukrainian wikipedians. So far it is a competition of amateurs doing original research, with the exception of Russian wikipedians who may be biased.

<li><b>Keep</b>—In <i>Taras Bulba</i>, Nikolai Gogol wrote <i>gorelka</i>, and not <i>vodka</i>, because he knew the drink has a cultural significance. His translators simply write "vodka" or "corn-brandy," because the English language doesn't acknowledge the significance, and they didn't think they could convey what all Russians and Ukrainians know in a brief footnote. And so the English reader's understanding of Gogol's work is diminished in a small way.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Remember again <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" rel="nofollow">that WP is not paper</a>. This means that once reliable notability is established, our goal is to help our readers. All you need to do is imagine someone reading an article related to Ukraine, seeing Horilka mentioned, then clicking on the WP entry, and getting all s/he wants to know about it. Label pictures, the cultural connections, the Taras Bulba quote, the various peppers and spices that are added for taste, the reference articles, etc. IOW, once that person reads our article s/he would become educated as to what Horilka means, much more (and easier) than searching some Ukranian dictionary which will never have this potential wealth of information. Our not being paper allows us to better serve our readers, and this would be a good example. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 23:33, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>all reasonable articles say that "horilka is ukrainian word for vodka". Cultural connections about drinking vodka during various feasts is laughable to present as "national ukrainian tradition". It is a misinformation of readers, not information. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 02:39, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Source #2 says: "The Scots drink Scotch whisky; the French drink wine; the Germans drink beer, and the Arabs drink coffee — to provide just a few obvious examples. For the Ukrainians horilka is probably the most widely consumed liquor and it sort of gives it the status of “a national drink.”". You say it's the same as the Russian vodka, just a different word. If so, it would not be a "national" drink. It also says "Ukrainian horilka for quite the wrong reasons is often referred to in the west as “Russian vodka.”". Again, there is a distinction made. All I am saying is that Horilka can stand on its own feet in its own article, without getting lumped into a common <a href="../../../v/o/d/Vodka.html" title="Vodka">Vodka</a> article, just like the Western <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whiskey.html" title="Whiskey">Whiskey</a> varieties have their own individual articles, per <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" rel="nofollow">WP is not paper</a>, as we noted above. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 03:00, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK. I looked thru all of them, (it is #1 now, btw), and I see it is "Welcome to Ukraine". A piece of advertisement bullshitting again: "most widely consumed liquor". Who run the statistics? Who separated Ukrainian vodka from Polish, belarussian, russian, moonsihine, etc.? I can agree that <b>all</b> brands of vodka together give "the most drinkable" status. But the quoted statment without any solid ref is just a random speculation. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 03:26, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>My point was not to show there is scientific statistical proof that Horilka labeled bottles are consumed more than others in the Ukraine, although I suspect it's true. My point was simply to show that we have a source saying that Ukrainians consider Horilka, not 'vodka', their national drink. We also know that Horlika (as a bottle label) typically contains various spices that make it 'stronger and spicier' than Russian vodka. Bottom line: Ukranians consider Horilka, not vodka, their national drink, and Horilka is typically stronger and spicier than Russian vodka, hence it deserves its own article, just like the Western national varieties of Whiskey have theirs. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 03:40, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
