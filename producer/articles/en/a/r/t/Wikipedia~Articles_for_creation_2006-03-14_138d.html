<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-03-14_138d.html" title="Edit section: Third World">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_World_e346.html" title="Third World">Third World</a></span></h2>
<p>The Beginning</p>
<p>Third World is a social organization founded in 1998 by Manan Shah, Kamal Buttar, and Ali Najmi. It was originally composed of a few students from different schools around the New York City area who all lived nearby. Centered at Stuyvesant High School, the group‚Äôs members consisted of students from Bronx Science High School, Cardozo High School and Environmental Studies High School. However, it was the Stuyvesant grouping that would expand the quickest and eventually would consist of almost fifty members.</p>
<p>Building a Reputation</p>
<p>After a year, Third World at Stuyvesant grew to such a large number that it had quite a presence within the school‚Äôs community. Consisting mainly of students of South Asian decent, this original lineup of Third World became involved in many confrontations in high school. These confrontations eventually lead to them building up a strong reputation that many students came to fear and respect. It also led to them building lasting friendships with other groups within the Stuyvesant community such as CCC.</p>
<p>The Fourth Floor</p>
<p>During this time, the members mainly hung around on the fourth floor, an area that came to symbolize Third World (I guess you could say literally too, remember how dirty that place was?). It provided a refuge for the students when they needed some place to escape to from the daily grind of classes (if they actually went to classes). It was here that most of the memories of Third World are centered, from the rumbles to the games of manhunt through the school‚Äôs hallways. The fourth floor became a little alcove for Third World and all their friends.</p>
<p>Greater Outreach</p>
<p>By its third year of its existence, Third World had fortified a strong niche within the school‚Äôs community. Nevertheless, it was during this year that three dub‚Äôs influence expanded to encompass the entire school and not merely be relegated to being another little group. Third World began recruiting and broadening its diversity. So much so, in fact, that it no longer was identified as just a group for South Asian students. More notably, Third World started playing an active role within the Stuyvesant community. By the year‚Äôs end, Third World touted both the vice president of the school body and the vice president of the senior class as well as many other notable positions in the school government. The year that followed began a transformation for Third World since it marked a transition from a ragtag collective to an actual close-knit organization where all the members became good friends. This was sparked by the many times that the members were there for another, most notably during September 11th when everyone part of 3dub had one another to help them through the day‚Äôs events.</p>
<p>A New Era</p>
<p>The beginning of the 2002 school year began a new era for Third World. Most of the members had graduated including the founders and the original members. The responsibility of keeping Third World‚Äôs tradition fell on a class that was reeling from seeing it‚Äôs membership shrink from almost fifty members at its peak, to less than ten by the start of the school year. However, undeterred, these few members quickly expanded 3dub once again, recruiting a new slew of members encompassing a wide variety of people and personalities giving it a great dynamic. The smaller size of Third World during this time proved to be more rewarding in that it allowed for a tight unity between every member. This year also marked the launch of the affiliate t-shirts, a very successful endeavor that just proved testament to the influence Third World still had at Stuyvesant.</p>
<p>Third World: Present and Beyond</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the last class of Third World students graduated from Stuyvesant in the year 2004. However, Third World left an indelible mark on Stuyvesant‚Äôs psyche (also on the walls and desks). Every member has gone on to attend prestigious colleges around the country and are on track to become successful members of society. However, even though they may have made new friends and joined new circles, the people part of 3dub and those that they were close to will never forget the memories they made through high school. It marked an innocent time when all everyone cared about was having fun and not getting caught by their teachers while cutting classes (the later being something I wasn‚Äôt very good at). Many of the members still stay in touch with one another, though it isn‚Äôt the same - we‚Äôve all grown and have become adults. But, ultimately, those memories forged in high school will always be there, and I‚Äôm sure that as the year‚Äôs go by, whenever any of us meet again, we will always have those memories to talk about: the rumbles, the games of manhunt, those great train rides, the rumbles in the train rides, the wildly successful basketball tournaments, glue in the SU, and the BBQs among many more. We still have our annual BBQ which gives us an opportunity to get together and relish on memories past, but we all know that those times are well behind us. But, no matter what, we will always have those memories of great times and, most of all, great friends.</p>

<p>Arthur Barnett's is a Dunedin, South Island based department store operator. Historically they have only had stores in the South Island. As well as their flagship store in what is now the Meridian Mall in Dunedin, Arthur Barnett also had stores in Balclutha, Alexandra and Oamaru (Otago towns). Arthur Barnett took over the ailing D.I.C department store company in 1990. The D.I.C had stores throughout New Zealand and should have prived a good geographical match for Arthur Barnett. D.I.C had 4 stores in the Auckland market, New Zealand's biggest. However, the merger did not work well and all D.I.C stores with the exception of Christchurch were closed within 2 years. The Christchurch store was re-branded as Arthur Barnett's and refurbished within a new mall development in the city's centre. The Alexandra and Balclutha store were closed or sold off during the 1990s, and the Christchurch store was closed in 2006. The company now has the one department store, which dominates the top-end of the market in Dunedin, selling branded furniture, cosmetics and clothing. The store's future is in doubt as the Farmers department store chain moves up-market nationwide, placing pressure on smaller department store operators.</p>

<p>Stinky Peterson is a <i>fictonal character</i> on the TV show <i>Hey Arnold</i></p>
<p>Stinky is the residant redneck of the show, living on a farm, (despite the fact the show takes place in a New York type place)and all of his relatives are named Stinky as well.</p>
<p>Stinky is a one of those country boys, tall, warm hearted, and a wee bit out of the ordinary. Stinky was rarely seen being mean to people,the only notable sassy remarks would include the episode <i>Arnold Betray's Iggy</i>, and <i>Weird Cousin</i>. Despite Stinkey's warm heart, he was sometimes ritaclued. For instance in the episode <i>Helga's Boyfriend</i> where Helga abuses Stinkey's affection for her by using him to make him look like her boyfriend to attrack Arnold's attention. Another episode, <i>Stinkey's Pumpkin</i>, is an oppurtunity we get to see Stinkey's family, you can tell they don't have much money, living in a small hillbilly- like hut with a porch swing, screen door, etc. The most notable ridacule episodes is <i>Stinky Goes Hollywood</i>, in which Stinky tries out for a commercial for Ya- Hoo Soda (a spoof of the milk drink "YahooTM"), and he then becomes popular, soon, he learns the agent has been using him the whole time because he's such a "reject" as the agent says. But he still seems to be close friends with many characters including Arnold, Sid, and Harold.</p>

He is Yoshi's best friend, and is among popular with people who have played Super Smash Brothers Melee. He is currentely part of a grand prix called Yoshi Kart <a href="http://www.http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2556092/18/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2556092/18/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and is one of the Yoshi Kart racers.</p>
<p>He has been among one of the most popular fan-made characters used in the SSBM section, and he could become one of the most recongnize fan-characters of SSBM. He has made over 18 appearances in fanfiction, and has made 2 appearances in a series of short sprite comics on DevaintArt <a href="http://www.http://www.deviantart.com/view/29316049/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.http://www.deviantart.com/view/29316049/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="http://www.http://www.deviantart.com/view/29318554/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.http://www.deviantart.com/view/29318554/" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.</p>
<p>He will appear in 7 more short sprite comics, as well as 4 more fanfics. Here's some info on his stats:</p>
<p>Color: Yellow</p>
<p>Appearance: Has a sturdy body with four legs, and a circle for a head with a reptialian snout</p>
<p>IQ: 20</p>
<p>First Appearance: Yoshi's First Adventure <a href="http://www.http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2509152/1/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2509152/1/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>If there's a possible chance in the future, it is likely that if fan-characters are allowed in a fan0made game based off of SSBM, it is likely that Peppy will appear.</p>

<p>Gayle Dean Wardlow, commonly refereed to as ‚ÄúThe Godfather of Delta Blues‚Äù and most closely associated with innovative and reveling research on Robert Johnson, Wardlow is considered to be the World‚Äôs foremost leading authority on Mississippi Delta Blues; and most especially so, in the sub-category of <i>Country Blues</i>.</p>
<p>Wardlow was born in the very small town of Freer, Texas, in 1940, to a Mississippi family who had temporarily relocated to Texas in order to be involved in Texas oil field construction projects. Upon the death of his father, when Gayle was only six years old, the family returned to Meridian, Mississippi, where young Wardlow was raised.</p>
<p>While in high school, starting at the age of 16, Wardlow spend most weekends traveling alone into the Mississippi Delta to interview all of the old Blues musicians that he could find, recording oral histories, anecdotes, songs, and remembrances in general. This was done of his own volition while he was nothing more than a local white high school kid in the ‚Äò50's, and it was done without any training as a researcher. He did this simply because he had a thirst for knowledge coupled with a burning interest in, and abiding respect for, the particular subject matter. Furthermore, it‚Äôs a practice that he continues to this very day.</p>
<p>In the process of this lifelong research, Wardlow became the world‚Äôs leading authority on Delta Blues and most especially so in the sub-category know as <i>Country Blues</i>. Along the way, he amassed the world‚Äôs largest and most valuable collection of 78 RPM Blues records, many of which are the sole remaining examples of not only particular songs, but also certain individual musicians or musical groups of the period and the genre.</p>
<p>As Mr. Wardlow was growing into young adulthood, he developed a keen interest in politics, investigative journalism, and sports news, which spurred him on to earn degrees from Belhaven College, The University of Alabama, and The University of Southern Mississippi. As a result of this education and his interest in sports, Wardlow served as Sports Information Director at Livingston University, and ultimately in the Sports Information Dept. at The University of Alabama, under the direction of Paul ‚ÄúBear‚Äù Bryant, himself. Wardlow later spent time as a journalism professor at various universities.</p>
<p><br />
Mr. Wardlow has written several books and published innumerable articles in learned journals, academic publications, and Blues magazines in the U.S. and dozens of foreign countries over the last four decades. Recently he has had great success with his latest book, Chasin‚Äô <a href="../../../t/h/a/That.html" title="That">That</a> <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil.html" title="Devil">Devil</a> Music: <a href="../../../s/e/a/Searching.html" title="Searching">Searching</a> <a href="../../../f/o/r/For.html" title="For">for</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/The.html" title="The">the</a> <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blues.html" title="Blues">Blues</a>, which received rave reviews and which also covers new ground-breaking information on Robert Johnson. The book is available at most book stores, including Barnes &amp; Noble and Amazon.</p>

<p>Houston Summers Recent NWHS Graduate Selected in Major League Baseball Draft</p>
<p>Houston Summers, a Summerfield native and recent Northwest High School graduate, was selected in the 47th Round of the Major League Baseball amateur draft Wednesday by the Arizona Diamondbacks. He is the first draft choice directly out of Northwest High School baseball program in school history. He joins Jamie Hemingway, a former Northwest baseball player who was drafted by the Atlanta Braves after his stellar college career ended at UNC-Wilmington in 2003, as the only Northwest High School baseball players to be drafted by professional baseball teams. Houston was the 1,393 overall pick in the amateur draft, held over two days on June 7th and 8th. Also this spring, Houston signed a college baseball scholarship to attend Virginia Tech University. If he chooses to go to college, his professional rights will be relinquished by the Diamondbacks and he will not be eligible to be drafted again until after his third season of college baseball. Negotiations between the Diamondbacks and the Summers family will begin soon. The Summers family is being advised by former major league player and owner of the North Carolina Baseball Academy Scott Bankhead.</p>
<p>Houston has been the starting catcher at Northwest for the last two years, achieving all conference and all area honors. As a junior, he was selected to play in the North Carolina State Games and played on the Colt Word Series qualifying team from Greensboro. This summer he has been selected to serve as a member of team North Carolina in the annual North Carolina-South Carolina High School baseball challenge. Also, he was selected to the West Team in the North Carolina East-West Senior All Star Game. Additionally, at Northwest High he is an honor roll student and member of the National Honor Society.</p>

<p>(slang, 2005)</p>
<p>"Baby bump" is a slang nickname given to the stomach of a pregnant human female. Usually, it's applied to women in an early stage of pregnancy, where the abdomen is just beginning to bulge.</p>
<p>It's often seen on tabloid magazine headlines, referring to a newly-pregnant celebrity in an effort to sell the magazine (example: "Angelina's/Jessica's/Britney's Baby Bump! First Pictures!").</p>

<p>Todd Wills and Sam Menter from the outskirts of Bristol in the UK, have always been musically together somehow, from days as kids in a band to the partnership they have today. Like their hometown influence Massive Attack, Cities Of Foam worked with a number of vocalists and musicians in order to create the lush soundscapes of their debut album, "A Great Day For The Race".</p>
<p>Holed up in a studio in France which they had to build from scratch before recordings, "A Great Day For The Race" features up-and-coming London jazz vocalist Nia Lynn, who features on the album's outstanding futuristic jazz of "Out Of Reach". Other collaborators include vibraphone player Jim Hart, of his eponymous jazz quartet's fame, who is a masterpiece of control and subtlety on "Goldtop", and trombonist Eddie Rieband.</p>
<p>"It's dance music that is rarely danced to. We wouldn't call it Chill Out; we prefer 'Slow And Considered'".</p>
<p>First single "Last Man Standing" showcases the many sides to their sound perfectly. The title track is a slow dance record which builds and builds with each layering of sound to form a warm jazz vibe, while flipside "Barry Can't Do Flat Tops" is a Knowing nod to the multicultural influences which surround the port town of Bristol, with an insidious melody married to loping ska/dub beats and jazzy horns.</p>
<p>"Maybe something in the Bristolian psyche lends itself to a lower BPM," quips Todd Wills on describing their influences such as Massive Attack and Portishead. However their musical loves are wide ranging. Their omnivore attitude can be seen in the duo's reverential love for musicians as diverse as Wills' favorites The Clash, The Smiths, Nick Drake, and classical composers Arvo Part and minimalist Steve Reich, whose sound can be heard echoing throughout the album, as well as Menter's love for Roy Ayers and the songwriting skill of Bob Dylan.</p>
<p>"Electronic with an emphasis on live playing" is their definition of a sound which has drawn comparison to Lemon Jelly and Zero 7. It is this married to their range of influences which make Cities Of Foam an enticing new prospect.</p>

<p>Shirgah - Location: 17 km south of Ghaem-shahr (8.2 km north of Shirgah) Shahpoor River Site.</p>
<p>On the east side of the Ghaemshahr-Shirgah highway is an area of approximately 150 ha on high ground that has a good gradient for draining ponds to the north toward the Tadjo River. Most of the water for irrigating this area is obtained via irrigation canal from the Shahpoor River which on October 23,1968 had a flow of only about 400 gpm (25 l/sec.). At the bottom of the slope, however, is the Tadjo River with an estimated 700‚Äì1,000 gpm (63 l/sec.) flow of which a part is used to irrigate 6 to 7 ha of the same area. Water can be pumped to the desired elevation from the Tadjo or from the Shahpoor River which is located a short distance across the railroad tracks west of the area. Normally water would reach this area by gravity from the Shappor via canal. A low dam across the Shahpoor immediately below the highway bridge crossing the Shapoor would be required for a more permanent means of diversion than exists there now.</p>
<p>This area would also be suitable for rice pond fish culture because many of the rice field bunds are already high enough for fish culture of this type.</p>
<p>The possibilities of obtaining more water or all water by gravity from the Tadjo should be studied with engineers' level and rod.</p>

<p>Extreme Hill Jumping is a little known sport which has existed for at least six years.Although not offically a sport it can be highly competitive. <b>Rules</b> The rules of the game are that the contestants have to run down a very steep hill,which may have obsticles on itsuch as small cliffs,trees or heather.The winner is the last person to keep running,ie to the bottom of the hill.Or the one who continues and doesn't drop out.Different "jumpers"can challenge each other by running down more dangerous and extreme slopes.Due to the intense level,injuries can be sustained,and if ever created as an offical extreme sport then saftey clothing would possibly be worn. Seen recently on The Vauxhall Astra Sport Hatch advertesment,where one of the "jumpers" jumps down the mountain in the pursuit of the aforementioned car.</p>

<p>During the late fifties, a considerable interest arose in Quantum Mechanical Perturbation Theory. Among several techniques, the partitioning of the Hilbert space into two subspaces is a valuable tool in several branches of Quantum Chemistry, for instance in the formulation of semiempirical theories.</p>
<p>The partitioning may be carried out by means of projection operators. The Schrodinger equation may be written in the form <span class="texhtml"><i>M</i><i>C</i> = 0</span> with <span class="texhtml"><i>M</i> = <i>H</i> ‚àí <i>E</i> &lt; <i>d</i><i>e</i><i>l</i><i>t</i><i>a</i> &gt;</span> Partitioning this set into two parts a and b, one obtains</p>

<hr />
<p>Commonly refereed to as "The Godfather of Delta Blues" and most closely associated with innovative and revealing research on Robert Johnson, Wardlow is considered to be the World‚Äôs foremost leading authority on Mississippi Delta Blues; and most especially so, in the sub-category of Country Blues.</p>
<p>Wardlow was born in the small town of Freer, Texas, in 1940, to a Mississippi family who had temporarily relocated in order to be involved in Texas oil field construction projects. Upon the death of his father, when Gayle was only six years old, the family returned to Meridian, Mississippi, where Wardlow was raised.</p>
<p>While in high school, starting at the age of 16, Wardlow spend most weekends traveling alone into the Mississippi Delta to interview all of the old Blues musicians that he could find; recording oral histories, anecdotes, songs, and remembrances in general. This was done of his own volition while he was nothing more than a local white high school kid in the ‚Äò50's, and it was done without any training as a researcher. He did this simply because he had a thirst for knowledge coupled with a burning interest in, and abiding respect for, the particular subject matter. Furthermore, it‚Äôs a practice that he continues to this very day.</p>
<p>In the process of this lifelong research, Wardlow became the world‚Äôs leading authority on Delta Blues and most especially so in the sub-category know as Country Blues. Along the way, he amassed the world‚Äôs largest and most valuable collection of 78 RPM Blues records, many of which are the sole remaining examples of not only particular songs, but also certain individual musicians or musical groups of the period and the genre.</p>
<p>As Wardlow was growing into young adulthood, he developed a keen interest in politics, investigative journalism, and sports news, which spurred him on to earn degrees from Belhaven College, The University of Alabama, and The University of Southern Mississippi. As a result of this education and his interest in sports, Wardlow served as Sports Information Director at Livingston University, and ultimately in the Sports Information Dept. at The University of Alabama, under the direction of Paul "Bear" Bryant, himself. Wardlow later spent time as a journalism professor at various universities.</p>
<p>Mr. Wardlow has written several books and published innumerable articles in learned journals, academic publications, and Blues magazines in the U.S. and dozens of foreign countries over the last four decades. Recently he has had great success with his latest book, Chasin‚Äô <a href="../../../t/h/a/That.html" title="That">That</a> <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil.html" title="Devil">Devil</a> Music: <a href="../../../s/e/a/Searching.html" title="Searching">Searching</a> <a href="../../../f/o/r/For.html" title="For">for</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/The.html" title="The">the</a> <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blues.html" title="Blues">Blues</a>, which received very positive reviews and which also covers new ground-breaking information on Robert Johnson. The book is available at most book stores, including Barnes &amp; Noble and Amazon.</p>

<p>Sometime between <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercedes-Benz_be95.html" title="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a> introduced the SmartKey, a plastic key fob to be used in place of the traditional metal key. Electronics that control locking systems and the ignitions made it possible to replace the traditional key with a sophisticated computerized fob. With the adoption remote keyless entry several years earlier, Mercedes-Benz felt the SmartKey was the next intelligent step in key technology. The SmartKey fob adopts the remote control buttons from keyless entry into the SmartKey fob. Although, once inside a Mercedes-Benz vehicle, the SmartKey fob unlike keyless entry fobs, is placed in the ignition slot where a starter computer verifies the rolling code. Verified in milliseconds it can then be turned as traditional key to start the engine. The device was designed with cooperation of <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siemens_AG_5145.html" title="Siemens AG">Siemens</a> Automotive and Huf exclusively for Mercedes-Benz yet many luxury manufacturers have imitated the technology. The SmartKey's electronics are embedded in a hollow, triangular piece of plastic, wide at the top, narrow at the bottom, squared-off at the tip with a half-inch-long insert piece. The side of the SmartKey also hides a tradtional Mercedes Huf key that can be pulled out from a release at top. The metal key is used for valet purposes such as locking the glove compartment and/or trunk before the SmartKey is turned over to a parking attendant. Once locked manually, the trunk cannot be opened with the SmartKey or interior buttons. The key fob utilizes a radio-frequency transponder to communicate with the door locks, but it uses infrared to communicate with the engine immobilizer system. Original SmartKeys had a limited frequency and could have only been used in line-of-sight for safety purposes (for Summer mode). In addition to the SmartKey, Mercedes-Benz integrates as an option Keyless Go; this feature allows the driver to keep the SmartKey in their pocket, yet giving them the ability to open the doors, trunk as well as starting the car without ever removing it from their pocket. The Keyless Go SmartKey was originally offered only in SmartCard format although the SmartKey Card has been discontinued in favor of the chrome SmartKey.</p>

<p>Often referred to as "AE," ASCII Express was a telecommunications / terminal program from the early days of Modems and BBS's on the Apple ][ computer. ASCII Express contained a password-protected "BBS" mode that would allow users to upload and download software from the BBS Operator's computer, in a mode similar to FTP.</p>
<p>This software played a key role in the early days of software piracy on the Apple ][ and in the discemination of hack/phreak information through text files.</p>

<p>"It is evident that the primes are randomly distributed, we just don‚Äôt know what 'random' means."</p>
<p>-- R.C. Vaughan</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The purpose of this work is to look into some long pondered questions. First, is the distribution of primes across the number line random? Next, what is random anyway? Finally the theories and axioms derived are used to solve the long discussed ‚ÄúPrime Twin Problem‚Äù to show possible applications of the understanding of what it means to be random.</p>

<p>Martin Fallon is an IRA bomber who tries to blow up a troop truck but instead kills a bus load of school children. He loses heart and quits the movement and goes to London trying to leave the U.K. and start a new life. The IRA wants him back (he knows too much) and the local crime boss, Meehan, will only help him if he performs one last hit, on a rival crime boss. When Fallon does perform the hit, he is seen by a catholic priest. He refuses to kill an innocent again and must find a way to escape the police without killing the priest who can identify him.</p>

<p><a href="../../../i/n/s/INS_77dd.html" title="INS">INS</a> IPControl is a next-generation software system that enables service providers and enterprises to dramatically improve their IT infrastructure operational efficiency and service levels by automating IPAM and DNS/DHCP server configuration. Using IPControl, most organizations are able to realize a return on investment of between 150 to 500% over 3 years from automating manual processes. In addition, by automating IP management using IPControl, organizations can reduce network downtime by 15% or more and create a more stable IT infrastructure capable of supporting companywide end-to-end service delivery.</p>
<p>Unlike current generation IP management products that have failed to keep pace with modern IP network architectures and rapidly evolving DHCP and DNS feature sets, IPControl supports multi-tiered addressing, multi-homed hosts, DNS views, DHCP client classes, transaction signatures, and much more. In addition, IPControl saves you time by providing unmatched feature extensibility with server templates, DNS/DHCP option and policy dictionaries, and user-definable attributes for devices, subnets, containers, alerts, device types, and naming policies. All of this enables you to manage your IP name and address space the way you want to manage it, not the way your software tool dictates.</p>
<p><b>IPControl Key Features and Benefits</b></p>
<p>Enables you to model, discover, configure, and manage your name and address space in accordance with how your IP network is structured</p>
<p>Provides significant user control to define attributes, fields, policies, and hierarchies, allowing for unsurpassed flexibility and extensibility</p>
<p>Delivers comprehensive reports, including IP address utilization history and forecasting data, to improve capacity management and audit tracking</p>
<p>Streamlines the DNS/DHCP configuration process</p>
<p>Features an advanced GUI that simplifies navigation, address management, and configuration</p>
<p>Self-contained hardware version available - IPControl Sapphire Appliance</p>

<p>Kana Sohma, a fictional character from the ever popular manga Fruits Basket, used to be Hatori Sohma's girlfriend. They loved each other very much, but broke up when Hatori asked Akito Sohma for his permission for them to marry. Akito got extremely angry and injured Hatori's eye badly, almost making it blind. Kana was very upset and blamed herself for Hatori's injury. Soon, she grew almost insane with depression and her heart broke. So Hatori, not wanting to see his love suffer anymore, erased the memory of him and Kana loving each other. Kana Sohma left, and although Hatori missed her greatly, later in the book he starts dating a teacher of Tohru Honda's.</p>
