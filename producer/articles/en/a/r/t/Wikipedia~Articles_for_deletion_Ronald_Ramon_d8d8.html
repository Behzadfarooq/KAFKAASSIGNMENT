<p>Contested prod. Prod was taken off with no comment or further edits to the article. This looks like a vanity article on a non-notable college basketball player to me. While I agree that articles on some college basketball players may be appropriate, I don't believe this person is notable enough. No real claims to notability that would distinguish himself among other college basketball players. Are we to have articles on every college basketball player? I think not. It can be remade if he ever makes it to the NBA. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 20:23, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi there. I am writing in rebuttal to the possible removal of my article specifically for notability reasons. Ronald Ramon is cureently a spohomore at the University of Pittsurgh and obviously has already made a name for himself. I already presented evidence that he has received several awards within the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_East_Conference_f830.html" title="Big East Conference">Big East Conference</a> which should justify his placement as a notable individual. He has already found success on an elite basketball squad and has already been to the NCAA Tournament on two occasions. A major point I feel we must look at is the fact that team leader <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Krauser_c536.html" title="Carl Krauser">Carl Krauser</a> has graduated and Ronal Ramon will step into his place. Ramon has been able to play at an elite level despite getting little or not as many minutes as he should under Carl Krauser and obviously battling with the fact that he has had his two young and least productive college years. Ramon has been a very influential player on the Pitt squad and in the Big East and for this he deserves to stay. College basketball analysists such as <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Vitale_6152.html" title="Dick Vitale">Dick Vitale</a> have broadcasted for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Pittsburgh_9287.html" title="University of Pittsburgh">University of Pittsburgh</a> and have been impressed with his long ball and general athletic and basketball ability. I see Ramon as having enough importance to be on Wikipedia and his importance will only improve. If we were to remove the Ronal Ramon article we should remove any and all college basketballa rticles for the simple fact that they are worth no monetary value for their basketball at this point. To say that, well players like J.J. Redick have better records would be illogical ecause at that point we would have to set some reasonable standard for what record a player would have to set for admittance into this encyclopedia. For eample do they have to be a stat leader for 1 year against their peers, several years, all time? Obviously to have to set a standard for what an award is worth and more importantly what award is needed for entry is completely and totally absurd. I feel Ronald Ramon's performance which has been renowned by his peers and experts proves that his name deserves to be included in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/e/e/User%7EJeeps2009_cb7b.html" title="User:Jeeps2009">Jeeps2009</a> 20:27, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The extent of his notability is earning "All Big East Rookie Team Honors", and it doesn't even specify if it was first team or not. If we used this for criteria for inclusion we would be adding hundreds of basketball players throughout history that were all-conference freshmen who's careers never progressed past that. My personal standards for not nominating a college athlete's article for deletion is at MINIMUM earning first team NCAA All-American honors. I wouldn't create an article on one unless they won an NCAA award for being the best in their position, or did something equally notable. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 21:31, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The point I was making through his Big East hiors as well as interteam honors it the fact that the young Ronald Ramon is regarded as a great young player. When one tries to place a standard on the requirments for a college basketball player, I feel the general rule of thumb should be does that person deserve to have an article. At this point I have already written the entire article so there is no other real "labor" if you could call writing that left. The aticle could use some cleanup using the AWS or whatever. Back to the argument about placing a standard, there are many great players who do not win the player of the year or an NCAA award. Also, why do we have pages for "newer" coaches who have not yet won an NCAA award. What makes Pitt's coach <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Dixon_6134.html" title="Jamie Dixon">Jamie Dixon</a> notable. It is that he belongs to one of the most elite college basketball programs in the country. So what has Ramon accomplished:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>National reconition in respected basketball talk programing</li>
<li>All Big East Rookie Honors</li>
<li>Game winning shot in double overtime vs. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notre_Dame_c734.html" title="Notre Dame">Notre Dame</a></li>
<li>New York All City Team</li>
