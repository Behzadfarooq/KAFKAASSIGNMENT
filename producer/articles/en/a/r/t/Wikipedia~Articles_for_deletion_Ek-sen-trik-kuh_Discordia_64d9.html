<p>I smell a hoax.</p>
<p>As a religion or a website, this fails miserably. Apparently it's a sect of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discordianism.html" title="Discordianism">Discordianism</a> practiced by a small circle of followers, and the <a href="http://www.loveshade.org" class="external text" title="http://www.loveshade.org" rel="nofollow">website</a> isn't even rated on Alexa, and has only one incoming link.<a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=www.loveshade.org&amp;url=loveshade.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=www.loveshade.org&amp;url=loveshade.org" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Well, okay, if it's not a notable religion or notable website, is it a notable criminal case? I'd say yes, but I can't find any evidence whatsoever that the child pornography or terrorism allegations exist. Google searches only turn up forum/blog posts obviously made by Loveshade/Ek-sen-trik-kuh posters.</p>
<p>I wouldn't mind keeping this if some real evidence of the criminal charges could be offered, but I'm betting this one's a hoax. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 06:25, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wrote this article with <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerina_a4d6.html" title="User:Gerina">Gerina</a>, and while you're entitled to your opinion, I don't think Wikipedia's policy encourages you to say that a religion or website "fails miserably." Whether you like the religion or the website is your own opinion, but isn't reason to call for deletion of an article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know much about an Alexa rating, but the site <a href="http://discordia.loveshade.org" class="external free" title="http://discordia.loveshade.org" rel="nofollow">http://discordia.loveshade.org</a> hasn't been there very long. The beginnings of the work Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia, though, has been around since 1994 and online since 1995. Read the sources I link to in the article--there are references going back to the 1990s. Check the index of the BloodStar site at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/bloodstar84" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/bloodstar84" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/bloodstar84</a> (it was last updated in 2001); or groups.yahoo.com/groups/illuminatusinnersanctum; or <a href="http://appendix.23ae.com/apocrypha/" class="external free" title="http://appendix.23ae.com/apocrypha/" rel="nofollow">http://appendix.23ae.com/apocrypha/</a>; or <a href="http://www.23ae.com" class="external free" title="http://www.23ae.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.23ae.com</a>; or <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Zone/7971/panpleasant/apocrypha.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Zone/7971/panpleasant/apocrypha.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Zone/7971/panpleasant/apocrypha.html</a> (check the index--it was last updated in 1997).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also the Alexa search engine you mentioned gave 388 hits for rev loveshade and 549 for reverend loveshade. Check it out yourself if you don't believe me. And check any version of the published Rev. DrJon Swabey's version of <i>Apocrypha Discordia</i> and you'll find Reverend Loveshade and BloodStar in it. You can also find this has been translated into German.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While it's a joke site, Reverend Loveshade is popular enough that there's an article about him at <a href="http://en.uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Reverend_Loveshade" class="external free" title="http://en.uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Reverend_Loveshade" rel="nofollow">http://en.uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Reverend_Loveshade</a> that's been there for months. If an article there isn't about something important enough for people to get the jokes about, it's deleted. Do a search on Uncyclopedia for Reverend Loveshade and see how many references you can find. I got 22.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the legal parts, the sites are there that show that too. "Stripping Away American Freedom: A Call to Action" which deals with the terrorism is on both BloodStar's site and the new Loveshade site. Check the index of the BloodStar site and you'll see it was posted in December 2001 just like it says. Check my article for the links to the legal problems in Illuminatus Inner Sanctum posted in 2003, or the profile of 2002. Check the links!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I know I'm not supposed to take comments personally, but Gerina and I worked on this article for a month. If you don't believe that, check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Discordianism" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Discordianism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Discordianism</a> and look at the section for Apocrypha and Ek-sen-trik-kuh. We were encouraged to write the article by <a href="../../../d/r/j/User%7EDrJon_05c9.html" title="User:DrJon">DrJon</a> and even by <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenisMoskowitz_1bb7.html" title="User:DenisMoskowitz">DenisMoskowitz</a>. Denis was against it at first until he realized that Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia was originally called "the non-existent Apocrypha Discordia," and had been around and well-know for years. And DrJon compiled the 2001 Apocrypha Discordia, and also encouraged us.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please check the links and you can see there are references to this all over. Gerina and I worked very hard on verifying what we posted.

<dd>Er. It fails the respective notability standards miserably. I'm not passing judgement regarding quality, merely noting that the following is extremely small.</dd>
<dd>Do you have any evidence from a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> that this is a religion with a large following, a popular website, or a major legal case? - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 07:14, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That's why we didn't use just the <a href="http://discordia.loveshade.org" class="external free" title="http://discordia.loveshade.org" rel="nofollow">http://discordia.loveshade.org</a> site.

<li><b>Keep</b> Forget about the criminal stuff that's icing on the cake. Hasn't anybody here mentioned that Greg Hill who wrote <i>Principia Discordia</i> praised Loveshade's work before he died? And that Mark Steele/Icarus who worked on the Illuminatus! comic book for Robert Anton Wilson who popularized Discordianism contributed to Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia, and so did S. John Ross who created Warehouse 23 that was Steve Jackson Games organ for Discordian and other weird stuff? Remember the Steve Jackson Games edition that made Discordianism famous?

<li><b>Comment</b> - Damn Straight! All of these other commenters are members of those Sinister Ministers the Bavarian Illuminati. I know some of them and have had to face off with them over a number of issues. They are trying to infiltrate Wikipedia, you must stop them and their mad dash to get people to think that just because many Discordians are aware of Rev Loveshade, his work, his legal issues and the correctness of his facts, that somehow its actually worthy of the Grand Wikipedia. I warn you, if you do not delete this entry soon, the Illuminati will overtake Wikipedia and all will be lost. The next thing you know servers will get hit with golden apples dunked in fire and brimstone (like carmel but more spicy!).

And I never said that anyone had contributed "0 edits". Please don't put words in my mouth or text in my edit. I am merely pointing about how you and your friends have only contributed to this single article's subject, so you might not realize the fuller scope of Wikipedia, that is all.

"I never said that anyone had contributed '0 edits'" You're right, you didn't. You said, more or less (I see you'd edited your own comment) there are "all these users on WP who have never contributed before except to this single <s>article</s> subject."

<li><b>Response</b> - Yes, I know basic English. So let me explain. If, with the exception of this article, you've done something zero times, then, with the exception of this article, you've never done it. You're focusing on semantics instead of the fact that you made a bold assertion that was verifiably not true.

<p>I was going to stay out of all this, as I am obviously biased. Just for my posting a comment here, some of you may be motivated to rip me to shreds. Go ahead, rip. I've had a lot of life experience and I've been ripped to shreds before. I've learned to lick my wounds, heal, and move on.</p>

That is completely uncalled for. Call my work crap, call me crap, say I deserve to burn in Hell. But please don't hurt them. Maybe they're hoaxers, maybe they're lying. But if they are at least attempting to tell the truth, this is both of their first article on Wikipedia. They worked on it very hard for a month together.</p>
<p>Binky is very hurt, as I think you can tell from her posts. And Gerina, who is fresh out of high school and was very excited about this, is now afraid to even post comments here for fear she'll be torn to pieces. Both of them had been encouraged to write this article by active posters and administrators (see the Apocrypha and Ek-sen-trik-kuh discussion on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Discordianism" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Discordianism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Discordianism</a>). Now, I don't know if either one of them will feel comfortable ever posting here again. Maybe some of you don't care. But I'm hoping some of you do.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Revrend Loveshade is a heretical follower of the Bavarian Illuminati and has long been known as a Discordian Triple Agent (He was a double agent but converted). He has worked closely with Cecil Weishaupt (Great Great Grandson of Adam Weishaupt) in the development of this work. We cannot allow these false groups to overtake the sacred works of Eris K. Discordia. We know that She speaks only to those that have a pineal gland (and we have medical proof that Rev. Loveshade's pineal gland was removed in a secret Masonic rite on the 20th of last month). Therefore, this no-ledge could not have come from Eris, but instead from the False Non-Prophet, known as Auntie Kryst. Could one imagine granting a Wikipedia entry to The Gospel of Judas?!!! Surely not, for Judas' gospel is little known and (until it became popularized by the media) would have turned up few Google entries. This obviously is the same. Revrend Loveshade's apocryphal work sould not only be removed from Wikipedia, but all copies should be found, burned and his additional works banned! - Ratatosk, Squirrel of Discord, Muncher of the ChaoAcorn, Chatterer of The Words of Eris, POEE of The Great Googlie Mooglie Cabal <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 63.72.211.132 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.72.211.132_a7f9.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.72.211.132">contribs</a>).</small></li>
