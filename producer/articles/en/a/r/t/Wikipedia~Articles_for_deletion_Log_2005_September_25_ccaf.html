<p>The mission of the <i>Binary Research Institute</i> is dissemination of the theory that the Sun has got a companion star. The outfit has a <a href="http://www.binaryresearchinstitute.org" class="external text" title="http://www.binaryresearchinstitute.org" rel="nofollow">website</a>, which is rather well done, but doesn't seem to have a presence in the physical world. (At least I couldn't find any). The theory that the Sun has a companion star does exist, but as the pages at the Institute never mention the existing research they are run-of-the-mill crackpots.</p>
<p>Please consider in this context Walter Cruttenden as the founder of the institute, whose page is also up for deletion. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 00:07, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We are not concerned with the <i>veracity</i> of the theory, merely with its <i>importance</i>.

<dd><i>"The ground-breaking and richly illustrated new book, Lost Star of Myth and Time, marries modern astronomical theory with ancient star lore to make a compelling case for the profound influence on our planet of a companion star to the sun."</i> is how the review starts. This is hardly a review, it reads like advertisement copy, and on the PBS website there is no trace of the Cruttenden-sponsored documentary "The Great Year" that is mentioned in the text. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 11:52, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The point is they didn't <i>ignore</i> the institute and the book they published. So why should we ignore them? Don't mistake me, I think the theory is bull, but you wanted a mention, and there's one, no matter how lousy. <a href="../../../o/s/w/User%7EOswax_0a10.html" title="User:Oswax">Oswax</a> 13:39, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

It looks as if the folks at the Institute sent out press releases to everyone and their dog, and some websites did put them up.

<dd>If he financed it himself, then it would seem <i>exactly</i> like vanity press to me. Publication through normal channels proves that the author of the work <i>was able to convince others</i> to put <i>their</i> money where the <i>author's</i> mouth is. A normal book or movie has survived a difficult external review (albeit one based on profitability rather than truth).

<dd>'I do not know if he financed the entire thing himself, or what part of it he did. A more accurate description might be that it was financed through his institute I guess. I have no idea how much came from where. It is obvious that getting knowledge of this theory out into the public is an uphill battle (that might be an understatement), but the theory itself has the <b>potential</b> to alter the beliefs of many millions of people (the entire population of the planet) if it were to be proven true. Like I said before, research is in its infancy, and faces heavy attack from the scientific establishment. Witness what has happened here, within a few minutes of the stub appearing it was marked for deletion. That is the kind of uphill battle Mr. Cruttenden, the Institute, and the theory face. But the potential for it to affect the lives of every human being is there. <i>IP 65.9.158.81</i>

<dd>And <b>when it is proved true,</b> we should have an article about it.

As far as the "Binary Research Institute" goes, it has 300 Google hits, 97 of which are unique. A bunch of these are speaking engagements on the esoteric circuit, the rest are copies of the press release on the movie and Wikipedia entries. There is no indication that the institute or the theory ever hit the mainstream. A Google search for '"The Great Year" Cruttenden' returns 48 unique hits; again many of these are copies of the press release. The movie is self-produced; there is no inducation that Cruttenden managed to find an investor. No indication is given anywhere that it was shown on PBS or anywhere outside the esoteric circuit. Walter Cruttenden himself heads an investment firm with a <a href="http://cruttendenpartners.com/team/team-walter.shtml" class="external text" title="http://cruttendenpartners.com/team/team-walter.shtml" rel="nofollow">staff of three</a>.

Even fervent deletionists can't come up with a good enough excuse for deletion, until you can prove to me this is purely for vanity purposes than I rest on the case that it is a relevant encyclopedic article that ascribes to an Institute founded by a notable individual as can be seen from the notable and reputable background and coverage on the Net. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 13:29, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

If they haven't done anything except self-publish a movie and a book they ought to go.

<p>If this discussion is about the article about the Binary Reasearch Institute, then I would suggest it be kept - i've read it's less than 10 lines several times, and found it not objectionable at all, nor it falls into any category of non NPOV - it's merely a stub about what IS this institute, nothing else. If the pseudoscientific theory they're trying to promote shouldn't be here according to wikipedia (original research) then well, that's another thing - the article about that theory should be deleted. The same about article on Walter Cruttenden himself and the film "The Great Year". Registered at least, hope this helps (BattleTroll)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, thank you Pilatus for proving my point. I couldn't have done it better myself. The rabidness with which you are going about this, and the fact that now you are stalking me and adding "special comments" to my contributions here further proves that these three nominations were in <b>BAD FAITH</b>.

<li>If your edits are only to this and related VfDs Pilatus has every right to point that out. <i>Roughly,</i> 100 diverse edits prove an editor stopping by a VfD is "disinterested" rather than pushing their own cruft or creations. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 18:38, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Conflict of Interest - Question</b>: should the person who nominates articles for deletion also be making changes to those articles? In this case, <a href="../../../u/s/e/User.html" title="User">Pilatus</a> has nominated these three articles for deletion - Walter Cruttenden, <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_Research_Institute_cb5f.html" title="Binary Research Institute">Binary Research Institute</a>, and The Great Year - and has made extensive changes to them. In most of his changes he leaves behind typos and grammatical errors, broken links, and straggling headers (i.e., after he's removed everything that was under a header), not only messing up other users' work but leaving the article in much poorer shape than it was before. He also deletes extensively, and removes categories and stubs aggressively. He goes in after anyone adds anything to an article and removes everything the other person contributed. He seems to be working to <i>increase the chances for deletion</i> of the articles. In light of this, it would be appropriate, in order to avoid this obvious <b>conflict of interest</b>, for the person who nominated the articles to refrain from modifying them until the decision has been made? <a href="../../../s/y/u/User%7ESyug_2b31.html" title="User:Syug">Syug</a> 21:06, 28 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Most articles up for deletion are not judged upon the quality or quantity or their content, but rather the appropriateness or notability of the topic. Any edits that Pilatus may have made to the content of the article are irrelevant, for he cannot make a worthy topic unworthy by bad grammar or misspellings. <a href="../../../o/s/w/User%7EOswax_0a10.html" title="User:Oswax">Oswax</a> 21:47, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>AfDs are closed by an admin who was not involved in the debate to prevent conflicts of interest. The offer still stands: instead of complaining feel free to add content to improve the article. Also note that there is broad consensus for my edits. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../s/y/u/User%7ESyug_2b31.html" title="User:Syug">Syug</a>, your comments are vague and general. We're talking about one particular article here. I infer that you think Pilatus has intentionally damaged the article in order to influence voting. Which are the specific edits where you think he's done this? I looked at one case of an editor "(correcting more Pilatus syntax errors)" and it didn't look to me like anything that would affect voting. Your own edits, which he removed, didn't seem like anything that would have led people to vote "keep" had they been left in. Nor do I see any evidence in the discussion that anyone is complaining about typos or grammatical errors or using them as a reason for deletion. If you think that Pilatus has been deliberately damaging the article in order to influence people to vote for deletion, you really should open a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> on this. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 16:25, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

Instead of crying "Oppression", why don't you list Walter Cruttenden's achievements? <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 17:20, 27 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have no reason to list his achievements, they are readily availble on the net for all to see. They were included in the articles, with links, and you deleted them. The fact that you feel the need to stalk me and add the stupid disclaimer above to my contributions in the deletion pages only further proves my assertion that these three nominations you made are in <b>BAD FAITH</b>. Why are you so afraid of Walter Cruttenden, his Binary Research Institute, and the film they produced that you must work so hard to censor them? You vandalized the articles, removing other people's contributions, you hang here 24 hours a day making sure your supress any information that appears. I am no longer suspicious, after reviewing your history here, I am <i>certain</i> that you have hidden agendas and ulterior motives. Furthermore, if one were to apply the unbelieveably strict standards you are setting up for these three articles to all the articles on Wikipedia, half the articles would be deleted immediately, and on further consideration, few of the other half would survive. They'd be lucky if 10% of the articles survived. I repeat, this is <b>BAD FAITH</b>. <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarthian_7789.html" title="User:Earthian">Earthian</a> 17:38, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Conflict of Interest - Question</b>: should the person who nominates articles for deletion also be making changes to those articles? In this case, <a href="../../../u/s/e/User.html" title="User">Pilatus</a> has nominated these three articles for deletion - Walter Cruttenden, <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_Research_Institute_cb5f.html" title="Binary Research Institute">Binary Research Institute</a>, and The Great Year - and has made extensive changes to them. In most of his changes he leaves behind typos and grammatical errors, broken links, and straggling headers (i.e., after he's removed everything that was under a header), not only messing up other users' work but leaving the article in much poorer shape than it was before. He also deletes extensively, and removes categories and stubs aggressively. He goes in after anyone adds anything to an article and removes everything the other person contributed. He seems to be working to <i>increase the chances for deletion</i> of the articles. In light of this, it would be appropriate, in order to avoid this obvious <b>conflict of interest</b>, for the person who nominated the articles to refrain from modifying them until the decision has been made? <a href="../../../s/y/u/User%7ESyug_2b31.html" title="User:Syug">Syug</a> 21:06, 28 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Most articles up for deletion are not judged upon the quality or quantity or their content, but rather the appropriateness or notability of the topic. Any edits that Pilatus may have made to the content of the article are irrelevant, for he cannot make a worthy topic unworthy by bad grammar or misspellings. <a href="../../../o/s/w/User%7EOswax_0a10.html" title="User:Oswax">Oswax</a> 21:47, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. There is exactly zero primary evidence for Cruttenden's notions about the Sun being part of a binary system.

<li><b>Comment</b> As the author of the comic, I figure I should at least make a few comments here. I didn't write the article, and haven't made any claims about the comic's popularity apart from the fact that it has on occasion made the top 40 on some of the voting lists (buzzComix, TopWebcomics, Webcomics List). I was surprised when the article appeared, since it didn't meet the original notability guidelines at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Webcomics_eab2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics">Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics</a>. It did meet the alternate proposal guidelines (and the alternate alternate ones, with well over 500 comics), though. But I'm not the one interpreting the guidelines, and I can't exactly claim that Station V3 has a great rank on Alexa or an especially active forum! I'll leave this up to you guys - the article's been copied over to <a href="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Station_V3" class="external text" title="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Station_V3" rel="nofollow">Comixpedia's wiki</a> and expanded there anyway. - Axonite 02:01, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Transwiki</b> to Wikibooks Cookbook, and</s> <b>delete</b>. Recipes are <i>not</i> encyclopedic — they are how-to's. If the article were to discuss the concept of a Goodbye Russia with Love cocktail, or its impact on society, or on cocktailing, or perhaps if it had some interesting history or some media attention for some reason beyond being alcoholic, then it would have some encyclopedic mileage.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. The nominator appears to retract in their later comment (perhaps an accident, but important nontheless) — since some cleaning has been done their later comment certainly leans in the direction of a keeper. Given the work that was done and the wavering of the nominator, and the lack of an outright consensus to delete, I'm not persuaded that there is a rough consensus on what should be done, so I shall do nothing. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 21:08, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Although I have just excised the worst of this blatant adspam (contact details etc), IMDb does suggest they have distributed (<i>but not made</i>) many films <a href="http://imdb.com/company/co0006990/" class="external autonumber" title="http://imdb.com/company/co0006990/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. This rather inflates their Google count, I expect, since they will be in the small print all over the place. Whether doing something that is not notable of itself (distribution) and collecting lots of small-print mentions adds up to corporate notability, I am unsure, but doubtful. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 01:35, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. Well, the numbers are towards three-quarters at 11d-5k. This is the kind of debate that could be swayed by work during, though. That does not appear to have happened as the deleters continued to stack up throughout. Also, Piecraft's comment though numerically I put it as a keep, sounds more like a <i>categorify</i>, without any particular desire to retain the article. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 21:18, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I've moved the unsourced entries—that is to say, all of them—to the article's Talk page and replaced the opening sentence to one similar to the opening of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_believed_to_have_been_affected_by_bipolar_disorder.html" title="List of people believed to have been affected by bipolar disorder">List of people believed to have been affected by bipolar disorder</a>, namely "This is a list of people accompanied by <b>verifiable source citations</b> associating them with hypochondria." This means the number of valid items presently on the list is zero. I've also added <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Levant_9da0.html" title="Oscar Levant">Oscar Levant</a> to the list on the talk page, as I'm about 99% certain he has discussed this in his own autobiographies, and our article on him asserts that he was a "notorious hypochondriac." I sort of think sources can be found for Samuel Johnson and Hans Christian Andersen. I think it is sloppy and irresponsible to put up an unsourced list like this and expect others to do the work of digging for verification.

<li>Shinra Online has been one of the longest consistently running communities on the Internet, which is astounding given it has no real content other than the forum itself to keep people coming back. SO was once said to be the forum equivalent of a cult film; this can be seen in its hardcore member base, as it is ranked #6 out of ~1,400 on Big-Boards.com (a site dedicated to statkeeping for forums possessing over 500,000 posts, a milestone in all itself) for average posts per user. <b>Keep It</b>. <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerk_7bbd.html" title="User:Gerk">Gerk</a> 07:11, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep It</b> For the record, I am one of the admins over at www.shinraonline.com and having read some of these comments, there are a few errors which I would like to take a moment and address and correct.</li>
</ul>
<p>1. It was one our members who approached us asking to create this wiki article to record some of the sites rich history. You can read that for yourself here: <a href="http://shinraonline.com/board/showthread.php?t=139474" class="external free" title="http://shinraonline.com/board/showthread.php?t=139474" rel="nofollow">http://shinraonline.com/board/showthread.php?t=139474</a></p>
<p>2. Why are you using Alexa Rank? Everyone knows that its not a true estimate or accurate guage of a sites popularity since only a select portion of surfers use thier software. If you would like some better statistics, try our google rank of 4 (not bad) or our stats over at www.big-boards.com where we are ranked 581 in posts made just last week, this is great considering slashdot, dslreports, offtopic and howardsterns forum rank at the top of these lists. We are also ranked very close to the top in other catagories.</p>
<p>3. "No evidence of notability" - our site and our reputation are duly noted at a dozen other internet sites.</p>
<p>We are also the creators of the "forum points and store system", a system which was copied onto every major bulletin board package available, including phpbb, and has had well over 5 thousands unique installations across various incarnations. Please see <a href="http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?t=35267" class="external free" title="http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?t=35267" rel="nofollow">http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?t=35267</a> for some of the demand prior to its first release in which even a vbulletin developer said they may code something akin to it.</p>
<p>4. We are not a commerical site, at this time all expenses are paid out of pocket with the occassional member initiated donation. We have no advertisements, no adsense, nothing. We make not one dime, it's a labor of love.</p>
<p>Now that that has been said, I personally think the article itself could use some work as I feel it would be more appropriate to chronical the actual history of the site rather than list the forums we have which change continuously but like all articles, this was something a member initiated and not something I or any of the staff had been actively engaged in until this moment.</p>

<p>Non-notable website, or at least fails to provide a purpose for its existence on how it adds to the project of documenting the total sum of human knowledge. For one, it seems to <i>detract</i> from human knowledge by representing subjective opinion as fact, while not adding anything significant. This is different from the addition of a <a href="../../../s/c/h/School.html" title="School">school</a>, for example. Looks like a POV advertisement with severe factual inaccuracy, with weasel word statistics. Plus, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>, but it argues that it will soon "become a hot spot on the internet". Way to go. I have no doubt the vain author will engage in an edit war over this to try to find some excuse or justification this outrageous act of misinformation and obvious intent to deceive the public, but I rest my case.

Evidently not a delete, but much uncertainty over whether to merge or keep outright, especially as several people give both options without a conditioning (note to such editors: it's hard to know what you really want.) -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 21:24, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I agree. This is a mere discussion of the meaning, origins and usage of this particular slang phrase. It has already been transwiki'd to Wiktionary. See <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/banana" class="extiw" title="wikt:banana">wikt:banana</a>. Note, however, that <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/transwiki" class="extiw" title="m:transwiki">transwiki</a> is a pagemove from one Wikimedia project to another, not a deletion from the project altogether. As such, transwikis do not have to be discussed first on AFD. This particular pagemove has been contested and is being discussed on the article's Talk page. I would ask that the interested parties make their comments on the article's Talk page instead of duplicating the conversation here. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 14:01, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, that's a false analogy. "Nigger" is a word with a long history associated with social and historical ideas. In fact, it's the title of two books and a play, and has <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Nigger%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Nigger%22" rel="nofollow">1.7 million</a> google hits. "Banana" is a word of far less significance and of recent invention. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">Neutrality</a><sup><a href="../../../n/e/u/User_talk%7ENeutrality_6997.html" title="User talk:Neutrality">talk</a></sup> 00:34, 27 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ah so I finally got people to admit the issue is notability and not the fact that this article is an alleged "dictdef" per the original nomination since it's only about the word and not about the subject. So how do we go about establishing "notability" criteria? For those in the ethnic group, "banana" is far more notable than "nigger". No doubt "nigger" has more google hits but where do we draw the line? The whole beauty of Wikipedia is that it can cover the "<a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_tail.html" title="Long tail">long tail</a>". Restricting articles to "notable" subjects actually hurts Wikipedia in the long run. So long as the article is factual, it should be kept. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamw_5671.html" title="User:Samw">Samw</a> 01:38, 27 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The argument is still that this cannot expand past a dictdef. There's much that can be said about <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a>, but not much that can be said beyond a defition and context for Banana (person). This is, however, an argument to merge this into a list or transwiki it to Wiktionary, though, neither of which keep this term from being covered. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 01:56, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Banana Boys" illustrates usage of the word. "Banana Boys" has 12,000 Google hits. It's not only a book but a play<a href="http://www.fu-gen.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fu-gen.org/" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> that has been reviewed by major Canadian newspapers, is supported by government arts funding agencies and has toured in the Canadian national and provincial captial cities. I believe that establishes notability for "Banana Boys". If we agree "Banana Boys" is notable and worthy of a Wikipedia entry on it's own, then I would argue the root word "Banana" is also notable. BTW, I learned about "Banana Boys" from this article. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamw_5671.html" title="User:Samw">Samw</a> 23:47, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Singapore is a city-state with a population of roughly 5 million.

<p>The article as it stands today (2005-09-26) clearly states that the standard physics theory completely disagrees with this model. It also states that most mainstream scientists regard it as nothing more than pseudoscience - this is stated not once, but three times during the article, as well as 2 reasons for considering it pseudoscience (lack of empirical evidence and unfalsiability) are provided. However, if these 2 criteria were universally applied, the theory of superstrings should also be clasified as pseudoscience (it's unfalsifiable and right now there's no evidence for it), as well as the "dark matter" theories (MOND does have empirical evidence in it's favor, predicted acurately some behaviour of low emission galaxies and is falsifiable) I wrote the entry on the double star theory ("Nemesis", which itself was proposed by a respected mainstream scientist, though not well regarded today) was deleted from the Precession "alternative views" entry. I left it out for I wanted to settle down the controversy surrounding the article. I myself find some aspects of the "bin. model of eq. prec." objectionable, and it's proponents don't do their own theory any favor (trying to pass ancient Indian religious texts as scientific evidence isn't sound to say the least) but nonetheless interesting as it relates very well to the Nemesis theory and could have something to do with it - it could very well be possible that a rotating sun/nemesis system induced a slight parallax change thru millenia, which could add to the natural precession of Earth due to gyroscopic effect. Mr. Pitchford, if you don't mind a little criticism... have you ever read Kuhn or Feyerabend? Sometimes you sound REALLY dogmatic on your writings, as though your views on science were more akin to <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_Comte_6c2b.html" title="August Comte">August Comte</a>'s <a href="../../../p/o/s/Positivism.html" title="Positivism">positivism</a> than to modern <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistemology.html" title="Epistemology">epistemology</a> as put together since popper, kuhn, lakatos or feyerabend's times... By the way, now I've registered. BattleTroll</p>

<li>I <b>agree</b> with Battle Troll. Many of these scientific apologists are as closed-minded and dogmatic as the religious folks they despise so much. In fact, many of their views and exclusionist attitudes are as bad as anything in Catholic Church history, including the Inquisition that so many of them love to use as an example of oppression. The irony is, they're members of a Science Inquisition that is going on in modern times that's just as bent on silencing differing views as the Catholic Inquisition was. They also have a lot in common with the Christian fundamentalists that they criticize so much. <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarthian_7789.html" title="User:Earthian">Earthian</a> 16:36, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I decided to consult my university library's online-access-to-scholarly-journals service. The journal <i>Solar System Research</i> (English translation of <i>Astronomicheskii Vestnik</i>) has 23 articles since November 2000 containing the word "binary", 23 that contain the word "equinox", and 2 that contain both. One's about the binary asteriod 423 Diotima and the other's about the Ephemerides of Planets and the Moon. Neither mentions this theory, and no article mentions Cruttenden. The journal <i>Astronomy and Astrophysics</i> (affiliated with the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Southern_Observatory_7de2.html" title="European Southern Observatory">European Southern Observatory</a>) has, since 2001, 0 articles mentioning Cruttenden, and 0 results for the search [binary AND "equinox precession"). The journal <i>New Astronomy</i> has, since July 1996, had 0 articles containing the word "Cruttenden" and 0 articles containing the three words "equinox", "binary", and "precession", in any order. In light of this, I think this is a violation of the general policy espoused in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> Sec. 1.4, as the hypothesis lacks the widespread notability/influence to make it legitimately encyclopedic. This is also a potential violation of WP:NOT 1.3.1, as the lack of acknowledgement outside the originators suggests that this article constitutes "proposing theories". As such, I am convinced that the proper course of action is to <b>Delete</b> this entry. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 23:16, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, the one thing that it isn't is a vote. It's a discussion, to obtain a consensus. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 22:40, 26 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That may be the idea, but from the AfDs and RfAs that I've been in or witnessed, it's more of a vote counted somewhat like but not actually <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus_decision-making.html" title="Consensus decision-making">consensus</a> (i.e. a majority won't win, but a large majority, anywhere from 2/3+ will depending on the admin, his/her mood and the article in question). As I am part of a <a href="../../../c/o/h/Cohousing.html" title="Cohousing">cohousing</a> community, where consensus is used to solve all problems and do everything (establish the community's budget, landscaping, etc.), I am intimitely aquainted with how consensus works. If one person says no, consensus is not reached. Consensus doesn't mean that everyone agrees, it just means that no one is actively blocking consensus by saying, "This is unacceptable." WP, on the other hand, likes to say that we work by consensus, but we don't. We work by majority rules, and instead of having a 51% majority count, we say that a 67% majority (more or less) counts, and 80% for RfAs. The fact that we require a high majority doesn't change the fact that rarely is there actually a consensus in an RfA or AfD. And anyway, few AfDs are actually discussions. It's often taken as rude to ask about or otherwise query into someone's vote, as their vote is their vote and it counts as much as anybody elses regardless of their reasoning (unless they're a sock or their vote is completely irrelevant to the topic). I have seen, both AfD and RfA, people ask about a user's vote and recieve an answer of, "I don't have to or want to tell you," which here is considered a completely valid answer. So, in a place where that's acceptable, there's hardly a discussion or a consensus. I could write for hours about this, but I don't want to take up too much more of your time talking about this semi-unrelated topic in this AfD. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcap_a87c.html" title="User:Blackcap">Blackcap</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackcap_5870.html" title="User talk:Blackcap">talk</a> 00:29, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You have expressed the decision succinctly. The only question therefore is whether the band satisfies the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria. It certainly doesn't going by what the article says. There are no hits, no albums, no tours, no notable members, no awards, and no press coverage. The article also cites no sources and no sources of information about the band can be located.

<li><i>Hello, it is me, the big bad "anonymous editor". I'm sorry I have offended so many. I just haven't gotten around to registering an account yet. Though I doubt that will stop the insults from coming, or keep the vandals from vandalizing my work. Once again, for the record, I have nothing to do with this organization, I've never even so much as exchanged an e-mail with them or with Mr. Cruttenden. I just simply believe in the theory and would like to see it someday either proved or disproved. That's all. I first read about it more than 10 years ago in the book The Holy Science by Swami Sri Yukteswar, (which I think was the first mention ever of it in the Western World, as far as I know), that's why I added the bit I did to his article, which Pilatus promply deleted, as he follows me around deleting whatever I write. Apparently the fear that I might be connected to this organization (I am not) or worse, that I might be Mr. Cruttenden (I'm not) strikes fear in a lot of people's hearts.

<li><b>Comment</b>, thank you Pilatus for proving my point. I couldn't have done it better myself.

<li><b>Comment</b>: although I have as yet been unable to find a PBS airdate for this (I am seeing signs it may have been aired as an episode of another program), and PBS stations don't tend to archive their listings online, I have found reference to the documentary being shown at the Southern California Writers' Conference sometime in early October 2005.<a href="http://www.writersconference.com/la/labios-all.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.writersconference.com/la/labios-all.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> The film was also nominated for a CINE Golden Eagle Award <a href="http://www.cine.org/w_fall03.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cine.org/w_fall03.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I got curious about this when I saw the rabidness with which they are trying to get it deleted. I did a google search, and there are many mentions of it being shown on PBS. A search on groups.google.com turns up this, where a person wrote about it after seeing it on PBS: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan/browse_frm/thread/6f71327d6b7be05c/ce2d3c28feb74563#ce2d3c28feb74563" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan/browse_frm/thread/6f71327d6b7be05c/ce2d3c28feb74563#ce2d3c28feb74563" rel="nofollow">The Great Year and The Wheel of Time</a> in 2004. One thing I will say about those who are looking for it on the PBS website, I think PBS only keeps webpages about specials that they produce, or their affiliates around the country.

<li><b>Conflict of Interest - Question</b>: should the person who nominates articles for deletion also be making changes to those articles? In this case, <a href="../../../u/s/e/User.html" title="User">Pilatus</a> has nominated these three articles for deletion - Walter Cruttenden, <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_Research_Institute_cb5f.html" title="Binary Research Institute">Binary Research Institute</a>, and The Great Year - and has made extensive changes to them. In most of his changes he leaves behind typos and grammatical errors, broken links, and straggling headers (i.e., after he's removed everything that was under a header), not only messing up other users' work but leaving the article in much poorer shape than it was before. He also deletes extensively, and removes categories and stubs aggressively. He goes in after anyone adds anything to an article and removes everything the other person contributed. He seems to be working to <i>increase the chances for deletion</i> of the articles. In light of this, it would be appropriate, in order to avoid this obvious <b>conflict of interest</b>, for the person who nominated the articles to refrain from modifying them until the decision has been made? <a href="../../../s/y/u/User%7ESyug_2b31.html" title="User:Syug">Syug</a> 21:08, 28 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Most articles up for deletion are not judged upon the quality or quantity or their content, but rather the appropriateness or notability of the topic. Any edits that Pilatus may have made to the content of the article are irrelevant, for he cannot make a worthy topic unworthy by bad grammar or misspellings. <a href="../../../o/s/w/User%7EOswax_0a10.html" title="User:Oswax">Oswax</a> 21:47, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Try not to take it personally. It's not fair, but it's done for fairly good pracical reasons.</dd>
<dd>There is a longstanding tradition in Articles for Deletion of pointing out remarks left by users without accounts, and users with very, very new accounts--specifically users who have made very few edits except to matters closely related to an AfD. The reason for this is that a) because of WIkipedia's openness and anonymity, there is absolutely no way to know for sure whether the same person is casting multiple votes under different identities; b) it frequently occurs to people that this is possible, and virtually all Wikipedians believe that "sockpuppets" are very common in AfD, and virtually all Wikipedians believe that it is frequently possible to recognize them; c) ignoring sockpuppet votes is a matter of judgement; d) ignoring votes by not-logged-in users or very new user accounts is generally accepted as a reasonably neutral guideline. It's not fair to legitimate users with IP-address or very-recently-created accounts.</dd>
<dd>It is the <i>vote</i> that is being ignored, not the comments that accompany the vote. Wikipedia is probably the least authoritarian organization you are likely to find. If you make a cogent comment in AfD, your comments will influence the subsequent discussion, no matter whom you are. Since creating a Wikipedia account does not require disclosure of any personal information at all--not so much as an email address--everybody in Wikipedia is judged by the identity they create by themselves by their writings within Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:44, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And I have no problem not making it a redirect but just merging relevant material and deleting. I am not arguing that scally should get the same treatment because Ireland is a separate country.

<dd>It may interest you to know that England and Scotland are also separate countries; They just happen to be part of the same state.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This argument relies on a false analogy. "Gasoline" and "petrol" are synonyms: two words used to refer to the same concepts, albeit in different dialects.

<li>It's best not to. This is not supposed to be a dictionary article about a word, but an encyclopaedia article about a type of people. For a dictionary of slang, see Wiktionary, which has a <i>long</i> list of these regional slang words. (See <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chav" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:chav">Wiktionary:chav</a> and what it links to.)
<p>The discussion on whether or not to merge is not a linguistic one, as several editors above have erroneously painted it, but a sociological one. We don't have separate articles where the titles are merely synonyms for the same person/place/concept/event; nor do we have separate articles where it is simply the case that different countries have different words for the same things. (Witness <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gasoline.html" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a>/<a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrol.html" title="Petrol">petrol</a>, <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squash_%28fruit%29.html" title="Squash (fruit)">squash</a>/<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marrow_%28vegetable%29.html" title="Marrow (vegetable)">marrow</a>, and so forth.) This is an encyclopaedia, with one article per concept, not a dictionary with one article per word. The important question to answer is not about the words at all, but is whether the two concepts are in fact the same. That's (a) a discussion that belongs on the talk pages not here (since merger of <a href="../../../d/u/p/Wikipedia%7EDuplicate_articles_da79.html" title="Wikipedia:Duplicate articles">duplicate articles</a> doesn't involve deleting anything) and (b) a question that can only be answered properly by citing sources on the subjects of these concepts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, citing sources is exactly what is almost <i>never</i> done in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">chav</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charva.html" title="Charva">charva</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/w/Townie.html" title="Townie">townie</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogan.html" title="Bogan">bogan</a>, gogan, <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westies_%28people%29.html" title="Westies (people)">westies</a>, <a href="../../../f/e/r/Feral_%28subculture%29.html" title="Feral (subculture)">feral</a>, and their ilk. The articles are perennial original research magnets. (Witness as an example the edit wars over what vehicles certain stereotypes own and drive, and the lack of cited sources on <i>all</i> sides of those disagreements.) These discussions have been, too, with editors using "I am English", "I am from Newcastle", "Xe is not Scottish", and so forth as the <i>sole</i> bases for their arguments — bald assertions that that add no weight at all to the arguments that they supposedly support. I encourage both editors who assert that neds and chavs are the same and editors who assert that neds and chavs are different, to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:48, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- Personally I think the definition of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">Chav</a>, at least as given in the Wikipedia article, is much less precise, and also that article is subject to a factual accuracy dispute at the present time. That dispute, for me, is enough for me to support keeping the articles separate for now. The term Chav, as used in England, is much more wide-ranging than ned, being used to label anyone who is alleged to demonstrate poor taste in their choice of clothing, motor vehicle or lifestyle, even if that person of royal blood (Prince Harry). OTOH, "Ned" is a much more precisely defined term, covering mainly teenagers who are almost exclusively working class. English teens with a similar lifestyle are only one part of the amorphous Chav grouping. If the Chav article is improved then I <i>might</i> support a merge, but not at the present time. -- <a href="../../../r/u/g/User%7ERugxulo_c2ad.html" title="User:Rugxulo">Rugxulo</a> 22:11, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

Squeakbox did link it at the top of this discussion. It was closed as "keep, strong suggestion to merge and redirect." by admin Dmcdevit·t on July 27.

<p>Actually I followed the strong suggestion to merge and redirect, and got reverted, which is why we are here. So I did it for the rather obvious reason that that is what was suggetsed in th elast Vfd. Your comment aqbout my overturning the decision is false and makes no sense. I enacted the decision, not overturned it.

<li><b>Keep</b> and recognise <b>charva</b> as a totally different thing too. How do you reopen these deletion votes? I never got a say on the last one.</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;&gt;We have already deleted Charver and Charva on the basis that they are other words for Chav, and it should be the same for Ned,&lt;&lt;= BS. Charva is totally different, I suppose in southner terms it is a mixture of a chav and a hoodie (though it does mean more then this). They are certainly not 100% chavs. Charvas also predate chavs by a decade or over, you have only started hearing about chavs this century but charvas have been a common part of the NE for as long as I can remember. &gt;&gt;Charver and chavra are obviously derivatives of chav and do not deserve separate entries. The same cannot be said of ned, which is of completely different origin. -&lt;&lt; Again total rubbish. Chav is the derivative of charva, chav is a more mainstream, non-criminal popularization of charva culture with far heavier american aspects mixed in. Just as Scotland has its own culture north east England also has its own culture equally distinct from that of the south. The petrol argument doesn't work. It could apply if we were talking about western petrol and that totally different stuff they used to have in eastern Europe though for petrol/gasaline, two words for the same thing. Definatly not.-Josquius</p>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. On simple counting it's 5d-2k which I would not ordinarily write out an explanation for. However, in this case there has been much well-argued debate. The fact is, however, that nobody has been persuaded to shift their position as a result of it, and the deleteists are still sure of themselves even after the Unfocused-Hoary exchange (which I thought was quite an illuminating conversation). Tancarville, in my view, weakens his position by having to resort to the tourist trade for extraneous notability having not won much ground with the title alone. All of that taken together is enough to give the deleters their way. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 21:47, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Counts and other nobility were highly notable during the period of their dominance in history. Highly notable in their relevant time period is more than notable enough for inclusion here today. As far as I'm concerned, as long as the title is inherited the notability follows. I can wish the world was more egalitarian, but the notability of people like <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Hilton_9740.html" title="Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a> convinces me that it never will be. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 15:49, 27 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b>: That's an interesting point. From my limited knowledge of Paris Hilton, her surname and inherited wealth were essential to the formation of her celebrity. But whatever the methods used and however undeserved her celebrity may be, celebrity she has most certainly achieved. Google tells me that a search for <b>"paris hilton" -hotel</b> gets about 10.6 million hits. Even discounting a large majority as vacuous bot-bait ("the Paris Hilton tapes they never showed!!!" etc etc etc), that's a large number. Meanwhile, "stephen sant fournier" scores 95, and as far as I can see <i>every single one of these</i> is either from Wikipedia or copies thereof or some kind of social register. But is he better known as Steve? Er, hardly. Google offers just eight hits for "steve sant fournier". Should PH be noteworthy? Probably not. Is she noteworthy? Definitely. Is SSF noteworthy? No. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:03, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>My point wasn't about the relative fame levels of notability/notoriety, but instead that we don't get to choose who joins the "lucky sperm club". They are similar in that each is notable by virtue of being born to certain parents. Of course, PH later used the media to make herself <i>more</i> notable (and then even more so), but the fact is, she and SSF had a similar head start that 99.999% of the world doesn't get. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 03:51, 28 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry if I misunderstood your earlier remark. I'm not sure I fully understand the latter one, either. However, I believe I understand one part: that SSF and PH <i>are similar in that each is notable by virtue of being born to certain parents.</i> I'd say/guess that PH inherited an extremely minor degree of notability until she (or others) decided to exploit it. She has now indisputably achieved notability (of an particularly cheap and transient kind, perhaps, but notability all the same). I don't see that SSF is notable in any way, unless one is to suggest that anybody who can call himself "Count", etc., is thereby notable. (Moreover, the number of Google hits implies to me that there's virtually no interest in him.) If you take the latter position, then you open up WP to mostly genealogical articles on a vast number of people. I think that, say, the principals of grade schools (or those of whom verifiable info is available) are vastly more deserving of WP articles: these are people who are contributing to the world. (NB I've nothing against the fact that SSF is a count. On the strength of his verifiable position as managing director of a notable newspaper, some months ago I was arguing "keep" for the VfD'd article on some "noble" German gentleman. Sorry, I forget his name.) -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 04:26, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I suppose we'll continue to disagree.

I certainly wouldn't mind if everyone who can legitimately call themselves "Count" had an article here. It would certainly be interesting to compare their achievements and career paths with those who aren't born into peerage. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 05:40, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think that B&amp;JB too are unremarkable. However, (i) their pop is famous and SSF's isn't; (ii) they're famous and SSF isn't.

<li>As I said, we'll continue to disagree. It's still a matter of parentage as B&amp;JB haven't done anything noteworthy enough on their own to have an article. Who your parents are matters.

<li><b>Comment</b>, Evidence of notability can be found not only on web sites and www.maltesenobility.org but also on each year book of Malta which lists the nobility. Steve is also a recognisable artist whom rarely sells his works without a hassel. Steve displays his news works once a year, and let me say, people come from all corners of the world to take up his works. Must not only mean he is notable for his noble connections but for his passion for Maltese hertiage. Though most are blinded by the fact that this gentleman is titled. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">Tancarville</a> 18:20, 28 September 2005 (EST)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, Tancerville, before placing the article for deletion I have placed a comment on the talk page, asking you to proof notability. As already stating nobility does not fall as a category in the Wikipedia polciies on biographies. Being a Maltese, I have never heard of his fame, however if there are other Maltese who know about his works and can provide more detail on him this should be done over here. The comment I have placed in the talk page was evidently removed by you. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaltesedog_6843.html" title="User:Maltesedog">Maltesedog</a> 17:44, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Its a pity that now we have Stephen Sant Fournier similiar to Charles Gauci close to deletion as both have contributed highly in the world of Nobility in and out of Malta. Stephen is not only notable but also a leader amongst the nobility leading them both out of the 19th century into the Modern times. Without Stephens' help, the Nobility in Malta would have been extinct in a matter of heritage in Malta. Both Stephen and Charles Gauci are leaders in the fight for restoring some cultural benefits to the Tourism for Malta as the nobility is considered a MAJOR interest to the Tourist trade and importantly keeping many employees in Malta in a job. Please rethink your decision, as this is of essence. Thank you.. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">Tancarville</a> 06:48, 29 September 2005 (EST)

<li><b>Comment</b>: You seem to imply that without the effort of these two people (of whom one has had article already deleted via AfD), the Maltese people and nation would have forgotten about Maltese "nobility". Quite aside from my own attitude toward inherited titles, this seems somewhat unbecoming; or anyway I hardly think it "aristocratic" to embark on a PR job on behalf of one's own "aristocracy".

<p>This was created by an anon five months ago, and tagged for cleanup almost immediately. At the time it seemed to me that it wasn't really an appropriate Wikipedia article — it's more of a chunk out of some other article. I didn't know what to do with it, though, and so I left a note at <a href="../../../w/o/m/Talk%7EWoman_7a4e.html" title="Talk:Woman">Talk:Woman</a> asking for guidance (which shows how naive I was at that stage in my Wikipedia career). There was no response, and it's still there, untouched except for an extra space, and a title-change to correct capitalisation. If anyone can suggest an article for it to be merged to, fine — but otherwise I think that it needs to be put out of its misery. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 17:27, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> POV feminist dogma.

<li>Additional comment: It needs a better title also. I'm not sure what it should be but the vague title doesn't adequately describe the subject matter.

<li><b>Delete</b>. These entries are too specific to be useful. They need to be grouped into a parent article that discusses the road network or transportation.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Who built it, and when. The civil engineering behind it. Images of the road through time. Notable historical people that lived or died there. Parades that use it, demonstrations that happened on it. A discussion of people displaced by its construction, and the people who demanded it. At least some roads have history. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b>. That is a great list. I hope one day Wikipedia can be expanded to include all this. As we can all see from these short existing article we are a long ways away from that. I like your suggestion of merging into a parent article. Instead of creating thousands of stubs, lets create a few decent articles. We can expand from there as new sources of information (Ministy of Transportation?) becomes available. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> 03:52, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'd suggest creating an article Major Roads in Toronto, Ontario. <b>Merge</b> at least the first two with that proposed article, and, at such a time when the information on any individual road is sufficient, create an article devoted to the street.

<li>As I've pointed out before, "there are notable things on this road" does not equal "the road itself is culturally significant". <a href="../../../y/o/n/Yonge_Street_db9b.html" title="Yonge Street">Yonge Street</a>, for example, is culturally significant because rightly or wrongly, it is listed in the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness_Book_of_Records_2093.html" title="Guinness Book of Records">Guinness Book of Records</a> as the world's longest street. It does <i>not</i> get its significance from what happens to be <i>on</i> it. To deserve an encyclopedia article, <i>these</i> are the kinds of questions that need to be answered in the affirmative:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Does the street lend its name via metonymy to an entire industry (eg. <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay_Street_46c4.html" title="Bay Street">Bay Street</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_9499.html" title="Wall Street">Wall Street</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadway.html" title="Broadway">Broadway</a>?)</li>
<li>Is it listed in the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness_Book_of_Records_2093.html" title="Guinness Book of Records">Guinness Book of Records</a> for something?</li>
<li>Is it so famous that a person who's never even seen a map of the city in their lives might still conceivably have heard of it?</li>
<li>Is it closely linked to a major historical event or political controversy?</li>
<li>Does it have some unique feature like <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syracuse%2C_New_York_b662.html" title="Syracuse, New York">Syracuse</a>'s upside-down traffic light or <a href="../../../l/o/m/Lombard_Street_%28San_Francisco%29_8bd5.html" title="Lombard Street (San Francisco)">Lombard Street</a>'s switchbacks?</li>
<li>Is it on a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly.html" title="Monopoly">Monopoly</a> board? (And yes, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Monopoly_26a6.html" title="Canadian Monopoly">Canadian Monopoly</a> counts.)</li>
<li>Is it the primary ceremonial boulevard (eg. <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sussex_Drive_149a.html" title="Sussex Drive">Sussex Drive</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania_Avenue_cad4.html" title="Pennsylvania Avenue">Pennsylvania Avenue</a>) in the nation's capital?</li>
<li>Have <a href="../../../d/e/g/Degrassi_Street_54a9.html" title="Degrassi Street">TV shows</a> been named after it?</li>
</ol>
<p>Being an important traffic route <i>within</i> the city it's located in, or having significant things located <i>on</i> it, do <i>not</i> make a street encyclopedia-worthy. <i>None</i> of the streets in this debate meet any criterion of notability higher than these two, so <b>delete</b> all. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 22:11, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete all</b>. Lists of the directions streets go, which streets they intersect, and "things to see" along the road are all non-encyclopedic.

<li><i>Very useful topic and needs to be expanded to help people make good decisions about building in hurricane prone areas. More knowledge in this area could save lives....</i></li>
<li>we have a guide for seismic retrofit, why not a guide for hurricanes, etc?</li>
<li>If it's really useful, it should be <b>transwikied to Wikibooks</b> and a link created from the page on <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricanes.html" title="Hurricanes">hurricanes</a>, yes? <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlba_9e53.html" title="User:Alba">Alba</a> 22:06, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> at least for a while. The article was posted only today and it looks like the author intends to expand it. I certainly would be interested in reading how buildings are built to be hurricane-proof. However, the article should be written not as a “how-to” but as a discussion of the methods used to reinforce buildings to withstand hurricanes. ♠&#160;<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 22:47, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, perhaps move to a better title like Hurricane precautions. Notable, useful, can easily be presented in an encyclopedic tone ("Authorities typically recommend..." or "A common practice is for people to...") instead of a how-to. Cite copious sources, as plenty exist. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 00:38, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. There is not enough in there to save. If kept, the title should be changed to something like Building Cyclone ressistant structures. I think it would be better to change <a href="../../../b/u/i/Building_standards.html" title="Building standards">Building standards</a> to an article that would cover issues like this or issues like snow load and cyclones or freezing temperatures. Since there is a lot of common information there, one article would be more encyclopedic than several articles. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 06:19, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: I already voted keep above, so I can’t vote again. But I like Vegaswikian’s idea about expanding this article to include not only hurricanes but other natural and weather phenomena that have to be considered in housing construction. Would be a very interesting article. ♠&#160;<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 22:03, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There's info about hurricane proof building design, but it is scattered all over the internet. Wikipedia is a good place to consolidate it all. However, all work stops on an article after vandals threaten to delete it. I've had several works in progress deleted by people who just sit around all day deleting stuff on wikipedia.
<ul>
<li>I wikified the formatting of the comment above, which was malformed. The comment was posted by 71.131.43.185, whose IP address is similar but not identical to that of the article’s author. People should realize that a vote or comment carries a lot more weight when it is signed. ♠&#160;<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 22:15, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't see why you would think this is Point of View. Wind loading, etc is an architecture topic. Maybe the recent hurricanes have made some people a bit too sensative. I would not combine it with a building designed for snow load as they are different issues and different solutions. It's a stub (basically a request for article outline) which should be added to if it gets past the AfD trial.</li>
<li><b>Rewrite</b> - this topic could be rewritten as an overview of different techniques that are used to hurricane-proof buildings. However, as it stands it's a how-to guide, which is not appropriate for an encyclopedia (it <i>is</i> appropriate for Wikibooks, however; see <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_instruction_manual" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not an instruction manual</a>). <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font color="red">Z</font><font color="black">iggurat</font></a> 23:17, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> definitely needs a rewrite, but definitely could prove encyclopaedic after that rewrite. Certainly wouldn't be POV after a rewrite - either something stands up to a hurricane or it doesn't - there's no two ways about that, and a Force 12 wind is pretty objective in its assessment of buildings. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 09:18, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></li>

<li>I just thought maybe for someone who doesn't want to go back and forth between those two individual pages for info or who just want info on the double album as a whole they could just visit one page. Is there anything I can do to keep it on? Sorry for any trouble. RageAgainstTheSystem.

<li>It's no problem. Parts of Mezmerize/Hypnotize are a little opinionated, but the rest can be merged into the individual album articles. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 18:29, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

Only contributions to date are four AfD comments/votes made within the space of two minutes. These are made in rather broken English and yet he/she feels strongly about a middle-class 1970s Northamptonshire-focussed type of housing.

<li>Agreed, that's why I had that "if you wish" clause&#160;;). In practice, the daily/month articles will be the detailed view to enable us to build up a really useful historical timeline, whereas the anniversary and years will be of a different format, more high-level and generally more topic based than time-based. Lots of ways into the actual articles is a good thing though, IMO. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 01:02, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would be extremely grateful if some contributors would take a wider view than just articles. We have a tens of thousands of pages in the main namespace that are not articles - lists, disambiguation pages and component pages such as found on the cricket pages. These individual day pages are not so much articles in themselves but building blocks so that we can create more useful articles (see above).

<ul>
<li>Lol, ok let's follow the chain of events that led <i>you</i> to cause <i>me</i> of logical flaws.
<ol>
<li>Nickpar dislikes the extra mouse click required when finishing up editing transcluded pages.</li>
<li>I put out that the current events page are a drop in the ocean compared to AfD pages, and so he may as well succomb and get a tabbed browser.</li>
<li>You tell me that AfD is busier (The number of clicks required is identical no matter how busy the page is).</li>
<li>You then tell me that actual you were really talking about the utility of the pages themselves rather than the number of clicks required.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>So it is you that is jumping around with the logic. Anyway all of that is irrelevant. You seem to agree that transclusion is good thing for AfD. Maybe it won't be such a huge boon for date pages (I think that it will, but it will take time as we learn that it useful to link to individual dates sometimes - e.g. dates of people's deaths) but the size of the boon doesn't matter. As long as it's a boon, and the cost to people who prefer to continue to look at the <i>unchanged in look</i> month pages is minimal, then there is absolutely no need to delete these, because they are providing a positive benefit. I note that no-one has argued against that. It all appears to me to be arguments about strict definitions of what is in the article space and an unwillingness to try anything new.... I am glad this feeling wasn't around when Wikipedia was much smaller else we'd have never got anywhere! <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 19:26, 26 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I disagree. Transclusion is bad in any event. The only reason it's used on AFD is because it's a necessary evil. And they're not creating a positive benefit- I could split up any page by sections, and they wouldn't create a benefit. That's essentially what you're doing. To view your articles by section, one would have to manually enter the URLs- something it seems like only you would be doing in the first place. In any event, I'm done arguing with you, because no matter what I say, you have your feelings, and nothing I say is going to change them. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315"><font color="red">Ral</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315"><font color="green">315</font></a> <a href="../../../p/o/s/WP%7EPOST_8e4c.html" title="WP:POST"><font color="blue">W<sub>S</sub></font></a> 20:38, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> with Community Discussion about future standards for this type of information. In the long term, cataloging individual dates could be a very useful and innovative use of Wikipedia. The massive hypertext data of Wikipedia enables a better cataloging of the events of an individual day than ever before. However, currently we can only search it by year and day only, not the two combined. Wikipedia should eventually be considered a resource for social science data mining. Combined with semantic tags, maybe we could discover for example whether people are more or less likely to commit suicide on days with bad news or disasters. Or whether different periods of the year are more likely to be associated with different types of historical incidents. Although the standards for this information need to be discussed, a day actually ranks pretty high there up on the quality of encyclopedic knowledge. I think this is an excellent test by Pcb21 and a taste of the future of Wikipedia. Don't cut Wikipedia short.</li>

<dd>On top of that, it has immediate value because people are interested in what happened on their birthdays and wedding days, etc. And the edits to Pcb's article will give us ideas about how to manage this information.

<li>I agree. To tell the truth, a day and year article is probably more useful than a day article alone. A day page (ie. <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>) is only useful for commemoration and superstition. Different and changing calendars, leap years, and other things make them pretty meaningless anyway. Day and year pages would solve the calendar problems through redirects and would open a huge new use of the database. The status quo set-up for dates is NOT the future, and the longer we use it the longer it will take to convert eventually.

<p>They do not publish "obscure records", they have published several records on their record label including "Caravan To Obscurity" which refers to a song lyric on the album, and not a description of the record. It was recently reviewed in the Sunday Times by Stewart Lee, receiving 4 stars in the recommended albums... hardly obscure. There's none so blind as those that cannot see.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>revert</b> to earlier version. I started the article when I wasn't quite as aware of our original research policy. I later intended to back it up with published sources, but never got to it. It has since degenerated into a horrid article that isn't likely to serve it's purpose. If anyone cares to, check the earlier versions to see if anything is worth saving. It could be taken from there and redone using the <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirk_McKusick_d7d2.html" title="Kirk McKusick">Kirk McKusick</a>'s books and a few others to legitimately discuss the differences between the OS families, but I'm not going to get to it. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 18:29, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> joining Taxman's and Maru's consensus. The first sentence of this article is, "BSD and Linux are two families of open-source computer operating systems." If a need for deletion is due to the article's being perceived as inaccurate from the first sentence, then the important issue is merely that the two OSs are favorably named on the same page. So be it, give 'em what they want and delete the entire article. If someone wants to recreate it anew in the future, let them take up any founder's responsibility along with the no-win language and cultural hassles. Like Maru, I worked a lot on this. Like Taxman, I was not quite as aware of Wiki's O-R policy when I contributed. Whether this article is horrid, bad, informative, or was consumer useful to me is moot. It should not remain published here if it is undocumented and thus indistinguishable from <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Original Research</a>. Wiki O-R policy excludes informative insider knowledge because, by "insider" definition, their knowledge is infrequently documentable. My thanks to all who provided content. From the expert editors I've learned much of what I had hoped to find on first arrival at the article. Especially AlbertCallahan who knows a lot about shells (and cooking), a critical choice for new B &amp; L users along with packaging systems. (How are your taco shells? "yum" &#160;:)<br />

<dd>It doesn't matter in practice. Generic lists of facts and organizing outlines aren't copyrightable; for example, non-telco telephone listings.

<dd>Ah, I don't know much about Linux and BSD. Why doesn't someone just go in and delete anything that is false or subjective and leave an objective comparison of the two? I came to wikipedia to help me decide between installing freebsd and linux as my first non-windows OS experience. This was the only wikipedia article I could find with a comparison. 66.75.49.213
<dl>
<dd>Because if everything that was viewed as wrong was deleted, you'd end up with an even more useless article. There is a massive conflict of personalities between most Linux and BSD users, from Linux users constantly spreading misinformation and slander to the BSD users constantly belittling Linux users for their usage of a worse system. And that's just the BSD perspective, the Linux users think of BSD as a dead and arcane piece of garbage that only an idiot would use. And even then, there are worse things going on between the two overcultures. The fundamental differences between the two groups causes constant conflict and pretty much constant and embittered arguments, often with no real cause behind them. My opinion, if you want to learn Unix, you go to OpenBSD because it's documentation is better, if you want a Windows replacement you go Ubuntu. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanizary_90cd.html" title="User:Janizary">Janizary</a> 03:28, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The term "BSD" describes any modern day derivative of the Berkeley Software Distribution (such as FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, etc.) or the Berkeley Software Distribution itself. In other words, "BSD" refers to an operating system. The term "Linux" describes the operating system <i>kernel</i> developed by Linus Torvalds – <i>not</i> an operating system. To compare a complete operating system to just a kernel is like comparing apples with oranges. Not only that, but you can't compare "BSD" to any other operating system because "BSD" doesn't refer to a single operating system – it refers to a family of operating systems that are actually very distinct from each other. I don't understand why the article is titled "BSD and Linux" if it's really a comparison of FreeBSD and GNU/Linux. But a change in the title of the article isn't going to fix anything either – why does Wikipedia need a comparison of one specific BSD derivative and "GNU/Linux" (which doesn't refer to an operating system either; there is no GNU/Linux operating system, just distributions that combine the Linux kernel and GNU userland)? The basic idea behind the entire article is flawed. <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESether_24a1.html" title="User:Sether">Sether</a> 03:56, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>(Sigh) There were some old-title links that the linking page editors (maybe you?) needed to update. By talk page consensus, the article is no longer comparing one specific derivative with another entire family. The article compares the two families generally and makes a non-comprehensive sample comparison between one derivative and one distro (copy-editing in "derivative" was on the to-do list). The "just a kernel" objection was already covered in the article. The empty "The Linux Kernel and the GNU Utilities" to-do section was to intended to explain Richard Stallman/GNU's marginalization as being why he started the "just a kernel" issue (see the talk page). If you consider yourself an unbiased Wikipedian, maybe you should read the article again, particularly the Scope section, and withdraw your AfD as based on obsolete understandings (IIRC, you do strike-through formatting of your AfD intro, and add a brief retraction). Milo 07:20, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, come on. The article is garbage. It varies wildly between being overly simplistic and being terribly confused and confusing. Not to mention often spouting complete rubbish (does anyone really need to be told that new users sometimes have problems? what is all this Major Software nonsense? is Wikipedia really the place for this rather odd Marxist analysis, interesting - if poorly presented - idea or no? what is this rubbish about FreeBSD linux compat? have you even read the handbook?). A clear (simple or in-depth) introduction to the differences between the BSDs and Linux may or may not be useful (I think not), but this article is <i>not it</i> and will not become so short of completely starting again. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicM_3e6b.html" title="User:NicM">NicM</a> 15:06, 3 October 2005 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>To 66.75.49.213 Yours was like my experience, except I wanted to compare of all the BSDs and Linux, for future consumer folks like us. Simplifying, even though BSD and Linux have mostly indistinguishable OS features, a persistent eye-roller objection was that they <i>can't</i> be compared because the two OSs have different cultural names for too many things. That language issue could be resolved ...except that too many objectors don't want it resolved. With persistent nitpicking, the objectors plus normal critics won't give the outnumbered unbiased editors the year or more it would take to document the article's extensive use of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">O-R</a> look alike insider info.

<p>This is probably a <a href="../../../n/i/h/Nihilartikel.html" title="Nihilartikel">clever hoax</a> created by <a href="#ipaddress" title="">the same persistent prankster</a> or pranksters who invented the <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_Nasher_45fa.html" title="User:Mirv/Nasher">Nasher dynasty</a> (<a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Nasher_32cb.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Nasher">old VfD page</a>). It appears plausible, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghaznavid.html" title="Ghaznavid">Ghaznavids</a> haven't ruled anything since the 12th century. The article claimed that they did, but it should be easy to guess who added that fact.</li>
<li>Several assertions are verified and unverifiable through any sources I can find, namely:
<ul>
<li>the assertion that he founded the Spinzar corporation. In fact, it was founded as a venture of the Afghan National Bank.</li>
<li>the assertion that Kipling named <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shere_Khan_8a6c.html" title="Shere Khan">Shere Khan</a> after him. Not only does <i>Shere Khan</i> mean something like "Tiger Lord", according to the commentary in the 1992 Oxford University Press edition, but if this person was born in the 1890s, he would have been no more than four years old when <i>The Jungle Book</i> was published—thus an unlikely source for the name.</li>
<li>The assertion that Afghanistan's largest port is named after him. <s>As was pointed out in the previous VfD, Afghanistan is landlocked, thus it's unlikely that it has any ports named after anybody</s>. Okay, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shir_Khan_b09e.html" title="Shir Khan">Shir Khan</a> is a real port in Afghanistan, but I find no indication that it was named after him.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There may be some parts that are true, or at least based on a real person: see <a href="http://www.farhaddarya.info/through_darya.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.farhaddarya.info/through_darya.htm" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>, the reliability of which is hard to judge. It appears that the hoaxster took some facts about <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farhad_Darya_f0b2.html" title="Farhad Darya">Farhad Darya</a>'s grandfather from that source, mixed them with fiction about the Nasher dynasty, and came up with this article.

<li>Regarding Kipling - <i>did</i> he ever go to Afghanistan? Some flicking through a handy biography suggests he spent several years in Lahore and got as far as the Khyber Pass, in 1885, to report on the visit of <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdur_Rahman_Khan_f04f.html" title="Abdur Rahman Khan">Abdur Rahman Khan</a>; he doesn't seem to have travelled there, or if he did his biographer didn't think to mention it. As far as I can tell he'd have been in the UK or America by the time Khan was born, and it beggars belief a character written in 1892-4 would be named after an infant - possibly not even born - who he'd have no reason to be aware of. I'm <b>not voting</b> either way on the article, but that part's definitely got garbled en route; I'll remove it... <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk.html" title="Talk">talk</a> | 00:18, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

<p><b>Support</b> I was the one who created this article about Sher Khan. As a matter of fact, I created the original version which has been altered by other users. When factual errors appeared, I corrected them. I am a PhD student at Brown, specializing in Afghan history. Sher Khan is a key figur in post-British Afghanistan and should thus remain in the dictionary. About your points: True, the Ghaznavids have not ruled the country after the 12th century as Kings, but they lived as hereditary Khans in their home area, having some sort of 'traditional' power. The Spinzar Company was founded by Sher Khan, but largely owned by the Afghan Government through the Bank-e-Milli. Sher Khan held about 5 % and some percentage in the ACG (Afghan Cotton Company) in Gulbahar and Pol-e-chumri. After Sher Khan's death, his son Gholam Serwar served as CEO until the war with Russia broke out (most literature on Afghan history is - ALAS!!! - almost impossible to get, this you can check online on <a href="http://www.institute-for-afghan-studies.org/HistoricalResearchCorner/ACFAE9.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.institute-for-afghan-studies.org/HistoricalResearchCorner/ACFAE9.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.institute-for-afghan-studies.org/HistoricalResearchCorner/ACFAE9.pdf</a>). He was then imprisoned by Daoud. The Spinzar Company is back in action today, ran by Mr Arianpoor. I do not know much about the association to Kipling. I do however know that Kipling spent some time in Kunduz. Sher Khan Bandar was named after Sher Khan Nasher, this fact is undisputed among anyone dealing with the history of Afghanistan. As a matter of fact, the Sher Khan Road leads from the Spinzar Company up to Sher Khan Bandar (passing Sher Khan high school). In 2002 the Afghan government wanted to change the name to Massoud Bandar. An outrage, followed by a quasi-riot broke out in Kunduz up to Sher Khan Bandar which made the government change its mind. The Columbia article deals with a different Sher Khan, mostly referred to as Sher Shah. He was an Afghan ruler of the Mughal empire for five years (1540–1545) who had defeated Homayun. So: except for the Kipling part, all the info is accurate. Steve</p>

<p><b>Mirv</b> We appreciate your effort very much. We are all trying to get as close to historical accuracy as possible. There is no need to act offensive. This service of writing about something I know much about (and spend my life with) is something I am giving to the Wikipedia community. I defended the points but I am not writing a scientific text scattered with footnotes for you as I have many other things to do (namely do research about other historical incidents and people I do not know much about). Regards, Steve</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am not asking for exhaustive footnoting of each and every point; I just want to know where you got the information contained in this article. My own research has turned up nothing that confirms what is written here; this, plus my experience with the previous Nasher hoax, leads me to believe that some or all of the article is erroneous or fictitious. If the facts cannot be verified, then the article will probably be deleted. I am willing to take the time to verify it, but I've hit a dead end in researching and don't know where to continue. If you name a few of the sources you used in writing the article, other editors can check them and be convinced that the article is not a hoax. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<small>(Mirv)</small></a> 19:13, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

In the end, Poppycock circus is just a website which no one ever visited, just because it was a website with a comic on, does not mean it deserves an article. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 23:38, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
