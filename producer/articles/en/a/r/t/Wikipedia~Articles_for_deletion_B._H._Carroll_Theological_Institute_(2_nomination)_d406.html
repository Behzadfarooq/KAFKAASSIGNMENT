<p>Unnotable unaccredited "institute." I get 342 yahoo hits for "Carroll Theological Institute". This "institute" does not even have classrooms, and while its website in 2004 said it hopes to have accreditation one day, there is no independent accreditation group/board that mentions this. The last <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_B._H._Carroll_Theological_Institute_95dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/B. H. Carroll Theological Institute">afd was "no consensus"</a> due to inclusionists claiming two church publications make it notable. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 20:46, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I questioned the good faith of this AfD as soon as I saw it on my watchlist, and <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> did not disappoint, starting in with a baseless attack on those who voted to keep this article as "inclusionists", accompanied by the use of "scare quotes" to imply that there is something unseemly going on here. A thorough read through the published, verifiable, independently-sourced articles included in the article regarding the school shows that it is quite genuine. That a new school is not accredited by a national accrediting agency does not make it a diploma mill, nor does the timeframe in obtaining such accreditation constitute any evidence of non-notability. Despite the lack of traditional news coverage, the articles provided and available online provide clear satisfaction of every aspect required by <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. I find the use of "scare quotes" and other derogatory suppositions regarding those who voted to keep the article in the previous AfD to be yet another staggering violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> by <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a>, and the bad faith shown in taking another stab at destroying this article so quickly to only add to the issues.

<dd>You again are falsely characterizing the sources. These are independent, verifiable and reliable sources that describe the institution and its no programs, satisfying <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>; they are not "church sources". I know of no Wikipedia standard that requires an educational institution to have a brick-and-mortar campus; apparently, in our computer age, schools have the ability to offer classes electronically over this thing called the "Internet". The article you provide is completely and entirely accurate, but entirely irrelevant to the article in question. You again try to falsely imply that the B. H. Carroll Theological Institute is offering degrees in violation of Texas law, and provide a source that talks about some other school.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The Baptist publications are independent reliable sources. They are not by close affiliates of the institute. For those who don't follow Christian denominations, baptists are about as unorganized as something can be and still be worth having an organizational label for. Independent for discussing notability and for <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">WP:INDY</a> purposes means just independent of the particular organization/person/etc... under discussion. Religious POV newspapers are just as legitimate as "alternative" newspapers with a politically left POV (which we use as independent reliable sources on politically left topics). The Baptist Standard is a print newspaper/magazine that has been publishing since 1888, see <a href="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=2807" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=2807" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. The <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Baptist_Press_b935.html" title="Associated Baptist Press">Associated Baptist Press</a> is a news bureau based in Florida with offices in Washington D.C. and Texas, see <a href="http://www.abpnews.com/aboutus.page" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abpnews.com/aboutus.page" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 18:14, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I find the comment by <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> that the sources used are "religious publications with obvious strong biases" to be disturbing and confusing. What is their bias? Each of these sources are used to provide factual information, not to offer an opinion. Each source used is an independent entity that covers religion. The implication that these sources are invalid is false, if not patently offensive. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 13:27, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The issue here is notability. There are <b>two sources</b> tied to churches. That's all there is. Yes, accreditation is a multi year process; Are they a canidate? Can you verify they have applied for accreditation? All regional accreditators require a school have a library, this doesn't even have a campus. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 16:10, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The only one of these points relevant to notability is that the false claim about the independent sources. The sources are not tied to churches. The publishers have near pseudo-denominational affiliations, which is very, very different. (Baptists aren't even really a single denomination; in the U.S. they were for about 50 years, but have been becoming more and more fragmented since they original association broke up due to the same tensions that led to the Civil War.) See the response above for more details about what the publishers are. There have been multiple published, independent reliable sources primarily about them, which is the foundational basis for almost all criteria for notability, and we have no consensus criteria for schools to assert a tighter standard. (The notion of tighter standard for schools is laugahable, given the general AFD discussion about schools.) A trivial google search also produces additional reliable sources. There are 34 articles in The Baptist Standard that refer to the school (natural, given that it covers Baptists in Texas) <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=+site:www.baptiststandard.com++%22B.+H.+Carroll+Theological+Institute%22+-Wikipedia" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=+site:www.baptiststandard.com++%22B.+H.+Carroll+Theological+Institute%22+-Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. It has been covered by the North Carolina baptist newspaper, which isn't exactly local to the school, <a href="http://www.biblicalrecorder.org/content/news/2003/11_7_2003/ne071103carroll.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.biblicalrecorder.org/content/news/2003/11_7_2003/ne071103carroll.shtml" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> (this also incidentally mentions a near 5,000 volume donation to the Institute's physical library plus a second smaller one, proving from an independent reliable source that the institute does have a library). <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 18:14, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Coverage of specialized subjects is often in specialized publications.

<dd>I am starting to think that you are either not listening or severely biased. First, "multiple" means more than one. So even if there were only two, which has been false for the entire time this discussion was underway, multiple is met. But we have linked in the article and referenced here, from at least three different independent publishers four different non-trivial published works primarily about the institute. Then I pointed out that one of those publishers has thirty-four different articles that mention the institute. Your arguments hold no water. Plus we have <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a>'s statement below that it was covered by the city paper, even though their archives aren't freely available to use it as a source. And not being accredited is not a reason for deletion; we have <i>multiple categories</i> for non-accredited schools. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 12:34, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please try to turn down the attitude and keep your personal observations about other editors to yourself. And as for the other sources, I don't think publications like the <i>Baptist Standard</i> or the <i>Biblical Recorder</i> count, because they violate, at least in spirit, <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>'s dictum that the source be "independent of the company or corporation itself". It's for this reason that we don't give as much weight to articles about Scientology that come from Scientologist news services. Lastly, I think the authors of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> meant "multiple" to be more than just two, because even a hot dog stand in Iowa can manage to get two puff-piece articles written about itself in some paper or other. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 13:45, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You could always click on the link provided, and check for yourself. Sunject lines such as "Four leave Southwestern Baptist to join new seminary", "Baptist seminary may find itself at home in Arlington", "Texas Baptists to open independent institute" and "Theology education taken to churches" would all seem to be "about" B. H. Carroll Theological Institute, not just mere "mentions" as your scare quotes seem to fear. Though you (and all others who voted to delete) should click on the link and check the sources for yourself, and not take my word for it. The article has been updated with several of these sources, which have been included in the article with links to the references. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 14:04, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Scare quotes? Um, no, they were <i>quote</i> quotes. I was quoting the editor above who stated "one of those publishers has thirty-four different articles that mention the institute." And a <i>mention</i> isn't good enough. Many of the articles you refer to came out before the school opened, and are apparently simply passing along what was received in the school's press release. This too, is dealt with in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>.

<dd>First there are no sources. Then the sources are "biased" baecause they're church-related. Now the sources are indeed from widely-accepted news sources, but came out too soon, before the school opened. Every source listed and provided in the article meets every standard specified by <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and especially <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> which specifies that <b>The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself</b>, which is clearly met by the sources provided.

<dd>Yes, you did quote me saying "one of those publishers has thirty-four different articles that mention the institute." You apparently didn't notice the immediately prior sentence (which you need to read to understand the quoted one, because the antecededent for "those" is in the prior sentence) that says "But we have linked in the article and referenced here, from at least three different independent publishers four different non-trivial published works primarily about the institute." The bit about thirty-four is for people who don't think four is enough and are willing to look at the evidence that has been provided. I think four that meet every test in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">WP:INDY</a> is enough to defeat the claim about inadequate sourcing, so I'm not going to waste my time looking at the other thirty-two. If you feel that you need more in order to change your opinion, I point you back to the link I posted above so that you can go read all of them. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 15:34, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the reminder; I'll try to calm down and focus more on my for pay job. I do think those outside the Institute are already starting to see the new methodology as notable, as evidenced by some of the articles linked in the article. But my keep opinion would stand even if that methodology never caught on elsewhere, because there is more than enough independent reliable coverage, some of it from outside the region, which meets my temporary standards.

<dd>Having independent reliable sources write articles primarily about it means that it is notable to the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> standard "The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself." This has been discussed extensively above.</dd>
<dd>In this particular use of the statement, it undercuts the argument that you could create an equivalent school out of your living room, and explains how the hypothetical AFD for your hypothetical school would not be equivalent. This is a real school, not a diploma mill. The evidence on this seems quite clear to me, even looking just at the sources already in the article, never mind the things I saw when I went looking for additional evidence. We have, between the article and this discussion, proof of staff that were college professors before they joined this Institute, a library in excess of 5,000 volumes, a founder that was formerly a college president, and multiple published articles in multiple independent reliable sources that are primarily about the Institute. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 19:46, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nowhere in your comments do I see an explanation of <i>why</i> this is "not a diploma mill". Saying it doesn't make it so. I see nothing in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> that says having college professors and college presidents associated with you makes up for its other shortcomings. (Tell me again, where exactly is this "library in excess of 5,000 volumes" if they don't have a brick-and-mortar building??) <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 20:20, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I said the evidence was in the sources already in the article. But I'll copy it here for your covenience. To quote our article <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diploma_mill.html" title="Diploma mill">diploma mill</a> "an organization that awards academic degrees and diplomas with very little or no academic study, <i>and</i> without recognition by official accrediting bodies." (Emphasis added.) At the present they lack accreditation, as everyone knows - Wikipedia even sources the article to their statement that they aren't accredited. However, the other test for being a diploma mill is "awards academic degrees and diplomas with very little or no academic study". A cursory glance at <a href="http://www.bhcti.org/AboutUs/index.cfm?action=page&amp;contentid=120" class="external text" title="http://www.bhcti.org/AboutUs/index.cfm?action=page&amp;contentid=120" rel="nofollow">their admission requirements</a> shows that they want students with the ability to do academic study. (This is most blatantly obvious for the advance studies program. <small>"For admission each applicant must submit to the Committee of Senior Fellows for Advanced Studies a research paper either previously prepared (an ungraded copy) or prepared especially for the application on a subject in the student’s chosen major field of study. This paper should be 25-35 pages in length. The paper should represent the applicant’s best quality of research and writing. The form and style should follow the 6th edition of Kate Turabian, A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations. The paper will be graded in terms of form, presentation, and content to determine whether the applicant is capable of doing research and writing at an advanced level."</small> But it is visible in the admission requirements for all three levels of studies.) Since I went to <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_dd6d.html" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">a school where the typical course was 12 units of credit</a>, I have trouble interpreting course units as used elsewhere, but I'm sure that 48 units in 24 courses for their lowest level or 78 units for one of the second level programs (<a href="http://www.bhcti.org/images/DiplomaChristianMinistry.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.bhcti.org/images/DiplomaChristianMinistry.pdf" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="../../../p/o/r/Portable_Document_Format_95a8.html" title="Portable Document Format">PDF</a> and <a href="http://www.bhcti.org/images/StudiesPastorNew.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.bhcti.org/images/StudiesPastorNew.pdf" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="../../../p/o/r/Portable_Document_Format_95a8.html" title="Portable Document Format">PDF</a>), plus a recommendation to take half as many courses per term as one would elsewhere <a href="http://www.bhcti.org/Students/index.cfm?action=page&amp;contentid=126" class="external text" title="http://www.bhcti.org/Students/index.cfm?action=page&amp;contentid=126" rel="nofollow">(second to last paragraph)</a>, is not "very little or no academic study". See also second paragraph of their statement on accreditation, linked in the article.</dd>
<dd>I don't know where the physical library is; I'm not in the same part of the world as the Institute. I just know that we have reliable evidence that they have it. I'd guess it is in Arlington, Texas, given that they have a center there where the professors are.

The <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> standards were created knowing full well that any new and growing company will make efforts -- including hiring PR people, whose sole purpose is to obtain such coverage -- to get articles published in the media, the more the better.

<li><b>Delete</b> Even if you believe that all schools are notable (fortunately I do not) this institute wouldn't qualify. "The institution does not hold classes in any conventional sense. Rather it trains students in 15 “teaching churches” scattered across Texas, as well as through interactive lessons taught over the Internet" Its not a school, its a church afilliated organization and a non-notable one at this point.

<li><b>Keep</b> (edit conflict) Holy well-poisoning, Batman. Calm down, everyone. Yes, persistent school inclusionists are tiresome and yes this really isn't a school, but the issue is notability and verifiability, as JoshuaZ rightly points out (though I disagree with his ultimate conclusion). Let's look at the sources to see if they establish these. The "church sources" are articles in independent wire services or publications that appeal to Baptists; however, there is no apparent connection with the seminary itself. They are independent and seem credible to me. Also, this has been covered by major daily newspapers. The sources (and, since <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> doesn't seem to be participating in this discussion, let me be the one to point out that you have to actually read the sources) noted the controversy surrounding this organization: it was founded by four moderate Baptist professors forced out of another seminary when it was taken over by fundamentalists (who dispute the propriety of this college using the name of the other seminary's founder). The coverage in the mainstream and religious press generated by this controversy makes this subject notable. (I cannot believe my first edit after coming back from a longer-than-expected wikibreak is to keep a freaking school!) <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 02:19, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> We need to keep cool heads here. I was ready to vote delete right away on this one, but further research bears out. By the so-called "tests" this seems non notable on face value, but deeper digging DOES turn up multiple, independent coverage. The various "tests" we apply for notability are meant to get us LOOKING for notability, but they by themselves do not mean that something fails the primary notability criterion. There is multiple coverage, it is covered in a fairly extensive way, and by independant sources (I know it's "religious" press; but then again you look for music reviews in the music press, don't you???). Just because it fails a guideline doesn't mean it is AUTOMATICALLY not notable. It means we should check it out. When one checks it out, it passes. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 03:56, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

There are plenty of things that meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <s>(which this does)</s> (changed my mind, see below) that are still not notable enough to include in an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>: First off, <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is a guideline, not the Bible, and not WP policy. There's a gut check about whether something is notable. 400 students? I can name thousands of high schools with more. Coverage in the Fort Worth paper? I can provide tens of thousands of articles if local news coverage is all it takes to be notable enough to be an entry in an encyclopedia. Per your comment, there's also no criteria that says that I can't use a lack of accredidation and any shred of recent coverage to help form my opinion as to whether this Institute matters beyond its own walls. Lack of accredidation means it's not a school that can confer degrees, which means that it's in essence a Bible Study group. Typically, notable organizations will have ongoing coverage <b>or</b> be historically significant. This fails both. And by the way, the Dallas News article cited is future-looking ("hopes to start classes", "will be based somewhere between Dallas and Fort Worth", etc. Both Ft. Worth newspaper articles focus on the four founders resigning their prior posts and joining this new project prior to the Institute ever teaching a class. No secular (i.e. "independent") news coverage exists after the Institute is founded, so I'm not sure that helps the article's case. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkerHawx_2728.html" title="User:SkerHawx">SkerHawx</a> 13:44, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> On what basis are you claiming that the 2006 article from the news bureuae Associated Baptist Press <a href="http://www.abpnews.com/766.article" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abpnews.com/766.article" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> is not independent. There is no link between the ABP and the Institute. This independent coverage has been a source for the Wikipedia article since before this AFD began. The claim that both are Baptist is not a serious claim that they are related parties; as reading our coverage of Baptists could tell you. Baptists just aren't as organized or like minded as most other denominations are; they are splintery like the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Catholic_Churches_6706.html" title="Independent Catholic Churches">Independent Catholic Churches</a>. Per <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptists_in_the_United_States_5dfd.html" title="Baptists in the United States">Baptists in the United States</a>, there are four separate major groups of Baptist denominations. The ABP self describes in part as "Working out of our Jacksonville, Fla.- based headquarters, and with bureaus in Washington and Dallas, ABP provides daily coverage of Baptist news, news from the nation's capital, and other general news and information of concern to Christians in the U.S. and around the world." <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 14:42, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b>. I understand how loosely affiliated Baptist Churches are. But the article's author, Marv Knox, is the editor of the Baptist Standard, and the article you cite by the ABP is a <b>direct copy</b> of an article printed by Knox's Baptist Standard <a href="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=4445" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=4445" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. Another "independent" article cited (The Biblical Recorder) is written by Mark Wingfield, who worked for the Baptist Standard directly under Marv Knox <a href="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=1070" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=1070" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. The third article is by Ken Camp. Camp replaced Wingfield directly under Knox at the Standard when Wingfield returned to ministry. So, although Baptist churches are very loosely affiliated, it seems all three of the authors of the four referenced articles currently work for, or worked for, the Baptist Standard (and they all worked together and know each other intimately). That's not independent. Two of the other references provided are directly from the school's web site. Okay, now deep breath... Take a look at this article <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptist_General_Convention_of_Texas_9a76.html" title="Baptist General Convention of Texas">Baptist General Convention of Texas</a>.

Somehow, despite the fact that the <i><a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Worth_Star-Telegram_c51a.html" title="Fort Worth Star-Telegram">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Morning_News_212f.html" title="Dallas Morning News">Dallas Morning News</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Antonio_Express-News_0a0d.html" title="San Antonio Express-News">San Antonio Express-News</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_Star_9abb.html" title="Kansas City Star">Kansas City Star</a></i> and the <i><a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Journal-Constitution_62d1.html" title="Atlanta Journal-Constitution">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a></i> are all independent nationally-recognized publications, with editors and publishers looking over reporter's shoulder's, each member of the cabal was able to pull the wool over their eyes and get an article published. Send your theories to Dan Brown, it sounds like a great plot for a new book. But, other than that, it's pure unsupported original research. You'd be hard pressed to find any group of reporters covering any one industry -- Recording, Iowa Hot Dog Stands or Baptist churches -- who haven't worked together at some point in their career. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 17:30, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> I'm sorry, I don't see any citations from the San Antonio, Kansas City, or Atlanta papers in this article. The Dallas and Ft. Worth papers are responding to a press conference covering a notable event (the abrupt resignation of four faculty members at SBTS, as below.) And I searched the papers you mentioned, and they all have articles from (only) November 2003 indicating the same information (faculty resigns, to form new institute - note future tense). <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkerHawx_2728.html" title="User:SkerHawx">SkerHawx</a> 17:42, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Further note</b>: Two of the three secular articles cited are from Nov 5, 2003 (Dallas &amp; Ft. Worth papers). These articles were covering a press conference <a href="http://www.biblicalrecorder.org/content/news/2003/11_5_2003/ne051103four.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.biblicalrecorder.org/content/news/2003/11_5_2003/ne051103four.shtml" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> on Novemeber 4, 2003 and seem to be covering the abrupt departure of the four faculty members from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary as much (or more) as covering the new school. Of course, both articles are (as mentioned above) future tense, since no such Institute existed yet. I'm not paying $2.95 to see the full text of the third article, but the only visible paragraph just repeats the information already known from the first two. Look, the Baptist Standard is the official paper of the BGCT, and all of the religious articles covering this came from the Baptist Standard or its writers. All but one of the articles was published in the Baptist Standard directly (see my citations above). This isn't a conspiracy, it's a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_relations.html" title="Public relations">Public relations</a> strategy. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is crumbling on this one.

<li><b>Almost convincing</b> Where this falls apart is the link between those editors and the Institute. Yes, the Institute is named after one of the founders of the BGCT. But he was also a founder of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, from which the staff broke away. We wouldn't say that the Institute was affiliated with SWBTS because of using one of their founder's names. The argument was enough to go make me look and see if the BGCT supports the Institute. The <a href="http://www.bgct.org/texasbaptists/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=278&amp;srcid=247" class="external text" title="http://www.bgct.org/texasbaptists/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=278&amp;srcid=247" rel="nofollow">BGCT's page</a> on the schools they support does not mention this Institute. The results of a <a href="http://www.bgct.org/texasbaptists/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=2655&amp;srcid=278&amp;txtSearch=%22Carroll+Theological%22" class="external text" title="http://www.bgct.org/texasbaptists/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=2655&amp;srcid=278&amp;txtSearch=%22Carroll+Theological%22" rel="nofollow">search</a> at the BGCT's page don't show any sort of affiliation. They show trivial mentions a scholarshiop given to a student at the institute, a member of the Institute staff leading a tour group in the U.K, an event being taught by folks from <a href="../../../b/a/y/Baylor_University_b30a.html" title="Baylor University">Baylor University</a> held in part at the site of this Institute, that the Institute is one of ninety-seven exhbitors at the 2006 convention, and one of nine schools of higher education hosting a special event at that convention. (The policies of the BGCT do allow non affiliated organizations to exhibit, I checked, and the hotel chain exhibiting is adequate evidence of that.) I also checked the Institute's web You've convinced me that a lot of the articles were written by people who know each other. You've also convinced me that those writers are the world experts on what events among Texas Baptists are newsworthy. You failed to convince me that they have any affiliation with the Institute, which is what independence is all about; see <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">WP:INDY</a>. So I continue to conclude that the articles are by independent sources. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 18:48, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Last one</b> This will be my last post on this AfD discussion, simply because I'm just not that passionate about whether or not this article is ultimately deleted. I'll answer your question and then just let the facts speak for themselves. Everyone is welcome to vote for a delete or a keep. Alas, you asked for some more detail, so I'll respond this last time. Here you go... Check out the BGCT member church web site <a href="http://www.bgct.org/texasbaptists/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=2869&amp;srcid=178" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bgct.org/texasbaptists/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=2869&amp;srcid=178" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> and cross-reference it with the institute's teaching churches <a href="http://www.bhcti.org/Churches/index.cfm?action=page&amp;contentid=158" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bhcti.org/Churches/index.cfm?action=page&amp;contentid=158" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. A 100% match on all 17 churches. Charles Wade, executive director of BGCT, welcomed the Institute in "...our ongoing effort to train effective Christian leaders..." <a href="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=923" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=923" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. Dr. Russell Dilday, one of the founders of the Institute was a former president of the BGCT <a href="http://www.baylor.edu/pr/news.php?action=story&amp;story=7804" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.baylor.edu/pr/news.php?action=story&amp;story=7804" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. This is the bottom line ... the Institute and the Baptist General Convention of Texas have the same deposit of faith. Their visions are aligned, whether or not BGCT explicitly supports the Institute or not. The Baptist Standard is an official publication of the BGCT, and as a religious newspaper it writes from a certain paradigm. There's nothing wrong with that, it's just not unbiased. (If Catholics in Atlanta created a Catholic Theological Institute, the Archidiocese of Atlanta's official paper (<i>The Georgia Bulletin</i>) would cover it (so long as it was in line with Catholic teachings). I wouldn't consider that to be an independent source. Nor would I consider other Catholic publications an authoritative source to help establish <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. So I'm just saying that the beliefs of the official voice of the BGCT and the beliefs of the Institute are 100% on target. As such, the BGCT (and therefore the Baptist Standard) have a vested interest in promoting the Institute. That's all.

<li><b>Keep</b> We are not a regulatory agency, nor are we interviewing graduates of the school as potential employees, so even if it were a giant unaccredited diploma mill, we should only look at notability, not legitimacy. This is the same principle on which we have articles about religions without having to prove the truth of their claimed miracles and the existence of their particular god. Similarly we have articles about hoaxes and pseudoscience, without certifying the truth of the claims. We are not the arbiters of truth, just of verifiable notoriety. The school has faculty formerly with the mainstream Southern Baptist seminary, who were pushed out by the fundamentalist takeover of that denomination. The school is widely mentioned in Baptist publications, has 400 students, and trains them in 15 churches. It appears to be notable.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 12:52, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> As per original nom. The only thing I take away after reading all of this mess (and losing some sanity as a result) is that the school is *still* not very notable.

<p><b>Delete</b> As per nom. And let's get this straight - the B. H. Carroll Theological Institute is NOT a school. That's a thing that kids go to and every school is notable and important in its community. It is argued often that every school is therefore worthy of an article in Wikipedia. I change my mind about this every week! But, I repeat, this is NOT a school - it is a non-notable, unapproved organisation with no classrooms. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 16:59, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Acts 20:35 &amp; Psalm 2:4</b> There is something very odd about this site. It seems to be written by someone who wants to paint the instituion in the worst possible light - perhaps the intention is to get it deleted for some reason? Having looked there appears to be three institutions trying to suggest they inherit the Caroll name. I've checked the web site, it looks pukka - it even does greek and that's not for the feeble minded. I've sent an email to the institute suggesting they look at the web page.</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> This appears to be fairly sizeable institution, if rather new. Comment: Arbustoo and others seem to focus on accreditation as a sole criterion for whether something counts as a legitimate higher education institution. I agree that for an ordinary college, that is a good rule. However, for a seminary or other "vocational" type schools (perhaps, say, a school of auto mechanics) I think the rule is not always applicable - the students' prospective employers (in this case, Baptist congregrations) don't care if the school is accredited, they want someone educated by a group that they themselves trust, and who can demonstrate their knowledge of the field. So, I think we need to focus on other factors - age, size, prominent graduates, connections with established denominations, press, etc. On another point, there also seems to be a tradition of distance education in theological education - probably because prospective ministers can't afford to attend a college full-time. I agree that this makes the institutions less notable, but I don't think it should disqualify them, just because there are fraudulent institutions that use the same methods. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 20:57, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
