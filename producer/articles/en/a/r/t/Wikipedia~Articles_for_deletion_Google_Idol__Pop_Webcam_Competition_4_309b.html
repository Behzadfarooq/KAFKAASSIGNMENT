<li>It's a online lip-synching contest. How is that notable? It's worse than having an article about a air guitar competition. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 06:15, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Think of it as similar to an article about a battle of a war, like D-day, Gettysburg, and the such. Plus, an online competition like this that has been in plenty of newspapers around the world and has loads of media attention is just like American Idol. see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_idol" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_idol" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_idol</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Idol_%28Season_1%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Idol_%28Season_1%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Idol_%28Season_1%29</a>. They both have depositorys of information in them.
<ul>
<li>Wars and battles are notable and interesting. An online lip-synching contest is neither. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 21:30, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Take the World Cup of Soccer for example....that's a very popular sport that thirty-two countries take part in. This is an INTERNATIONAL lip-synching competition that takes place online, and ANYBODY (and I mean ANYBODY) can participate in it. You can call this the World Cup of Lip-Synching. And since a World Cup is a soccer war, Google Idol can also be considered a lip-synching war consisting of numerous battles (matches whether they be head-to-head or 4-way).Ovechkinfan4life</li>

<li><b>Definitely Keep</b> Gidol is only six months old, but it's becoming popular and popular by the minute....and some people don't really know gidol at all, so this is needed to actually SHOW them what gidol is about. We can always TELL people what gidol is, but we wouldn't do so with as much accuracy as well as consistency. SHOWING is more efficient than TELLING. Think of it this way....you're trying to show a picture to a friend. Would you A) Simply let him see the picture itself or B) Describe the picture in a million or so words without letting him see the picture?Ovechkinfan4life
<ul>
<li>I don't see any non-trivial sources talking about it. I can't read the other links since they aren't in English, but the USA link is just the website of Gidol. So this doesn't appear to be notable at all. You cannot compare something as trivial as this to something that more than a few hundred(or MAYBE a few thousand) people have heard of to a competition that is covered by just about every sports channel and website covers and that is viewed by hundreds of millions of people. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 01:42, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> See Publicity section of googleidol.com. Gidol has been in newspapers and on television several times. It is less popular in the US than in Europe so a lot of the publicity isn't in English. There is still no reason to dismiss it as trivial, espeically since it's less than six months old and has garnered millions of hits and is and still ever-expanding. It is a worldwide phenomenon. The point is, many people around the world <b>will</b> want to know about Gidol. This is simply a documentation of the contests that have happened within the site which will allow them to do so. NewObjective 08:20, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> Google is a useful lookup source. Google is a notable corporation. A google lip-syncing competition is corporate promotion with NO HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE. <b><a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECain_Mosni_TXP_a663.html" title="User:Cain Mosni/TXP">TXP</a></b> <a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECain_Mosni_a2a0.html" title="User:Cain Mosni">Cain Mosni</a> 14:48, 4 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It has nothing to due with google, and you would know that if you knew anything about it.
<ul>
<li>So the they're deliberately trading on confusion, then. There's apotential "passing off" suit right there. Still doesn't make it significant. And having taken the time to survey the site, rather than simply read second-hand, I can say with even greater confidence that it's trivial nonsense not meriting a second glance, and certainly not warranting WP resources. <a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECain_Mosni_a2a0.html" title="User:Cain Mosni">Cain Mosni</a> 20:11, 4 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is named google idol because only google videos can be a part of it. There are other sites that support videos, like youtube, myspace, and photobucket. Stop making assumptions like that. It's like saying Baby Ruth the candy bar was named after Babe Ruth, the Great Bambino, the Sultan of Swat, the King of Crash, etc....the candy bar was not named after Babe Ruth. It was named after Ruth Cleveland, the first baby ever born in the White House. Or saying that Caesar salad dressing was named after Roman Emperor Julius Caesar. It wasn't. It was named after a chef named Caesar who founded the dressing. This is somewhat mundane if you ask me Ovechkinfan4life</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Just becuase you say it's trivial doesn't necessarily make it so. And besides, google idol is in a sense like myspace and facebook and digg.com. All three sites were founded by one person in particular (myspace by Tom Anderson, facebook by Matt Zuckerburg, and digg.com by Kevin Rose). Google Idol is similar in that one person founded this (Ben Petro). What has happened to myspace, facebook, and digg.com? They became very popular websites and one of the most popular in the world today. As for google idol, it's just in its infant stages. The reason you probably never heard of google idol is because many ppl have limited access to the media or simply they don't read. I myself had not really heard of digg.com until I read Business Week one time and heard about how Kevin Rose made $60 million in 18 months. Give it some time....Rome wasn't built in a day, so why should google idol be as popular as the World Cup in its rookie year? Not every rookie has to be an Alexander Ovechkin type of rookie (or in laymans terms a very popular rookie). Some websites are brand new and that's just fine. We all have to be new at something sooner or later. Ovechkinfan4life
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> When it <i>is</i> significant, then it merits notice in an article, and only then. There's no need to "give it a chance".

<li>It is significant....many people are just too lazy to figure out what's going on around the media.Ovechkinfan4life</li>

<p><b>merge</b> into Gidol - the details arn't that important --<a href="../../../t/-/r/User%7ET-rex_9e1e.html" title="User:T-rex">T</a>-<a href="../../../t/-/r/User_talk%7ET-rex_4226.html" title="User talk:T-rex">rex</a> 03:05, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>It is merged into Gidol as a link. If it was on the same page as gidol the home page would just become all messed up like Dexter Reed's Mondo Burgers at the beginning of the Good Burger movie. And the details are needed so people can see an example of formats for Gidol. If you're interested in sports you would be interested in scores as well. And if you're interested in statistics you could analyze these statistics for various tests (for example, you can do a chi-square test of homogeneity to see if getting a certain amount of votes is independent upon the country a performer is from).
