An article about <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nat_Turner_e1b8.html" title="Nat Turner">Nat Turner</a> exists. I agree that we should probably have an article about the incident itself, in addition to that one, if POV is a problem. But slavery and slave rebellions are too inflammatory, in my opinion, to have a new article for every side of the story. As the talk page of the article points out, there were non-white victims involved in the incident (and in slavery itself.) Delicate issues require delicate, consensus-building article discussions and non-POV article titles. And we need sources for these names, as well as some of the details of the article. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 03:06, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The only way this should be merged is if all the victims are included. to be worth including, it needs either a paragraph explaining the 200 plus murdered slaves and the individual names cutting, or the extra paragraph and ALL the names of the black victims. To name only white casualties is on the "we were right to annex the rhineland" side of POV. <a href="../../../b/o/y/User%7EBoynamedsue_998b.html" title="User:Boynamedsue">Boynamedsue</a></li>

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> as copyvio with the likely intent of advertising. Just for your information though, you're not allowed to replace removed PROD tags. Removal, even without explanation, is considered a contesting of the tag (albeit a weak one), so the next step is AfD.

<li><b>Delete</b> as NN. Not even checking with the figures, as a free-to-play game that downloads in seconds on broadband, it isn't surprising that it has spread like wildfire amongst these free gaming sites. What else is there to actually say about this game? The article itself repeats itself and doesn't make a great deal of sense. Is this 'road rage' a sega game I've never heard of or are we talking <a href="../../../r/o/a/Road_Rash_7865.html" title="Road Rash">Road Rash</a>? When was there a motorbike duel in Bladerunner? Seems gobbledegook to put a few sentences in an article that hasn't proven any need to exist. With the greatest of respect, Bejeweled isn't just a popular webgame, it springboarded Popcap games up into a company publishing and producing some polished games and established them as one to watch. Bejeweled has been ported to many formats and is also a commercial product (the deluxe version). If this game gets some press, takes the world by storm etc. then I'd welcome an article, but right now it reads like a nonsensical advert about a popular-enough game that's getting copied-and-pasted by its developers. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 10:06, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The reason that there are no incoming hyperlinks is that editors had already helpfully arranged for all of the different Mark Tuckers elsewhere to hyperlink to individual articles that this article then listed, ready for people to write. In other words, they had already done some of the work of setting up a proper disambiguation, ready for others to then build upon. You could have used "what links here" <i>for the redlinked articles that it disambiguated</i>. You still can, in fact.

<li><b>Delete</b>. These minor entries are <i>better</i> in one article than a dozen little ones, but frankly the concepts in this article are divided into two types: important concepts that should be (and indeed are) explained adequately in the main articles -- like "Kingdom Hearts" itself and the "Heartless" -- and other concepts so minor that they don't need to be discussed on Wikipedia at all. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 18:45, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>I am the author of this page, and I made some edits after this issue was brought up. After editing, I believe I have addressed some important issues:</p>
<p>As per Wikipedia's rules, a musical group is considered "notable" if they meet one of the criteria cited by Wikipedia itself. One such critera is that the band "Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable)...</p>
<p>-Keeping this in mind...consider that Apse is signed to Spanish label Acuarela Discos, and has currently completed two major releases for the label. You can find this information on Acuarela's website, or by confirming with them if you so desire. The external link at the bottom of the article now proves that Apse has two releases on Acuarela Discos. This label is an important indie label based in Madrid, with a large roster, and has been in existence for over 10 years. They have had releases by Xiu Xiu, members of Sonic Youth, and the Decemberists, all of which are large enough to be considered "notable".</p>
<p>-Further proof of Apse's European Tour can be confirmed by Acuarela Discos. On their webpage itself there is a link to the "Tanned TIn" festival website, held in Castellon, Spain, which has Apse's name on the banner. On it, it shows many other "notable" acts Apse will play alongside with. I have now included this link as a footnote in the biography section.</p>
<p>-Apse is also listed on AllMusic.com, which is noted on Wikipedia's own Notability page as "a good online resource for music and musicians". I have now put a link to Apse on allmusic.com, in the article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Apse (<a href="../../../a/p/s/User_talk%7EApse_1ca3.html" title="User talk:Apse">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Apse_928b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Apse">contribs</a>) 05:12, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<li>I've changed the title properly by using the "move" button.

<p>I also just added a footnote to one of the interviews where I got some of the information from, in the main biography (footnote 1). Apse 17:05, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just added a link to the myspace page after the mention of the European Tour, which now confirms many specific dates, locations, and venues.

The lead makes enough claims: <i>"Valente won the Italian Karting Championship (UISP) in the junior category in 1994, took part at the 1995, 1996 and 1997 European and World Karting Championships (FIA/CIK). He also tested a number of Formula-3 and Formula-3000 cars for different teams in Europe."</i> And while karting may be the lowest level of motorsports, winning a national competition in it (even at junior level) would in my view be notable, but I have doubts it is verifiable and the image leads me to lean to vanity. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:25, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

I don't see how that meshes well with your statement that "[w]e will not bend to your demands".

<li><b>Delete</b> Such an entry belongs in a place like Ripoffreport.com and not a forum guised as a source of valid information. Is the purpose of the Wikipedia forum to service individual vendettas, disgruntled employees, or un-informed individuals? This type of entry assumes much and does not serve as a source of valid information but as a tool of misdirection and assumptions. Silensor seems extremely un-informed with regards to the facts about NCU and can only assume that s/he has no experience with the institution directly and therefore is making unfounded blanket statements. S/he speaks of "recent controversy" as the ration for their view, but in fact the issues I can only assume s/he speaks about are historical because in truth they are related to NCU only through their former President Donald Hecht. There are no recent issues to speak of. I suggest s/he at least attempt a course so that they may avoid speaking from ignorance. There are other forums an individual may use for such recourse, this forum is inappropriate as Wikipedia might be misinterpreted to be a source of valid unbiased information on this subject. NCU has nearly 4000 students and over 600 affiliated staff. The information contained within this site serves no public interest, in only serves to satisfy a vendetta of a few individuals. If such a page must exist, it should be put under the heading of Donald Hecht as the topic and not NCU. Do the right thing. Delete this item.

<li><b>Keep</b> The information in the Northcentral article is accurate and should be kept. I understand that it may be unflattering, but this site is not meant to be a marketing tool. Students spend a lot of money working on their education. If the school has controversial practices, it may negatively affect their accreditation status, and thereby make degrees from the school of questionable value. Prospective students and others should be aware of this information. Bluecanada 18:13, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Templeton has been a VERY important part of skateboarding since the late 1980's. Not to mention he is known internationally as a visual artist. I can think of several large scale magazines that Templeton is featured in on a monthly basis. Don't believe me? Pick up a copy of this month's Transworld... maybe Skateboarder then? ... how 'bout Thrasher... Juxtapoz, perhaps? All of these magazines circulate between 500 000 and 1 000 000 copies a month. Should I go into publications that are not printed in English as well? What the hell are you thinking? The fact that this article is being considered for deletion is absolutely ridiculous. The person who initiated this deletion vote obviously knows nothing about skateboarding, which makes me think that they should stick to deleting articles from subjects that they know something, if anything, about.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>A religious order in operation since 1929, honored by Cardinals and Governors, with 29 or so homes in the U.S. and Europe, founded by a Sister proposed for beatification, whose case is working its way through the procedures of the Vatican, seems pretty notable.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:31, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I agree, I think the person whoever posted this should be put on probation if he returns. If that's what you mean.

<li><b>Comment</b> Are we sure this is a hoax? The article may not provide an accurate description of Chacon, but I have some evidence that he might actually exist. In the 1993 non-fiction children's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Very-Scary-Almanac-Eric-Elfman/dp/0517274043" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Very-Scary-Almanac-Eric-Elfman/dp/0517274043" rel="nofollow"><i>The Very Scary Almanac</i></a>, author Eric Elfman includes an interview with one Christopher Chacon, whom he identifies as a member of OSIR. Elfman writes in the introduction to the interview:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"The Office of Scientific Investigation and Research (OSIR) is a private agency, based in Central California, that investigates paranormal occurrences around the world. Since 1985 OSIR has investigated hundreds of reports of poltergeists, apparitions, haunts, causes of demonic possession, UFO abductions, and the simply unexplainable. The OSIR staff also includes electrical engineers, geologists, biologists, and scientists from other disciplines. Christopher Chacon, the director of OSIR and a field investigator, is also a professional illusionist and magician, a useful talent when it comes to detecting fraud or trickery. In December 1992, he agreed to answer some questions over the telephone about his job as a real ghostbuster..." (pg. 41)</dd>
</dl>
<p>There's a brief excerpt from the interview <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/CR0213680/monsters.htm" class="external text" title="http://library.thinkquest.org/CR0213680/monsters.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>, just to prove that I'm not making this up. Elfman also includes an address for OSIR, namely PO Box 461779, Los Angeles, CA 90046. <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 01:02, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Addendum</b>: Chacon has an <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1317666/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1317666/" rel="nofollow">IMDB profile</a>, fwiw. Although, doing a little Google search on OSIR, I really don't know <i>what</i> to think about this guy. I can't find any evidence online confirming that OSIR ever existed, although the 1993 book (which predates <i>Psi-Factor</i>) suggests that it did. *shrugs* <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 01:14, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Comment</b> I generally believe that Chacon is misrepresenting himself in all of the instances posted on the internet. Basically all of the biographies of Chris Chacon share exactly the same source. They are all structured the same and have exactly the same information, and I believe they are the same. Incorrect information, copied over 100 times still does not make the information correct. I believe that Chris Chacon is a fraud, and the information that is out on the internet neither proves nor disproves it's existence, leaving me to request a delete for this because their isn't enough information to write a credible, neutral article on Chris Chacon. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamC24_90c1.html" title="User:WilliamC24">WilliamC24</a> 04:41, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment – some research</b> I found a few pre-1996 (ie, pre Psi-Factor) Factiva hits mentioning OSIR:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Spook Stalker". <i>People</i>. 20 September 1993. p. 85</li>
<li>Carpenter, Richard P. "The hotel that inspired `The Shining'". <i>The Boston Globe</i>. 31 October 1993. p. B32.</li>

<li>"Things that go bump in the Bayou". <i>Los Angeles Daily News</i>. 30 October 1994. p. T1</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These specifically mention Chacon:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Hallisy, Erin. "Orinda's Real Ghostbusters / Every day is Halloween at the Office of Paranormal Investigations". <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>. 29 October 1990. p. A5.</li>
<li>"Ghost busters never saw one". <i>Los Angeles Daily News</i>. 30 Ocober 1990. p. N3.</li>

<li>"Check out haunted hotels". <i>Richmond Times-Dispatch</i>. 23 October 1994. p. H3. (duplicated in several other papers)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So it seems that Chacon is a real ghost hunter, and that the OSIR actually existed, although the facts of the organization may have been exaggerated for the tv show. What do people think? <i>Please</i> relist this discussion at AfD if no one responds. <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 04:51, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I will not let crap like this stand. If you can write a more comprehensive, neutral article, I'll remove the delete tag, other wise, I'll argue the point and let it stand. I have no access to such databases as of now, and all that stands online are the same articles copied over and over. While I believe that Chacon may be a one of these ghost hunters, like what you see on the SciFi channel, I believe that he has exaggerated his importance, and by the lack of any current information that I can find with my resources, I don't believe that he is active. I am a skeptic, and I don't believe that stating that the MiB, paranormal exists as a fact is a neutral point of view. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamC24_90c1.html" title="User:WilliamC24">WilliamC24</a> 05:01, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>One more comment</b> Some of his television credits do appear legitimate; according to <a href="http://home.online.no/~arthujul/paranormal_videos.htm" class="external text" title="http://home.online.no/~arthujul/paranormal_videos.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://home.online.no/~arthujul/ufovideos.htm" class="external text" title="http://home.online.no/~arthujul/ufovideos.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a>, someone named Chris or Christopher Chacon appeared on the television series <i><a href="../../../s/i/g/Sightings.html" title="Sightings">Sightings</a></i> multiple times. I found a possible verification for the Connie Chung appearance as well - a December 30, 1993 TV listing from <i>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i> says, ""Eye to Eye With Connie Chung" 9 p.m. on Channel 5 (77301) - Segments include a report on safety at railroad crossings; the story of a dying woman's wish to reunite with her family; a glimpse into the secret training grounds of South Africa's neo-Nazis; and a look at real-life ghostbusters, the <b>Office of Scientific Investigation and Research</b>." I also found a 1994 <a href="../../../k/c/a/KCAL_9f9d.html" title="KCAL">KCAL</a> news transcipt mentioning Chacon at Lexis Nexis. I'm fairly confident now that some of this is salvageable with a little effort, but considering I'm the only person who seems to have access to some of these sources, it might be easier to delete it and let me rewrite it at a later date. Of course, if someone else has access to the sources and wants to try to clean it up, feel free....<a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 14:19, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Once the page has been replaced by disambiguation pages, it is no longer needed.

<li>I do not mind if this page is deleted, but additional pages should not go through AfD, in my opinion. I suggest moving content to separate talk pages, this handles many of the redirects, and then deleting the content on the original page as you move it. That way, you'll keep your place if it is a long page and someone who comes along later will not check to make sure that all of the content has been moved to the other pages. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 13:07, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non notable "record label" (actually a website, kind of a free vanity publisher for bands). "Gomek Records" gets 22 distinct Google hits. Gomek gets a lot of unrelated hits. Threat signal (their notable artist) gets 21 distinct Google hits in combination with Gomek. In fact, Gomek is not a record label, but a kind of webhost. Everyone can place their demo's, songs, ... on their website if they match their quality requirements. There is no contract, no record, no promotion, no exclusivity. See [<a href="http://www.gomek.com/submissions.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gomek.com/submissions.asp" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>]. As such, they have had until now one band wo put a previously released demo also on their website and later went on to record one album (which in itself seems not enough to match <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> for that band. Some people have gotten to know the band through Gomek, which is good, but as can be seen from the Google hits, this is only a small part of the exposure the band has gotten and is hardly relevant in their career, let alone as a reason to have an article on this website. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 09:33, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: it would probably be better if <a href="../../../g/o/m/Gomek.html" title="Gomek">Gomek</a> became a redirect to <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crocodile.html" title="Crocodile">Crocodile</a> (all info seems to be there already), or was just deleted, but that is a separate issue. I'm not against mass AfD's (I've donea few myself), but they should be about very similar articles (content and so on). These two have the same author, and one is named after the other, but they are completely unrelated and would have a quite different AfD logic. So I'm not going to include Gomek in this AfD. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 10:38, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>At present this consists of 1 paragraph defining what a swimming pool is (from the <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swimming_pool.html" title="Swimming pool">Swimming pool</a> article), 1 paragraph of marketing speak about what is invovled with deciding to building a swimming pool, a series of headings with no content, a see also list of two items (<a href="../../../s/w/i/Swimming_pool.html" title="Swimming pool">Swimming pool</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Construction.html" title="Construction">construction</a>), and - what I suspect is the primary motive for the page - a long list of external links.</p>
<p>I don't see any potential in this for an encyclopaedic article.

<li>If an article is not ready for the primetime so to speak, it's best to keep it in your userspace. Smerdis has offered some idea on what we expect such an article to look like, and it doesn't include partial copies of existing articles.

<li>Fine. Go ahead and delete it. If you feel like it is a worthy article then let me know and I will continue to work on it and post it when it is in a more finished state.

<li><b>Delete</b>, while it might possibly be notable in the local area this does not merit it a Wikipedia article. The article is also incredibly poorly written with many unsourced statements and even self-contradictorary paragraphs, e.g. "In 1995, the premiere store was a happening joint called "The De-Lousing Factory". It closed in June of 1977 after an 8 year-old boy was killed underneath the escalator."

<li><b>Comment</b> - Local suburban newspapers really have nothing to say that is worthwhile. When you are in high school, you will see guys get in the local newspaper for coming first in the under-10 football competition or because they won some Freshman poetry competition in their local village etc. As was pointed out in the DRV, the newspaper had a very small circulation, less than the average spamvertisement by you rlocal member of congress/parliament who has 100,000+ constituents and uses his spamvertisement newspaper to plug local butchers who do fundraising for him.<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">BLabberiNg</a> 02:23, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> says: "A company or corporation is notable if it meets '<b>any</b> of the following criteria: 1. The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself." The article lists multiple non-trivial published works. Therefore, MacDade Mall passes <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 18:17, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> The criteria asks for <b>non-trivial</b> published works as references - the articles lacks these (a couple of small mentions of <i>parts</i> of the mall not the mall itself in one larger local newspaper; an article reporting on the mall closure in a small local newspaper (mentioned in the previous afd, not in article); a random Flickr photo account; a non-working link on a model railway hobbyists' website.) Also, even if better sources were found, <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is still a guideline subject to consensus interpretation. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 18:51, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If the mall is notable from some other perspective such as architecture, length, or height, by all means produce appropriate sources saying so. Contrary to the apparent opinion of those with mall fetishes, I am not out to get all malls. <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carr_Mill_Mall_b222.html" title="Carr Mill Mall">Carr Mill Mall</a> is clearly significant for non-<a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> reasons, and I have done my bit to improve that article. Similarly, I am considering whether or not Chesterfield County, Virginia's Cloverleaf Mall is notable enough for an article due to the drawn out and well covered dispute over its redevelopment. There is no way that all malls are notable by default. I know of plenty of enclosed malls that should not be listed here. I'll note them here because I don't think that's a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>: Tazewell Mall, Richlands Mall, Claypool Hill Mall, Mercer Mall, Jasper Mall.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Despite TruthbringerToronto's grasping at straws, it does NOT have multiple NON-trivial media coverage.

<li><b>Delete</b> I encouraged relisting because of the new source that was found by the last contributor to the prior AFD, which needed evaluation by the community. My opinion is that this doesn't get the article to meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>; only one of those sources is <i>about</i> the mall. The one on <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telemedicine.html" title="Telemedicine">telemedicine</a> could be a source for that article, which could use sourcing and improvement. The one on the lawsuit couuld be a source for an article about changing patterns of food distribution or on department stores in general. But neither of these are sources about the mall. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 16:06, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>COMMENT</b>: At first, I thought: Why does anyone care about this mall? Then I saw the picture: <a href="../../../1/0/3/Image%7E1030051624.jpg.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/f/fb/1030051624.jpg/300px-1030051624.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" longdesc="../../../1/0/3/Image%7E1030051624.jpg.html" /></a>. That is a pretty damn cool entrance. However, based on the number of cars outside, I would say it is not notable. But, if we can find a reliable source that that ridiculous entrance actually exists, and is not photoshopped out of a kids cartoon, then the page should definitely remain. NOTE: The article states "The Macdade Mall previously contained 2 indoor water fountains years ago." How many water fountains does it contain now!? —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 08:48, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

The play of Aeschylus was also created in 467 BC.

<dd>I'm not sure the google test is really appropriate for a year, a quick flick through the results shows mostly garbageish results. I would also suggest that rather than giving random information on the AfD, you actually add it to the article.

<p>This is a <b>non-notable</b> personality. A google search for "Robert Larzelere" produces only 100 results, and it is not at all clear that any of them (apart from the wikipedia link!) refer to the person featured here. Most seem to relate to a reputable clinical psychiatrist at the University of Nebraska.</p>
<p>On the face of it the article is <b>libellous</b>, both to Dr Larzelere, and to Werner Erhard.

The article does not meet wikipedia's criteria for <b>verifiability</b>, especially in respect of potentially defamatory personal allegations. The sole source for the contentious material is Pressman's book [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outrageous_Betrayal" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outrageous_Betrayal" rel="nofollow">Outrageous_Betrayal</a>]. This does not appear to satisfy the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> guidelines as it fails to provide footnotes, bibliography or references to the primary sources on which it draws, so the assertions cannot be checked. Although written in a matter-of-fact narrative style, it appears to draw substantially on off-the-record unattributable conversations. The account of the incident featured (and much else in the book) is directly contradicted by attributable eye-witness reports in <i>60 minutes and the assasination of Werner Erhard</i>, Jane Self Ph.D, 1992 ISBN: 0942540239, which - in contrast - contains over 250 footnotes giving full detail of individuals interviewed and publications quoted. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveApter_966a.html" title="User:DaveApter">DaveApter</a> 11:30, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>DELETE I concur- this article is clearly not designed as an encylopedia article, but rather a "tabloid article" . It is patently sensational.

<li><b>Comment</b> (after edit conflict) And I'm sure, using those sources, you could produce a very thorough and engaging piece of work with the title "Scottish Nation Identity". But it would be an essay rather than an encyclopedia article. People's personal feelings on unionism/nationalism or Scottishness/Britishness are a matter of the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Scotland_74e3.html" title="Politics of Scotland">Politics of Scotland</a> and the extent to which Scottish people identify with traditional Scottish symbols is a part of the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Scotland_a221.html" title="Culture of Scotland">Culture of Scotland</a>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The title of this article is far too broad and open to interpretation and I think it will always end up either repeating reams of content from other articles or it will become original thought, drawing its own conclusions. At present it seems to do a little of both.</dd>
<dd>Incidentally, Donald Dewar's remarks about the Scottish national identity in <i>A Lifetime of Opportunity</i> seem to have related to his feelings on the political climate of Scotland in the late 1990. I think they'd be better referenced in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Scotland_74e3.html" title="Politics of Scotland">Politics of Scotland</a> or in fairly slender article on the <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Dewar_a2b6.html" title="Donald Dewar">man himself</a>.--<a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslaySolomon_7ae5.html" title="User:IslaySolomon">IslaySolomon</a> 17:46, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, the <i>Oxford Companion to Scottish History</i> has eight pages on <b>national identity</b>, making it one of the longest articles in the book.

<p>There are around 850 google hits for this topic, of which over a third appear to be from Wikipedia articles and mirrors. Around 130 unique hits. The article itself is unreferenced, in that the few references mentioned <i>do not appear to mention the term</i>. Some of the article is concerned with bona-fide mathematics, unprovable thjeorems etc., but most of it reads very much like original research, possibly as a thinly-veiled attack on certain controversial individuals.

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. Notability is, as pointed out below, demonstrated by specific coverage in reliable third-party sources, not by our own opinion on how big "big" is. For much of this AfD that was completely ignored by the 'keep' side. Later sources started to be mentioned, but only two third-party sources relating to the same assertion of notability have so far been referenced enough for anyone to actually be able to find and read them. If they were significant enough I could default to keep on the basis of insufficent discussion - however, they consist of an interview and a MobyGames listing showing that a special edition of Ultima IX was named after them, which is a point of minor trivia that might merit a mention in <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ultima_IX%7E_Ascension_6512.html" title="Ultima IX: Ascension">Ultima IX: Ascension</a>, and in terms of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> qualifies the interview and game listing as passing mentions (they total exactly four sentences in an 11-page interview, one of which is "Yeah", plus the one line in the MobyGames listing). They are therefore not sufficient.</p>
<p>It has been asserted that they received other coverage in some other magazines, but no mention of when or where. That's too vague. If the actual articles can actually be tracked down, so that they can be referenced with issue number and article title, then <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> can consider them (once they are able to actually read them). At this point in time this is still an article on a website with no adequately verified assertion of notability, and policy requires its deletion. Articles are <i>not</i> innocent until proven guilty - the burden is on the editors of the article.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Quoting my earlier deprodding rationale: "Any active club, run since 1994, that has a <a href="http://www.udic.org/members/roster.cgi" class="external text" title="http://www.udic.org/members/roster.cgi" rel="nofollow">membership roster huge enough to crash your neighbour's Amiga</a>, is probably notable". As for verifiability, we can trust the site itself as a primary source. I'm pretty sure I've seen mentions of the group in mags, just can't remember where right now, it's been years. The bottom line is, anyone who's interested of <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultima.html" title="Ultima">Ultima</a> series of games is bound to run to these people sooner or later.

<li><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> says, "If an article topic has no reputable, reliable, <i>third-party</i> sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on that topic."

<li>Fair enough. Here's a small question that came in mind, though - exactly what in the article is questionable enough to warrant verification from third-party sources? Please be specific.

<li>And exactly <i>why</i> shouldn't we have an article in the first place?

<li>Well, given that there's no contentious information in the article, self-published sources are fine with me, and like I said, I think it is in Ultima Online for Dummies. Possibly in some of the other for Dummies books, I don't know for sure. Might even have been included in some Origin products, as a link to their fanclub, but I'm not sure.

Seriously, if somebody wanted to verify this in the way you wanted, they could, since this is a factual account but that would be way outside the needs of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:12, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>You are now actively avoiding answering the questions. Please point to where on the World Wide Web the club's origins on Prodigy may be observed and where on the World Wide Web the customs of the club have been documented and fact checked. Lack of an answer, having been asked three times in a row, will strongly indicate that your assertion of verifiability is a false one. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:18, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, the various Wikipolicies quite wisely acknowledge they aren't an iron-clad straitjacket. Besides, the group has been around since at least 1996 according to the IAW. Do you think they've been lying for 10 years? I think given the lack of any claims that any information in the article is wrong, given the lack of any comments on the Internet that they're wrong, that well, the principle that a person's account of themself can be reliable about themself. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:52, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>A direct quote from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>: "Wikipedia:Verifiability is one of Wikipedia's three content-guiding policies. The other two are Wikipedia:No original research and Wikipedia:Neutral point of view. Jointly, these policies determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in the main namespace. They should not be interpreted in isolation from one another, and editors should therefore try to familiarize themselves with all three. <b>The principles upon which these three policies are based are negotiable only at the foundation level, not at the level of the English-language Wikipedia.</b>" (Emphasis mine) -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 02:48, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And if you read further down on the page: Material from self-published sources, and other published sources of dubious reliability, may be used as sources of information about themselves in articles about themselves, so long as: (blah, blah, all things relevant and not in dispute here). The fact is, there are things that need robust verifiability, and things that don't. Given that anybody can check their website, I'm not seeing any problem with verifiability. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 03:34, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you want to use the site in that manner, you'll need to preface every piece of information extracted from the site with a phrase like "The Ultima Dragons website claims that...", in order to bring it in line with that kind of usage. And of course, there's still the bit of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> that says, "Anyone can create a website or pay to have a book published, and then claim to be an expert in a certain field. For that reason, self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources." Maybe it would be different if there were reliable outside sources, but there aren't. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 09:19, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Note the word <i>largely</i>. That means there are exceptions, doesn't it?. This, I contend is a clear exception. Why? Because the article is autobiographical. Since this information has been presented for at least 10 years according to the Internet Wayback machine, I doubt they're making it up. And seriously, you can check the internet for Ultima Dragons sites. There are plenty of people who claim membership.

Pity they didn't say what months, it might make searching easier(still, I will try, so cut me some slack on looking for them, if you please). But still, I think it indicates that notability does exist. After all, if the creator of a well-known game series mentions them as the reason to make a collector's edition of a notable game, that is something substantial. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:43, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In the grand scheme of things, it really isn't. It's cool and all that they seem to recognize you guys, but it's still just a fan club for a video game. Try to look at this from the point of view of someone who doesn't play video games. I still stand by the argument that if you haven't been written about, (not just mentioned, but discussed) then you aren't notable, which is one that Wikipedia policy agrees with. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 20:16, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You guys? First, I am not, nor have I ever been an Ultima Dragon(I have, however, played the Ultima games). Second, looking at it from the point of view of someone who doesn't play video games(let alone hasn't played the Ultima series), I realize that that person wouldn't know about the importance of the Ultima series, let alone the fans of it, so IF for some reason they were looking for it, explaining what it was would be quite important. I certainly would't say such a person has any standing to question their notability. They just wouldn't know enough about the subject. Especially one like this one which doesn't always attract that much journalistic or academic interest. (Though Richard Garriot, who does attract that interest, has apparently spoken about them, at least according to what I've found on the usenet site. Now I just need to find the articles. It may take some time, since I'm searching the Wayback machine to see if I can find the old articles.).</dd>

<li>And a random comment, putting it here just because I feel the need to ramble a bit: I don't believe verifiability is reason for deletion if the notability can otherwise be established from the sources. In AfD, <i>notability</i> is much more of a factor. We're supposed to be debating whether or not this topic needs to exist as a stand-alone article. Lack of verifiability is a <i>cleanup issue</i>: You can remove unverifiable material from the article, and merge the rest <i>if</i> the article isn't big enough. Lack of verifiability is only an issue when there's absolutely no material that would speak <i>for</i> the notability, for example, saying that a book is a bestseller without telling the book's ISBN or even publisher, and then finding less than 10 google hits for the author, all unrelated. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 06:23, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In addiotion to that, there's a difference between verifiability of a theory, and verifiability of a fact. There's little, if any theory in the article (nothing like say, Ultima Online's success killed Ultima X), and mostly non-contested facts of an autobiographical nature. Even if the facts aren't verified robustly, that they could be (because they are facts) is a reason to not delete. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:34, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>A club's origins are facts as they would be events that exist. They can be observed, remembered, and written about. Same with customs. And they have been reported on the club's website.

<li>Failure to be verifiable <i>is</i> a reason to delete an article - if you can't find <i>any</i> mentions at all from any source whatsoever that seems remarkable. However, in this case, there's absolutely no reason not to believe the primary source, because even casual digging reveals that the group has been in existence for a long time and their own arguments seem to hold water. This is where this debate turns controversial: The primary source holds water, <i>unlike</i> in many other random sites that tend to get slapped "not verifiable" etc; this is where your friendly hey-we-just-opened-a-website-yesterday tactical nuke of two-penny-website smiting turns into the evil cruftbane of stacked charges, a tool to get articles deleted because of a technicality rather than what plain ordinary common sense says.<br />
Also, as Wizardry Dragon says below, we're facing a small dilemma here. People who toss around "not verifiable" usually follow it up with "two google hits". In this particular case, <b>"not verifiable" is followed up with "23,100 google hits"</b>, which in this case isn't followed up with "...but most are irrelevant". this is a little bit of a contradiction and a reason for doubt. There's <i>reasonable doubt</i> that "not verifiable" is bunk, no matter how you put it. "Not verifiable" in this case needs clear demonstration and clear example proving otherwise, because the group <i>has</i> visibility. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 09:47, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I know for a fact that there are plenty of third party sources that mention the Ultima Dragons, they've been mentioned in quite a few pieces of gaming literature. The problem is no one's really gone to the effort to track them down and properly write that information in and cite it. I myself have added information on some of the projects that they've participated in. One of them <a href="../../../l/a/z/Ultima_V%7E_Lazarus_55ff.html" title="Ultima V: Lazarus">Ultima V: Lazarus</a> got a lot of coverage in the gaming and general media, including <a href="../../../p/c/_/PC_Gamer_a838.html" title="PC Gamer">PC Gamer</a>, <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_Gaming_World_5490.html" title="Computer Gaming World">Computer Gaming World</a>. By association with the many projects like that alone I'd think the group is notable. As to verifiability, it's a valid complaint that it hasn't been properly cited or verified, but it <i>can</i> be.

<li>Hello all, I'm the creator of the page in question and operator of the GdayPal website. I urge you to consider the GdayPal forums as a distinct and valuable entry into wikipedia as the largest open free gay forums to men in Australia. I'll concede the fact the website isn't well know out side of Australia but neither is OUTeverywhere.com a UK website similar to our own list on Wiki, and I feel both website deserve mentioning. I started the page in the hopes that our members would also contribute. The site is a valuable resource to all gay men living in Australia as it cover opinions and fact face gay men in a modern western society. Never the less I will happily take the page down if that is the consensuses of this forum. | 00:29, 22 September 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Gdaypal (<a href="../../../g/d/a/User_talk%7EGdaypal_e98a.html" title="User talk:Gdaypal">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gdaypal2_4f38.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gdaypal2">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li>The website has appeared in the premier Australian gay publications SX National, Bent Mag and Sydney Star Observer consistently over the past 12 months. Is seen by 400,000 views every week on OutTV and SelectTV on QueerTV in Australia and Canada. But the real value of the discussions themselves are what stand out as unique and unadulterated critical opinion on Australian gay cultural issues. Researchers searching wikipedia, looking to understanding Australian gay culture, would find GdayPal an essential social knowledge resource. These are the largest community gay forums available to men in Australia, I urge you to seriously consider keeping this list.| 10:29, 25 September 2006 (UTC) --Gdaypal 10:00, 25 September 2006 (UTC)<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Gdaypal</small></li>

So that said, when <i>doesn't</i> a G4 apply to a previously deleted article? --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 19:42, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>When the article is deleted through an uncontested prod or a speedy delete, rather than an AfD. And if you read the link to the previous AfD, it was closed because it was speedily deleted. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 21:04, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The basic idea is that administrators can speedily delete content that has previously gained a rough consensus to delete — i.e. it has been through a full discussion in one of our normal (non-speedy) deletion processes — and therefore been examined by several pairs of eyes. Speedy deletions are things that we entrust to the judgement of just one pair of eyes. (And thus our speedy deletion criteria are narrow, limiting speedy deletions to solely those areas where we trust that that one pair of eyes will make the correct decision almost all of the time.) If some content was speedily deletable under another criterion once, if reposted it will be speedily deletable under that same criterion again. So there is no need for G4 to apply to speedy deletions. In this case, there wasn't a speedy deletion criterion that covered the article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:51, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The issue is more related to the <i>Elite</i> units, which appear in that source. Any old unit with a line in balaclavas and mirror shades seem to fit into that, so you end up with some countries listing justabout every tinpot outfit. The only one I can say is accurate is the UK, and even then a couple of editors insist on listing a whole host of dross on a regular basis, that's pretty clear cut because whilst the UK does not have official policy, there is mention of the make-up of DSF in a Hansard (parliamentary) comment.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have added more data to the article on his screenwriting career. Note that his professional credits seem to be mostly under the name of "Henry Cobbold", rather than "Henry Lytton-Cobbold". They seem somewhat marginal, but re-examination may be warranted. (Incidentally, unless there's some other Henry Lytton-Cobbold he has to be disambiguated from, the page should <b>not</b> be moved to include his middle name.) <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoess_95be.html" title="User:Choess">Choess</a> 05:16, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>okay firstly the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Second_Division_cb6f.html" title="Scottish Second Division">Scottish Second Division</a> is not 'fully professional' - Brian Tucker's club, Greenock Morton, are, to the best of my knowledge, the only full-time professional club in the league. The article states that Tucker is a player playing at youth team level, i.e. he is not listed as being part of the first team squad, as shown <a href="http://www.soccerbase.com/teams2.sd?teamid=1765" class="external text" title="http://www.soccerbase.com/teams2.sd?teamid=1765" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.gmfc.net/the-squad/index.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.gmfc.net/the-squad/index.asp" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I understand that <i>Articles about first team squad members who have not made a first team appearance may also be appropriate</i> however in my opinion Greenock Morton are not of a sufficient stature to warrent articles on youth players - i.e. most first team squad players don't even have articles! <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbsey_d5ce.html" title="User:Forbsey">Forbsey</a> 17:17, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I want to point out however, the people who run Wikipedia have a better understanding of what is notable and what is not. I am grateful for everyone who has spoke up for me and my work, but if Wikipedia does not wish for my account to be on here, I would respect that. I have alot on my plate with the application to NBC and other networks talking to me. If I am not on now, please believe me someday I wil be on the pages of Wikipedia, until then, please respect the site and respect the show by being appropriate fans and not terrorist. I also see now that <a href="http://www.facebook.com" class="external text" title="http://www.facebook.com" rel="nofollow">FACEBOOK</a> is now open to anyone, I would invite fans who do not have facebook to join that and join our many fan groups there. I frequesnt those alot. Thank you. BradmanTWB</li>

<li>As I suggested above, I think that a single page should be devoted to briefly describing the major Warcraft maps. By brief, I mean about one paragraph (or less).

<li>Exactly. I suggested something similar here. I tried to convince the editors of Footmen Frenzy to transwiki the article. I envision a single article discussing the phenomenon of user-made maps in general with subsections on specific games that have a significant presence of user-made maps. Each of those subsections could then link to the proper gaming wiki with all the details concerning each of the maps. -- <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScientizzle_e07a.html" title="User:Scientizzle">Scientizzle</a> 16:33, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Why though? Each of these games is notable. Dota and Footmen Frenzy, are equally popular, or more popular, than the Actual Online Game itself.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Other Warcraft III custom maps are being permitted to stay. I feel as though there's a bit of hypocrisy.

<li>You basically argued the same thing on the AfDs I initiated for "other Warcraft III custom maps," <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Dark_Deeds_47df.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Dark Deeds">Dark Deeds</a> &amp; <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Eve_of_the_Apocalypse_%282nd_nomination%29_a5ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Eve of the Apocalypse (2nd nomination)">Eve of the Apocalypse</a>. <small>(This strikes me as a ridiculous contradiction to your own argument: don't delete this article becuase other Warcraft III custom map articles exist, then you vote to keep the other articles, too?!)</small> The discussion here is about Footmen Wars, and Footmen Wars should be considered in its merits alone. There is no "fairness" involving Wikipedia articles--a subject either merits an article, according to Wikipedia policies &amp; guidelines, or does not. If other Warcraft III custom maps have articles, they are to be considered on <i>their</i> merits. -- <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScientizzle_e07a.html" title="User:Scientizzle">Scientizzle</a> 03:10, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Australian Idol contestant who did not make it to the finals. Page history suggests article created by whoever runs his website. Serserse 17:15, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> A look at the Beyond Idols section clearly shows he hasn't done anything outside the show to warrant an article (at least not yet). If the songs he did on the show aren't in the Australian Idol page, they can be <b>merged</b>, but that's about it. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:12, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, the fact is that the contestant WAS on Idol. That can't be debated. The article is as warranted as any of the other Idol related contestants' articles. It makes no false claims as to the achievements of the contestant.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Regardless of whatever Lindsay's results were or were not on Idol, he is still a working musician within the Melbourne and Australian music industry and has just as much right to his place in popular cultural history as anyone else. So therefore, the article should remain. <small>— Bacibella (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bacibella_c9d7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bacibella">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Lindsay West is an Australian artist who is trying to make it in the music industry. He appeared on Australian Idol in 2005 and got as far as the wildcard stage, one stage before being in the finals. This article is not rude or innapropriate in any way - those are the ones that need to be deleted. All it is is a short biography on an Australian musical artist, who may not have a number 1 song, but who has done well and worked hard for his achievements. Surely this can be acknowledged in an article in Wikipedia. <small>— 61.68.231.124 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_61.68.231.124_8056.html" title="Special:Contributions/61.68.231.124">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Given some of the topics and subjects that currently have a page on Wikipedia, I can see no reason why this page should not be allowed to exist. Australian Idol is a show that generates a lot of talk, and thousands of people every year apply for a shot at the big time. The fact that Lindsay got to the final 30 entrants in 2005, and the manner in which he got that far, is surely reason enough to keep this page active. Itswin 01:01, 26 September 2006 (UTC) <small>— Itswin (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Itswin_250d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Itswin">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - If this artist were to be deleted, then ALL noteable Australian Idol contestants not reaching first or second place status would need to be deleted. Wikipedia is a resource, therefore isn't it in everyone's best interest to keep it as abundant in information as possible? And I see this artist's listing is clearly up-to-date and accurate. There are other vocalists who reached the same stage of competition in Idol (eg: Ngaiire Joseph) who are making their mark gradually, and we don't see them being unfairly deleted from discussion pages. West is a singer-songwriter first and foremost, and active in the Australian music scene in more than one capacity, and that's credibility enough to remain here, in my books. Every artist has something unique to offer, there's room for all. Surely you people have more pressing matters than to be as petty as requesting fatuitous deletions from websites! Really!!!

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - So Lindsay West is not a hugely famous recording artist (yet!!). But what he is, is a very talented singer-songwriter making a go of it out there in one of the worlds hardest industries. I fail to see any reason why his entry should be deleted. We should be getting behind such people and supporting them in their efforts to make something of themselves and share their talents with the world. Surely Wikipedia can assist him with this by including his article.Supporting Australian Artists 00:15, 27 September 2006 (UTC) <small>— Supporting Australian Artists (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Supporting_Australian_Artists_40b4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Supporting Australian Artists">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> -Hey now! What’s the dealio?? Im sorry but isn’t the purpose of Wiki (being an encyclopedia and all) to be used as a valuable source of information for individuals to go to and find out more on things?? Hmm.. I think YES!! So then, doesn’t this indeed mean that it should contain as much information for people to search specific subjects? I MUST say… I think deleting West’s page defeats the purpose of this site entirely! Why have the site at all if you’re going to go and delete pages that don’t count to YOU? What about all the Lindsay supporters? As a supporter of both Lindsay’s AND Wikipedia’s I am most outraged that the even thought of deleting such a great musician’s page has even been put across in the first place! What a JOKE! This guy works just as hard, if not, harder than any other muso out there… therefore I do believe he deserves to have his page kept! I bet if we were talking about a million dollar international artist, this “deletion” thing would never of even come up at all! He should most definately NOT be deleted. What about all the people who come onto your site to view his page! He is an interesting and inspiring person to many people, I really do feel it isn’t fair for his page to go! All I’ve got to say is “GO Lindsay! Keep rockin! You got loads of support!!” Cuddly giggles 03:31, 27 September 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Cuddly giggles (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cuddly_giggles_d06d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cuddly giggles">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I appologize if this looks like a 'Clever plug' But I am seriously just a fan who felt his was notable. I have other articles, but I am not sure what you consider credible sources.MarySwope</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Like MarySwope I also am a concerned fan. Could we just merge his other two articles, Tonight with Bradman and Bradman the Movie into this one? That seems most fair to everyone involved. <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerican007_6677.html" title="User:American007">American007</a> 16:31, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Would that be allowed? If it would I would say you should do that, Bradman is a good entertainer, don't judge him too fast.12.214.20.35</li>
<li><b>ATTENTION</b> This is actually Bradley Laborman, I was notified about this situation a while back and I just want to tell my fans thank you. I want to point out however, the people who run Wikipedia have a better understanding of what is notable and what is not. I am grateful for everyone who has spoke up for me and my work, but if Wikipedia does not wish for my account to be on here, I would respect that. I have alot on my plate with the application to NBC and other networks talking to me. If I am not on now, please believe me someday I wil be on the pages of Wikipedia, until then, please respect the site and respect the show by being appropriate fans and not terrorist. I also see now that <a href="http://www.facebook.com" class="external text" title="http://www.facebook.com" rel="nofollow">FACEBOOK</a> is now open to anyone, I would invite fans who do not have facebook to join that and join our many fan groups there. I frequesnt those alot. Thank you. BradmanTWB</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - YouAreTV provides a service specifically to indepedent filmmakers and television show makers. Because it is niche does not mean that it should not be documented. Additionally, the site is documented in congressional hearings for Net Netrality, as well as appeared in an article in the Independent Film Magazine. Would the Wikipedia been written up in the Wikipedia before it was big even though it was a very profound idea and provided a service?</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This article has multiple connections to Network Neutrality and this entity has appeared in Congressional testimony before the US Senate Committee.</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> Tonight with Bradman is broadcast not only on cable access, but syndicated around the United States. A Search for "Tonight with Bradman" on Goolgle brings up well over 700+ sources of where TWB can be seen. It is also featured on iTunes, YouTube and other online boradcast services. There are several programs, Any Milinokis, etc. who wilm at a Public Access facility for syndication. The program has hosted Britney Spears, Playboy, Girls Gone Wild, Kenny Kramer, Wink Martindale, and many others. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by MarySwope (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarySwope_7972.html" title="User talk:MarySwope">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MarySwope_2a52.html" title="Special:Contributions/MarySwope">contribs</a>).</small> 14:18 September 21, 2006</li>

The <i>Tonight with Bradman</i> page has no assertions of notability besides claims that are unverified (such as having Britney Spears on the show- until I see video of it, I'll refuse to believe that Britney Spears went to Iowa to appear on a cable access / Internet show), and the claims of celebrity guests probably wouldn't be enough to qualify it for a WP article, anyway. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 23:27, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete all</b> The whole point of the Iowa newspaper article is that any ol' local cable access host can now go nationwide on the Internet.

<li><b>Concern</b> Is this more because of the fact that he is from Iowa? I was watching his program last night, and a person called with concerns about the Wikipedia editing. October 8, 2006 is going to be announced by Mayor Ross Wilburn as "Bradman Day". I am not sure if you realize this, but Bradley Laborman kept a town in complete communication when a tornado struck Iowa City this fall, and no network affiliates were there to cover it. Also if you want an answer to the question of notability, I guess, if you don't feel he's notable maybe Wikipedia isn't an accurate source for information.128.255.107.80</li>

<li><b>FAN COMMENT</b> Although 'Tonight with Bradman' may not be nationally or internationally known, it in fact IS a big deal in the Iowa City area. It is, as far as I know, the only public access show that people will make time in their schedules to watch each week. Also, I believe that one of the reasons it has not gotten more press coverage is for the simple fact that it's a public access show. It might be worth a one-time feature article, but the newspapers would feel that any more would be kind of a waste of space for a public access show, no matter how big it is (unless it was a state-wide phenomenon or something). Despite it's relative 'smallness', I personally believe the show should at least be allowed a spot on Wikipedia. Thank you. 63.252.23.150</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. An article about this show came up on AfD before, and was deleted.

Maybe the show has become more notable since then, I'm not sure. But I would like to get some clarfication on the first comment above. Does the show actually air on broadcast or cable television anywhere besides Iowa City? Or is it seen outside Iowa City only via the Internet? Also, to anyone planning to submit another identical FAN COMMENT, please give us reasons why this show is notable in your own words instead. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 02:57, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>FAN COMMENT</b> As a fan of Tonight with Bradman, I have put this message on this page in support of Bradley Laborman and Tonight with Bradman. By putting this here I feel both subjects are noteworthy of your know-all website. THANK YOU</li>
<li><b>INPUT</b> I'm currently studying in Germany and was introduced to TWB through a friend. Since then I have enjoyed watching what I can on their main website, along with downloading podcasts and recommending the show to other friends. So far it seems that the main argument for not allowing TWB a wikipedia page is that the show is viewed as being insignificant or trivial. May I please remind you that all things start out small and it's only when they're given the <i>chance</i> to grow that they evolve into something of the "repute" wikipedia seems to desire. For what it's worth, TWB appears to be quite popular (or at least well known) among Iowa City Residents <i>and</i> as it's being viewed by people in multiple countries (let alone continents) I fail to see why it does not deserve a wikipedia page. Surely if Page France and the definition of 'Bank Reserve' get a page, a great show with a fanbase like that of Tonight with Bradman should deserve one also.--132.180.252.57 11:11, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>ATTENTION</b> This is actually Bradley Laborman, I was notified about this situation a while back and I just want to tell my fans thank you. I want to point out however, the people who run Wikipedia have a better understanding of what is notable and what is not. I am grateful for everyone who has spoke up for me and my work, but if Wikipedia does not wish for my account to be on here, I would respect that. I have alot on my plate with the application to NBC and other networks talking to me. If I am not on now, please believe me someday I wil be on the pages of Wikipedia, until then, please respect the site and respect the show by being appropriate fans and not terrorist. I also see now that <a href="http://www.facebook.com" class="external text" title="http://www.facebook.com" rel="nofollow">FACEBOOK</a> is now open to anyone, I would invite fans who do not have facebook to join that and join our many fan groups there. I frequesnt those alot. Thank you. BradmanTWB</li>

<dd>The redundancy is not merely "some", but total. Do you really mean we should list all educators even though the term "educator" is ambiguous?

<li>Could you explain why in this case you feel this is a useful complement to a category? except for a few redlinks, I don't see this as exemplifying any of the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories%2C_lists%2C_and_series_boxes_edc0.html#Advantages_of_lists" title="Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes">advantages of lists</a>, and this seems to have the disadvantages mentioned.

<ul>
<li>Well, the storage of redlinks is one of the purposes of lists, yes, known as the <i>development</i> purpose. The list also provides for navigation and groups things together in a way that provides information. In essence, it serves a number of purposes, some of which can't be served by categories (i.e. development) and there's no real reason to delete beyond <i>I don't like lists</i> presented here at all. It's verifiable, encyclopaedic (and actually a half decent article). <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:00, 13 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Having read the material, I believe understand the theoretical advantages. However, in this specific case, I don't see them as applying in a substantial way. Do you have reasons why this specific list is practically more useful to a degree that outweighs the additional maintenance burden over categories? I have the impression this is more a general thing for you.

<ul>
<li>Yeah, I generally defend verifiable, encyclopaedic lists at AfD - I have no real specific attachment to this list. As for <i>the Burden of Maintenance" it's obvious to me that someone has taken that burden upon themselves, thus for the Wikipedia project as a whole, it's essentially zero maintenance. The list and category aren't redundant, so the existence of one doesn't argue for the deletion of the other, the category can exist in parallel, and do well what it does well, and poorly what it does poorly. To delete this when its in good shape just because</i> Well, one day it could become a problem <i>seems unconvincing. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 20:42, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</i></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom. Good effort, but the page seems to replicate what category pages already do better. Visually, this page is much less user-friendly than the category pages. You could sort the names in a more spatially understandable way, but you'd probably just end up with something like a whole bunch of category pages stuck together. The only advantage I can think of is that you could do a name find across all the educator names on the same page, but sincec wikipedia already has a search engine this is redundant. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 01:32, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hi. As you can see from my (unanswered) question to you above, I gave more than a cursory glance, and am not yet seeing the mysteries you allude to.

<li>I'm not really interested in pressuring participants - the point of responding to presented arguments is so that the closing admin will realise they're faulty - part of the concensus procedure. Transparently false arguments (such as lists being replacable by categories) need to be recognised as the fallacy they are and called on it.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Lists are useful when the set of items to be listed is strictly limited, and when there's some value in listing them even if they don't have an article. Neither of these appears to be the case here - as others have pointed out, there are a <i>lot</i> of preschool teachers in the US. Categories appear to be the superior solution here, especially as nearly all of the educators listed already have articles. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 03:59, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Lists with such broad subjects are almost entirely pointless, and have no place here. As <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">User:Zetawoof</a> said, lists should only be used with a reasonably limited set of items. "Educators" is a humongous category of people; there are tons of them around the world and throughout history that are not, and never will be, included in this list. There is no point in having such a list here, unless we plan on becoming a <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_pages.html" title="White pages">White pages</a> directory someday. Groupings like this are best left to the Category system. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 09:00, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Useful list, for all the reasons lists are ordinarily useful. Despite the claims that this is identical to the category, it's obviously not, based on the most cursory of inspections.

<li>Category pages are automatically maintained, while lists are manual; that seems like more work to me, especially if the categories already exist. Maybe I'm underestimating the number of anarchists or atheists out there, but those lists seem much smaller in scope than the domain carved out by a list of educators from <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socrates.html" title="Socrates">Socrates</a> to <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbie.html" title="Barbie">Barbie</a> (Teacher Barbie, I presume). I guess I'm still not seeing the potential for this article to be a gem. Thanks for the response, though; it was helpful to hear your perspective on lists. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 07:32, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The maintenance difference is overplayed; articles have to be added manually to both types, both have a page that needs to be kept free of vandalism, and both need to be watched for false entries. The last point is actually infinitely harder with a category since movement of articles in and out of a category cannot be watched, so far as I understand. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 13:35, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Interesting. I guess it seems like twice as much work to me then to maintain both. The watching of categories, though, is a great point, and one I hadn't considered.

<p>The result was <b>speedy keep</b>. The nominator doesn't want this deleted, and nor does anybody else.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. The Khaleej Times is the Gulf's most important English-language newspaper. In case anyone wonders whether many people in the Gulf read English papers, let me remind them that a majority of individuals in the most Gulf emirates are South Asian expatriates; the Khaleej Times is thus the largest paper in the Emirates.

<li>As a new user to Wikipedia, I agree that I may have gotten a little overenthusiastic. I would very much like, if possible, to create an article that answers Wikipedia requirements. I will definetely review the links created, and have remove the one you mentionned. However, I do note in the regulations thata company which has been written about in the press is eligible. We have had a number of articles published in the media, including the Gazette, Les affaires, Plant Enginnering, Gestion Logistique, Le Devoir. Admittedly these articles are all Canadian-based, but they are widely read on a local basis. These articles are referenced on our website. We are also a subsidiary of GFI Informatique, which is a public company. I am not sure of the regulations for this situation. Tanja Gehring.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by TGehring (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TGehring_ce36.html" title="Special:Contributions/TGehring">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>TGehring does make a valid point. I do not personally know if these newspapers are popular in Canada, because if they are, then it meets one criterion of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. --<a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="color:red"><b>Nish</b></span><span style="color:blue"><b>kid</b></span><span style="color:green"><b>64</b></span></a> 20:12, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Newspapers re-hashing a company's press releases ("we have had a number of articles published") does not count. What counts is journalists writing articles <i>of their own</i> about the company. If you can <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite</a> any articles of the latter kind, please do so. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:27, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd previously deleted this article as <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD A7</a> and urge careful consideration by Jeder1 as to if you expect that this company <i>really</i> deserves an article in an encyclopedia. (Admins, please note CSD A7 doesn't qualify an article for G4 speedy re-deletion. From my understanding, it has to go through a VfD at least once to be eligable in the future.) <b><i><font color="#FF00FF">~Kylu (<a href="../../../k/y/l/User%7EKylu_6ad3.html" title="User:Kylu">u</a>|<a href="../../../k/y/l/User_talk%7EKylu_3741.html" title="User talk:Kylu">t</a>)</font></i></b> 04:36, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Speedy deleted material technically doesn't qualify for any sort of G4 redeletion. However, it can always be reconsidered whether it will qualify under <i>same</i> speedy deletion criterion. (It's an entirely different matter, however, whether the article qualified for A7 in the first place. A7 doesn't clearly spell out that corporations qualify, in my opinion, thus, nonnotable corporations don't qualify for A7. Which is a shame.) --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 14:51, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I feel that this company does deserve an entry in Wikipedia--they have been around for ten years, have many customers, and have been referenced in a number of publications and magazine articles. I don't know what CSD A7 means, or G4, or what a VfD is--I'm just trying to write an entry that's germane and acceptable; this is my first attempt at a Wikipedia entry, and I picked a company that I feel is a leader in its space.

<li>AfD debates don't create binding precedents and deletion rules, only "similar cases" that can sometimes be referred to. The people were allowed to make the article, just as anyone was allowed to make <i>this</i> article. All deletion debates are unlinked, and notability of each article is assessed independently of each other.

Agree - if he's an "important ornithological scientist" then the article should be able to be <i>expanded</i> to include his accomplishments. (Like, there are tons of archaelogists, but until they discover something of note or publish something notable, they don't deserve an article). As it stands at the moment, the only thing notable is that he spotted the bird mentioned above - perhaps a one-liner in the article for the bird mentioning Mr. Webb? I tend to to think that the bird might be notable for venturing out of it's normal area, not the guy who spotted it - and the governing body itself doesn't seem to have verified the claim, anyway. Google doesn't seem to be too fruitful in offering up anything of note, so I guess it's up to Wikibirders to explain why this guy deserves an article. <a href="../../../c/p/m/User%7ECPMcE_3017.html" title="User:CPMcE"><i>Camillus</i></a> <a href="../../../c/p/m/User_talk%7ECPMcE_6ecc.html" title="User talk:CPMcE">(talk)</a> 19:04, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>This article appears to be facing deletion. This is most unfortunate. Madness Combat is an icon, a hero, a pioneer of flash animation. It has forever changed internet culture. It is disappointing that a reliable third party source hasn't come out and said this, but it's true. I understand that Wikipedia's rules are Wikipedia's rules, and that a mere user's plea, an anonymous user at that, cannot prove notability. This is very disappointing, but I accept the fate of this article. It appears to be evident that the enormous popularity of the series and superb effort presented in this article shows notability, but it appears that WP:WEB is far too strict. Most disappointing, but I understand that the rules are the rules and exceptions can't be made, so I need to be mature and step back. I need to display the white flag, to lay down my sword and admit defeat. Mabye in the future a third party source will display itself and this article can be resurrected. But for now, I step back and let what happens happen. 85.214.50.115 02:37, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Madness has been an insanely popular webtoon for the past couple of years, often attaining the number one slot as Newground's most popular flash for its newer episodes. It has also spawned a significant number of copycat flashes and there is a wide fan base awaiting new additions to the series. For these reasons, and for the fact that several other Newgrounds icons (such as <a href="../../../p/i/c/Pico_%28Newgrounds%29_49af.html" title="Pico (Newgrounds)">Pico</a>, <a href="../../../x/i/a/Xiao_Xiao_21c5.html" title="Xiao Xiao">Xiao Xiao</a>, and <a href="../../../x/o/m/Xombie.html" title="Xombie">Xombie</a>) all have their own articles, Madness should stay. It's more than notable enough to warrant a place on Wikipedia. In fact, attempts to delete this article seem completely baseless and without reason. To be honest, the only problem I have with it is the POV (which definitely comes off as fanboyish), but even that shouldn't count as an excuse to delete the whole thing. <a href="../../../r/p/h/User%7ERPH_0dcc.html" title="User:RPH">RPH</a> 13:43, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Even if this were referenced, which it isn't, would an encyclopedia be the place for a collection of what is essentially fan trivia?

<dd><b>Keep</b> the nice thing about this article is that there <i>are</i> a bunch of trivial events in one article. There are votes to add events to the list. There's a bunch of information in this that link to different pages that are significant to the NFL, specific pages like "The Drive" which isn't even linked in the <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver_Broncos_cd7b.html" title="Denver Broncos">Denver Broncos</a> page.

<li><b>Keep</b>, granted it can be POV but there is a general concensus that games that are given "nicknames" are considered lore, while a fan of a team that scored 20 points and came back to win would think that it deserved to be here.

<p><b>Closer's notes</b><br />
This was a complicated AfD. On a purely numerical basis (after disregarding or giving little weight to comments as set out below), the outcome was no consensus. However, given that AfD is a debate and not a vote (a proposition supported by several editors in this debate), and given the substantial participation in this debate, and given that this nomination was the result of a group of editors agreeing to submit the issue to the community to seek direction, the debate was not closed on a purely numerical basis.</p>
<p>Firstly, I should note that in determining the final consensus:</p>
<ul>
<li>My comments were disregarded;</li>
<li>The comments of the very new user Fabianist (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fabianist_e421.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fabianist">contribs</a>) were given little weight; and</li>
<li>The comments of unregistered users were given little weight.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several arguments were raised by those in favour of deletion and by those in favour of keeping the article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Notability or importance</a> was raised by most editors. A majority of these editors were of the opinion that the subject is not sufficiently notable or important, and of the remainder, several acknowledged that the subject was at the lower end of the scale of inclusion, or argued in favour of keeping the article based on precedent that AfDs have kept articles on non-notable politicians in the past. Some editors also mentioned <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, and the higher bar or notability or importance that it sets. Debate on this point was given the most weight.</li>
<li>A minority of editors discussed whether questions of decency or propriety should be considered as a factor in an AfD. Debate on this point was divided, and as acknowledged by some editors, ought to be the subject of broader discussion anyway. Debate on this point was given less weight.</li>
<li>Several editors, both those in favour of deletion and those in favour of keeping the article, discussed historical difficulties (legal and otherwise) with this article. Much of this debate was ill-informed, through no fault of the editors concerned, and was given little weight.</li>
<li>Several editors suggested that the article should be kept because of the nature of the nomination (that it was procured by "conveniently timed emotional manipulation", or that it was in bad faith), and several other editors agreed with or referenced these arguments. Given that the nomination was the result of a group of editors agreeing to submit the issue to the community to seek direction, and clearly not in bad faith, debate on these points was given little weight.</li>
</ul>
<p>Distributing weight accordingly, the result of the debate was a consensus in favour of deletion.</p>
</div>
<p>After a period of intense brouhaha including legal threats, forum shopping, <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a>, indefinite blockings and all the other accoutrements of low drama Wikipedia style, we finally have cautious agreement from the Foundation to write a neutral biography on this minor figure in British right-wing politics.</p>
<p>I emphasis that the subject has never been an MP, or even a candidate, not even stood for a local council. He is a party activist of very questionable importance outside of a small circle, and I say this not to run him down but out of sheer bewliderment for the amount of trouble this article has caused.</p>
<p>The latest act in this little play, though, is a message to <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">User:Edchilvers</a> stating that the subject is suffering from a very serious illness. Given that the neutral statement of certain facts (check the talk page archive) apparently causes the subject great distress, and taking the information and request at face value, it would seem to be decently respectful to delete the article. Frankly I don't think this person's notability is worth the effort expended and I am all for just deleting it anyway, but impassioned defence earlier in its life makes this a controversial move.</p>
<p>So: the matter of principle having been settled (yes we should paint the picture warts and all), should the matter of ordinary human decency now come into play here? My immediate reaction is that it should, and Ed Chilvers (who God knows has no reason to love Lauder-Frost) also seems persuaded. Others disagree, unsurprisingly given past deceit from friends of the subject, but Ed is very persuasive in respect of the credibility of the communicaiton he has received, so between <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">User:Edchilvers</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">User:William Pietri</a> and myself we have decided to bring this to the community. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 22:46, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The amount of effort necessary to spend maintaining a decent article on this extremely run-of-the-mill political figure is simply a waste of time. The highest claim to notability is <i>"referred to... by The Independent as a leading right-wing political extremist"</i>. Being a <i>"leading right-wing political extremist"</i> is the equivalent of being the highest beetle on the dung heap. It may be a significant achievement within your circle, but in the overall scope of things it's an extremely limited claim to notability. The <i>actual</i> reason why this article has managed to survive AfDs is the scandal element. Wikipedia is not a local gossip rag. We do not write about scandals on the basis that someone underwent an "interesting" scandal - we maintain articles on significant, notable figures, and if said notable figures underwent verifiable scandals, we report them. GLF is not notable, by any definition other than "omg, there was a flamewar on Wikipedia so this must be a significant scandal". No it isn't. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_man_on_the_Clapham_omnibus_9c99.html" title="The man on the Clapham omnibus">The man on the Clapham omnibus</a> <a href="../../../h/o/l/WP%7EHOLE_7127.html" title="WP:HOLE">would not know this man from a hole in the ground</a>. Remember when Jimbo told us to go for quality over quantity? That means taking the axe to articles that aren't worth the time and effort. I suggest that those who have spent so much effort on this article turn their attentions to <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Aitken_6239.html" title="Jonathan Aitken">Jonathan Aitken</a>, an <i>infinitely</i> more significant scandal-stricken personality, whose article is currently about the same size and all but unsourced to boot. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 00:49, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As a central figure in the histories of several notable and influential conservative groups - which, based on the information I've now read, helped shape the direction of the modern Conservative party, often by inadvertently pushing the party away from their extremism- Gregory Lauder-Frost has attained sufficient notability as well as notoriety to warrant an article on Wikipedia. The personal life section is a little creepy-stalkerish, but on the whole it gives a good perspective on his life and the impact he had on British politics. To an extent, I'm also arguing utility - the Gregory Lauder-Frost article spurred me into reading up about the history of the Conservatives/Tories. A hell of a lot of work has gone into getting the page into good condition, and it's one of the articles (along with the Daniel Brandt article) that I can point to proudly and say "This is the project I spend my rare free time on. This project covers important figures, warts and all, with good sourcing and without allowing a whitewash of uncomfortable truths, and helps connect them to other events, places, and people of note." I'm damned proud of the people who put blood, sweat, and tears into this article, defending it against POV-pushers, anonymous vandals, and the addition of unsourced information. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 02:25, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> When did WP ever bend to the requests of the article's subjects? This isn't an absolute case like wtih Justin Berry or Jack Thompson when the foundation had to get involved.

The French soccer player's AFD dissolved into an orgy of "Keep" votes because the subject had requested deletion. Daniel brandt, well, he's the joke now, everybody votes keep.

<ul>
<li>Note that this nomination is not at the request of anyone. The main arguments are that Lauder-Frost is not sufficiently notable enough to warrant a biography in Wikipedia, and that disputes about the article's content have caused substantial problems in the past; the fact that the subject is ill is merely icing on the cake, it's an extra reason to delete the article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 04:51, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> On balance, I think this figure is too minor.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>; not per concerns of illness neither per legal threats—but Sam Blanning said it well. I skimmed over the talk page archive and, like Sam, concluded that it's not worth the effort keeping an article about a marginally notable person against such <i>brouhaha</i>.

Pietri have more useful things to do than fighting it; (I mean this as endorsement of their contributions, not as a criticism of their attitude and contributions to this article). <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a> 12:44, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I tend to think he's not notable and would support deletion, but only if someone makes a concerted effort to remove the dozens of references to Lauder-Frost's various letters to the editor, club positions, and dinners, all of which appear to have been salted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&amp;search=Lauder-Frost&amp;fulltext=Search&amp;offset=20&amp;limit=20" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&amp;search=Lauder-Frost&amp;fulltext=Search&amp;offset=20&amp;limit=20" rel="nofollow">on numerous pages across Wikipedia</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>: This article will always be subject to attack from The Left, just as it has been up until now. Screams of "neutrality" and "balance" are simply feeble excuses used to demonise what was once a very full biography of the Political Secretary of Britain's most well-known, ever, Tory pressure-group, simply because the attackers were opposed to their philosophies. I have no doubt that once this article is ditched the same people will simply move on somewhere else for the same purposes. If anything this whole charade has exposed Wikipedia not as a proper encylcopaedia, or one which respected the sensitivites of living people, but as a sneering smearing vehicle for The Left.213.122.13.20 16:51, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm going to have to vote <b>keep</b>. I'm not unsympathetic to the legitimate medical concerns of a Wikipedia subject, but (i) I've seen no evidence that this isn't just another charade on the part of GLF and his associates, and (ii) I'm concerned about setting a bad precedent for any similar controversies in the future. GLF was once a leading figure in the Conservative Monday Club and the Western Goals Institute, both of which were notable (if dubious) political pressure groups within Britain: he is, IMO, a notable public figure. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 19:45, 22 September 2006 (UTC).</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - achieving nothing worthwhile is not a sign of non-notability; &lt;insert failed politician you don't like here&gt; would have been deleted long since if that were true. Lauder-Frost is not important, but importance is not what we want. Lauder-Frost is not successful, that too we don't need. The article is conformant with <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> standards, includes material far beyond mere trivia, and for me demonstrates the undoubted notability of the subject in that third-party reliable sources have seen fit to spill ink on his doings for a variety of reasons. It may well be true that none of the individual references is non-trivial, but there are enough of them to form a coherent and relatively well-referenced biographical article. I wouldn't have known the man from a hole in the ground in May.

<li>Just curious, but isn't that argument sort of meta? It amounts to "he's notable for me because this article caused a big fuss in Wikipedia".

<li>I'd say it was more on the lines of UncleG's "notability is not subjective" ideas. The article doesn't offend against any core requirements - it is written from a neutral point of view, cites reliable sources and is verifiable. Generally those articles deleted for missing the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines also fail to comply with one or more of verifiability, &amp;c. This one may miss the guideline, but does comply with our core values. Because Mr Lauder-Frost can be the subject of a neutral, verifiable and non-trivial biog, he is notable in his way. Perhaps rather circular, but there you are. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 06:38, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> More trouble than it is worth. If the proper article cannot be displayed for legal reasons it should be deleted. GLF supporters think any edits and facts are the work of the 'Left', and anyone who edits it in a way GLF supporters don't like would immediately labelled 'Leftist' and threatened with legal action. GLF is not even a leading figure of the right, so any information in the article relating to past right wing politics is anachronistic anyway, that kind of politics died with Enoch Powell. Why would the Conservative party need a protest opposition group anyway? Conservatives are considered to the right of the mainstream. What it boils down to, is a man that rejects rightist politics in favour of extreme right wing politics. If anything GLF should be sub-headed under categories for that type of Wikipedia entry. 82.1.234.67 21:20, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. He is not particularly famous, granted, but he has been a reasonably politically significant figure and I am ill at ease with the idea of deleting articles because we don't agree with their politics (I don't agree with GLF's politics myself, for the record). I also think Captainktainer's point about the Monday Club and its ilk having a perverse influence on the Tory party - setting themselves up as The Way And The Truth And The Light and inadvertently inspiring the leadership of the party to react further against them, as much in terms of the mass vs. the elite in culture as in terms of conventional politics, is a good one. The article is (mostly) sourced, is reasonably balanced (and less overtly detailed than it was), and gives a good account of the man's life and personal history. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobinCarmody_3768.html" title="User:RobinCarmody">RobinCarmody</a> 02:58, 23 September 2006 (BST)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> One relevant standard within <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> appears to be "Major local political figures who receive (or received) significant press coverage". Significant press coverage is a definite term of judgement. Before the 1992 legal incident he had been mentioned in 10 articles in 28 months, or about one every third month. Most of those 10, from the description provided on the archived talk pages, are passing mentions or use of short quotes. In my judgment, this does not constitute significant press coverage. He doesn't appear to have been elected as a Member of Parliament, so the other inherently political criteria is not met. "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events" does not appear to be met; I read the evidence a decade+ later and across the pond as the event having gotten a bit wider than average coverage because a figure of some public recognition was involved. The last relevant criteria is "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person. (Multiple similar stories describing a single day's news event only count as one coverage.)" I don't see enough here to say that he was the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works. As none of the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria are met, deletion is the right answer. Has he is being deleted as non-notable by Wikipedia standards, this is evidence that we don't need to say much about him in other articles. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 03:40, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think that debates over the troubles and legal issues here should be left aside and notability considered on its merits. There are three possible aspects under which the subject might be notable: 1) his political activity; 2) his genealogical activity; 3) his private life. I have investigated his contribution to genealogical scholarship previously and reported on the article talk page that I don't think it makes him notable in itself. He was mentioned as one in a list of about 20 contributors who had helped the compilation of the most recent edition of <i>Burke's Peerage</i>. Secondly, his private life does not appear to be so publicised and unusual as to make him notable; the publicity it attracted was largely due to his political activities. Finally, we come to his political activity, which has previously convinced me to vote to keep. Looking again, I can see he was never an actual leader of the organisations he was involved in, merely a leader of committees and a secretary. I don't think this makes it as high as the bar of notability – though it comes close – and therefore my vote is a <b>weak delete</b>. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 08:40, 23 September 2006 (UTC).</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>: those in favour of keeping this article only wish it to be kept in their approved format - by inclusion of matters already dealt with, and long ago, and so illegal as far as I can make out. If it were proposed to insert instead "legal difficulties" I suspect the small group of his detractors behind all the commotion attached to this article would want it removed. I have spent a good deal of time looking around at those involved on the GLF support side of things, and I can see that a small group of anti right-wing 'administrators' have attacked any number of interesting articles and succeeded in having many of them deleted. In the case of one that I found, John Pinniger, his article was up for deletion, deemd unimportant. (Probably another non-entity). Yet it was suddenly found by some resarcher that this fellow had turned on the Monday Club as 'racist', got a few mentions for it in the media, and so became some sort of a hero. His article was left up. This is not a good sign of objectivity and it is worth commenting upon it here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the prime mover in the initial onslaughts, someone called Homeontherange, who himself appears to have fallen foul of Wikipedia, is said to have left Wikipedia, he has been replaced by people such as Ed Chilvers, who I see at the beginning of June attacked the entire article and reduced it to one single paragraph. It could hardly be argued that this represented fair and balanced editing.</p>
<p>It is quite pointless pointing out whether Lauder-Frost was important, semi-important, or a non-entity. He will always fall into a category depending on the opinions of others. The great failing, as I see it, in the whole controvosy, is the provocative actions and smart-alick sneering by some editors, some far worse than others, and some by 'administrators' (who are <i>never</i> admonished, against the subject and any support he or the article have had. When the provocations have been successful and others have responded, the Wikipedia rule book has been meticulously used to make everyone other than the detractors of the article seem in the wrong. People with no legal knowledge whatsoever have postulated at length on issues about which they have no knowledge. Those who appear to have had some knowledge have been consigned to the scrap-heap by them for daring to oppose the self-righteous, again using the Wikipedia rule-book, which it would appear to me, the novice, at least, they themselves and countless others appear to break with great regularity. I cannot see this ever being resolved because the fairness and neutrality so often spoken of does not really exist. If it does, it is one-sided, and tunnel-vision reigns supreme on all sides.</p>
<p>We are told, at the top of the page, that Lauder-Frost is ill. But I cannot see any posting to that effect on Wikipedia. Have I missed it? Whatever, if I had a young family I would be very concerned about their protection from matters past and certainly would not want them returning home from school saying that other children's parents had told their children not to have anything to do with the LFs because of what they had found on the internet by just typing the name into Google. I am in no doubt The Left, using whatever guise the can, would like to keep the 1992 incident up in lights forever. But it is wrong and it shows Wikipedia up in a very bad light indeed. So just get rid of the whole thing. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChelsea_Tory_f648.html" title="User:Chelsea Tory">Chelsea Tory</a> 15:13, 23 September 2006 (UTC).</p>

<dd>The matter of GLF's illness was a personal communication to an editor, later reported on the Administrator's Noticeboard. We're all taking it with a grain of salt. As for being concerned about the Lauder-Frost's children, all of the information in the article comes from news stories and publicly available information; the responsibility for notoriety lies with the person who committed the notorious acts, not those who report on them. I'm sure that the incidents are very uncomfortable for the Lauder-Frost family, but the fact of the matter is that they <i>happened</i>, and they have a direct bearing on the subject of the article, who was himself a vital part of the eventual reshaping of the Tory/Conservative party. For that matter, please do not make vague and unsubstantiated claims of "rule-breaking" without providing evidence. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 15:24, 23 September 2006 (UTC).</dd>

If I may comment on your remarks: providing you are prepared to sit down and trawl through media archives you will probably find something on a great many people. That is not the issue here. You know very well that posting things on Wikipedia means that people don;t have to search for anything. All they have to do is to type a name into a search engine and up will come the article.

<dd>Hi, Chelsea Tory. Although I've been involved in this for months, you'll note I haven't expressed an opinion yet on this AfD. It's a complex issue, with many perspectives, and I'm still thinking my way through them. I'm thus disappointed that you have again reduced this to an unmixed stream of negatives ending with accusations about "The Left". I think it harms the discussion in two ways. First, it ignores important facts, making it hard to treat the rest of your opinions with the respect they deserve. Ed Chilvers, who you name as an opponent and have frequently accused of malice, has asked for deletion of this article on grounds of compassion for Lauder-Frost. Guy, presumably one of the out-of-control admins you refer to, has seconded it. If they are really part of a sinister political conspiracy, they aren't doing a very good job of it. Second, by being continuously accusatory and partisan, you make it much harder for everybody involved to demonstrate the clear-headed fairness that you claim to seek. I'm sure you're saying these things in good faith, but natural human biases can yield <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/24/opinion/24gilbert.html?ex=1159156800&amp;en=60663cf25b4a3d0f&amp;ei=5070&amp;pagewanted=all" class="external text" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/24/opinion/24gilbert.html?ex=1159156800&amp;en=60663cf25b4a3d0f&amp;ei=5070&amp;pagewanted=all" rel="nofollow">increasingly polar situations</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I really don't know what else I can say William. I feel that if you spent the time I have, purposely, reading everything regarding this article (includes what has been said on other pages) you would reach the same "negative" conclusions I have reached, especially given the political comments about GLF (which I presume applies also to the tens of thousands of Monday Club members who have passed through that group over three or more decades), and especially about the two editors whom you mention. They have relentlessly campaigned for the inclusion of the illegal matter, and have been quite denigrating in their attitudes to others who, also, would like to have their say. I agree with you that there is a degree of polarisation on this issue. Articles on political personages should, in my opinion, be avoided by those who are seriously opposed to them. For instance, articles on Labour Party MPs, members, activists, Tribune folk, etc., I have never visited, or edited, because it would end up a re-write or an edit war, as I am so opposed to them and their philosophies. North America, where Wikipedia is obviously based, seems to have a far more vicious unforgiving and, might I say, non-Christian attitude to anyone who may have fallen foul of the law, especially those whom they disapprove of. For us in Britain, who so often hear about US fundamentalists and "bible-belts" this seems a bit amazing. It may be that Wikipedia requires a Political Editor-in-Chief who is as independent as possible, to be a sort of policeman or final arbiter. I understand the concept of Wikipedia being a community, but that might well become a commune, depending upon who makes up the jury. This entire business has been an eye-opener to me. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChelsea_Tory_f648.html" title="User:Chelsea Tory">Chelsea Tory</a> 19:22, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>CT, I don't think I'm alone in finding your comments here very disappointing. As regards the issue of the supposed illegality of including certain verifiable facts, that argument has been fought long and hard, and the answer from the Foundation is that they know of no reason to suppose that the basis for supposed illegality would apply to a neutral biography, or to a site hosted in Florida. Beating that particular dead horse is not going to get you very far. As to allegations of bad faith, I find them unpersuasive. William Pietri, for example, has no evident stake in this and has a history of showing exceptional good faith even towards the most egregious POV pushers. Perhaps you would like to try stating the case a little more neutrally? <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 09:39, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to the Talk pages two top firms of UK solicitors both decided the law was being broken. Your suggestion is that they have no idea of the law. Chelsea Tory has clearly set out a very plausible case which you don't wish to grasp because you are a very determined detractor. The only fair thing you've ever done in your jaundiced comments on this case is to nominate the page for deletion. 213.122.129.134 08:31, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, a solicitors letter threatening legal action is not a decision that the law is being broken, it is a <i>suggestion</i> that there might be a case to answer, an opportunity for the recipients to either retract and settle or outline (poosibly through their own lawyers) their reasons why they do not believe themselves to be in breach. It is not the same as breaking into a house and nicking the video. If nessesary a judge will decide whether or not there is a case to answer under UK civil law.--<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> 10:25, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, Guy, but unfortunately these kinds of comments are only what you would expect in the circumstances. The people posting them are political extremists, so they see the world in extreme ways: anyone who doesn't agree with them is part of "The Left" or is "non-Christian". If they'd been around 70 years ago they would have been complaining about Bolshevik and Jewish influences.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> The thing to remember is that this article was almost certainly written by a friend of Lauder Frost with the aim of glorifying him and his achievements. At about the same time as it was created a whole batch of overly long articles on other far right figures involved in an organisation called the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Democratic_Alliance_9b06.html" title="Conservative Democratic Alliance">Conservative Democratic Alliance</a> were also started and were remarkably similar in style and content (in some cases passages were word for word the same with only the names changed). All were extremely sympathetic to their subjects and made it appear as though their lives were an unbroken stream of success). GLF, needless to say is a leading member of the CDA. When the Lauder Frost article was nominated for deletion for the second time the puff pieces on his CDA friends also went up for the chop. GLF's was the only one to survive, albeit in a much reduced form. It seems to me that the purpose all along was to big up GLF and his friends and draw attention to the CDA. Personally I think that this has gone on far enough. Call it compassion, call it non-notability, call it bowing to pressure from trolls -whatever you like. With the exception of William I don't think anybody involved in this issue comes out looking very good. Lets draw a line in the sand and move on.--<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> 17:30, 23 September 2006 (UTC).</li>

<dd>Really, I cannot see the evidence to support these claims. If you read the Encyclopaedia Britannica you find biographical articles and a great many political activists who both you and I have never ever heard of. But they all played a role in the democratic process. It can be quite annoying to know about the existance of a pressure-group and yet know nothing about the officers of it. I think we would all like to know something about them, wouldn't we? One of the problems with Wikipedia, it seems to me, is their almost total reliance upon press notices to decide whether or not an individual is important. Such a yardstick to me is a nonsence and should be used with great care. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChelsea_Tory_f648.html" title="User:Chelsea Tory">Chelsea Tory</a> 19:48, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I've been thinking quite a lot about this because I have crossed swords with GLF plenty of times off wikipedia and I wondered whether I should comment. I think that he does meet the standards for notability because he was chairman of the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monday_Club_234a.html" title="Monday Club">Monday Club</a> when it was an important, if declining, element within the Conservative Party. He also generated rather a large amount of press coverage in the <b>national</b> press. So he meets the notability criteria in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and if his views were less controversial I don't think we would be having this argument. If there were not the legal threats or his ill health I would say that this case were open and shut, as the fact that this is the fourth AfD demonstrates. On the other hand there are legal threats and ill health - and so I am sympathetic to the idea that this article is more trouble than it's worth. That's why it's a weak keep. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 17:22, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. On reflection, nothing in the article as written establishes notability. If there are reliable sources that establish that GLF was an important figure in the British political scene at some point, however, the article should probably stay. With regard to the personal appeal, I'm sympathetic, but I would prefer that he make the appeal to the foundation, rather than letting us muddle through the issue. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 13:17, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Please forgive me going on at length here, but I couldn't find a shorter way to do the question justice. For readability, I've broken this down by argument:
<ul>
<li>From a strictly personal perspective, I'd rather see this article deleted; it has been a time sink and a drama generator for months now. But I don't think difficulty or contention are good grounds for deletion; it means Wikipedia can be harrassed into altering content.</li>
<li>Some suggest deletion because of his opinions, but I think that's antithetical to an encyclopedia's spirit and purpose.</li>
<li>On the other side, some suggest deletion because of systemic bias against people with opinions like his. I can see the point, but I think the appropriate solution is to <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">counter systemic bias</a> consciously. An encyclopedia that can only tackle bland topics isn't of much use.</li>
<li>The legal questions are interesting, but I think they are red herrings. Were this encyclopedia hosted in Britain and run by a British organization, British law and norms would matter. That's not the case, and so British freedom-of-press restrictions matter no more than Chinese or Kazakh ones.</li>
<li>Notability is a finer matter and reasonable people could disagree, but having read through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gregory_Lauder-Frost/Archive#Relevant_newspaper_articles" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gregory_Lauder-Frost/Archive#Relevant_newspaper_articles" rel="nofollow">much of his press coverage</a> I think he qualifies, albeit at the lowest rung.</li>
<li>Compassion is the next argument, and it comes in two forms. First is the sort of compassion that motivates the <a href="../../../r/e/h/Rehabilitation_of_Offenders_Act_1974_bf68.html" title="Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974">British law mentioned</a>: that once you've paid your legal debt and kept your nose clean, the conviction should be forgotten. I feel for that, but I don't believe that it's the business of an encyclopedia to manipulate its readers. I think people who meet Lauder-Frost should treat his conviction as a long-forgotten issue, but I trust them to make that decision on their own based on our neutral presentation of the facts and their recognition that one's public record is a small, small fraction of what a person is.</li>
<li>The other argument from compassion is that the article subject is ill and that the article causes him distress. This one moves me personally, and it's a clear illustration of why <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> sets a much higher bar. But when I think of how we could make this into a broader policy of deletion or suppression of uncomfortable truths because of the discomfort they cause, I fail to imagine anything workable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And so, although I would like Lauder-Frost to be at peace and would like to have a little more peace myself, I end up at a <b>weak keep</b>. However, if others do envision a plausible compassionate deletion policy I encourage them to write it up and push for adoption. On AfD number 5, that would enough to change my recommendation. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 16:37, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. He's really a very minor figure on the impotent far-right fringes of UK politics, and ironically the article wouldn't have been here at all but for the efforts of his "friends", who are now baying for it to be removed since they find they can't control the content, while still holding that he's notable. He's not. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 17:24, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> He might be a minor figure on far right politics in the UK, but bearing in mind this is the 4th nom, its survived 3, I would suggest this is possibly a bad faith nomination. Its been voted on and either kept or no consensus 3 times previous, i would wait a while and see what happens. <a href="../../../t/m/a/User%7ETmalmjursson_5155.html" title="User:Tmalmjursson">Thor Malmjursson</a> 13:08, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm puzzled by that. After having read the text at the top, why would you think this might be a bad-faith nomination? And how would you expect waiting a while to help the specific issues people have raised?

<ul>
<li>I consider anything which has been nominated and <b>SURVIVED</b> 3 times, only to be nominated for removal again, a bad faith nomination. Forget the waiting on it, its been marked 3 times, people have not been able to reach consensus or get a clear keep vote, I say leave it alone. <a href="../../../t/m/a/User%7ETmalmjursson_5155.html" title="User:Tmalmjursson">Thor Malmjursson</a> 18:56, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You did read at the top where this nomination was inspired by newly received information, yes? It seems that Guy and Ed Chilvers, who both advocated keeping the article in the past, are acting in entirely good faith in now calling for its deletion. I could understand you disputing their reasoning (which I don't think you've done quite yet), but I think impugning their motives is inappropriate and isn't supported by the facts here or in the article's extensive history. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 19:54, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It is common use in politics in India .There are 38000 google hits for the term.<a href="http://www.google.co.nz/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Congress+high+command%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=." class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.nz/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Congress+high+command%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=." rel="nofollow">[33]</a> So article should have place on wikipedia looking at interest . The article does inform what the term indicates. If the Congress high command and congress working committes are the same sure media would not specified Congress high command for some situations and Congress working committee for others.There are different terms . Hornplease says it is actually incorrect without providing reasons why it is incorrect .The reference is provided and no reference is no ground for deletion.Keep and allow time to develop .<a href="../../../s/h/y/User%7EShyamsunder_e921.html" title="User:Shyamsunder">Shyamsunder</a> 13:40, 22 September 2006 (UTC).</li>

<dd>Oh, please. The above comment is by the article's creator. I am not sure that his claim that the "media would have specified" needs an actual response. However, just in case: the media occasionally uses phrases like "the White House" and "the Hill" to refer to individuals or centres of power. The "Congress high command" is one such phrase which, as I said, is in fairly common use in India. I think the phrase itself cannot have an article much more than a dicdef, and could be speedied under the criterion that an article with content that adds no more information than the title meets <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>. However, it also has a single line of information about the historical period when this title came into force, which is completely unreferenced and quite clearly <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. "Allow time to develop"? Into what? What could possibly be added to an article about a term? Might as well have an article entitled Bombay Remote Control. What would be in that article that would not be in a <a href="../../../b/a/l/Bal_Thackeray_698c.html" title="Bal Thackeray">Bal Thackeray</a> article? <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 02:05, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Reply</b> - are you trying to discredit his vote? The articles creator may know more on this phenomenon, which is a more useful term than "working committee"<a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <font color="blue"><sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub></font> 02:43, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That is an incredible response. The Congress Working Committee is a specific organisation, the highest decision-making body of the Congress Party. A more 'useful term'? And I am not trying to discredit his 'vote', I am pointing out that his statements are not helpful or in line with WP policy. I should also add that the only factual assertion in the article claims that the term "began to be used" when Indira Gandhi "became Prime Minister" in 1971. This is factually untrue. She became PM in 1966. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 05:15, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep, or merge</b> Like a lot of political parties, there are formal structures and committees, and a "real" core leadership that's smaller. But in most cases the core is an individual leader, like Indira Gandhi, or Tony Blair, so we don't need another separate Wikipedia article about the leadership group. If the Congress high command is <i>collective</i> (and different from the formal committees) then develop this as a separate article, otherwise merge. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMereda_55a9.html" title="User:Mereda">Mereda</a> 06:51, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There's no content to merge. "High command" is a phrase usually used in the states as a reference to the central committee in Delhi, or euphemistically to the supreme leader if there is one. So any content here will be speculative at best, OR at worst. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 07:48, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
