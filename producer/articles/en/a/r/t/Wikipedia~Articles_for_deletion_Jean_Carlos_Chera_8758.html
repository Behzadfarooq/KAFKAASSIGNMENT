<dd>In case anybody requires an explanation how I arrived at this decision, as it is a bit borderline: There seems to be only one reliable source, an article repeated in USA Today and other media. What tipped the balance is firstly the weak reasons in some of the "keep" comments (specifically, those of necronudist, Portillo, and I don't understand Minfo); and secondly, I think we should be extremely cautious in having articles about living children. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 12:45, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, you can't compare the article on a player who has played nearly 70 matches in the top professional league of a country with a ten year old child who plays for a youth team - one clearly meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, the other clearly doesn't.... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 08:12, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe we simply need time to fix the article because clearly the mainstream sources can be located, also i found a blog which might help with the whole generation-y web 2.0 crap that youtube is about. <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portillo.html" title="Portillo">portillo</a></p>

Many of the users are very bias against the idea of a 7yr old having its own article or the fact that his only a child prodigy, but indeed we have a child prodigy article. Im definately getting a sense of outright bias and a feeling that many of the voters here are americans. <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portillo.html" title="Portillo">portillo</a></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think most of the delete (and some of the keep) votes are completely missing the point. Of course this kid isn't a notable footballer. He is however notable as an internet/media phenomenon. Wikipedia has plenty of articles for such people, as an example go look at <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahir_%C3%87a%C4%9Fr%C4%B1_d074.html" title="Mahir Çağrı">Mahir Çağrı</a>. Then at the bottom of his page have a look at the categories he's placed in. When someone comes to Wikipedia and searches for "that kid i saw clips of on TV" or "that kid my mate sent me videos of" and who's name give 35,000 google hits... He should be here! <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlii_h_fb96.html" title="User:Alii h">aLii</a> 15:20, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I wonder if there is a misunderstanding here? If you are a child prodigy as a piano player you can play the piano. If you are a child prodigy as a mathematician you can do complicated sums in your head. Here, the kid undoubtedly has unusual ball skills but that doesn't make him a footballer. I also don't see him as a 'internet/media phenomenon' with any longevity - with YouTube such phenonima come and go like snow in the sun. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 00:01, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>He was born as a YouTube phenomen but now he's known by all of the users above, has google entries and BBC articles. Guys, you wanna delete him, let's do it. Simply there are people who search for him and people who know him, there are many articles on paper magazines about him, but if you are too zealous to keep a 9-years-old top-youngster 'cause "well, dear Watson, it fails WP:BIO =_= ahem" let's do it. Do it and stop arguing bullshits. --<a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecronudist_ebaa.html" title="User:Necronudist">necronudist</a> 09:24, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
