<ul>
<li>I know. Ultra-Loser (great name) commented that if this article is going to be deleted, then all other episodes of this series would need to be deleted (and why would one episode of a list of episodes be nominated without any of the others being nominated anyway?). I was prematurely stating, in that case, keep them all. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 02:22, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ok, let's get something straight. Did you read the article? It's one sentence, it doesn't add anything at all. You can have a list and nominate stuff later on that doesn't meet notability. But for now, just think about this article. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font><font color="red">sox</font></a> 02:26, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, my name rules. Anyways, I've thought this over, and I've decided to vote <b>delete</b>, for this article and every other article in the list - unless someone can expand them considerably within the next five days. Right now they're just wasting space on the wikipedia servers and degrading the quality of this encyclopedia. Anyone who comes to this article looking for information will likely just be disappointed. I dig the spoiler warning over the "this article is a stub" sentance, by the way. Very useful. <b><a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltra-Loser_fa06.html" title="User:Ultra-Loser"><span style="color:#112B84">Ultra-Loser</span></a></b> <small><a href="../../../u/l/t/User_talk%7EUltra-Loser_53db.html" title="User talk:Ultra-Loser">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ultra-Loser_4117.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ultra-Loser">Contributions</a></small> 02:45, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, I read it, and I then went to the episodes list and glanced at a couple other episodes. They appear to be mostly one sentence articles, but that's why I made the comment that articles can be expanded. I've never seen the show, but I know it has a huge fanbase. Surely someone can expand it. I'd hate to see Wikipedia become lopsided in its content, excluding content on older shows, while current shows like My Name is Earl and Office have entire in-depth synopses of every single episode. Just my thoughts. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 02:54, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Maybe it would be more useful to have all of the one-liner articles merged into a list while retaining the blurb descriptors and then linking that list back to the main article? I can see why we should keep the material in as much as we keep a lot of pop culture, but a load of 1 line articles isn't really what we want unless they will someday each grow into something more than a stub. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobovski_2c2e.html" title="User:Robovski">Robovski</a> 04:16, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> this and other Battlestar Galactia episodes unless someone expands them beyond 1 line before the AFD closes. IF these are kept, then merge this with part 2 as is tradition (look at Star Trek, 2 part episodes have 1 article). <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 02:30, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> It should be kept but single line articles like this have no intrinsic value. They are also a pain to navigate to, and elevate what should be a bullet point in a main article detailing all episodes, to one which has a full page given to it. Its simply a waste of resources. We need some policy on this <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScope_creep_3ef9.html" title="User:Scope creep">scope_creep</a> 03:01, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Fancruft. The show may deserve an article, but single episodes do not. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 04:12, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> You might want to look around - there are plenty of articles on single episodes of various TV series in Wikipedia. The precedent has been set. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:58, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, substub one-line articles. If someone wants to do an expansion, they can always recreate. - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESpLoT_0684.html" title="User:SpLoT"><b><font color="orange">SpLoT</font></b></a> / <sup>(<a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESpLoT_ad35.html" title="User talk:SpLoT">talk</a>)</sup> 11:24, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There are many thousands of TV episodes that have pages on Wikipedia, do you suggest we delete them all? Some of them are even less significant than Battlestar Galactica. Needs expanding but keep, no reason it can't stay on here. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 14:54, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"If article X then article Y." is a fallacious argument, for obvious reasons. The correct argument is that Wikipedia should reflect the sources that exist in the world at large. We justify articles on individual episodes from series like <i>Babylon 5</i> and <i>Star Trek</i> not because "other shows have them", but because we can point to web sites, articles, and even <i>entire books</i> where people have documented, commented upon, and analysed such television series at the levels of the individual episodes. If you wish to make a similar case for this television series, please <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">point to</a> equivalent web sites, scholary articles, or books for <i>this</i> series that provide the requisite amount of source material for supporting an individual encyclopaedia article on this individual episode. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:52, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep.</b> The big problem with this (and the others) is that they are sub-stubs. I have put a message on the original author of this article(and other BG episode articles) urging him to expand the articles(he/she appears to be active). Hopefully, they (or someone else will expand). <a href="../../../j/c/a/User%7EJcam_7f9c.html" title="User:Jcam">Jcam</a> 15:20, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Original author here. Oy, vey, give me a break, okay? First thing was to create the article, put in all the infobox information, link it all, and then pad it out. For any article this is a drawn out process and part of this is that the whole thing IS supposed to be collaborative, right? Having the article is supposed to invite editing and improvement, right? The article's less than a week old, have a coffee and wait to see how long it's been before you go and do something like this... Now... I have to have another yelling match with someone over naming conventions. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueSquadronRaven_0385.html" title="User:BlueSquadronRaven"><font color="blue"><b>BlueSquadron</b></font><font color="black"><b>Raven</b></font></a> 19:35, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect</b> per above. <strike><b>Strong keep</b> but expand, of course.
