<li><b>Keep</b> It has not been any of the editors of this article that have edited Charles I. We have tirelessly worked on this article for a whole day. If you think it's a hoax, CHECK THE REFERENCES. Mohit DOES appear in there, and not in a minimal role either. We don't much appreciate users who say delete without any reason, AKA Tintin and Coredesat. If you honestly believe that this article is a hoax, which it is not, please state some conflicting evidence instead of saying "delete as a hoax". Every single word in that article is true, and we should be receiving praise about writing such a detailed account of an important sage's life instead of being vilified for it.</li>

<li>Ah, sorry, didn't remember that, it was my first contribution and I was playing around at school, I'd only just learned of Mohit when we were studying ancient India in World History, and we looked him up on Wikipedia for a paper but he wasn't there, leading to the creation of this article. I was pretty ticked at his absence from this site, so I edited some nonsense, but the content of this article remains true, as you can see from the absence of Charles I anywhere. And the information on the Bantu tribe is true as well, some moderator keeps deleting it, however.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/y/t/User%7EPythonriot_d0b4.html" title="User:Pythonriot">Pythonriot</a> (<a href="../../../p/y/t/User_talk%7EPythonriot_15e6.html" title="User talk:Pythonriot">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pythonriot_9e98.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pythonriot">contribs</a>) 20:49, 26 July 2006.</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Clearly it is not patent nonsense. It may be a hoax, but that would need to be judged by those with knowledge of relevant history.

<li>The first reference has a bit more, like Mohit's meeting with Pope Silvester, but they overlap a lot.

<li><b>Keep</b>Undisputable garbage? We live in a country where one is innocent until proven guilty. So, too is it conceivable that a man should be accepted as existing unless proven contrariwise. It is far easier to prove a man exists than to prove the opposite. Herein lies considerable evidence that the man in question did in fact exist, and held deeply considered beliefs in his respective fields of philosophy. Perhaps he is obscure, but consider the following: Gravity is only a theory. It is a set of beliefs which seem to hold true in all circumstances. We believe we know how it functions, but we cannot claim to know why. We cannot see or comprehend it, but only witness its influences. So too can we witness Mohit's influences in the references aforementioned.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.179.90.27 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.179.90.27_b00a.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.179.90.27">contribs</a>) 26 July 2006.</small></li>

<li>Because they amount to a handful of people saying "I saw it in a book." Given the stupendous number of websites that devote huge amounts of space to every religious or philosophical teacher that ever lived, it is inconceivable that not one even mentions this guy. Possibility 1: he's the only religious teacher in history to never be mentioned on the web. Possibility 2: The whole thing is a hoax. Add in the fact that the author of the article is a proven and admitted liar, and the conclusion is inescapable. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 20:57, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> since it is, at present, impossible to separate fact from fiction. I don't believe a word written by Pythonriot, not least because the references to Mohit in the articles to which this makes reference were in several cases added by Pythonriod - it defies belief that long-standing articles would have missed such a figure had it been attested in the sources. Also, the article claims as fact the baptism of Constantine by Silvester I, which is generally accepted to be fiction. The supposed book cover is a blatant bit of Photoshopping. Unless a genuine authority can come in and essentially start again I think we're better off without this strange mix of (maybe) fact and fiction. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 20:59, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
