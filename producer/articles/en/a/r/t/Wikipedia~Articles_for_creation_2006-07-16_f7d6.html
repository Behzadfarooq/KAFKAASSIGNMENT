Spring Thomas is a cyber porn star, famous for her controversial adult-oriented website "SpringThomas.Com" aka, "Spring World". Her gimmick is that as a white, blonde-haired young woman, she only has sex with black men (and women), but the controversy comes from some of the racially charged statements she makes in her videos. It can be argued that some of the things she says are racist, or at best, demeaning to the black race.</p>
<p>Part of her website also includes "cuckolding", in which a white male (sometimes claiming to be her boyfriend or the boyfriend of one of the white female "conversions" who take part in her clips), often masked or further humiliated in some way, sits off to the side and watches Thomas or her friends have sex with a black man, and is only allowed to masturbate and not participate in the activities.</p>
<p>A few choice quotes from her scenes, including such gems as "My granddaddy owned your granddaddy", "why do n*ggers sweat so much?", and "n*ggers don't make any money", are said either during the act or immediately afterwards, at which point her black male counterpart plays into the role and either agrees or takes out his aggression on her sexually.</p>
<p>Some may say she is merely playing a role and supplying for a niche market in the porn industry. Others argue she is a racist and should not be allowed to say and do such things on film.</p>

The triple spin is located right beside the Shock Wave roller coaster. This ride, appropriate for all ages, spins around while arm of the car you are in spins, and the car you in also moves but does not spin. This ride takes you high enough to see the Rebel Yell.</p>

Justice K.T.Thomas, retired Judge of Supreme Court of India made a speech on 12th July, 2006 clamouring for minority rights by many college managements now is turning into a "moneyority" issue and a "Veerappan philosophy" is guiding a sizable section of them to maintain false financial statements and records indulge in largscale corruption.</p>
<p>Justice Thomas also wondered how many managements could sincerely state that they were not taking "under-table" money from students who had been given admission to the professional courses.</p>
<p>"Minority cannot be segregated as a class in the Indian society. The minorities shouldn't have any rights which the majority doen't have" he said.</p>
<p>Asserting that he was ready to be in the forefront of securing the constitutionaly guaranteed minority rights. Justice Thomas said that church heads would have been admired more had they been ready to blacklist the managements of the minority education institutions which indulged in corrpution. The management should stop stoop present false accounts even in courts, as many of them had done it before the government , he said.</p>

<li><b>Declined</b>. It's unclear what the article was intended to be about. If it was intended to be about the justice, then it should cover more of his life and career. If it was intended to be about this particular speech, then it's not sufficiently notable (individual speeches almost never are). If it was intended to be about the new word "moneyority", then that would fall under the guidelines for Template:WP:Avoid neologisms; more sources demonstrating broader usage of the word by the public would be needed to establish notability. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 18:58, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Astoria was settled by William Hallett, an Englishman, who had previkously lived in the New England Colonies. He obtained from Govenor Stuyvesant on December 1, 1652, a grant of about 160 acres. The lower part of Astoria bordering on the East River and Hell Gate is still recalled as Hallett's Cove. One of the first and most decisive steps in the historical development of Long Island City into a municipality was the passage of a bill on April 12, 1839, entitled "An Act to Incorporate the Village of Astoria." Sstephen A. Haley, one of the founders, chose the name in honor of his friend and business associate in the fur trade, John Jacob Aster. Ironically Astoria has a large Greek population and many have come from Kastoria, a fur trading region in Northern Greece. "Horns Hook Ferry" was the only link with Manhattan. Between 1854 and 1871, Astoria prospered as a favorite suburb and vacation spot for many prominent and wealthy New York Families. Visitors coming from New York were to take the 34th Street Ferry or the 92nd Street Ferry, the only means of crossing the river. Long Island City merged with New York City on January 1, 1898. According to an article published the Central Astoria Local Development Coalition, "Astoria remains one of New York City's most vibrant neighborhoods. Astoria is a place that's former home to Ethel Merman, Tony Bennett, and Christopher Walkin; the "birthplace" for Steinway Pianos, an emerging headquarters for east coast movie, television and video production, site for the "world's longest department store - Steinway Street" and residence to the largest concentraions of Greeks outside of Athens." Places to visit: American Museum of the Moving Image, Socrates Outdoor Sculpture Park, Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum, Silvercup Studios and Kaufman Astoria Studios. According to the book published by the Greater Historical Society, "Images of America, Long Island City:" "at 66 acres, Astoria Park is a stunning jewel in the New York City Park system. Astoria Park Pool, constructed in 1936, is the largest in New York City. It has been described as the finest pool in the world. It was the sit for the finals of the Olympic swim tryouts for the 1936 and 1964 games." The Hellgate Bridge, a spectacular site from Astoria park crossing the East River is the world's longest rail road bridge and was constructed in 1917. The treacherous currents beneath the Hellgate Bridge are infamous for the sinking of Hussar Ship carrying over a million dollars in gold bars in 1780...the gold was never recovered as the currents were to dangerous for divers to go into.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-16_f7d6.html" title="Edit section: Moon Valley High School">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Moon Valley High School</span></h2>
<p>Many of Moon Valley High School's original 565 students and 25 teachers will recall the unfinished buildings, blowing dirt, lack of grass and lack of facilities that caused Moon Valley's delayed opening in September of 1965. As the years went by, the faculty grew from the original 25 to the current number of 100, and the boundaries are now from Thunderbird Road to Peoria Avenue and Black Canyon Freeway to 51st Avenue. Students now number 1,677. The new school was named Moon Valley because it was indicated on maps that the Moon Valley area was near the new school (since then, the areas have shifted). Many protest letters were written to the Board of Education stating that the school should be called either Deer Valley High, Northwest High, John F. Kennedy High or Westown High. The controversy raged for many months with petitions pouring in from the community, both for and against the name. The board, however, stuck with the original name, stating the Glendale schools are neither named after people nor directions, since that was the way Phoenix Union District named its schools. Mr. Don Reed, an engineer at General Electric, contacted Hughes Aircraft and was able to have donated an Air Force GAR air-to-air guided missile shell for use as a mascot. In accordance with this, the student body chose the mascot name, "Rockets." The school colors are scarlet red, royal blue and white. Because there was no grass that first year, flower beds were planted around the school. Students refused to let janitors take out all the flowers, so the flowers have become a permanent fixture on the grounds. Mr. Victor E. Lowman was Moon Valley's first principal for three and a half years. Moon Valley's present principal is Dr. Linda Rosness. The Rockets' administration also consists of Bob Shupp, assistant principal (AP) for student services; Susan Hertneky, AP of operations and resources; and Michael Fowler, AP of discipline and attendance. Moon Valley began a closed campus in the fall of 2002, which means that students stay within campus grounds throughout the day. During the years of the "mini-skirt" and "sideburns," the dress code was a problem. The girls would roll up their skirts to make them shorter. When they were sent to the office, they would roll them down as if their skirts were never short. This didn't last very long. Things haven't changed so very much, but currently it is girls' short shirts that are getting pulled down, attempting to meet current dress code standards. In the 1973-74 school year Moon Valley was on double session because Thunderbird High School was not yet open. The Moon Valley students came in the morning, while the T-Bird students came in the afternoon. According to Mr. Williams, the situation caused a great deal of confusion and many problems ensued during this year-long period. But once Thunderbird opened, things got back to normal. Remodeling took place on the campus in 1976-77. The vocational automotives facility was expanded to allow for more equipment and technical instruction, and additions were made to the gym. Moon Valley High has been accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges an Secondary Schools since its first graduating class in 1967.</p>

<p>Hippie Death Jam is a 3 piece musical ensemble formed in Sydney Australia in early 2006. There fast and raw rythems are propelled by driving bass lines that form Thrash punk music that can only be described as Awsesome.</p>
<p>The band consists of three members, Peter W is behind the drums and forms a crucial part of the bands rhythm section. Martin N is the Lead singer and Guitarist, his crunching vocals destroy all opposition, while the bassist, Alexi M also provided crucial back up vocals and killer bass licks.</p>
<p>The band is renound for its catchy and aggressive tracks that include the likes of "Fuck off and Die", "Monkey Brains", "Tarman" + "Tarman 2, Tarman harder" and offcourse the ever popular "daisies".</p>
<p>Critics have suggested that the length of the songs be increased as fans often are left salivating for more when a song ends, to this comment the HDJ response has been simple fuck off and die, well play how we like.</p>
<p>It is rumoured that an albumn is in the making, the 28 track (give or take) production is currently being discussed by the band and is likely to go ahead with vigour.</p>

<p>Once Australia (and one of the world's) largest travelling family carnivals, Tom Wittingslow started the business before World War II. On his return from the war, the Changi veteran started touring with a horse and cart and eventually bought merry-go-rounds and rides.</p>
<p>The Wittingslow Carnival operated at all major agricultural shows, including Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide, and many street festivals in Melbourne. Since the 1950s, Wittingslow rides have also provided many hours of summer holiday fun at the Rye and Rosebud Christmas Carnivals on the Mornington Peninsula.</p>
<p>In the 1990's the company had a value in excess of $20 million, with a large amount of portable amusement rides and sideshows.</p>
<p>Following numerous unfortunate incidents around 2000, and with the passing of Tom Wittingslow, the original company was declared insolvent.</p>

<p>Psyched for Life, a concept developed by business consultant, educator and author Alan Guinn, focuses on challenges faced in decision-making when viewed through a concept of changed perception. The concept was developed and published to encourage better decisions through a self-analysis of "why" decisions are made and what principal factors influence those decisions. How each person views reality obviously impacts significantly upon how he or she makes decisions.</p>
<p>A book, <b>Psyched for Life: A New Guide to Decision Making</b> was published in 2001, and copyrighted in 2002. The book has spun off seminar presentations, a webpage developed by the book's author, licensed content woven through a variety of educational presentations, and a facilitation method published by the International Association of Facilitators.</p>
<p>The concept of being Psyched for Life is based upon acceptance of what Guinn identifies as Ten Corollaries of Life: 1) Change how you think. 2) Realize that there are bad people in the world. 3) Make learning an ongoing process. 4) Live the truth--You change your history. 5) Share and weave your experiences into the lives of others. 6) Life life every day to its fullest. 7) Search for a "Ration of Passion." 8) Never, never, never say never. 9) Don't ever lie to yourself. 10) Accept the compliments.</p>
<p>The Psyched for Life concept has evolved into an ever-broadening variety of practical ideas for living a fuller, more enjoyable life through personal focus on making better decisions... without the negative influences of persons or situations.</p>

<p>It is a nature reserve area in Kırklareli province of Turkey near the small coast town of İğneada on the Black Sea Coast. It gets its name from the Saka Lake which is in the boundaries of the area. Its area is 1345 ha. The area sits on a floodplain of a river that flows into the Black Sea and seasonally floods thus rendering it a unique and one of the very few remaining floodplain forests in all of Europe. The flora consists of oak forests (typical of the Yıldız mountains located in the vicinity of the area), ash, alder , elm, maple and hornbeam trees. There are also wide stretches of pristine coastal area with several endemic plants some of which are halophytes(salt-loving) and wetlands dominated by reeds which harbor different bird species.</p>

<p>No. 333 (Norwegian) Squadron RAF was established as a detachment under the RAF 210 squadron, the 8.th of February, in 1942 by captain Finn Lambrechts. The squadron was located in Woodhaven, Scotland. The 10.th of May, 1943 a B-Wing of the squadron was established in Leuchars, with De Haviland Mosquito Fighter-bomber’s and Bristol Beaufighters. The B-wing became the RNoAF 334 squadron the 22.th June, 1945.</p>
<p>On their first mission to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norway</a>, the poet, and news-reporter <a href="../../../n/o/r/Nordahl_Grieg_a977.html" title="Nordahl Grieg">Nordahl Grieg</a> was with them to report from the flight. This was then a secret mission. After this mission, he wrote the poem: Flagget</p>
<p>Under the war, the missions of 333 squadron included dangerous search and destroy submarine missions, patrolling, and secret missions along the Norwegian Coastline, behind the German defence lines. They landed and picked up agents, illegal radios, and transmitters. They also dropped Christmas presents to the Norwegian population, and did search and rescue missions.</p>
<p>After the war, they helped to rebuild the northern parts of Norway, transporting people, and equipment from the south to the north.</p>
<p>The oil-activity, establishing of the Norwegian economic zone, and establishing of the coast-guard created new demands to the squadron. Now they had to surveillance great sea areas, and they had to get new airplanes, the <a href="../../../p/-/3/P-3_Orion_a70d.html" title="P-3 Orion">Orion</a>. In the 80’s they did search and destroy submarine missions along the coastline and in the fjords. Several times they have dropped sharp weapons against submarines that were illegal in Norwegian territory. In the 90’s, the Russian north fleet was reduced to the half in quantity. But still they have 67 operational submarines, and a great fleet of ships. But, the fleet is still just as powerful as earlier, because of new technology.</p>
<p>Today the squadron regularly does various missions as; surveilling military maritime operations, patrolling the economic zone, controlling the fishing, and the resources, submarine searches, but they also does search and rescue missions. But also they often are a part of international missions, and training.</p>
<p>The squadron is the only one that has been active all the time since the Second World War. And is today a part of the 133 Air wing.</p>

<p>Libbyland was the brand name of a line of TV dinners produced in the 1970's. They were designed specifically to appeal to children, and were promoted by a cartoon character named Libby the Kid (a pun on Billy the Kid) who was a white-hatted hero/adventurer. His primary nemesis was the mustachioed Mean Gene, who frequently attempted to steal Libbyland dinners from unwary children.</p>
<p>As with any food product aimed at children, packaging was a critical component of marketing. While the dinners contained ordinary, kid-friendly items such as fried chicken or spaghetti, they were given names such as Pirate's Picnic and Safari Supper. These packages were colorfully illustrated, and could be turned into games and/or serving trays for the food. Imprints of various Libbyland characters could be found at the bottom of each serving tin, presumably as a means of encouraging children to finish their meal.</p>

<p>Roots Tonic is the backing band for the Hasidic Rock/Reggae artist and beat-boxer Matisyahu. The group is comprised of Aaron Dugan on Guitar, Jonah David on drums, and Josh Werner playing both the bass and keyboards. Werner is also known to share the writing credits with Matisyahu and is credited as the sole writer for the heartfelt acoustic track "What I'm Fighting For" on the newly certified gold record "Youth".) The band has been with Matisyahu since his debut album, "Shake Off the Dust... Arise", and continue to play with him through his two follow up albums. "Live At Stubb's" and "Youth" have both been certfifed gold by the RIAA and as of late June were both charted in the top 40 ("Stubb's" peaking at #30 and "Youth" at #4), making Matisyahu/Roots Tonic the only artists able to make that claim at the time.</p>

<p>Brackenridge Field Laboratories is a research facility managed by the University of Texas at Austin and resides along the northeastern shore of Town Lake in Austin Texas, on Lake Austin Blvd. The facility consists of a total of 345 acres of land, although some of this land is leased as commercial property. The Lyons Municipal Golf Course also resides on this property.</p>
<p>The facility contains over 50 unique species of ants, including several endangered populations. The facility has provided scientists with several groundbreaking discoveries involving ant behavior and cohabitation among species. Most notably, the facility has played a key role in determining key principals behind the caste system used among different ant colonies. This includes research on how the queen gains and retains control in a colony. The warlike and amicable interaction between colonies are studied in great detail, as there are few other places where such a diverse concentration of ant species live.</p>
<p>The university has recently (May 2006) commissioned a task force committee to determine possible future uses for the land. Part of this land was rejected as the future site of the George W. Bush Presidential Library.</p>

<p>The Cultural Politics Discussion Group was founded and maintained by Daniel Garrett for several years. Its members read books and articles, saw and discussed films, and listened to and commented on music and other forms of culture, as well as discussed philosophy and politics. Various members moderated sessions on selected topics. Daniel Garrett had an idea around 1983 for a discussion group that would explore both art and politics. He participated in various groups and workshops such as House of Poets in Harlem in the mid-1980s and Kofi Natambu's workshop (on modernism and postmodernism) at the St. Mark's Poetry Project in the late 1980s, two groups he admired, but it wasn't until Garrett started the Cultural Politics Discussion Group, which met first at ABC No Rio in Manhattan's lower east side and then Soho, that he fulfilled his vision of what such a multicultural and intellectual group might be: and the group discussed a wide range of cultural forms and philosophy from 1989 to 1993. (The motto of the group was knowledge, discourse, friendship, and social responsibility.) Garrett has mentioned the Cultural Politics Discussion Group in various writings, including, briefly, his commentary on the films The Barbarian Invasions (January 2004) and Dogville (June 2004) and in an iconographic consideration of culture and social life (February 2006), all of three of which appeared on the web pages of Offscreen.</p>

<p>A well-respected comedian whose been compared to a tornado on amphetamines. His high-energy comedy act is both outrageous and hysterically original. Born in Far Rockaway, and raised on Long Island New York. Steven Pearl has been performing stand-up comedy professionally since 1979. He began his stand-up career in such prestigious NYC comedy clubs as Catch A Rising Star and The Improv, moving to San Francisco in 1979. In San Francisco he immersed himself in the comedy scene and was often performing seven nights a week. By 1985, he found himself opening for the then up and coming L.A. based comic Sam Kinison. He eventually discovered a comedian could only go so far in San Francisco and moved on to Los Angeles in 1987.</p>
<p>In L.A. he was quickly made a paid regular at the world-famous Comedy Store on Sunset Strip. In his first days there he suddenly found himself following such legendary comedy acts as Sam Kinison, Richard Pryor and Roseanne. In the highly competitive world of the 1980s L.A. comedy scene, he held his own and continued to grow both as a writer and performer. In the late 1980s he began appearing on numerous TV shows, including A&amp;E's An Evening at the Improv (1990 - 1994), and Caroline's Comedy Hour (1992).

<p>Harjes, Herman Henry. (1875, France - 1926, France): banker, senior partner of the Morgan-Harjes Bank of Paris founded by his father John Harjes (1830-1914), played a significant role behind the scenes in World War One by negotiating sizeable loans for the Allies. In time, the Morgan Bank system became the exclusive purchasing agents in the U.S. for the Allies. Harjes was a prominent member of the American Colony in Paris: he and his father had been among the founders of the American Hospital in Neuilly. He became involved in relief work as soon as the war broke out. As head of the American Relief Clearing House, he presided over the channelling of American contributions to France in currency and in kind. As chief representative of the American Red Cross in France from 1914-1917, he founded the Harjes Formation, a volunteer ambulance driver group which later merged with Richard Norton's American Volunteer Motor-Ambulance Corps to become the Norton-Harjes. When relief work was militarized under the American Red Cross in July 1917, Harjes stepped down and became chief liaison officer for the AEF with the French High Command.</p>
<p>Harjes, said to have introduced polo to France, had in 1923 lost his eldest daughter in a riding accident. Handicapped by a stiff leg from a war injury -- Harjes had told his wife he would stop playing polo altogether, but was killed in 1926, in a polo accident which occurred during the 'just one more game' he had promised his wife would conclude his polo career.</p>

<ul>
<li>=Early Life=</li>
</ul>
<p>Paul Schaltenbrand's life began in relative obscurity. He was born to a working class family in Carrick, PA, a suburb of Pittsburgh. He attended <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrick_High_School_5e87.html" title="Carrick High School">Carrick High School</a>, starring in Football and on stage in numerous productions. His performance on the field caught the eye of coaches at <a href="../../../d/u/q/Duquesne_University_c432.html" title="Duquesne University">Duquesne University</a>. He chose Duquesne over <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_University_8e23.html" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a> (branch campus) and matriculated at the university's prestigious School of Pharmacy. He quickly realized that pharmacy was not what he had bargained for and began to pursue a degree in Education. After a devastating knee injury during his junior season Schaltenbrand was forced to abandon his dreams of playing professional football and shifted his focus to teaching.</p>
<ul>
<li>=Teaching Career=</li>
</ul>
<p>Paul Schaltenbrand began his teaching career at his alma mater Carrick High School. A few years later he accepted a position at <a href="../../../t/a/y/Taylor_Allderdice_High_School_c53d.html" title="Taylor Allderdice High School">Taylor Allderdice High School</a> where he remains today in the social studies department. [edit]</p>
<ul>
<li>=As a Historian=</li>
</ul>
<p>Schaltenbrand is a disciple of Boston University Professor Emeritus Howard Zinn. Like Zinn did in his influential work, A People's History of the United States, Schaltenbrand stresses the importance of the study of non dominant historical perspectives. "History is prismatic; one event occurs, but it is then recorded in a thousand different lights. It is a living, breathing and perpetually changing study in perspective."</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>=Golf Coach=</li>
</ul>
<p>Schaltenbrand began his tenure as Allderdice Golf Coach in 2004 upon the departure of Alan Margolis. Under Schaltenbrand the team has continued its dominance capturing the City League Championship in all three of his seasons. At the Peters Township Invitational in 2004, Schaltenbrand was able to secure a $1000 donation perhaps as a result Allderdice's 100 stroke loss in the event. He has used these funds and other donations to purchase needed supplies for the golf team.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>=Odds and Ends=</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>His favorite movie is [Forest Gump]</li>
<li>Since 2005 his study halls have been called Scharties and draw numerous students from all over the building.</li>
<li>In June 2006 he threw a Mexican Themed Scharty which was dubbed a "Schiesta" by the attendees. It featured homemade food, a Piñata, and live entertainment. It was the last Scharty for the first generation of Schartiers (Class of 2006).</li>

<p><i>(n)</i> a ratcase refers to a person's 'ratty behaviour'. The extent to which the ratty behaviour occurs or, the how long it may occur may result in the term ratcase being used.</p>
<p>Examples are: 1) the wife is displaying stubborn behaviour about sharing the sheets in the bed. "She is a ratcase" 2) the young child throwing food after being told not to. "you little ratcase" 3) the wife refusing to believe that ratcase is a word "you are being a ratcase my love!"</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-16_f7d6.html" title="Edit section: Kees Dieffenthaller">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Kees Dieffenthaller</span></h2>
<p><b>Kees Dieffenthaller</b> is the prolific lead singer/song-writer from Trinidad &amp; Tobago, who, with his two brothers, <b>Jon</b> and <b>Hans</b>, and bassist <b>Riad Bochoon</b>, form the band <b>KES</b>. Kees and his band are part of the new movement of music within Trinidad &amp; Tobago today. KES has begun to turn heads in international circles, attracting the attention of such famous names as <b>David Bramble</b>, who is currently working with the band. The band is under the management of <b>QuestionMark Entertainment</b>, and releases music in a fusion of Trinidadian soca and chutney, Jamaican reggae and international rock and punk. Kees cites as his musical influences: <b>Sparrow</b>, <b>Van Halen</b>, <b>Bob Marley</b>, <b>Mungal Patessar</b>, <b>the Dave Matthews Band</b>, <b>David Rudder</b>, <b>Shadow</b>, <b>Stevie Wonder</b> and <b>Andre Tanker</b>, among others.</p>
<p>Kees was born on March 12th., 1981,in <b>Palmiste</b>, Trinidad, the fourth of five siblings. His elder siblings are Trinidadian director, videographer and producer extraordinnaire, <b>Danielle Dieffenthaller</b>, and fellow band-members, Hans and Jon. His youngest sister is <b>Heidi</b>. Kees attended <b>Presentation College, San Fernando</b>, where he joined his first band, <b>Gregory's Dream</b>, with such notable members as Juilliard grad, <b>Michael Zephryne</b> and former Miss Trinidad &amp; Tobago, <b>Faye-ann Alibocus</b>. The dismal failure of Gregory's Dream, led Kees to form his own band, <b>Limestone</b>, with his brothers, Hans on drums, Jon on guitars and they recruited Riad at this time to be the second guitarist. Kees was always a highly intellectual individal, his notable academic achievements being quite high. Kees secured seven grade 1's at the CXC level, as well as a full scholarship to Princeton University in the USA, for the pursuit of medicene which he had to forgo, due to his desire to pursue music as his professional career.</p>
<p>At the age of nineteen, after completing his Advanced Levels at <b>St. Mary's College</b> in <b>Port-of-Spain</b>, Trinidad, Kees and his fellow bandmates in Limestone were drafted into the Caribbean band <b>Imij &amp; Co.</b>, a major soca band that enjoyed world-wide recognition. Kees has always proudly recognized his musical history and applauds the experiences he gained from each of the bands he headlined prior to KES. In early 2005, however, Kees, his brothers and Riad left Imij &amp; Co., due to musical conflicts and formed their own band, which Kees heads, known simply as KES. The name for the band was chosen as KES, because Kees (a German name, with a literal pronunciation of Kay-ess) has always been called by his Trinidadian peers "Kess." To make matters simple, the band decided that it would be in their favor to capitalize of Kees' huge popularity and use his name as the front name for the band.</p>
<p>The objective of KES was simply to create a new identity for themselves in which people can respect the band for the music they create, and their contributions to the artform.</p>
<p>Not an easy feat, but one that is being accomplished one step at a time: whether by winning the praises of <b>Mark McGrath</b>, performing as the opening band for <b>Sugar Ray</b>; being featured as the only live act on the popular MTV series <b>The Gauntlet II</b>; performing as one of the few invited acts for the launch of MTV’s network <b>TEMPO</b> – which now shows in over 17 countries throughout the Caribbean; headlining a national touring promotion for Coca Cola, called <b>Rock Your Crib</b>, with other major celebrities such as <b>Machel Montano</b>, and <b>Rikki Jai</b>; or working extensively with internationally renowned producer <b>Derek Bramble</b>. A KES track has been chosen by <b>ELECTRONIC ARTS SPORTS (EA SPORTS)</b> to be placed on on the soundtrack to their highly anticipated football (soccer) game called <b>FIFA 2006 – WORLD CUP EDITION</b>, which will debut on all three platforms (PS2, X-Box, and Nintendo) on over 6 million units shipped worldwide.</p>
<p>Kees has written most of the songs for his band KES, and these include: <b>One Day</b>, <b>The Way</b> and <b>Calling</b>. He has also done a remake of the famous Dave Matthews Band song, <b>Crash</b>, in a collaboration with <b>Skid Nevelly</b> frontman, <b>Andrew</b>, on steelpan. All the above songs can be found on the band KES' first album released on April 12th 2006, <b>Three Baldheads and a Dread</b>.</p>
<p>Other collaborations by Kees include a duet with <b>Natasha Simmons</b>, written by <b>Anil Roberts</b> called <b>Angel</b>, a duet with <b>Michelle Xavier</b>, written by Kees Dieffenthaller called <b>Hynotized</b>, and a song called <b>Dance all night</b>, produced by venerable Caribbean producer, <b>Kenny Phillips</b>.</p>
<p>Kees continues to be the leadsinger of the band KES and performs to sold-out audiences in the Caribbean, Florida and Canada. He writes and arranges music for KES and is currently working on the band's second album.</p>

Cancer is caused by stagnation of Qi, a major disharmony that can lead to death. Qi must always be flowing like stream moving oxygen and nutrients, purifying and detoxifying. When the body is not at balanced herbs are used to strengthen or sedate the most affected organ. Herbs are also used with the seasons to cool and warm.</p>

<p>Preston Theler (Born 01/21/1982 in La Crosse, WI) is a ramp agent/ freelance web designer. He also works in ground operations at <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesaba_Airlines_94f5.html" title="Mesaba Airlines">Mesaba Airlines</a>. He lives in Minneapolis, but travels around the world. Preston also is an expert bike mechanic, sysadmin, bartender. He was chronicled in the Preston Stories published in 1993.</p>
<p>His career in photography kicked off in 1997 when he got a digital camera from Brett Warner. It was probably stolen, but that didn't stop him from starting in on a full time career of documenting life in Southwestern Wisconsin. In 2005 he moved to Minneapolis where his photography skills improved as he shot pics of the Warehouse district, NEHE, and the gritty strech of Franklin Avenue where he lived.</p>
<p>In 2006, he sold all his earthly possessions and started on a 24 month long trip around the world. He didn't know it at the time, but this would be a turning point in his life. He met up with many fine women, and took many fine photographs which are available on his official website (see below). The first stop was London. He met up with Ali G, who would go on to influence his style forevermore.</p>

<p>This endearing little convertible was a creation offered by two enterprising New Yorkers who formed the Playboy Motor Corporation in the years immediately following the end of World War II. At the time, Playboy was one of many small car companies going up against the major automakers for an entirely unproven market—the sub-$1,000 car. The majority of these efforts featured tiny cars with small engines that were cheap to buy, run and maintain. Louis Horowitz, Charles D. Thomas and Norman Richardson originally founded the Playboy Motor Corporation as the Midget Motor Car Company. Horowitz, a former Packard dealer, and Thomas, a onetime Pontiac engineer, came up with a very affordable lightweight convertible for fun motoring. It seated three, had a manually activated retractable metal top that stowed behind the seat and was powered by an inline four-cylinder engine. The factory was located in Buffalo, NY. Only 97 prototypes were handbuilt before the company went out of business.</p>

<p><b>The Realm of Comics</b> is a webpage containing sprite comics and other personal interests of it's creator, Duane van Voorst, also known as Speedy. The site isn't that big, and doesn't seem to update very often, yet it is still visited every day.</p>
<p>Most visitors, however, are interested in the Wifi Code Collection, one of the small sections on the webpage. This section holds Nintendo DS friend codes, which can be submitted through a form found on that same page. It also holds a form in case Speedy forgot to add a Wifi game. Though this seems useless overall, since Speedy checks several game websites weekly merely to see if there's a new Wifi game. When the Nintendo Wii (Revolution) comes out, it is said that this collection will expand it's site merely to hold these codes as well.</p>
<p>Other visitors rather search around the ever-yet-slowly updating sprite comics, such as <i>The Key to Madness</i>, which is currently on hiatus until a different author would step in and make some comics, or <i>Elementals</i>, which is also on hiatus because of a lack of material. <i>HoloclonesGoBad</i> is the active webcomic. Although updated rarely, it still continues. While this started as an idea to make his own version of the so called Megaman Cataclysm (somewhat like <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_and_George_ebc6.html" title="Bob and George">Bob and George</a>) it ended as a whole different story. The comic page also holds other comics as well as simple images made while Speedy was slightly bored.</p>
<p>The Realm of Comics is also known for the <i>Role Playing Zone</i>, although it has not been active for a while and will be replaced in the future for a better board, covering more than mostly Megaman.exe roleplays.</p>
<p>Creation date of this webpage is unknown, even the creator itself doesn't remember. It has probably been online since 2000, but because of all the server changes and layout edits nobody can be sure.</p>

the deejay is the screendesigner is the artist is the photographer is the graphic activist is the editor is the beat maker is the boarder is the man!</p>
<p>Mid School HIP HOP DEEJAY.</p>
<p>One of Berlin's club DJs that have been around for a long time; has a real fine feeling for the music he spins and will surprise you with lots or rocking b-sides to your favorite a-sides; loves the mid-90s stuff but also hits you with the new good hip hop and, as a berlin-born frenchman, has a faible for the dope french stuff; one for the hip hop connaisseurs. Also doing an audiovisual 4 turntable show with b.ski rocks called "yo fishski raps", showing the golden age videoclips while deejaying to it! Actual mixtape: "keys by the pound", every song contains piano loops ... new tape is in production!</p>
<p><br />
AUDIOVISUAL ACTIVIST.</p>
<p>Born in berlin, jah fish started doing stencils on blank skateboard decks and self-tainted t-shirts in the mid-eighties, quickly using a macintosh as a useful tool for typos ... even though he wouldn't call himself an artist, he is capable to use way more than just a computer to accomplish his vision. At the end of the eighties, he started doing flyers on a regular basis, record covers, advertising, ... various jobs in various agencies like Die Gestalten, Melle-Pufe, W.H.S., Octopus (london), ZFK, ... and for clients like Warner, Afri-Cola, Vision Street Wear, DC Shoes, Echo, Adidas, Puma, .... from scan slave to art director he produced advertisement campaigns, company CIs, logos, magazine layouts, websites, 3D flash animations, screensavers, cinema advertisements, short movies, videoclips, record covers and ads, video game packagings, clothing artworks, customized cars and vespas, menu cards, books, catalogues, ...</p>
<p>then went into screendesign and IT business with MPT, Klug New Media, Rosa (CH), BVM, .... for clients like V-Scout, Afri-cola, Bacardi, Virgin, Smart Car, lodown, deutsche bahn, .... did screendesigns for websites, concepts for sites and planned sited maps, created interactive flash websites/movies/animations ... at the typo 99 (annual designer meeting in berlin) he blasted the audience with an audiovisual performance with deejay quest, producing the soundtrack to the flash-movie live on 4 turntables, taking the screen to the stage. but he turned away from the IT-world, saving himself from becoming a 24/7-on-the-computer-nerd.</p>
<p>By that time, he had spent 10 years deejaying in many many club in berlin and the rest of the world. been resident deejay at clubs like WMF, Yaam, Kurvenstar &amp; the famous BOOGALOO (rip) and been warming up the crown for a lot of my hiphop heroes: pharcyde, A Tribe Called Quest, 3rd bass, urban species, mc solaar, The Roots, Grandmaster flash, mr. lif, sinista, TY ... On tour with KRS One, Outkast, Guru &amp; band, Gangstarr + das efx &amp; mop .... and he was about to stop deejaying when quest (from berlin) hooked up with him and made him part of the pflegerlounge crew.</p>
<p>He is showing love for his roots, and that's not just hiphop. besides breaking a facial bone in 98 for the love of hiphop, he reappeared out of nowhere in the middle of berlin, with an incredible exhibition: The Return Of The Killer Memorabilia (2600 items for the Atari 2600 console), a huge collection of consoles, carts, accessoires and various items related to it. there is a daily exhibition, game contests with prices, wild music performances and many interesting visitors.</p>
<p>Now in the dirty thirties, he starts combining the work (money) and the love (hiphop), moving into an office with karin at subotage.com he produces a website and most tour posters and deejays on some of the concerts. Audiovisually supporting the Live-demo team on their events, and doing freelance jobs from time to time for interesting clients.</p>
<p>in 2005 he moved together with Asa, his beloved kungfu girl. she's a visual artist, doin visual design, filming, editing ... and in her work, you will sometimes find one of his typos or maybe you'll find some of her artwork in his design. he spent half a year in capetown and got married to his wife there. now they are on the way to beijing to make some new experiences and collaborations.</p>

<p>The so-called Truman National Security Project was launched in the wake of the 2004 Presidential elections, ostensibly by a Oxford Rhodes Scholar named Rachel Kleinfeld, and another young Oxford grad named Matthew Spence. While launching the Truman Project, Kleinfeld as Senior Consultant to Booz Allen Hamilton, worked on information-sharing across the military, intelligence and law enforcement communities, homeland security, and trade and security issues, <i>according to her official biography writing at least one joint op-ed piece with the</i> firm's Vice President, R. James Woolsey, the first CIA Director under President Bill Clinton, a member of Donald Rumsfeld's all-neocon Defense Policy Board (chaired by Richard Perle), and the co-chairman today of the hardcore imperialist Committee on the Present Danger, along with Bush-Cheney Administration godfather and leading Synarchist George P. Shultz. The Project's last conference in June 2005 featured a post-election panel discussion titled ``What Democrats did wrong, Republicans did right, and neo-cons did better. <i>The Project's website features</i> a series of policy papers, all of which project the idea that rightwing Democrats can do a better job of marketing the same Global War on Terror and free trade dogmas than their GOP counterparts.</p>
<p>Beyond the Kleinfeld-Woolsey links, the Truman Project's Advisory Board includes an all-star cast of Democratic Leadership Council luminaries, and other Democrat super-hawks, including Will Marshall, the President of the DLC think tank, the Progressive Policy Institute; former Clinton Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; Kurt Campbell, Senior Vice President of the Center for Strategic and International Studies; William J. Perry, the former Clinton Secretary of Defense who recently advocated a preemptive strike against North Korea's missile launch sites; and Anne-Marie Slaughter, the director of the Princeton Project on National Security, chaired by George Shultz. The Princeton Project teamed up with Felix Rohatyn's own center at Middlebury College, Vermont in Oct. 2004, to host a conference promoting the ``privatization of national security, <i>which openly advocated a ``new feudalism</i> modeled on the British East India Company, to serve the requirements of an ``American neo-imperialism. <i>The Princeton Project and the</i> Progressive Policy Institute are officially listed as partner organizations of the Truman Project. In an astute column in the {Los Angeles Times} May 28, 2006, the paper's former editorial writer Jacob Heilbrunn warned about the real mission of the Truman Project, under the headline ``Neocons in the Democratic Party.</p>

JAH FISH: french deejay and artist from berlin, Germany</p>
<p>Mid School HIP HOP DEEJAY.</p>
<p>One of Berlin's club DJs that have been around for a long time (since 1989); has a real fine feeling for the music he spins and will surprise you with lots or rocking b-sides to your favorite a-sides; loves the mid-90s stuff but also hits you with the new good hip hop and, as a berlin-born frenchman, has a faible for the dope french stuff; one for the hip hop connaisseurs. Also doing an audiovisual 4 turntable show with b.ski rocks called "yo fishski raps", showing the golden age videoclips while deejaying to it! Actual mixtape: "keys by the pound", every song contains piano loops ... new tape is in production!</p>
<p><br />
AUDIOVISUAL ACTIVIST.</p>
<p>Born in berlin, jah fish started doing stencils on blank skateboard decks and self-tainted t-shirts in the mid-eighties, quickly using a macintosh as a useful tool for typos ... even though he wouldn't call himself an artist, he is capable to use way more than just a computer to accomplish his vision. At the end of the eighties, he started doing flyers on a regular basis, record covers, advertising, ... various jobs in various agencies like Die Gestalten, Melle-Pufe, W.H.S., Octopus (london), ZFK, ... and for clients like Warner, Afri-Cola, Vision Street Wear, DC Shoes, Echo, Adidas, Puma, .... from scan slave to art director he produced advertisement campaigns, company CIs, logos, magazine layouts, websites, 3D flash animations, screensavers, cinema advertisements, short movies, videoclips, record covers and ads, video game packagings, clothing artworks, customized cars and vespas, menu cards, books, catalogues, ...</p>
<p>then went into screendesign and IT business with MPT, Klug New Media, Rosa (CH), BVM, .... for clients like V-Scout, Afri-cola, Bacardi, Virgin, Smart Car, lodown, deutsche bahn, .... did screendesigns for websites, concepts for sites and planned sited maps, created interactive flash websites/movies/animations ... at the typo 99 (annual designer meeting in berlin) he blasted the audience with an audiovisual performance with deejay quest, producing the soundtrack to the flash-movie live on 4 turntables, taking the screen to the stage. but he turned away from the IT-world, saving himself from becoming a 24/7-on-the-computer-nerd.</p>
<p>By that time, he had spent 10 years deejaying in many many club in berlin and the rest of the world. been resident deejay at clubs like WMF, Yaam, Kurvenstar &amp; the famous BOOGALOO (rip) and been warming up the crown for a lot of my hiphop heroes: pharcyde, A Tribe Called Quest, 3rd bass, urban species, mc solaar, The Roots, Grandmaster flash, mr. lif, sinista, TY ... On tour with KRS One, Outkast, Guru &amp; band, Gangstarr + das efx &amp; mop .... and he was about to stop deejaying when quest (from berlin) hooked up with him and made him part of the pflegerlounge crew.</p>
<p>He is showing love for his roots, and that's not just hiphop. besides breaking a facial bone in 98 for the love of hiphop, he reappeared out of nowhere in the middle of berlin, with an incredible exhibition: The Return Of The Killer Memorabilia (2600 items for the Atari 2600 console), a huge collection of consoles, carts, accessoires and various items related to it. there is a daily exhibition, game contests with prices, wild music performances and many interesting visitors.</p>
<p>Now in the dirty thirties, he starts combining the work (money) and the love (hiphop), moving into an office with karin at subotage.com he produces a website and most tour posters and deejays on some of the concerts. Audiovisually supporting the Live-demo team on their events, and doing freelance jobs from time to time for interesting clients.</p>
<p>in 2005 he moved together with Asa, his beloved kungfu girl. she's a visual artist, doin visual design, filming, editing ... and in her work, you will sometimes find one of his typos or maybe you'll find some of her artwork in his design. he spent half a year in capetown and got married to his wife there. now they are on the way to beijing to make some new experiences and collaborations.</p>

<p>Hydrolysis processes</p>
<p>Fermentable sugars can be obtained by hydrolizing amylose, cellulose and other polymers into sugars that can be utilized to displace petroleum as a feedstock in a growing variety of manufacturing processes. Today fermentable sugars such as glucose are being produced from starch (e.g. corn and wheat) to produce ethanol, polyesters and plastics. It is anticipated that even larger quantities of glucose will be available from lignocellulosic materials such as agricultural biomass (e.g. sugar cane bagasse, corn stover, wheat straw, citrus peels, wood chips, and switch grass to name but a few).</p>
<p>If we are able to unlock abundant quantities of low cost sugars from renewable resources such as those highlighted above we will be able to reduce our dependency on petroleum. Additionally, such energy is renewable and can be grown and produced in every country making the world a greener, safer place to live.</p>
<p>Amylose (CAS# 9005-82-7) is a linear polymer of glucose linked with mainly α(1→4) bonds. It can be made of several thousands of glucose units. It is one of the two components of starch, the other being amylopectin.</p>
<p>amylase works on the ends of the starch molecule, breaking it down into sugars.</p>
<p>The cellulose molecules are composed of long chains of beta-glucose molecules. In the hydrolysis process, these chains are broken down enzymatically using cellulases to unlock the sugar.</p>
