<p>Andrew Cuerden comes from South Africa and grew up in Zimbabwe. He decided he loved dancing when his sister forced him to dance at her 21st birthday; he was only 8 years old. He moved to England in the mid-90's to pursue a career in dance. Before this he made the painful decision between his two favourite pastimes: dancing and rugby! His amatuer career saw him reach fourth place in the England rankings.</p>
<p>2005 was a pivitol year for him. Along with professional partner Hanna Haarala he turned professional. They were also invited to join other professionals such as Lilia Kopylova and Darren Bennet in Strictly Come Dancing 3. Andrew was partnered with Holby City star Jaye Jacobs but they only reached the second show being voted out on the week they performed their rumba.</p>

<p>Brett Jarvis is an ex-football player from Iowa State University. He is somewhat of a folk hero to those on the ISU campus. With no spec of athletic talent, a nit-picking negative attitude, and a heart of gold, Brett Jarvis quickly became a fan favorite to the Cyclone faithful. Fan clubs and forums have been filled with jarvis followers (most notably the Holy Brotherhood of Triple J). He is a hero to many, including Alex Ernst, Matt Berg, Matt Scribbins, and Justin Lillie. While he only had one play vs. Oklahoma State, his legend lives on as he has inspired many young walk-ons to stick it out and play for the love of the game.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-31_c874.html" title="Edit section: Fermentable sugars">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fermentable sugars</span></h2>
<p>Hydrolysis processes</p>
<p>Fermentable sugars can be obtained by hydrolizing amylose, cellulose and other polymers into sugars that can be utilized to displace petroleum as a feedstock in a growing variety of manufacturing processes. Today fermentable sugars such as glucose are being produced from starch (e.g. corn and wheat) to produce ethanol, polyesters and plastics. It is anticipated that even larger quantities of glucose will be available from cellulosic materials (e.g. agricultural biomass such as sugar cane bagasse, corn stover, wheat straw, citrus peels, wood chips, and switch grass).</p>
<p>If we are able to unlock abundant quantities of low cost sugars from renewable resources such as those highlighted above we will be able to reduce our dependency on petroleum. Additionally, such energy is renewable and can be grown and produced in every country making the world a greener, safer place to live.</p>
<p>Amylose (CAS# 9005-82-7) is a linear polymer of glucose linked with mainly α(1→4) bonds. It can be made of several thousands of glucose units. It is one of the two components of starch, the other being amylopectin. Amylase works on the ends of the starch molecule, breaking it down into sugars.</p>
<p>Cellulose(C6H10O5)n is a long-chain polymeric polysaccharide carbohydrate, of beta-glucose. It forms the primary structural component of green plants. The primary cell wall of green plants is made primarily of cellulose; the secondary wall contains cellulose with variable amounts of lignin. Lignin and cellulose, considered together, are termed lignocellulose, which (as wood) is the most common biopolymer on Earth. In the hydrolysis process, these chains are broken down enzymatically to unlock the sugar.</p>
<p>Companies such as Dyadic International, Inc. (AMEX: DIL) are applying its technologies to produce enzymes for use in converting various agricultural products (e.g. corn) and waste products (e.g. switch grass, wheat straw, sugar cane bagasse, etc.) into fermentable sugars, which can then be used in the production of traditional and cellulosic ethanol as well as other products currently derived from petroleum.</p>
<p>With the advent of genetic engineering and genomics, companies like Dyadic with its C1 Host Technology [1], and Genencor and Novozymes, can develop and manufacture large volumes of new and better performing enzyme mixtures to make the production of cellulosic ethanol more economical.</p>

<p>San Marcos Baptist Academy story began December 20, 1905, when the Rev. M. E. Hudson, a pastor in San Marcos, and the Rev. J. B. Holt spoke at a meeting in Lockhart on the need for a Baptist school in the southwestern area of the state. After their speeches, the Rev. T. J. Dodson, a pastor from Seguin, moved that the Baptists of Southwest Texas establish a school and that an educational rally be held in San Marcos on January 18, 1906.</p>
<p>At the rally, a committee was appointed to visit towns to secure bids for the contemplated school. The committee visited San Marcos, Lockhart, Seguin, Gonzales, Corpus Christi, and San Antonio.</p>
<p>Bids were opened at a meeting held in San Antonio, March 15 - 18, 1906. On the recommendation of Dr. J. B. Gambrell and Dr. J. M. Carroll, the committee agreed to establish an Academy in San Marcos.</p>
<p>The placement committee promised the City of San Marcos that if the citizens raised $13,000, the Baptists of Southwest Texas would raise a similar amount, giving a total of $26,000 for the school. On July 16, 1906, this proposition was accepted by the San Marcos citizens, and fifty-seven acres of land in the most scenic section of San Marcos were given for the campus.</p>
<p>Dr. J.M. Carroll, founder and first president of SMBA.</p>
<p>Dr. Carroll was asked to visit San Marcos to make a speech and counsel with the citizens on ways to raise their promised funds for the school. At a mass meeting on the courthouse lawn, Dr. Carroll pointed out the advantages of a properly financed Baptist Academy. He estimated the cost would be at least $50,000. At his suggestion, the $13,000 pledge was raised to $25,000, and the denomination was to match that amount. The Business Men's Club of San Marcos adopted his suggestion and elected him president of the proposed school and leader of the forces to raise funds.</p>
<p>In San Marcos on September 19, 1906, trustees were elected by the Conference of Southwest Texas Baptists. In their first meeting they ratified the action of the San Marcos Business Men's Club by electing Dr. J. M. Carroll as the first president of the San Marcos Baptist Academy.</p>
<p>On January 22, 1907, Dr. Carroll submitted general plans and specifications for the first building, which was approved on April 9 of that same year. On July 10, 1907, the cornerstone of the first building, eventually named Carroll Hall, was guided into place by Dr. Carroll's daughter, Edna Mae. The original Carroll Hall, first building erected on the Academy campus.</p>
<p>The original charter was enacted under the laws of the State of Texas on July 10, 1907, at which time the trustees were elected by the Baptists of Southwest Texas. At the request of the Board of Trustees, the Academy was passed to the patronage of the Baptist General Convention of Texas in the fall of 1910.</p>
<p>By the time Carroll Hall was completed, the contributions from the citizens of San Marcos had reached $40,000, almost doubling their original pledge. The history of San Marcos Baptist Academy cannot be written without recognizing the devotion, generosity, and loyalty of the citizens of San Marcos.</p>
<p>San Marcos Baptist Academy opened its doors for the first day of school on September 24, 1908, with an enrollment of 200; by the close of the first year, the enrollment was 277 including day students. Eleven students graduated that first year.</p>
<p>Dr. J. R. Pentuff was the first dean and he had thirteen faculty members. Originally the curriculum was organized into a program of study that consisted of the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades in the preparatory department and four years of high school. In the high school program of studies, students were required to complete four years of Latin for graduation. During the 1908-1909 term, a band was organized. The policy was to provide for aesthetic as well as spiritual, social, and academic training. It was Miss Edna Mae Carroll who selected the green and purple of the mountain laurel as the Academy colors. The June 1, 1911, "Blue and White," a publication of the Eleutherion and Carroll Literary Societies, included the first mention of Academy athletes with pictures of that year's football and baseball teams.</p>
<p>The administration of Dr. Carroll, who resigned in 1911, is credited with the erection of four permanent buildings, the securing of a well-trained Christian faculty, and the enrollment of a student body of more than 200 annually. His tasks were tremendous and his achievements extraordinary, opening the door to an even greater future. The student body and faculty may have been small, but it became a close-knit family of friends and fellow Christians.</p>
<p>As successor to Dr. Carroll in 1911, the Board of Trustees turned to one of their own charter members, Professor Thomas G. Harris, who had served as president of the Southwest Texas Normal School, now Southwest Texas State University. During Dr. Harris' administration, the Academy was placed on the list of accredited schools by the Secondary Commission of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.</p>
<p>In 1913, the Board of Trustees created the position of Vice President and Field representative. Dr. B. A. Copass was chosen for this position to raise funds to liquidate the indebtedness against the Academy. He served as a solicitor for both money and students, and it was largely due to his service that the Academy's indebtedness of $110,105 was liquidated. When President Harris terminated his five-year administration in January, 1916, prospects for the future of the Academy were bright.</p>
<p>Professor J. V. Brown, superintendent of schools of Dothan, Alabama, was unanimously elected as the third president of the Academy by the Board of Trustees. The administration of President Brown was marked by expansion in several directions: the campus was enlarged, buildings were erected, the faculty was increased, and the curriculum was broadened. During that same year a two story frame residence, situated across the street from Carroll Hall, was purchased at a cost of $4,500 to be used as a home for the president. One of the military companies was the Academy band, a tradition which continues today.</p>
<p>With the military spirit pervading America in the war year of 1917, the Academy launched its program of military training. The United States granted the Academy a Junior Unit of the Reserve Officers Training Corps. Immediately, the uniform and the discipline of military life became part of the life of the students of San Marcos Baptist Academy, instilling self-discipline, patriotism, leadership, and responsibility. The Academy is currently recognized by the Army as an Honor Unit with Distinction.</p>
<p>Among the new buildings constructed while President Brown was in office were a frame building with adequate accommodations for the literary and fine arts departments, a twenty-bed hospital for boys, a fifteen-bed hospital for girls, and the laundry. In 1924, a $36,000 gift from Mr. H. L. Kokernot made possible a gymnasium, ultimately costing $60,000.</p>
<p>When President Brown resigned in the spring of 1926, the Board of Trustees elected as his successor a man who had been a member of the faculty since 1920, Colonel Jesse Franklin, the first member of the faculty to be elected to the position of president. Under his leadership, freshman college work was offered for several years by the Academy. The classes were conducted by the faculty of the Academy, and students completing the courses satisfactorily received credit toward a college degree. The Extension Bureau of the University of Texas authorized the organization of classes in mathematics, history, and Spanish. Baylor University authorized the organization of classes in English through the Extension Bureau. This program was discontinued after a brief time.</p>
<p>The next few years were critical ones at the Academy. Businesses were not prepared for the national economic crash which occurred in 1929. The enrollment dropped sharply as family incomes were reduced, and gifts were greatly curtailed. The academic standards of the school were maintained at the usual high level though serious financial difficulties began to arise, forcing the Academy into debt; and when President Franklin resigned in the Spring of 1931, the school was in serious financial condition.</p>
<p>Once again a citizen of San Marcos and a member of the faculty of Southwest Texas State Teachers College was enlisted by the Board of Trustees when they selected Dr. Raymond M. Cavness as president. The financial condition of the school was exceedingly poor; nevertheless, a renewed spirit of enthusiasm and optimism was created by the incoming administration. An excerpt from an article in the San Marcos Record on the occasion of the Silver Anniversary in 1932 stated: "The Academy is endorsed fully in educational and boarding school circles everywhere, and is distinctly and outstandingly a school of applied Christian training."</p>
<p>To meet a 25 percent reduction in enrollment due to the stress of the financial condition of the country, President Cavness made a number of adjustments in personnel, reducing the overhead expenses to correspond with the reduction in income. Neither the scope nor the standard of the curriculum was lessened, but fewer faculty members were needed. President Cavness and the Rev. R. L. Powell, former president of the Board of Trustees, toured Texas speaking to groups and raising money for the Academy.</p>
<p>President Cavness succeeded in operating the Academy within its income during his first year as administrator; however, the Academy could not continue to operate without assistance in carrying the weight of old obligations and its bonded indebtedness. During the next few years, help was received from the Baptist General Convention of Texas, from small endowments, and from the citizens and churches of San Marcos. In the heart of the Great Depression, the Academy operated in receivership with President Cavness serving as the receiver. Serious effort was made to work out the problems of the school and to remove the burden of indebtedness. Judge O. S. Lattimore, trustee president, made a loan of $10,000 of his personal money to help buy up the old obligations of the school. The school repaid Judge Lattimore as resources permitted with the final payment being made just two months before the Judge's death. Meanwhile, the Executive Board of the Convention assumed the bonded indebtedness against the Academy. The receivership order was dissolved in the July, 1936 term of the District Court in Hays County.</p>
<p>Just when there was some relief from the financial strain, new trouble sprang up to plague the Academy in the form of a fire resulting in an 85 percent loss of the Administration Hall on October 23, 1936. This hall, erected in 1919, contained all the classrooms for the secondary school. Once again, Judge Lattimore came to the aid of the Academy by underwriting $25,000 of the expense of constructing a new building. This, coupled with the insurance and the credit extended by the Executive Board of the Convention, made possible the construction of a new recitation hall, the first building of fireproof structure. It was opened for use on September 14, 1937, and named Lattimore Hall in memory of the late president of the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>Talbot Hall still stands today, in use by its current owners, Southwest Texas State University.</p>
<p>At this time Mrs. P. T. Talbot of San Marcos launched the Academy endowment fund with a gift of $200 to which two faculty members added $50 for a grand total of $300. From this beginning the endowment has slowly but steadily grown.</p>
<p>President Cavness resigned his position on May 1, 1943, to enter the naval forces of the United States. To succeed President Cavness, the Board elected Mr. Roy R. Kay, who assumed his administrative duties June 1, 1943. During his administration many improvements were made in faculty housing on the campus.</p>
<p>The operation of the school continued to be financially sound during President Kay's administration. The endowment fund grew from $4,650 to $25,671 during these years. A liberal contributor to this fund was Mrs. L. W. Alexander of Waco, a member of the Board of Trustees. Mr. Kay concluded his tenure on July 1, 1946.</p>
<p>Mr. R. Wilbur Herring assumed his duties as Academy president on August 14, 1946. President Herring appointed Mr. Hugh E. Proctor to serve as Dean of the Academy, beginning September 1, 1946. President Herring's administration ended with the close of the regular school session 1947.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Bruce Reed, formerly superintendent of the Alamo Heights School District in San Antonio, Texas, assumed the office of president on July 17, 1947. At the age of five, Dr. Reed had accompanied his father to the ceremonial laying of the cornerstone of Carroll Hall. He later attended the Academy in 1918-1919 and is the only former student to serve as president.</p>
<p>In 1948, the Chamber of Commerce of San Marcos purchased approximately three acres of land and donated it to the Academy for the purpose of erecting a dormitory for boys. It was opened in September, 1949, and named in honor of Mrs. L. W. Alexander, then president of the Board of Trustees. Abney Hall, another dormitory for boys, was dedicated in October, 1952. This building was named in honor of the late Dean Emeritus, J. E. Abney. September 15, 1955, was the date of the formal opening of Elizabeth Kokernot Hall, a dormitory for girls. This building was named in honor of Mrs. Herbert Kokernot, Sr., whose husband and son served the Academy faithfully as trustees and were generous in their support.</p>
<p>Dr. William H. Crook became president in June, 1960, and immediately set into motion plans which resulted in more improvements in less time than at any other period in Academy history. His first emphasis was to improve the quality of personnel by increasing remuneration and recruiting outstanding people. The years of Crook's administration also witnessed growth in enrollment, especially in the summer school.</p>
<p>The campus was expanded to approximately eighty acres, and a building program, which included numerous additions, as well as the rehabilitation of existing facilities, was inaugurated. A new academic building to be named Cavness-Reed Hall was constructed. The Sabre Bookstore and a new cadet dormitory were built. Upon completion of the dormitory, the trustees enthusiastically named it William H. Crook Hall. The dream of a new chapel was also resurrected, and the Tower of Prayer, as the first element in the chapel complex, was completed.</p>
<p>With excellence as the goal of all Academy programs, academics, student life, and Christian emphasis were strengthened during Dr. Crook's administration. His ideas, vision, and direction still influence the Academy today. He left the Academy in the summer of 1965 to serve his country in a number of posts, the last of which was the United States Ambassador to Australia.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1965, Jack Edwards Byrom became the Academy's tenth president, leaving the pastorate of the First Baptist Church in San Marcos. He began his work with the determination to build on the foundation which had been established so well by his nine predecessors, and to maintain the momentum which had been building in the immediate past. Dr. Byrom served as Academy president from 1965-1996.</p>
<p>Dr. Byrom's first appointment was to promote Assistant Dean Jimmie Scott to Dean of the Academy. Scott served faithfully and effectively through the years until his retirement in 1996.</p>
<p>The Academy, which was a charter member of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1913, and had long been accredited by the Texas Education Agency, was accredited by and received as a member of the Independent Schools Association of the Southwest on March 22, 1973. In that same year, the Academy was accepted into the membership of the National Association of Independent Schools.</p>
<p>A number of additions were made to the Academy's physical facilities during the early years of Byrom's tenure. Air conditioning was installed in the dormitories, the football stadium was enlarged and lights were added and a new president's house was remodeled. A dormitory for middle school boys was added and named for Mrs. Lorraine Derrick and Mrs. Ella Mae Wolfe, who for many years directed the dormitory program. The Thomas Library was built and dedicated to the memory of Jack and Florence Taylor Thomas whose children were among the first Academy students and gave the funds for this building. In 1973, the Robinson Christian Center was completed and dedicated in memory of John Harvey Robinson. It was made possible by contributions by his beloved wife, Velma.</p>
<p>After long and detailed negotiations with Southwest Texas State University, an agreement was reached to sell the campus to the University. The sale was closed on June 20, 1979, with the understanding that the Academy would occupy the old facilities while the new campus was planned and constructed. Ground was broken on the two hundred acre site, given by Mrs. Velma Robinson, on November 23, 1979. The move to the new campus started during the Christmas holidays in 1981, with spring semester classes beginning on the new campus January 18, 1982. The formal dedication ceremony of the new facilities was conducted on May 1 of that year with all the memorials from the old campus being rededicated.</p>
<p>"Onward Bound - Stage II" was the name given to a campaign for capital funds launched in the spring of 1980. The initial gift was made by Mrs. Robinson as a challenge to other friends to provide funds for a natatorium and military science facility. The response of many friends, including substantial grants from the Davidson Family Charitable Foundation, more than met the challenge. In the spring of 1982, the Davidson Natatorium was dedicated and ground was broken for the military science building on May 21, 1983. The new Academy campus continues to grow.</p>
<p>This giving program would be the prelude for a longer term program to enlarge the Academy's endowment. The endowment fund grew from $92,650 in 1965 to $1,075,000 in 1983. Onward Bound Stage III began in 1984 with the purpose of securing funds to increase the permanent endowment fund and to provide additions to the present facilities.</p>
<p>In the Fall of 1986 a Development Council was formed to "promote the overall development of San Marcos Baptist Academy." In 1987, the "Securing the Future Campaign," to further enlarge the Academy's Endowment Fund, was launched. With the completion of the campaign, the fund had more than tripled. Income from the endowments fund has allowed more students the opportunity to attend the Academy and has helped to carry on the tradition of excellence.</p>
<p>In the Fall of 1989, Academy girls were introduced to a new leadership program designed especially for them. The program was named COEDS. Created by Jo Quinn Long, the Dean of Girls, "COEDS" is an acronym standing for Community, Orientation, Enthusiasm, Discipline and Service.</p>
<p>The girls were divided into family groups much like the military companies. Leaders were chosen for the entire organization and for each family group. Through the years, this program has evolved into an organization that teaches the girls how to be leaders in school and in their community.</p>
<p>The Academy moved forward in academics during the Fall of 1993 with the beginning of the Carroll Scholars Honor Program. This accelerated honors program is designed to prepare students for the top colleges and universities in the country. These select students attend classes with a demanding curriculum combined with individualized instruction and technology assisted learning.</p>
<p>Following the initiation of the Carroll Program, Advanced Placement classes were added in the Fall of 1995 for students wanting an academic challenge with the opportunity to earn college credit upon completion of the course.</p>
<p>Technology at the Academy has grown tremendously in recent years allowing students access to more computers and current technology. In 1994, the Dr. Gwen K. Smith Technology Enriched Learning Center and the Kenneth Kendal King Information Technology Center opened. Teachers are now able to use these facilities for instruction, and students are allowed to use the computers throughout the day for their assignments. Also, during the nightly study hall, students with computers in their dormitory rooms are able to access reference materials from the library.</p>
<p>Other additions to the technology at the Academy include the addition of the Channel 1 News Network with televisions provided in each classroom, an integrated telephone system providing students, faculty and staff with voice mail and other features, and cable television, on a restricted basis, for all dormitories. In 1998, the campus upgraded its computer data lines to fiber optic and acquired DSL data lines for campus wide Internet access.</p>
<p>Upon his retirement, Dr. Byrom was named Chancellor of the Academy and also served as president of the SMBA Foundation. His successor was Dr. Paul W. Armes.</p>
<p>During Dr. Armes's administration, LTC Victor Schmidt moved from his position as commandant/dean of boys to serve as principal. In June of 2000, Mr. Schmidt was named executive vice president, working closely with Dr. Armes in directing the various Academy programs. Dr. Armes resigned early in 2001 to accept the presidency of Wayland Baptist University. Before naming a new president, the Board of Trustees conducted an extensive study of the Academy in order to lay out a plan for the future of the school search for the right leader to direct that plan. In November 2001, the Board named Victor Schmidt as the twelfth president of the Academy.</p>
<p>The history of the Academy is generously sprinkled with the names of those who have invested in this school and in the countless students whom it has served. The Academy is grateful to have an outstanding staff and faculty, dedicated trustees, a capable and enthusiastic student body, devoted alumni and friends, and the generous support of the Baptist General Convention of Texas. God has immeasurably blessed San Marcos Baptist Academy!</p>

<p>68.45.17.152 19:21, 30 May 2006 (UTC)Car coining is the act of tossing coins on the floor of a newly bought car to wish the owner luck. This practice seems to be limited to those of Italian descent living in Northern New Jersey. Family and friends of the new car-owner throw coins into the bottom of the car, or if it is someone who isn't trustworthy, they will tuck the coins into the car seats. The amont ranges from a little bit, to evey coin in that person's purse or pocket. It is a VERY happy occasion for everyone.68.45.17.152 19:21, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>doorwerth (also know as d'wood) is famous for it's beautyful nature and historic background. but now a days doorwerth has been taken over by what we call poekkie's.</p>
<p>they don't do a lot of working,and like to drink beer. word round the campfire is that if d'wood had a hashbar, some people would get filthy rich because of the huge amount of weed smokers in d'wood.</p>
<p>the historical part of d'wood has its roots deep in history, d'wood started as a place in the woods where the outcastst of the serounding villages met. it kept them out of hands from the sherif (ridder doodhout de 3e) so they called the place d'wood. low live trash is still to be found in d'wood,because this now is the aera of doorwerth where the less fortuned live.</p>
<p>in this century doorwerth only one time met distruction. this was during the second world war, when germany under command of the all mighty Führer invaded holland,and went for some weed to arnhem. where drugs was widely avaible, and cheap to buy.</p>
<p><br />
the geograpichal features of doorwerth are a fenomenon, the beauty of real forest,and a splendit view over the betuwe. this realy kicks a hell lot of ass. the best views are to be found on the duno and the hunnenschans. aspecialy in summertimes this is a real drugs heaven, because off the sheer beauty of it all.</p>
<p>so if ya'll plan at doing drugs, visit doorwerth,and head for the dunno/hunnenschans</p>

<p>American Singer/Songwriter, Radio Disc Jockey</p>
<p>Born in 1979 in Flint Michigan, Joshua Nathaniel Strickland began singing at church at a young age, and in 1994 co-founded the contemporary Christian pop/rock duo LASTDAZ, who recorded and performed for the next five years, including notable performances at the Icthus (Wilmore KY), Crossroads (Shelby OH) and True Love Waits (Durand MI) music festivals.</p>
<p>In 1998 Strickland began a successful radio career at Michigan radio station "Z 92.5 The Castle," (WJSZ-FM) whose unique 'no-format' format would eventually be that of the 2005 nationwide buzz format commonly referred to as "JACK." "Jukebox Josh" was heard in markets throughout Michigan, Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky until 2004 when he made the decision to incorporate his family name into his broadcasts.</p>
<p>In 2004, to coincide with the release of his first solo music project, entitled "July," "The Strickland Show" was launched on "Hot 96" (WSTO-FM) and at his official website, www.stricklandonline.com.</p>
<p>Strickland's "July," which is centralized around a divorce; he from his wife, that was finalized only 3 months prior to the release in July 2004, was succeeded in January 2006 by "On With The Story," the contents of which reference a variety of situations and scenereos, all unrelated to the subject matter of "July."</p>
<p>"41 Miles," the lead single from Strickland's "On With The Story," became a healing anthem for several Indiana and Kentucky towns following a sweep of devastating and deadly tornados in November of 2005. The song was written for one of the casualties, an 18 year old cheerleader in Boonville Indiana named Melinda Hadley.</p>
<p>"The Strickland Show" currently airs 2-6pm CST, weekdays on WSTO-FM. Strickland also hosts a special Sunday night program on "93.5 The Wolf" (WLFW-FM) from 6-12a CST under the alias "Joshua Nathaniel." Strickland has also used "JJ," "Josh Blank," and "Buckshot" as aliases in the past.</p>
<p>Strickland has won awards from the Associated Press and the Michigan Association of Broadcasters, including "Best Personality" in 2002. In 2005 Strickland was nominated for a Radio Music Award/Radio Megablast Award and WSTO-FM was nominated for Radio and Records CHR/Pop Station of the Year.</p>

<p><b>Recaldent</b>, scientifically known as <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/Calcium.html" title="Calcium">calcium</a> <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phosphopeptide.html" title="Phosphopeptide">phosphopeptide</a> - amphorous <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calcium_phosphate.html" title="Calcium phosphate">calcium phosphate</a></b>, is a compound derived from <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casein.html" title="Casein">casein</a>, the primary protein in <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cow.html" title="Cow">cow</a>'s <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milk.html" title="Milk">milk</a>.

Recaldent is often combined with <a href="../../../x/y/l/Xylitol.html" title="Xylitol">xylitol</a> for this purpose, as the sweet flavor of the xylitol will stimulate <a href="../../../s/a/l/Saliva.html" title="Saliva">saliva</a> flow, making the Recaldent more effective.</p>
<p>In addition to preventing and reversing demineralization of tooth surfaces, Recaldent is the active ingredient in a new "tooth regrowth" procedure used in Japan and Austrailia. The dental carries are cleaned with a <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser.html" title="Laser">laser</a> and then covered with a nanopourous <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dental_sealant.html" title="Dental sealant">dental sealant</a>, and the patient uses the tooth mousse containing Recaldent to encourage the tooth to regrow itself. In addition to being painless and requiring no <a href="../../../a/n/e/Anesthesia.html" title="Anesthesia">anesthesia</a>, this procedure creates a tooth surface that is nearly identical to the original tooth in both appearance and structure.</p>

<p>Like the pearls of oysters and giant clams, it is a shiny calcareous sphere. It is difficult to place a monetary value on a genuine coconut pearl, but the odds of finding one in a coconut are certainly less than one in a million.</p>
<p>The coconut pearl can form in the endosperm of the coconut in rare circumstances. It is estimated that only one pearl forms in every seven hundred and fifty thousand coconuts and they are rarely discovered when removing the endosperm as food.</p>
<p>In his classic six-volume work entitled Herbarium Amboinense, the distinguished 17th- 18th century naturalist Georg Eberhard Rumphius described and illustrated exquisite coconut pearls, often mounted in jeweled settings of gold and silver, owned by Malaysian dynasties.</p>

<p>TVTAD is a very good program to download files from RSS pages and launch the downlodaed files, at this moment the program only launch torrents and nzb files. TVTAD has very many loyal users and is one of the biggest torrent rss downloaders out there next to µTorrent. TVTAD stands for TvTorrents Auto Downloader and is very easy to use.</p>

<p>TVTAD was created by Kn00n and was not allways named TVTAD, the first name TVTAD had was BTGrappy, and was launched with the name. The other person who is in buissness with Kn00n is Jonas, he is the administrator next to Kn00n and is now his partner. However after Kn00n and Jonas figured out BTGrappy was so lame they tried to rename it, it was Jonas that figured out TVTAD, the name was like this because of the simplicity of the program and they wanted a name that was easy to remember.</p>

<p>TVTAD works by reading RSS pages. The way they do it is by having a Favourites section that they can add program names in. TVTAD then fetches the RSS pages added and looks for the program name in those feeds (rss pages). Then the program download the file which is inside the feed header and launch it with the program choosen, then the program that is launched do the rest (like downloading the file that the torrent links to).</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../k/n/u/Knuckles_Chaotix_46b3.html" title="Knuckles Chaotix">Knuckles Chaotix</a>, when a player inputted a certain cheat code, A level select menu with different options would appear. One of the options would let you select a character for gameplay. one of these characters was entitled '**********'. When selected, this character would appear as a grey-yellow-and-red Knuckles. This strange, unused character was dubbed 'Wechnia' by fan communities. The character uses Mighty's moveset. A theory has surfaced, stating that this character was intended to be Tails "Miles" Prower because he comes right after Mighty (a character that's almost identical to <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_The_Hedgehog_9c38.html" title="Sonic The Hedgehog">Sonic The Hedgehog</a>, Tails' close friend.) Still, lots have to be uncovered by this somewhat unfinished character.</p>
