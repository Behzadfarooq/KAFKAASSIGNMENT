<p>I recognize the fact that you doubters are unfamiliar with frizbeer, and I would venture to say you are older than the targeted age for this game. It's popularity is growing exponentially and there is no reason it should not be permitted on Wikipedia. Does this need to be a "household" drinking game before it earns a spot on Wikipedia, or can this up and coming game continue to spread in popularity with the aid of Wikipedia? Give it a chance before you judge.--Elrez 02:33, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I searched "frisbee drinking games" on Google and came across more than a dozen games that have rules either identical or undeniably similar to those listed on this page. I think it is the word 'Frizbeer' that is getting everyone so uptight. Chances are that when the "houston skyline" was listed on wikipedia, the actual name was not as popular but I sure as hell bet the drink combination was wildly popular.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Latani6 (<a href="../../../l/a/t/User_talk%7ELatani6_9d16.html" title="User talk:Latani6">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Latani6_4b4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Latani6">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<p>This article is an informative article explaining to people how to play a very fun and popular drinking game. Drinking games are like ancient oral history; you're not going to find out how to play them in the newspaper, but from friends and family. Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia, which allows anyone to get better acquainted with the world they live in. What separates Wikipedia from other encyclopedias is that it allows anyone to edit it, which in turn allows people to learn more about local histories than ever before. There are no pranks or jokes in this article, by deleting this article all that is happening is people are not being updated on the current social situation.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Plokloon (<a href="../../../p/l/o/User_talk%7EPlokloon_d2e9.html" title="User talk:Plokloon">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Plokloon_97d2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Plokloon">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>It would be nice if it worked like that, but we can't allow people to just add anything if there's no way to verify it. We can't just take your word for it, we need concrete evidence. Otherwise we'd end up with more hoax articles than real ones. It's not ideal, but that's the way things are. If you can't provide verification, the article has to go. If there is evidence of it under a different name, prehaps you should request that the article be moved instead, but it's not going to be kept under the current name. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 22:22, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
