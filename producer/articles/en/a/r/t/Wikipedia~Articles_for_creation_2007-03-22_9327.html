<p>Bronte Ammundsen is an amazing person. She is commonl known as 'Silver', short for 'Silverwings'. Bronte discovered a diamond mine at age 7. This was the first significant thing she did. She, and fellow friends Samantha M. and Jordan P., got all of the diamonds out, and donated all $369 898 387 they found. More than 300 million dollars. This was, of course, Bronte's idea. At age 8, brotne did yet another significant thing. She produced and dirceted an animatd movie, using the voices of her fellow friends. The movie was open for the public, by the name of 'Barry Trotter'.</p>
<p>Bronte was born on the 29th of February, 1863. Bronte has made this world a better place, planting trees for oxygen, discovering new theories of photosynthesis, and proved many of Isaac Newton's laws of relativety.</p>

<p><b>Lisa Oldfield</b> (born 16th January, 1976) is a television personality and the wife of former <i>One Nation</i> politician and <i>Celebrity Survivor</i> contestant David Oldfield.</p>
<p>As a child, Oldfield suffered from low self-esteem and engaged in disruptive behaviour. Subsequently, she was expelled from two private schools. However, she went to graduate from high school with a HSC result of 98.65 and completed a Bachelor of Business at the University of Technology, Sydney.</p>
<p>In 2002, Oldfield was diagnosed with facial skin cancer. This led to a year long battle with depression. She credits her husband for saving her. She has been in remission for the past three years.</p>
<p>Currently, she is one of four co-hosts of Channel Nine's new daytime show <i>The Catch-Up</i>. The show may be axed due to poor ratings. This comes after Channel Nine producers were shocked about Lisa's on-air revelations about her former illegal drug abuse.</p>
<p>Lisa also works as the Sales Director of a successful Australian software company.</p>

D.Z.K. is a white American Independent Rapper from Washington D.C. metro area. His rap songs are mostly original but a few are make heavy use of other popular songs for remixes much like Weird Al Y. D.Z.K.'s best-known song is "Haley" from his first album. It is a parody of "What's My Age Again" by punk band Blink-182. The song has used in the creation of several YTMNDs. The moniker D.Z.K. is believed to be the artist's initials but no formal explanation of this title has ever been given.</p>
<p>Despite great lyrical talent, the provocative and controversial content of his music makes him an unlikely candidate for a record deal in the near future.</p>

"Brandon Beck has the most home-run hits in the entire little league baseball team. He is some times called "Brandonious" because he is so good. Without brandon in school, we all can concentrate a lot easier in class. The spikes on his hair are tall enough to jump off of into a glass of water. He can do a rubik's cube in 1 minute. Thats how he is the best person in the world."- famous speech league writer CJO said during sections.</p>
<p>These words are now popular to speakers all over minnesota.</p>

Oregon Chai is a hot, tea based beverage prepared with steamed milk, vanilla, a sweetner (usually sugar, or honey) and other spices. It is distinct from Chais deriving directly from the Indian subcontinent because the dominance of spices like cardamon, pepper, and nutmeg, are muted. Some confusion exists, because Oregon Chai is also a brand name, but the term has become to suggest any Westernized version of the Chai. Nearly any "Chai Latte" ordered at a coffee chain is probably more kin to the sweeter Oregon then true spicy Indian Chai.</p>

<p>Title: The H-Block Song Lyrics by: Francie Brolly Recorded by: 1916, Adelante, Eire Shaor, Podgie and Shebeen Category: Internment and Prison Protest and The Troubles This material might be copyrighted. We do not claim copyrights to any lyrics. All song rights and copyrights belong to respective authors. Inform if us if your rights are violated.</p>
<p><br />
Copyright Statement I am a proud young Irishman. In Ulster's hills my life began; A happy boy through green fields ran; I kept God's and man's laws. But when my age was barely ten My country's wrongs were told again. By tens of thousands marching men And my heart stirred to the cause.</p>
<p>So I'll wear no convict's uniform Nor meekly serve my time That Britain might brand lreland's fight Eight hundred years of crime.</p>
<p>I learned of centuries of strife, Of cruel laws, injustice rife; I saw now in my own young life The fruits of foreign sway: Protestors threatened, tortured, maimed, Divisions nurtured, passions flamed, Outrage provoked, right's cause defamed; That is the conqueror's way.</p>
<p>Descended from proud Connacht clan, Concannon served cruel Britain's plan; Man' s inhumanity to man Had spawned a trusty slave. No strangers are these bolts and locks, No new design these dark H-Blocks, Black Cromwell lives while Mason stalks; The bully taunts the brave.</p>
<p>Does Britain need a thousand years Of protest, riot, death and tears, Or will this past decade of fears Of eighty decades spell An end to Ireland's agony, New hope for human dignity; And will the last obscenity Be this grim H-Block cell?</p>

<p>Follow these three steps to fill out this form: --&gt;</p>
<p>Seminole State College is a 2 years college located in Seminole, Oklahoma.</p>
<p><b>Bold text</b>History</p>
<p>Seminole “Junior” College was first established as the 13th and 14th grades of Seminole High School in 1931, under state laws which permitted such community junior colleges. The late Dr. John G. Mitchell organized the college when he came to Seminole to serve as superintendent of the public school system.</p>
<p>The new community junior college opened in September, 1931 under Mitchell’s leadership. Seminole High School principal Dr. O.D. Johns served as the first Dean. The college reached its peak enrollment of that decade in the 1938-39 academic year with 150 students.</p>
<p>Seminole Junior College continued to operate as an extension of the local high school, with classes being held on the third floor of the high school building, through the 1960s. Seminole High School superintendents served as presidents, principals as deans, and the school board acted as the governing board. In 1969, the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education recommended the development of a state-supported junior college which would be separate from the local high school.</p>
<p>Responding to the challenge, Seminole citizens worked with state and local leaders to develop Seminole Junior College. Dr. Elmer Tanner was employed as the “new” college’s first president.</p>
<p>During the 1969-70 academic year, classes met in the First Presbyterian Church of Seminole while the first classroom building was being constructed on a new campus on the northwest side of town.</p>
<p>The community continued its support for the new college by approving a $250,000 bond issue by an 8 to 1 margin to help finance the facility. In addition, a one-cent city sales tax was also approved to help support the college until 1975, when SJC became a fully state-supported institution. At the time, Seminole was the only community in the state of Oklahoma to ever impose a sales tax on itself for the support of a college.</p>
<p>The city purchased a 40-acre tract of land located on the northwest corner of town, at the intersection of State Highway 9 and State Highway 270, and donated it to the college.</p>
<p>Seventy-five years later, Seminole State College stands as a tribute to the vision of these early educators and to the tenacity of community and state leaders who fought to keep and build a community college in Seminole.</p>
<p>Now standing on an 82-acre campus, the college is composed of 12 buildings, has an annual fall enrollment of over 2,200 students, employs 125 individuals full-time, and operates on an annual budget of over $15 million.</p>

Founded in 1901, Delta Omicron Tau sought to establish a society for women in which social functions were predominant. While still largely a social organization, Delta has incorporated scholarship, community service and diversity as goals. With approximately 40 members, Deltas do not participate in only the Greek system, but in nearly every other part of the campus community from Residence Life and Intercollegiate Athletics to Glee Club and ASOC Senate. Delta houses 11 members and serves as a meeting place and location for events. Generous and helpful alumni add a supportive element to Delta. Beyond the activities and goals are the members themselves sharing friendship and laughter that define Delta Omicron Tau.</p>

<p>Re:Arrange is a Comic/Script like comic made by, Nicholas Scarola. It is about 3 students attending a school for the possibility of an attack from the neighboring rival country's attack. The main character's name is, Rael Naori, Chory Arcor, and Reka (last name has been undisclosed for now). The name, Re:Arrange derives from, Re: meaning, in an email when u have sent your message to someone and send it back you receive a RE: in the subject of the message. The comic is supposably to have 3 different view points. Each with a new name to go along Re:Arrange is the first of the three and supposably the longest running.

<p>Taemon is one of 1,050 pokemon, but more to see to be a pokemon master is my destiny. Taemon takes the form of a solid, liquid, and gas which makes this pokemon hard to defeat. When taking the form of a liquid it evolves to Diamon. When in gas form it is referred to as Fartamon. Creating this pocket monster is very easy. Each pokemon can create its very own Taemon. Taemon comes from the Philippines root word TAE. Taemon has very strong attack moves like the Gag Reflex and the Stink Bomb. When the Stick Bomb is used the trainer may use the Gag Reflex which causes the pokemon to faint instantly. Taemon has no weakness because of its ability to become a solid, liquid, and a gas. It's weight varies as well as its hight. It is rumored that Taemon will be in the upcoming game, Pokemon Coal, which is predicted to be released early December 2007 B.C.</p>

<p>Rabindra Tiwary * &amp; Anand Suman**</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION. DNA testing is a powerful technology that has revolutionized our traditional criminal judicature. It has a great contribution for crime detection and investigation and its application in our criminal judicature is indispensable in view of the rising crime in the new millennium. The technique covers all basic methodology, which is made applicable for the detection of crime by analysis and comparison of a wide variety of physical clues associated with a suspected event. It is in some ways a boon because it permitted almost every person on this planet to be identified uniquely since no two individuals can have an identical DNA pattern except identical twins. It is this difference that DNA testing relies on to distinguish one individual from another. There are three main types at DNA testing i.e. Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism Testing (RFLPT) Which is best used on large, unadulterated or untarnished samples, Polymerise Chain Reaction Testing- Nuclear DNA is used on smaller and less prestine samples and Polymerase chain Reaction Testing- Mitochondrial DNA is used to link a sample to a particular family since mitochondria is passed from a mother to his offspring. This type of testing can be used on extremely old or damaged samples. The DNA testing technology has got a plethora of application in many fields including legal fields. It can act as an important investigative tool in criminal cases in confirming the guilt or innocence of suspects of crime. A variety of offences such as murder, rape, exchange of baby, cases related to maintenance u/s 125 Cr.P.C., armed robbery, extortion and drug trafficking yield themselves to the application of DNA collection and testing. Evidentiary value of DNA testing DNA technology has provided great support to the legal community by giving a hand to resolve the criminal cases besides civil disputes, such as, paternity disputes. The various</p>

<pre>
provisions stipulated in the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Indian Evidence Act, the Constitution of India make the DNA test reliable in the eyes of Indian criminal judicature.
</pre>
<p>Section 53 of the Code of Criminal Procedure enables a police officer to compel an arrested person to undergo a medical examination with a view to facilitate investigation. Through Cr.P.C. (Amendment) Act, 2005 explanation in section-53 was inserted which provides that "examination" shall include the examination of blood.... by the use of modern and scientific techniques including DNA profiling.... But, here question arises whether to compel an accused person in custody U/S-53 of Cr. P.C. to submit himself for medical examination is violation of Art -20(3) of the Indian constitution. In a very landmark judgment of State of Bombay Vs Kathi kalu1, The supreme court has concluded that to be a witness against himself i.e. Art. 20(3), only applies to cases wherein the accused is compelled to give information against him based on his personal knowledge. If this is criterion is applied it would not be difficult to take DNA testing as admissible evidence in court. The law commission after considering the aforesaid decision has also expressed the view that the decision has the effect of confining the privilege under Art-20(3) to only testimony written or oral. Section 293(1) of the cr.p.c. also makes the provision that reports of certain government scientific experts upon any matter or thing submitted to him for examination or analysis may be used as evidence in any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this code. Section- 45 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872 recognizes the DNA testing technology in a view that the opinion of persons specially skilled in some science, art, foreign law, identity of handwriting and finger impressions is relevant. Other reasons for reliability on DNA testing In addition to the various provisions stipulated in the constitution of India, the Indian Evidence Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure, the under mentioned reasons also make the DNA test reliable in the eyes of Indian criminal judicature DNA testing, if properly performed is beyond any doubt which is there on the conduct of Indian police and prosecutors because of their history of fabricating and padding evidence. Therefore it is in favour of the judiciary to rely on DNA testing technology if</p>
<hr />
<p>1.1964 (2) Cri. L.J. 856 the same is conducted with proper care and caution. There is a fundamental difference between how DNA evidence is presented and how other kinds of identification/identity evidence are presented in a court of law. A DNA fingerprint expert gives an opinion, usually by stating that he/she is certain that the sample belongs to the person/accused. But on the other hand the DNA expert gives an opinion by presenting the evidence in the form of a numerical statement known as a "matching probability." The difference has more to do with the fact that unlike DNA evidence, earlier types of identification evidence are not derived from coherent body of data and statistical reasoning. The court on its own would be unable to form proper opinions if cases are related to science and technology and an expert helps in approaching to the conclusion. An expert witness is one who is skilled or has acquired special experience in any particular art, trade or profession by making a special study of the subject. But the court does not form an opinion only to see laboratory reports made by the expert. The examination of experts in the court is must and without giving opinion in the court, the evidentiary value of that laboratory report is a bib zero except in certain circumstances. Moreover, the experts have also gone through cross-examination, which gives a strong support in finding true conclusion. Thus by conducting examination and cross-examination in the court, the judiciary can rely on DNA testing technology. Challenges Apart from the various reasons for reliability of DNA evidence, this evidence is facing certain problems also. Firstly, of the 3.3 billion base pairs that make up a human blueprint, approximately 3 million differ between any two individuals. It simply means that for purposes of forensic DNA testing, scientists do not read all letter sequences and therefore a question of uncertainity always comes into picture. Secondly, the laboratory environment and its procedures are not foolproof. A constant danger in any laboratory is cross-examination between probe DNA and sample DNA or between two samples of DNAs. Contamination is the rule rather than the exception in forensic samples, a factor that simply is not tolerated in the normal laboratory environment. Thirdly, Collection of samples at a scene of crime requires some skill and observance of basic rules. Now a days when criminals are much more alert, there is always a possibility that an intelligent and expert investigating officer inadvertently commit mistake. Moreover there is always a chance of lackness in colleting materials from the crime scene. There is also a distinct possibility that several persons having left their DNA behind in a scene of crime. The need, therefore, is to identity all visitors and collecting their samples also (apart from those of the victim/suspect). Thus this becomes a doubtful process and challenges the adaptation of DNA testing as evidence.</p>
<pre>
                       Fourthly, Another problem is degradation of the sample from which DNA is to be extracted. Moisture along with high temperature can greatly damage DNA structure; DNA in a wet blood stains starts degrading within two days and a semen stain starts degrading within a week.
                       The other problem area is that there is always a possibility to change in chemical reaction of DNA samples. For instance, the forensic sample could have been removed from carpeting or clothing previously cleaned with detergents. The chemicals in the detergents can cause the restriction enzymes to cut the DNA at the wrong place, causing fragments to be different lengths than they would normally be thus, contamination can create misleading results contrary to the off-stated claims of the test's proponents that only a smear would result from the presence of contamination.
                       Sixthly, foundation of forensic science based on the premise "material objects will not lie" becomes meaningless because material objects are made to lie by certain men. The manipulation may be done in the laboratory findings under the pressure of highly influential members of the society. Again, in criminal investigations, the police collect biological evidence left at a crime scene to identify the perpetrator. There is always ample chance of destruction or manipulation of that evidences by police in collusion with criminals. Now, question arises up to what extent it has got the recognition in the courtroom. To answer this question we have to rely on judicial decisions. 
</pre>
<p>In the first wave of cases, judiciary is very hesitating to accept the DNA testing in view of the well-established principles of law. The landmark case in this regard, which really paved a way for judiciary to think on this burning issue, is the case of Gautam Kundu Vs</p>
<pre>
                     . State of West Bengal2 where the wife and minor daughter filed a petition for maintenance against the appellant under section125 of the Cr.P.C. The marriage between the parties was not denied, however, the paternity of the child was denied. Consequently, the liability to pay maintenance to the child was also denied. At that stage, the husband filed a petition for blood test of the minor and of himself as to prove that he was not the father of the child.
</pre>
<p>The moot question that crops up for determination was whether the court could direct the respondent to submit himself to the DNA test. The apex court, while reviewing the law prevailing in various foreign countries and the law prevailing in the country, ultimately deduced that where purpose of the application was nothing more than to avoid payment of maintenance, without making out any ground whatever to have recourse to the test, the application for blood test could not be accepted. It was also held that no adverse inference could be drawn against the person for refusal of giving blood sample for analysis. Going on the some track, the Hon’ ble Bombay High court in the care of Sadashiv Malikarjun Kheradkar Vs. Smt. Nandini Sadashiv Kheradkar3 also held that the court has power to direct blood examination but it should not be done as a matter of course or to have a roving inquiry. In the second ware of cases, expert testimony for the prosecution was rarely countered, and courts readily admitted DNA testing. In this series, the case of Sajeera Vs P.K. Salim4 can be taken into consideration for our purpose where the Hon'ble Kerala High court held that blood test is an important piece of evidence to determine the paternity of the child. Though by a blood test it cannot positively establish the paternity of the child, it can certainly exclude certain individual as the father of the child. Therefore, while the negative finding in a blood test is definite, the positive finding only indicates a possibility. However, the court relying on the judgment of Gautam Kunda Vs. state of West Bengal5 also said that without the consent of the person blood test couldn’t be conducted and there is no law in India enabling the court to compel any person to undergo blood test as available in England.</p>

</pre>
<p>In Syed Mohd. Ghouse Vs Noorunnisa Begum6 again the similar case of maintenance under section 125 of the code of criminal procedure was in question. Here the Hon'ble Andhra Pradesh High court (per T.C. Surya Rao, J.), rejected the impugned order of the lower court directing the respondent to submit himself to DNA test and expressed its faith on the judgment of Gautam Kundu case but went a step further that DNA test is not a developed test, which inclusively determines, with relevance to the gene characteristics, the paternity of a child. Court further held that if concerned person refuses to give blood sample without any valid reason the court is at liberty to draw the inference as a necessary corollary in sequel thereof. However, a full bench of the Hon'ble sc, in the case of Sharda Vs Dharmpal7 deduced some very comprehensive measures with regard to the collection of DNA from suspects in criminal cases. Speaking for the court Sinha, J. emphasized that DNA evidence should not be collected from suspects as a matter of routine unless the information is relevant to a specific crime in question. For example, it would be appropriate to obtain a DNA sample from a suspect where DNA evidence is left at the scene of the crime and the suspect's DNA is needed to prove the suspect's involvement. DNA should also not be collected from a suspect if investigators have no DNA evidence with which to compare the suspect's sample. When we take a turn from the old cases to recent cases, it appears that the judiciary is in favor of accepting DNA evidences. The case related to the Post- Godhra riots8 where DNA test nailed four killers. In this case the deceased Solanki was forcibly taken away by a group of people from near his residence in Vaghri- was on March 30, 2002, at around 10 pm. His body was found in a pit near Vankarvas on April 12, 2002. His body was cut into more than 30 pieces after which acid and salt were dumped on it. Police, along with a magistrate and other witnesses, dug up the place to recover the remains and called in forensic experts to check whether it was Solanki's body. The weapons used by the accused to kill Solanki were also found by the police from Venkarvas where they had been hidden. They include a butcher's knife (used by Mirza), a wooden stick (Ansari), a</p>
<pre>
                       ----------------------------------
                            6. 2001 Cri.L.J. 2028
                            7. (2003) 4 SCC 493 para 75
                       8.[Express News service, posted online, May 19, 2006]
                       hockey stick (Mehboob Husain ) and a sword (sheikh). Circumstantial evidence was taken into consideration and DNA samples taken from blood found on the weapons were matched with Solanki's DNA. 
</pre>
<p>Another glaring example is Priyadarshani Matto Murder case9 decided by the Delhi High Court on 17 October 2006. In this case, the Delhi High Court disagreed with the trial court's findings on the DNA report and went on to saying that there was no evidence of tampering with blood samples or proof that the procedure adopted for conducting the test at a laboratory in Hyderabad was erroneous and convicted the accused. Conclusion Keeping in mind all the facts stated above with regard to the evidentiary value of DNA testing, it would not be inadequate to say at this juncture that DNA testing has been acknowledged as the greatest breakthrough in existing justice delivery system because of the sheer magnitude of its impact on legal field. It is the most effective tool in the search for justice. It provides the prosecution with a way to finger suspects with a high degree of certainty and can exonerate others without the expense and suffering caused by trial. Due to this reason judiciary is in great favor of DNA testing technology which is very much evident from recent judicial trends. However, judiciary is prompted to accept this new technology not as a conclusive proof but as a supplemental tool to nail the culprit. In nutshell we can say that a DNA test is a compelling bit of evidence but not the final word in a criminal case.</p>

I am a student of Neuropsychology and recently came across an intriguing concept on mobility written by Shannon M. Hollsten, Ph.D. "The mobility instinct", as explained by Dr. Hollsten, describes how individuals have "instinctively pre-programmed circuitry for movement". The fascinating aspect of this innocuous white paper is the link between physical movement and cognitive evolution. It describes movement as an instinct, a "preconceived idea" or cognitive "reaction" rather than a physical response to external sensory input.</p>
<p>Dr. Hollsten is the President of a wheelchair company called SuperQuad. Her account of movement is as old as the lever, which probably accounts for her lever driven wheelchair! Obviously, she is interested in more than self-directed neuroplasticity, her company sells self-directed mobility as well. Both concepts (mobility and neuroplasticity) are subjects that deserve more attention. With the growth of the Baby Boomer population, she might sell a lot of those wheelchairs to people to value their independence and with a President like that, who wouldn't buy one!</p>
<p>Also, it appears as if Dr. Hollsten applied for a grant on a related subject under Steppingstones of Technology Innovation for Children with Disabilities. "The purpose of the grant is to build a self-initiated mobility device that increases the growth and maturation rate of both physical and cognitive development in disabled children". I sincerely hope someone is paying attention to this company and its President as the proposed outcomes of her study would be cutting edge in disability with support from strides in brain research, which is primarily fixated on adult disabilities rather than those of children.</p>
