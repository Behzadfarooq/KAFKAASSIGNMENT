<p>The result of the debate was <b>Redirect</b>. I didn't merge it as its all POV. I give up caring about this topic, so now you can be as London-centric as you want. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 02:48, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Just to explain why Squeakbox is listing this while voting to redirect: vfd for this page was suggested <a href="../../../u/k/_/Wikipedia_talk%7EUK_Wikipedians%27_notice_board_c7da.html#Charva" title="Wikipedia talk:UK Wikipedians' notice board">here</a> and there is an active dispute in progress as to how to make this article more npov. Some feel it should be deleted outright, and so listing here was suggested.

<li>Would prefer a <b>delete</b> but will settle for redirect. Despite its pretensions, the article makes no attempt to reference its claims and reads like a personal essay. There's barely a single assertion that can't be immediately questioned eg <i>Charvas often stay within their own 'clan', and gang fights can be common, again backing up the theory of mild US influence</i>. What is a charva 'clan'? Are their fights common or not? Whose theory are we talking about? How is their gang fighting a US-influenced phenomenon? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamsan_7def.html" title="User:Adamsan">adamsan</a> 21:40, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">Chav</a>. The word 'charva' is just a variant of 'chav' used mainly in the North East of England, and despite the extensive discussion on the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Talk%7ECharva_00a7.html" title="Talk:Charva">talk page</a> I remain to be convinced that it warrants its own article. <a href="../../../a/d/o/User%7EAdorableRuffian_c1ea.html" title="User:AdorableRuffian">AdorableRuffian</a> 21:44, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> with chav.. I have seen no evidence against the idea that charva is nothing but a regional variant of chav, and the POV issues here are so great (the article would be a stub if all the unverifiable POV were deleted) that we would benefit more from concentrating on a single article. BTW, we shouldn't keep bad articles because <i>others are doing it</i>. If there are articles on Islam with such amounts of POV, we should try to remedy that instead of making other articles as POV as them. <a href="../../../e/l/d/User%7EEldKatt_ef11.html" title="User:EldKatt">EldKatt</a> <small>(<a href="../../../e/l/d/User_talk%7EEldKatt_f6fd.html" title="User talk:EldKatt">Talk</a>)</small> 10:48, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b>. I agree with EldKatt, alleged POV somewhere is not an excuse for abuse (for it is far worse than just biased writing) here. It disturbs me that <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">User:Hedley</a> is taking this line. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 15:08, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> with <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">chav</a>. I've never quite understood why this merited a seperate article from <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">chav</a> in the first place. I've lost count of the number of different names I've heard depending on the part of the country being talked about. Neither "chav" or "charva" are the terms used where I come from, but "chav" is the one that's been picked up by the national media. While there may be regional variations I don't see that chavs of one part of the country are totally unrelated to charvas of another part. The article also has quite a POV problem: "<i>Charvas are widely thought in the North as the scum of British youth today.</i>" Presumably the charvas themselves don't take this view. The article's blanket statements about charvas almost remind me of the 1911 EB's country articles talking about the "national character" of somewhere. Compare "<i>Most charvas are considered to be unintelligent, and rarely show any intelligence that they may have, in order to look good around their mates.</i>", "<i>Socially charvas are seen as dis-obedient with a mind of their own.</i>" and "<i>Although some can be reasonable, most commit crimes.</i>", with "<i>If the Chinese character is inferior to the European, this inferiority lies in the fact that the Chinaman's whole philosophy of life disinclines him to change or to energetic action. He is industrious; but his industry is normally along the lines marked out by authority and tradition. He is brave; but his courage does not naturally seek an outlet in war.</i>" I think we'd do well to have all this stuff under one article so it can be kept in a reasonable state. No one is saying we can't talk about regional differences, so this is a merge, not a delete. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">Talk</a>) 18:18, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's a mischaractization. The issue here is sourcing and verifiability. The editors commenting above appear to be commenting on the fact that in fact <i>there is no</i> localization here, and that, regional pride in who had the concept first and whose spellings are the correct ones notwithstanding, there are no sources provided that make a distinction between the concepts of a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charva.html" title="Charva">charva</a> and a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">chav</a>.

<li><b>Comments</b>: There seems to be some confusion as to why this article is on VfD. I certainly didn't vote as I did because of the POV issues alone, as should be clear from my previous comments. I hope, and indeed believe, that nobody else did either. As of now, it's unlikely that I'll vote either way in the Ned VfD since I don't want to spend my time reading up on that term, but in the case of charva I hold the firm opinion that it's not different enough from chav to have its own article. The thing that could change that would be new facts being unearthed that point to more differences, but that hasn't happened yet. <a href="../../../e/l/d/User%7EEldKatt_ef11.html" title="User:EldKatt">EldKatt</a> <small>(<a href="../../../e/l/d/User_talk%7EEldKatt_f6fd.html" title="User talk:EldKatt">Talk</a>)</small> 07:58, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> redirect to Chav.--Ade myers 23:53, 24 July 2005 (UTC) The article tries but fails to convince me of the difference from Chavs. Although it does make a valid point about the rise in chav/charva culture due to post-industrial deprevation, especially in the North of England.</li>
