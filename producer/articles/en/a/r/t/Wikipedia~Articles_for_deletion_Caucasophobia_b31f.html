<li><b>Keep</b> As it was said in English language "Caucasophobia" is yet neologism. It is present in Russian language for along time though, and it is form of discrimination which is different from ordinary xenophobia (Check Russian search engines for Кавказофобия please). Being different from ordinary xenophobia the Caucasophobia shell be specified for a same reasons why anti-Semitism or phobia of Poles are considered (rightfully) a separate issue. Besides the term is already widely popular among critics of President Putin's regime, and is widespread in Russian publications(both mass-media and academicals) . Eventually it is used more and more often in English. Even if contains of “caucasophobia” will be deleted now it will become necessary to write something about it again. So what’s a point of removing the term only to put it back within few years if not few month?. <a href="../../../j/u/m/User%7EJumber_e4c8.html" title="User:Jumber">Jumber</a> 10:18 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>All what you have said does not change the fact that in English language (we are an English wikipedia, aren;t we?) it is a neologism. When this "eventualy" happen, then welcome the article. And the point is that wikipedia is not <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_ball.html" title="Crystal ball">crystal ball</a>.

<ul>
<li>The word is existing in English language already including very serious publications. Lets say someone will find it the “Migrantophobia, Caucasophobia and Anti-Semitism” address by Dr.Kohiro Matsuura director general of UNESCO or at the <a href="http://www.fsumonitor.com/stories/101802Russia.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.fsumonitor.com/stories/101802Russia.shtml" rel="nofollow">materials of UCSJ</a> or tons of other materials(see <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2005-15%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=Caucasophobia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2005-15%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=Caucasophobia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google</a>). Then some person who is studying the issue will turn to wikipedia to find out what caucasophobia actually means.. And will find nothing at all. Unless you will write the article again. It would be easier reediting it though.

The best example why wikipedia's policy is against original research: valid topic is turned into anti-Russian propaganda.

<li>I disagree. The both articles are extremely hostile for particlar ethnical group, in that case Caucasians who reside in Russia; and both article's blame those people for simply who they are.

<dd>Please type the word in any search engine, preferably the Russian version of it( Кавказофобия ). You will find that word many mainstream sources regarding Caucasian-Slavic relations . Many articles in Russian media or even academic researchers use the word as well. Apparently materials and articles containing the word <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasophobia.html" title="Caucasophobia">caucasophobia</a> will keep appearing in wikipedia articles, especially the ones regarding minority rights in Russia and conflict in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chechnya.html" title="Chechnya">Chechnya</a>.

<dd>I agree with you that Wikipedia should not become a load of personal social analyses of well-intending users. But that does not mean that Wikipedia can't describe what is happening out there. That's why we have articles like <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrophobia.html" title="Afrophobia">afrophobia</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">islamophobia</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html#See_also" title="Racism">what have you</a>. The worsening (how's that for a euphemism?) relations between the government of the Russian Federation and rebels in Chechnya has led to what can be described as <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasophobia.html" title="Caucasophobia">caucasophobia</a> among the people of Russia. I don't know if caucasophobia is the best word available. If there is a better word for it, the article should be moved to that title.

<li>Cleaned up version about the issue should be represented in WP, possibly in many articles, or, if in single article, under a different article name. This is neologism and non-English and should be <b>deleted</b> by definiton. Move and cleanup at a different name.

<li><b>Keep and Cleanup</b> This is a word transliterated from a Russian original that garners 1,000 Google hits (per Aecis), which seems a lot for a Russian slur. The fact that it isn't an everyday word in English is irrelevant. It is useful to have articles written in English describing non-Anglophone topics. Otherwise, whole realms of learning might be excluded here because a language barrier is making cross-cultural understanding tricky. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 02:31, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The neologism issue is something of an "idol of the marketplace" à la <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Bacon_d51b.html" title="Francis Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>, a logical confusion based only on the imperfection of language. Noone is disputing that the topic is generally legitimate, but only that "Caucasophobia" may not be acceptable as an English word, in which case something more long-winded but descriptive should suffice, e.g. Prejudice against Caucasians in Russia. Mikka and others have also argued that some of the content is incorrect or exxagerated, in which case it should simply be improved, not deleted entirely.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 07:34, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Is it possible to make an article under the Greek name in the English Wiki? If so, both "Caucasophobia" and Prejudice against Caucasians... could be redirects, the first on the ground that it is a reasonable transliteration. This way, a "new English word" would not be the main article title. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 08:51, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am not the specialist in Russian affairs(I came here through Nick's artistic page); but I see here are two problems: one is with some people who argue that the anti-caucasian discrimination does not exhist,and others argue that the world does not exhist at all. Now the word DOES exhist in English language so English wikipedia should have at least few sentence about what it means. Then users can be redirected at the page about discrimination of Caucasians. Conteins of that last page can be discussed. Erin23

<li>Wow! Somebody was complaining about "conspiracy thesis"..:) (<i>Unsigned comment by <a href="../../../k/n/u/User%7EKnutson_e603.html" title="User:Knutson">user:Knutson</a></i>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> You should not be surprised that "new people" are coming in; the contains of this article and the fact that it is about to be deleted was send around to few human rights groups who check the situation with Caucasians in Russia, and to some pro-Caucasian activists so you may expect some new guests and their opinion...But are we "guests" after creating the account?).About the discussion: I am surprised that someone was bold enough to put it at the deleting list! I mean-the word "caucasophobia" does exist, it does makes sense, it is available in the literature, and is even available in some dictionaries. As matter of fact it has two meanings: one is term to describe prejudice against Caucasian minority in Russia and another is a term used by American right-wing to describe the anti-white racism, which according to them is existing in the American society(would it be imaginary or real). To delete an article about the existing word simply because it hurts someone’s feelings is purely a vandalism! About the article itself: it is absolutely accurate observation if you ask me, but I can understand the hurt feeling who prefer to believe that problem does not exist. Anyway there are lot's of links provided to back the point, and most make sense(too bad many people here do not understand enough Russian).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Solution</b>: to keep the short explanation of Caucasiophobia here, and to create a link to the article about anti-Caucasian discrimination, where we can move this article and also some parts of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chechnya.html" title="Chechnya">Chechnya</a> section.And short note about "<b>conspiracy theory</b>". Accusing Western law enforcements and intelligence agencies ploting to conquer the World is a theory. Accusing <a href="../../../f/s/b/FSB_109a.html" title="FSB">FSB</a> and it's ancestor, the <a href="../../../k/g/b/KGB_8668.html" title="KGB">KGB</a> in the human rights violations isn't a "theory". It's a fact. Only recently FSB was officially blamed for two major criminal acts: the terrorist attack against Chechen poet <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yandarbiyev.html" title="Yandarbiyev">Yandarbiyev</a> in Qatar and attempted poisoning of the Ukrainian presidential candidate <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Yuschenko_9d43.html" title="Victor Yuschenko">Victor Yuschenko</a> with dioxine(spelling?). Plus here at this board one may fid tons of data about FSB being blamed for blowing up apartment blocks in Moscow in 1999 and 2000.(Just check <a href="../../../f/s/b/FSB_109a.html" title="FSB">FSB</a> or <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Chechen_War_66fe.html" title="Second Chechen War">Second Chechen War</a> surely enough <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> being a Russian patriot(assumption based on his profile) has another opinion.

<li>One minor detail Chechen "poet" Yandarbiyev was an international terrorist linked to Taliban and Al-Qaida ... he was official emissary sent by Chechen separatists to Mullah Omar and co. BTW To any sane person it is clear what "FSB being blamed for blowing up apartment blocks in Moscow in 1999 and 2000" is a conspiracy theory exactly of the same nature/credibility as conspiracy theories about CIA being behind September 11 attacks (the "evidence" for this is also abundant on the internet). The level of Russophobia desplayed here is rather disturbing. (<a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisenko_eead.html" title="User:Fisenko">Fisenko</a> 05:35, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC))</li>

<dd>Wrong assumption. Also, please be advised that wikipedia articles are not message boards to express opinions; they are about facts. Shall I start the Russophobia among Caucasian people that came to Moscow, but treat Muscovites as natural resource? Among any two nations that live by there are categories of people that hate each others. Former Soviet Union bragged it had over 100 nationalities. Shall we have 100x100=10,000 articles (and yes, multiplied by 2, for both direction of hate!) about how belarussians hated ukrainians, ukrainians hated belarussians, chukchi hated evenks, kyrghyz hated uzbeks, .....? Or shall we write a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proletarian_internationalism.html" title="Proletarian internationalism">proletarian internationalistic</a> one how everybody hated russians?

<p><b>Important note</b>: The content is changed according to the useful information(from your posts) and your suggestions <i>The text now begins with</i>: In North America where Caucasian refers to light complexioned people indigenous to, or descended from Europe, word caucasophobia is used mostly by American White supremacists, White separatists and afrophobes to describe the "anti-white racism", which according to them, is existing in the American society.</p>
<p>In common usage in the Europe, Asia and former USSR countries "Caucasian" is a collective term which refers to anyone descended from native ethnicities of Caucasus. Confusingly, in direct opposition to the most common colloquial English-language meaning of the word (so called "white-skinned" person in English meaning), the Russian language embeds certain stereotypes of Caucasian people. Typically, they are considered "dark", with nearly identically similar negative connotations to the Anglo-Saxon prejudice of "darkness" (<a href="http://www.tjetjenien.dk/baggrund/racism2.html" class="external free" title="http://www.tjetjenien.dk/baggrund/racism2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tjetjenien.dk/baggrund/racism2.html</a>) . Some people from the Caucaus refute these prejudices; others ignore them.</p>

<li><b>Rename</b> "Racism in Russia" would be better name for topic and more in line with many other Russia topic articles named "Economics in Russia", etc. A broader article could usefully compare with attitudes towards Central Asians, Chinese, Blacks, etc. in Russia. Note Кавказ means Caucasus (noun), so Кавказофобия should translate to Caucasusphobia. The translation as Caucasophobia unnecessarily conflates it with American racial issues, and is likely to attract additions on this unrelated topic.--<a href="../../../j/w/b/User%7EJWB_e997.html" title="User:JWB">JWB</a> 20:44, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
