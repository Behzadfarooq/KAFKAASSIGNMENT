<dd>Movie reviewers are generally good sources for something like "this film has a very similar theme to that film which was just released a little while ago", and statements like that are hardly ever disputed in real life. And if movie reviewers can't be used, then there are news articles on movies with similar themes and release dates, and there's no doubt at all that those can be used in footnotes, if the source is responsible. According to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, the question is over whether something <i>can</i> be sourced, not whether or not it has or hasn't been.

<p>In the second discussion, it was pointed out that this isn't some made up concept, but that the concept itself of films with similar themes and release dates was covered in a Washington Post article, as well as mentioned in dozens of reviews of these films.

<li>It's kind of pointless to have a "list of x" before we have an article on x itself. I wouldn't mind seeing an article about competing cinema trends, considering this list is aribitrarily defined, especially with sentences like "Sometimes, this may be coincidental as the result of two studios independently hoping to capitalize on a current trend." I don't think the idea of a "list of things coincidentally or otherwise competing against each other" should have its own article. Also, the fact that this is the third nomination shouldn't be precedent to end this discussion- a lot of good points were brought up last time. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 03:49, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I thought that it was supposed to be mentioned for procedural reasons if an article has been nominated before. I wasn't offering it as a reason to keep. My reason for keep is that a lot of editors have put a tremendous amount of work into fixing this article, and it's now a good article, with <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">good sources</a>. Also, I disagree with your logic that list of x is invalid if there's no article on x itself. Lists are often a far superior way to present information. Would you argue that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_baseball_nicknames.html" title="List of baseball nicknames">List of baseball nicknames</a> is inappropriate because baseball nicknames is not an article? --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 03:59, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Good sources? The only links in this article are to movie <i>reviews</i>.

<li>The only links are <i>not</i> to movie reviews. The Washington Post article at the bottom is simply not a movie review. Also, just because something is an opinion column or review doesn't mean everything in the column is unusable opinion.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> - there is no possible objective definition as to what constitutes a "similar theme." How many points of commonality constitute "a similar theme" and how is that determined without resorting to impermissible POV judgment calls? How much of a stretch is allowed? The list notes such films as "Lord of War," "The Last King of Scotland" and "Blood Diamond" as having similar themes based on their supposedly all being about "ambitious white protagonist[s] becoming involved in the violence of African politics" despite the films being about an arms dealer with clients around the world, a Scots doctor's relationship with Idi Amin and the Sierra Leone civil war, respectively. The films have similar themes only in a broad interpretation and that interpretation constitutes unacceptable POV. It describes "Flushed Away" and "Ratatouille" as being similar because they both have animated rats in them, despite one being set in a British sewer and the other in a Parisian restaurant. So many of the other items on the list suffer from similar problems that to simply remove them would result in a gutting of the list regardless. Additionally, there is no possible objective definition as to what constitutes "similar release dates." Most of the film pairings indicate that the films were released in different years. Some go so far as to capture films spanning from 2001 to 2006 and include remakes of earlier films as "similar." Given the incestuous nature of Hollywood it is unsurprising to find films with superficial similarities or minor thematic points in common, but that doesn't mean that such superficial similarities constitute encyclopedic information. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 21:06, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's why we're letting movie reviewers point these things out. Considering how frequently the media points out these things, sourcing should not be a problem. If it gets discussed in a movie review as being a similar theme and release date to another film, then it's not an original research issue, regardless of whether the films are two months apart or seven years, and there's no need for Wikipedia editors to invent their own criteria for exactly what "similarity" entails. Including all remakes, even ones decades apart, is an editing issue rather than any kind of <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion criteria</a>, and such things can easily be pruned out by normal editing processes. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 23:42, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The point is that the entire article as a concept suffers from irreparable NPOV issues.

I'm not familiar with the concept, can you point me toward some references which describe it? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 01:14, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The article does not appear to support the notion that there is a "trend" in Hollywood to release films with similar themes deliberately to compete with each other. Indeed, the article seems to indicate that studios don't like the idea of being the second to release a film with a similar theme, that it is an aberration for films to be marketed as the second similar film and that the conventional wisdom is that it's a bad idea. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 05:01, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If your concern is Eptin's statement that the "trend seems to only be getting more common" then I agree we should leave that out. But the WashPost article clearly delineates "a recurring phenomenon," if you're uncomfortable with the word "trend." When I read the list here, I think it already deals with your POV concerns pretty well. When a movie has significant differences as well as similarities, they are noted in the entry. But this sort of thing is really for the talk page, not for a deletion review. Theoretically, there <i>might</i> be a lot of POV concerns on a list like this; in actuality, it's not a significant problem. The list isn't flawed beyond the ability of a talk page to sort it out. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 05:15, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>What WaPo calls a "recurring phenomenon" I call a coincidence. And noting the differences IMHO exacerbates the POV problem rather than relieving it, since it requires editors to make subjective judgments as to what the differences and similarities are and whether the similarities outweigh the differences to a degree that allows or forbids exclusion. And I've already explained why appealing to movie reviewers or other external sources is problematic. Babe, Charlotte's Web and Animal Farm are all films about talking pigs. The Royal Tenenbaums and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre are both about dysfunctional families. I Spit on Your Grave and The Accused are both about women dealing with being raped. Yes these are extreme examples (and they're from different years, which for purposes of these examples is not the point) but some of the items currently on the list are also pretty big stretches to tie them together. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 05:50, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Since you believe the problem is so compelling that the article must be deleted entirely I find it odd that you're not siting examples from the list. Actually, i don't find it odd. The problems are theoretical -- in actuality, this list isn't causing the kind of problems you're worried about.</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is about neutral presentation. It doesn't say you hide differing viewpoints or delete articles that contain differing viewpoints, it says you present them neutrally. This article does a very good job of doing that. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 18:56, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Actually, I see above in your initial post that you do site examples you find problematic. I guess it just seems to me that the POV issues you're concerned with are adequately dealt with by including the rebuttal, i.e. "Both films are about rats but one is set in a Parisian restaurant and the other in a sewer system." or whatever. That's neutral presentation. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 19:01, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>But that's exactly the point. The very <i>existence</i> of this list is predicated on the notion that the similarities of the films are greater than their differences and that is inherently and fatally POV-pushing. If critic 1 says Films A and B are similar and critic 2 says they aren't then listing Films A and B on a "List of similar films" <i>at all</i> is giving undue weight to critic 1, even if the objections of critic 2 are noted. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 21:10, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I guess we'll have to agree to disagree here. To me the list just says the similarities are noteworthy. I don't think it suggests the similarities are <i>greater</i> than the differences. I mean, the differences are <i>always</i> greater than the similarities. But that's not what the list -- or this AfD discussion -- is about. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 21:38, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per the 40+ sources in the article and dozens more readily available and/or noted in this AFD. When articles have titles such as "Two Films, One Subject", it's a pretty good sign that the topic is real and receives real-world coverage. I don't know whether to laugh or cry at the notion that <i>movie reviews</i> cannot be used as sources for movies. Yes, they're opinions, but so's almost everything else in the world! Should we delete the <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanese_Civil_War_d0a5.html" title="Lebanese Civil War">Lebanese Civil War</a> article because the classification of violence from 1975-90 in Lebanon as a "civil war" was an opinion? The fact is that the English language includes words, concepts, and classifications that are delibaretly vague. There is nothing wrong with using movie reviews as a source for movies. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 03:42, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
