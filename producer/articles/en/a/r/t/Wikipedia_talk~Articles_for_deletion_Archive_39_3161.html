<h2><span class="mw-headline">Deleting a topic section on an article's Discussion page</span></h2>
<p>Might someone tell me how to delete a topic I started on an article's discussion page? I don't want the article itself deleted of course, I just want a topic section that I started to be deleted because I think it's wrong and misinformative and I want to take it back. I dropped "subst:prod|..." (with the proper brackets) into the section but was only mocked by Nigelj for doing so. How do I delete an article's discussion topic? Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>Hi again. For clarity, suppose for instance I wanted this very discussion topic section (i.e., "Deleting a topic section on an article's Discussion page") deleted. How would I go about that? Thanks a bunch.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Adding links to AfD "preloaded debate" template</span></h2>
<p>I have a list of several articles that were deleted or speedy deleted when a simple look at the page history, the talk page, the article log, and several other factors, such as "what links here", would have revealed important information that would have made a decision on deletion easier (eg. article turns out to be a recreation of a previous deletion; an old version of the article is salvageable and shouldn't be deleted; the article is an orphan). Is it not possible to change the "preloaded debate" template so that such links are included automatically? That might push the standard of debate up and prevent cases like the one I mention in the previous section. Would this be a good idea? I know people can do this research themselves, but having the links there would remind people that they should do this research before piling on to a vote without even reading the page in question. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 01:22, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>:{{la|{{{pg}}}}}</p>

<dd>That would then match what <a href="../../../t/f/d/Template%7ETfd2_f72b.html" title="Template:Tfd2">Template:Tfd2</a> does and I don't really see any reason <i>not</i> to do it. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:41, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's absolutely perfect! But the Afd, Afd1, Afd2 thing is confusing me. The AfD page says to use AfD1 template. How will people know to use this Afd2 template, or am I missing something about how these templates relate to each other? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 12:04, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I also found this has been done before. See <a href="../../../a/f/d/Template_talk%7EAfd2_cf29.html#Edit" title="Template talk:Afd2">Template_talk:Afd2#Edit</a>. I agree that the vote parameter is not needed. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 12:16, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>AfD1 goes on the article, AfD2 on the deletion sub-page, and AfD3 on the main articles for deletion page... basically AfD1 &amp; AfD3 link to/transclude AfD2, which is the 'main' template for the deletion discussion itself. The previous discussion of a similar change you cite doesn't seem to have gone far and was marred by also suggesting a built in 'vote' parameter - which as you noted, isn't really needed. I think it is worth trying the extra links for a while unless there are objections. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 20:06, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No objections from me. I also note that this sort of things is used in CSD templates as well. See <a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-meta_998e.html" title="Template:Db-meta">Template:Db-meta</a> for an example. Maybe a similar wording could be used on the AfD template? Along the lines of "Participants in the discussion, and the closing admin, should remember to check the article talk page, what links to the article, the page history of the article, and the page log for the article." <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 01:14, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I had previously seen articles which I felt were helpful on the Online Playboy offerings. I noticed that they no longer exist. I noticed at <a href="../../../p/l/a/Talk%7EPlayboy_365e.html#Merge_froms_recommendations" title="Talk:Playboy">Talk:Playboy#Merge froms recommendations</a> that they have been previously debated and deleted.

<dd>If you remember the article name, you can generally find the deletion debate by looking for [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PageName]]. Remember that some articles get discussed multiple times. You might also need to look for [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PageName (second nomination]]. Most admins will cite the controlling deletion decision in their edit summary when carrying out the community decision. You can find that summary by typing the article's name in the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_delete_f5f8.html" title="Special:Log/delete">Special:Log/delete</a>.</dd>
<dd>If the article was deleted, the contents generally can't be recovered by non-admins without a good reason. (Remember, if it could be undeleted at will, that would make the original deletion kind of pointless.) You can request an undeletion temporarily by following the "Content review" instructions at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a>. That's also the page where you can request permanent undeletion if you believe that there were procedural errors or facts which were not considered during the original deletion debate. Please take the time to familiarize yourself with the instructions on that page before making your request, though. Frivilous or inappropriate requests tend to get shouted down rather quickly. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 02:09, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

I agree that a delete button is not that useful, as closing admins <b>must</b> read the article and do their own investigation (eg. of the voting patterns) before deleting. After all that, a preloaded delete button doesn't really save time. They must on no account just scan the votes and click delete without bothering to look in more detail at what is going on with the deletion debate. Also, the "ordinary users will be confused" argument is an even stronger reason for not having a preloaded delete button. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 11:58, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>I saw two more before before the current one. Both of them had the buttons in the random order and not how the buttons are in MediaWiki. I first fixed the general user one. Then they changed it to another in random order but for admins--so I fixed it so buttons are for admins in MediaWiki. Then they changed it again, but at least this third time they defaulted to the right order. I think the buttons are useful for edits and admins alike. As for deleting or protecting stuff accidentally, it's a two-step process and even if an admin's mouse goes haywire, they can reverse it instantly. One thing though that might be faster is a link to view the AFD in a separate window, and not just <i>Click Edit</i> --&gt; <i>Click AFD individual voting page</i>. I sometimes have these things sitting on my computer for quite a while; I often go through AFDs while I'm doing another task on my computer that I have to wait for it to load, so it's helpful to refresh individual ones that catch my attention without having to load them all, or worse I research and AFD and am about to give my answer and poof it's deleted before I answer! <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 13:51, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Administrator Intervention</span></h2>
<p>Why are admins constantly closing AfDs early? I mean, AfDs are supposed to be submitted to a consensus by the users, not the admins. Why can't they wait until 5 days later when the AfD officially closes? There are several articles that have been appealed as a result of this. <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDiez2_aaaf.html" title="User:Diez2">Diez2</a> 19:00, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It depends on the AfD. Administrators will often close AfDs with obvious results early per <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a>. For instance, if an AfD has 18 delete arguments from established users in good standing within 12 hours (this has happened before on some hoax articles), it will more than likely be closed early because an administrator will see that there is no point in continuing the discussion any further. Other AfDs get closed late on their fourth or early on their fifth day if there is a clear consensus and no one has posted a new argument in a while (for instance, if someone opened an AfD at 12:00 on November 10 and it gets a keep consensus, an admin could close it at 00:00 November 15, which is not quite 5 days but close). --<a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Core</a><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoredesat_227a.html" title="User talk:Coredesat"><font color="#6699FF">desat</font></a> 20:42, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What's the difference between a deletion discussion page and a deletion debate page? These instructions are, as is often the case on Wikipedia, written for editors who are wiki-addicted. Can't they be beta-tested on the non-Wikipedia-savvy editor, ever?</p>
<ul>
<li>Create the article's deletion discussion page.</li>
<li>Click that link to open the article's <b>deletion discussion</b> page. Some preloaded text and some instructions will appear.</li>
<li>OR</li>
<li>Click the link saying "this article's entry" to open the <b>deletion-debate</b> page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are there simple instructions anywhere that aren't a wordsmog?</p>
<p>Anyway, the elementary schools of Albany School District should have been added to the request for deletion of the Albany Middle School page.

I don't think there's a set time for waiting to renom. A few days is definitely unacceptable though. I personally will not renominate an article which has been afd'd in the last 2-3 months. April '05 is fine - long time ago. Also, bear in mind that articles whose last afd concluded in keep may also be renominated with good reasons <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 09:49, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>AfD is probably the single most bureaucratic process that I've encountered on Wikipedia. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. The steps required are almost a safeguard. Do you really feel that an article merits deletion? Then you should spend the time going through the motions. If it's a flippant sort of want to see an article removed you're less likely to attempt it. Though if it's an obvious deletion candidate Speedy deletion is quite quick and painless as Jao pointed out. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichMac_732c.html" title="User:RichMac">RichMac</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERichMac_1402.html" title="User talk:RichMac">(Talk)</a> 09:51, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, AfD's are often of the form [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PAGENAME]], though you may have to try variants on this if it is a second or later nomination. If the article still exists, the talk page should (but doesn't always) have links to previous deletion discussions. For older discussions, replace 'Articles for deletion' with 'Votes for deletion'. Though really, using the "What links here" on the red-links is the most elegant answer, and should find all the AfD, VfD and DRV discussions. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 10:22, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A major, <i>major</i> problem with nominating articles for deletion is that their creators are too rarely warned that their articles have been nominated at all. Such laxity raises issues of incivility and implicit <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">biting of the newbies</a> by neglecting to welcome them and explain Wikipedia's inclusion guidelines, and after the deletion, makes it damn-near impossible for new or inexperienced users to respond to the nomination -- which inherently limits one perspective on the argument, a form of systemic bias.

<p>And Kurt Benbenek's creator was only notified after <i>I</i> told them, well into the AfD debate; Stripping fetishism's creator has left Wikipedia. Several were deleted before I could find out who their creators were.</p>
<p>Looking at those results, I'm extremely depressed. <i>Fifty-one</i> out of a total of the sixty-nine AfDs (excluding those for articles that had been created by an IP, or were extremely old), or nearly three-quarters, never resulted in the creator being informed that their article was up for AfD. The problem is crystal clear, and needs fixing.</p>
<p><a name="The_proposal" id="The_proposal"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">The proposal</span></h3>
<p>I propose, simply, that a fourth step be added to the process of listing articles for deletion. That fourth step would involve playing the {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAFDWarning_4e8e.html" title="Template:AFDWarning">AFDWarning</a>}} template on the creator's talk page, excluding cases where the article had been created more than perhaps 12 months before. This would reduce the systemic bias that is inherent in the AfD process at the moment, and prevent implicitly biting the newbies.</p>
<p><small>The following is an extension to the original proposal, added later by <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveydweeb_22a2.html" title="User:Daveydweeb">User:Daveydweeb</a>:</small> Additionally, {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfD_in_3_steps_6702.html" title="Template:AfD in 3 steps">AfD in 3 steps</a>}} would be deprecated and replaced by {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfD_in_4_steps_c55a.html" title="Template:AfD in 4 steps">AfD in 4 steps</a>}}.</p>

<li>I'm fully aware that nobody owns any page, and I - like everyone else - am reminded that all my contributions are GFDL'd upon submission. However, that doesn't change the simple fact that a vast number of new articles are nominated for either speedy deletion or AfD every day, in such a way that new users are never told what is being done. <i>We</i> may be aware that they don't own their submissions, <i>but they are not</i>. New users have generally never read <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> and, more importantly, are never told about it. As fair as it is to leave more experienced editors to take watchlist the pages they create, the problem of implicit incivility toward new users and the backlash toward Wikipedia that it creates <i>does</i> need to be taken care of, and telling them what the community is doing with their articles is a fairly fundamental step toward that. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveydweeb_22a2.html" title="User:Daveydweeb">Daveydw</a><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveydweeb_Esperanza_c934.html" title="User:Daveydweeb/Esperanza"><font color="green">ee</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveydweeb_22a2.html" title="User:Daveydweeb">b</a> (<small><sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDaveydweeb_17bd.html" title="User talk:Daveydweeb"><b>chat</b></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Daveydweeb_2_22db.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Daveydweeb 2"><b>review!</b></a></sub></small>) 22:39, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>How many new users to Wikipedia, do you think, know about the Watchlist? A sound majority of AfD articles are created by new users and are often those users' very first contributions to Wikipedia -- so it's downright unfair to expect them to be aware of a more obscure feature of MediaWiki, and to use it. JJay appears to be ignoring the point of this proposal, which is to avoid biting <b>the newbies</b>. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveydweeb_22a2.html" title="User:Daveydweeb">Daveydw</a><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveydweeb_Esperanza_c934.html" title="User:Daveydweeb/Esperanza"><font color="green">ee</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveydweeb_22a2.html" title="User:Daveydweeb">b</a> (<small><sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDaveydweeb_17bd.html" title="User talk:Daveydweeb"><b>chat</b></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Daveydweeb_2_22db.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Daveydweeb 2"><b>review!</b></a></sub></small>) 22:51, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Let me be clear here: newbie biting is a real problem and I hate it and always have. It's something I have fought against for a long time and is a big part of my entire approach to wikipedia. Massive participation - not article deletion- is the only way to improve overall article quality at wikipedia. The fatal side effect of the deletion process is that it drives away enthusaiastic good-faith contributors. Nevertheless, in my experience (probably hundreds if not thousands of AfDs), the newbie whose article is nominated figures out how to get to the discussion pretty fast. The newbie who doesn't show probably isn't coming back to wikipedia anyway and the article was just a one-shot. There is nothing really wrong with notifying the article creator, particularly when it's a newbie - I just don't think it should be mandatory. What should be mandatory is some kind of dialogue prior to nomination. I think nominators should be required to outline their positions on the article talk page before rushing to AfD. The goal is article improvement, and any method that can avoid the full-scale AFD nom and the resulting acrimony and bitterness is a good thing. Too many nominators edit war over an article and then nom for deletion. That is just plain wrong. Obviously I favor the prod process, but there is still a great deal of abuse and unfairness in the AFD system. I just don't see this proposal as addressing the more serious underlying issues. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:50, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

However, <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> is very relevant. Even if there is only one editor, that editor has no "ownership" rights on the article.

<li>You appear not to realise that this proposal is aimed specifically at addressing <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>, in that neglecting to warn new users that the articles they create are up for deletion is discourteous and unfair to them. You're absolutely right in one respect - active users don't need notification, because they don't own their submissions and are responsible for watchlisting them - but your opposition totally ignores that actual problem that I've identified. The vast majority of new articles are deleted because they were created by new users unaware of Wikipedia's inclusion guidelines, and it's a patently obvious fact that new users are generally unaware of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, the watchlist, and Wikipedia's notibility guidelines - and never told about them until, at the earliest, <i>after</i> their submissions are deleted or reverted. Neglecting to tell them that "their" articles, as they often see them, have been nominated for deletion, assumes that they possess a similar level of knowledge about Wikipedia as we do and implicitly <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">bites</a> them as a result. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveydweeb_22a2.html" title="User:Daveydweeb">Daveydw</a><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveydweeb_Esperanza_c934.html" title="User:Daveydweeb/Esperanza"><font color="green">ee</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveydweeb_22a2.html" title="User:Daveydweeb">b</a> (<small><sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDaveydweeb_17bd.html" title="User talk:Daveydweeb"><b>chat</b></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Daveydweeb_2_22db.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Daveydweeb 2"><b>review!</b></a></sub></small>) 22:46, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I almost always use Prod before AFD, and hope others are doing the same.

Wait until the AFD concludes and then declare it void and start over? <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 22:59, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Firstly and most obviously, not all AfDs are the result of removed PRODs; your point doesn't make sense in those circumstances. Secondly, removing PROD (and speedy, and AfD...) tags is <i>not</i> and indication that the user really knows what they mean - it's a knee-jerk reaction to seeing one's creation tagged for deletion in the first place. That would be why so many AfD tags are removed by inexperienced article creators, despite the very clear warning that "<i>the article must not be blanked, and this notice must not be removed, until the discussion is closed</i>". <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveydweeb_22a2.html" title="User:Daveydweeb">Daveydw</a><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveydweeb_Esperanza_c934.html" title="User:Daveydweeb/Esperanza"><font color="green">ee</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveydweeb_22a2.html" title="User:Daveydweeb">b</a> (<small><sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDaveydweeb_17bd.html" title="User talk:Daveydweeb"><b>chat</b></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Daveydweeb_2_22db.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Daveydweeb 2"><b>review!</b></a></sub></small>) 23:09, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> as instruction creep.

I examined only the first three. The point of this rule change would be that <i>more creators</i> would join in the AfD debates, and this would be good. <i>None</i> of the first three I looked at would have changed as a result of the rule change, because <i>all three</i> of the creators were aware of the imminent deletion.

<li>George Harlamon: boston2bronx (the article creator) was the first contributor in the AfD debate, regardless of how he found out.</li>
<li>Marshall Hubbard: Whpq prodded the article on 24 November, and notified the creator, Maddux31holytrinity, on his Talk page. An anon then de-prodded the article and the creator removed the prod notice from his own Talk page! After this happened Whpq took it to AfD, without further discussion.</li>
<li>Dirichlet prime: Leaving out some details, the creator (Giftlite) was well aware of the article deletion, and in fact supported it.

<dd>In the case of What's Under Benjamin's Bed the creator edited the article when it already had the AfD banner on it. So this suggests he had the information. (As a newbie, of course he may have not known the most reasonable thing to do about the situation, but he did have notification).</dd>
<dd>In the case of Daniel Assef here is the message I found in the deletion log:
<dl>

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Neither of these observations makes a decisive difference, but so far, I have not seen many clearcut examples of AfD debates where a bona fide creator of a real article which deserved a chance to live simply had no idea that deletion was going on. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 00:27, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The fact that the creator of What's Under Benjamin's Bed edited it after the AfD tag was added does not indicate that they were aware or comfortable with any of Wikipedia's policies or processes; indeed, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=What%27s_Under_Benjamin%27s_Bed&amp;diff=90253085&amp;oldid=89960612" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=What%27s_Under_Benjamin%27s_Bed&amp;diff=90253085&amp;oldid=89960612" rel="nofollow">content</a> of that edit itself is pretty compelling evidence that they were fundamentally confused about the matter. As for the creator of Daniel Assef and your request for an example of a deserving article being nuked without the creator having a chance to respond, that is <i>not</i> the issue I'm seeking to address; the issue is to do entirely with <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">biting</a> by neglecting to ensure that new users have an adequate opportunity to include themselves in process. Each of the oppose&#160;!votes so far, including this one, presumes that the users in question:
<ol>
<li>Are made aware of the deletion process;</li>
<li><i>Understand</i> that process;</li>
<li>Know how to respond to it.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Clearly, none of the above are supported by the facts, as I've explained both here and in my responses to the above criticisms. This proposal is aimed specifically at reducing the incidence of biting by demanding that experienced users offer a basic level of common courtesy toward newbies, <i>nothing else.</i> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveydweeb_22a2.html" title="User:Daveydweeb">Daveydw</a><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveydweeb_Esperanza_c934.html" title="User:Daveydweeb/Esperanza"><font color="green">ee</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveydweeb_22a2.html" title="User:Daveydweeb">b</a> (<small><sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDaveydweeb_17bd.html" title="User talk:Daveydweeb"><b>chat</b></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Daveydweeb_2_22db.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Daveydweeb 2"><b>review!</b></a></sub></small>) 00:55, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There's only so much that can be done to ensure that new users understand what is being done, and warning them about the deletion using {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAFDWarning_4e8e.html" title="Template:AFDWarning">AFDWarning</a>}} is a very basic way to do just that. The fact of the matter is that most deletions are nominated without even <i>trying</i> to let the creator know the problem; it's a reasonable demand that nominators tell new users that their articles have been nominated for deletion, and to point them to the nomination itself to explain <i>why</i>. Any more is unreasonable to the nominators, any less is patently unfair to the newbies. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveydweeb_22a2.html" title="User:Daveydweeb">Daveydw</a><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveydweeb_Esperanza_c934.html" title="User:Daveydweeb/Esperanza"><font color="green">ee</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveydweeb_22a2.html" title="User:Daveydweeb">b</a> (<small><sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDaveydweeb_17bd.html" title="User talk:Daveydweeb"><b>chat</b></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Daveydweeb_2_22db.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Daveydweeb 2"><b>review!</b></a></sub></small>) 01:17, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Oppose</b> - three steps is bad enough. And yes, I have had a page I created go through AFD without my realising it, so it does happen even to experienced users. In a big watch list, things get missed. It happens. In the case I'm thinking of, the right result was reached. And if the reasons for keeping a page are so obscure that only the original author knows them, well, there's always DRV. But maybe creating that 4th notification might be an appropriate task for a bot. If you're prepared to create a bot (or <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBot_requests_273d.html" title="Wikipedia:Bot requests">persuade someone else to do so</a>) and if you are prepared to run it at regular intervals (say every day or two) and prepared to make sure it behaves itself, then that would be a way to give people the friendly warning you want them to have, without making every nominator go to more work than they already have to.

<li>I'll be taking this request to the page you suggest, but I'm staggered that a minor piece of extra work on the part of AfD nominators would be placed at a higher priority than avoiding <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>.

<li><b>Neutral</b> - I <i><b>am</b></i> a newbie and seem to be surviving the existing process well enough. I've co-created a stub for a new article <a href="../../../s/m/a/Small_intestinal_submucosa.html" title="Small intestinal submucosa">small intestinal submucosa</a>, added some additional meanings for acronyms, performed some redirects, etc. (Readers of this note are undoubtedly savvy enough to see all I've edited here.) I've also participated in some of the AfD discussions. For one, it seems I may have helped educate another relatively new user a bit <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Tamaskan_Dog_7b38.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tamaskan Dog">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Tamaskan_Dog</a>. For another, I may have made some contributions that will allow for the article to be kept <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2006_November_25_6ec2.html#Sexual_anorexia" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2006 November 25">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2006_November_25#Sexual_anorexia</a>. What has worked for me is to read and follow the lead and welcome of the senior user who added a welcome to my talk page shortly after I created it. If I cannot find something or don't understand something or want help with something, I ask ... and about 7 out of 10 times, I've been helped. I expect for the remaining 3 out of 10 times, my query is either an unnecessary one or is one that simply will take a bit more time to tickle someone's fancy. If newbies are 1) willing to invest some time getting to know the existing system, 2) willing to communicate patiently with more senior, helpful users along the way, and 3) not just here to see if they can get "published," I think I'm a good example of how the current process as it stands is more than adequate.

<li><b>Nu</b>. I could see a definite need to rework the AFD instructions to emphasize the possibility of notifying major contributors, but adding a fourth step seems overkill. In cases where an article has a single editor so far, my FIRST preference would be to provoke a dialogue with the editor before sending their page off for AFD, my second would be to notify them of AFD. But making it required in some cases is not feasible. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 15:34, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't really understand the functional difference between this suggestion, and the original proposal. How is an additional step requiring that users notify the creator/contributors of an article any different to including that same requirement in an existing step?

<li>It's the difference between a <i>suggestion</i> (that we already have) and a <i>requirement</i>, as you propose. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 23:13, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b>. I always inform people of Prod's, I never inform them of speedy or AfD. A speedy is an uncontroversial deletion, agreed upon by an editor (me) and an administrator (the closer). If people want to edit Wikipedia, they should know what's it about and what is and isn't expected. If you make articles that so clearly are not what we need, then why bother informing them? Some effort has to come from both sides, and with a speedy, it appears like no effort has come from the contributing side to understand what is and isn't acceptable and wanted on Wikipedia. For a prod, things aren't that clear cut, and since after 5 days, it is a semi-automatic delete, this would mean that no one except me would decide on the deletion of saidf article, which isn't enough. So I notify the original contributor, always. Now, to the proposal: in an AfD, all editors are free to join the discussion, most discussions get a fair number of participants, many discussions get mentioned on relevant project noticeboards, ... Many people do their best to show that an article is noteworthy and shouldn't be deleted, thereby doing the work the creator should probably have done in the first place. Very few AfD's are unclear, and most of those get kept anyway (as a no consensus). So it is only in those cases where an article does not assert notability or verifiability, no one looking at the AfD can find any, but the creator, if notified and if reading his userpage, would be able to show that there is notability anyway, that this extra step would be useful for the result of the AfD. This doesn't happen very often in my experience. On the other hand, it is yet another step in an already quite bureaucratic process, thereby probably making more people ignore the many dubious articles on Wikipedia instead of submitting them for AfD. The spirit of <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> would be much better served by being less unfriendly in AfD's about non notable subjects (hoaxes, attack pages, ... are less deserving of friendliness of course). And while we're at it, let me make a counterproposal: always warn the creator of a Prod or AfD when the deletion discussion is put on DRV, since there is now no way of knowing this except actively scanning DRV. No message on userpages, no message in the watchlist... <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 22:19, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Xi</b>. I second Radiant!'s statement, why are we voting on this already? Wouldn't it be better to discuss first and see where it goes? The fact that people have been "voting" and not attempting to "reach consensus" has meant that good ideas that people have tossed out, such as getting a bot to do the fourth step of the process, have been largely ignored, which is a shame. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 23:26, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The <i>always</i> is a bit of a problem. Suppose I prod an article and warn the creator, they deprod it, and then I take it to AfD. Then suppose the deprod happens before the warning. Should there be a warning in either or both of these cases? Suppose they blank the AfD tag before I manage to give the warning, and I restore it and give them a {{<a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_substitution_a63d.html" title="Wikipedia:Template substitution">subst</a><tt>:</tt><a href="../../../d/r/m/Template%7EDrmafd_5120.html" title="Template:Drmafd">drmafd</a>}} for their trouble. Should I warn them about the AfD at the same time? Suppose I AfD one of <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html" title="User:Rambot">Rambot</a>'s articles. Should I warn it? Suppose the user has no contribs outside the article (this one happens a lot). If they edit the AfD, they're going to be tagged {{<a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpa_94ad.html" title="Template:Spa">spa</a>}} anyway; would the 'you are invited to comment' bit make sense in this situation? There seem to be too many exceptions here to make a good requirement. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 13:07, 28 November 2006 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> One issue I've always had with this sort of thing, is it assumes that we have a good definition of a <i>creator</i>, and that it's easy to figure out who that is (i.e. by a bot). Of course, if the article had only one editor, then it's fairly simple. Otherwise, who--the first editor, the one who added the most content..? If it's required to notify the <i>creator</i>, we need to know which creator(s) to notify, which may not always be trivial; assigning it arbitrarily would seem to violate WP:OWN. -<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanbeg_28d2.html" title="User:Sanbeg">Steve Sanbeg</a> 16:15, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
