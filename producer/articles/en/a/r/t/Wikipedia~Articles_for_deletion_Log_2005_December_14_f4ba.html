<p>Non-notable, new 'independent record label'. 103 displayed hits for the label, and 28 for their first release <i>"East Side All Stars Play Hard" sixfinger</i>. The second is hard to google, but doesn't seem to have many hits, which is logical since it's barely a month old.

<p>nevertheless the moniker itself is a separate one. Both th Big Smoke and Gunchester deserve separate entries anyway, since there is a history behind both [ Smog and Gun crime ] . Therefore it should be left in. The words 'far less common' don't apply to Ireland.

<dd>OK, I should've clarified that "well known" came from the new stub article; I'm not sure how one defines a "well-known" dog breeder or kennel. In my area, e.g., there are probably a couple dozen of well-known breeders of border collies, because their puppies are all over the place here. There are probably dozens of others all over the world like that, just for border collies. There are hundreds of other breeds. "Well known" has to be better defined, IMHO. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf_e89c.html" title="User:Elf">Elf</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/f/User_talk%7EElf_54a3.html" title="User talk:Elf">Talk</a> 20:01, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Listing all breeders may not be considered encyclopedic by some, but to those interested in the breeds there are specific kennels that are recognized as making significant contributions to the preservation and promotion of the breed, as well as signficant influence on the breed lines. Within North American Saints there are some lines that you will be hard pressed not find in most pedigrees at some point. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by MtHermit (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MtHermit_23e3.html" title="Special:Contributions/MtHermit">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I do not believe this article is accurate. "Patria y Libertad" (with a lowercase "y") was a right-wing group that during Allende's presidency organized a military mutiny, the <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanquetazo.html" title="Tanquetazo">Tanquetazo</a>. Can anyone confirm that Allende used it as a slogan? <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 10:18, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> No matter the outcome of this AfD, the title will have to be changed. First, the conjunction "y" (English: "and") should not be capitalized, as Gazpacho points out. As in English, Spanish prepositions, conjunctions, and articles appearing in the names of specific organizations are not to be capitalized, unless they are found at the beginning of a setence. Second, when the slogan "Patria and Libertad" is capitalized as a proper noun, it <i>does not</i> refer to the Allende slogan. Instead, the term refers to the following: (1) a number of fascist and quasi-fasicst groups set up over the years in Latin America, most notably the quasi-fascist paramilitary named Fatherland and Liberty set up to fight Allende's Popular Unity; and (2) <i>Patria y Libertad</i>, a drama by José Martí. In short, if there is going to be an article on "fatherland and liberty" as a slogan on the part of Allende's supporters, the article <i>must</i> be moved to an entry whose title appears in lowercase. (At the moment I will not comment as to whether or not the Allende slogan is notable enough for an article; thus, I will hold off on voting "keep" or "delete.") Forth, an article whose title is "Fatherland and Liberty" or "Patria y Libertad" appearing in uppercase should be written, with a disambiguation linking both to the article on (1) the various fascist groups in Latin America adoping such a name; and (2) the essay by Martí. Finally, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patria_y_Libertad_e913.html" title="Patria y Libertad">Patria y Libertad</a> (in uppercase) should redirect to the English "<a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatherland_and_Liberty_ac57.html" title="Fatherland and Liberty">Fatherland and Liberty</a>" in order to comply with <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia naming conventions</a>, which state that "article naming should give priority to what the majority of English speakers would most easily recognize, with a reasonable minimum of ambiguity, while at the same time making linking to those articles easy and second nature." The naming conventions are important because English-language sources tend to refer to the name of the neo-fascist anti-Allende paramilitary by translating it into English. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 05:55, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>this was part of my coursework, and was put on here somehow (not by me!). In our coursework we have to source everything, but come up with our own definition of water potential. I came up with this, it was put on here (thus becoming something I should source - but I couldn't, as our own definitions had to be exactly that - our own and original). So if it is not deleted then it is possible I could have taken it off here, as there is no proof that it was me that was using that IP when it was put on (even thought it was).

Can someone tell me how this is not just a convoluted and confusing special case of chemical potential as applied to water? If so I suggest that the article state as much and refer to a discussion of chemical potential. If this is special notation in common (?!) use then that should also be stated. As far as I know there is nothing special in this formulation that applies only to water and not to arbitrary solvents/liquids. I suspect that this concept is obsolete and of merit for understanding older thermodynamic literature. However, if this is the case, it should be made clear. Certainly it seems odd that a "potential" should have dimensions of pressure. 67.85.203.239 01:33, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Libel. Defamation. Nonsense. Identifying individuals by name and alleging irrationality without an exposition of the irrational ideas nor the logic used to claim irrationality. Content unbecoming a resource. From my web site: "when I created the recommendation for deletion, I did not sign my name to it. The next day my rationale for deletion was followed by a caption: "The preceding unsigned statement was contributed by Wyatt Ehrenfels [my IP address]." I deleted this caption, but on roughly half my visits to this page, I find the caption restored, so there's at least one person in my midst who feels my identity should be public knowledge. Fine. So let's reveal the identities of the individuals defaming the alleged kooks in the alt.usenet.kooks news group and, if we can't penetrate the identities of these anonymous sources, then as journalists, Wikipedia administrators should treat these individuals the same way journalists treat unnamed sources. Carefully. Confirm the rumors before releasing the article. If you have to release the article, withhold the identities of the alleged kooks. If you're going to reveal the identities of the alleged kooks, throw in a number of disclaimers. It's the absence of these disclaimers that undermines the neutrality of the article."</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Neutrality problems are not addressed by AfD. I challenge you to find <i>anything</i> in that article that is not worded in a neutral, factual way, and discuss it on the talk page. What alt.usenet.kooks <i>itself</i> does you may well find objectionable, but the article in no way, shape or form claims that the "kook" label is appropriate to the individuals listed—of which, I'm fairly safe to claim, you are probably one. It is true, however, that the list of individuals should be restricted to notable instances (Archimedes Plutonium and Wollmann spring to mind), not just list any random recipient. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 17:01, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The Seigenthaler article was worded in a neutral, factual way as well. But the civilized world cringed at Wikipedia upon learning of this piece. What you are doing is participating in slander. And that's exactly what it is (a) in the absence of your own names and (b) in the absence of the ideas (and/or equal-time statements) of the (c) individuals named in this entry. This strikes most civilized people as dirty. The statement from the preceding contributor "I'm fairly safe to claim, you are probably one" (i.e. a kook) is just additional evidence of a lack of value neutrality. Even if you are not an administrator or co-creator (i.e. just a passer-by putting his two cents in) it still speaks volumes as to how this entry is used and to whom it appeals. No one would be interested in creating or reading this entry if it were not a defamation delivery device. <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.129.121.254.html" title="User:67.129.121.254">67.129.121.254</a> (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.129.121.254.html" title="User talk:67.129.121.254">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.129.121.254_9df1.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.129.121.254">contribs</a>)</small>

<dd>"The statement from the preceding contributor 'I'm fairly safe to claim, you are probably one' (i.e. a kook)". No. This again highlights the misconception. I implied you were probably mentioned in the article as having been labeled a kook by the newsgroup to baldly demand the article be deleted. This in turn was based on previous experience—unsurprisingly, the vocal critics of the article in the past have been those individuals named. Whether you are actually a kook is another matter—personally I'd vote "no", since you're much too calm and rational. I still apologize for the remark, since the implications are also clear.</dd>
<dd>"No one would be interested in creating or reading this entry if it were not a defamation delivery device." Now you are the one engaging in unsupported statements, even if they don't defame anyone's character. We have many articles on notable newsgroups. That <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alt.fan.warlord.html" title="Alt.fan.warlord">alt.fan.warlord</a> is less controversial than this one is obvious, but that doesn't mean the article on this newsgroup should not exist.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think that NUTS, as one of the university's oldest and largest societies, is deserving of a separate article. NUTS is an important breeding-ground for thespians in Sydney.

<li>This would set up a precedent under which entries UNSW campus societies are included with an organisation that they may or may not be affiliated to. NUTS may not affiliate with the Guild post-<a href="../../../v/o/l/Voluntary_Student_Unionism_1159.html" title="Voluntary Student Unionism">Voluntary Student Unionism</a>, and UNSW's largest student club certainly doesn't. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoestella_3257.html" title="User:Joestella">Joestella</a> 13:38, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, it wouldn't set up such a precedent, but if indeed there are (or may be) clubs and societies which it would not be appropriate to include at the Student Guild page, it would be better going at a UNSW Clubs and Societies page, which should probably exist even if there are pages for individual clubs. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 15:26, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well there's no point having a circular argument about what constitutes a precedent. But if there are lots of less notable clubs on which information can be found, perhaps a general clubs page is the answer. But how would the (now quite detailed) <a href="../../../u/n/s/UNSW_Revues_cd15.html" title="UNSW Revues">UNSW Revues</a> page fit in to this? <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoestella_3257.html" title="User:Joestella">Joestella</a> 23:54, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Easily, because that page is not so full on content but full of lists of directors and producers. I wouldn't deem it neccessary to list such information on the Wikipedia page. So it could easily be merged to a clubs page with an external link to the revues website to obtain the full list of shows. But this isn't the place for having this discussion <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChanlord_d0f1.html" title="User:Chanlord">Chanlord</a> 01:27, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well then perhaps the solution is to simply <b>merge</b> what we have on NUTS and <a href="../../../s/t/u/Studio_Four_80e9.html" title="Studio Four">Studio Four</a> into the <a href="../../../u/n/s/UNSW_Revues_cd15.html" title="UNSW Revues">UNSW Revues</a> article and <b>rename</b> it 'Student theatre at UNSW'. And, as Chanlord suggests, save the past directors debate for that article's talk page. Of course, I'm new here and wouldn't have the first clue about how to make it happen. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoestella_3257.html" title="User:Joestella">Joestella</a> 01:52, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete with argument</b> as this is not a voting, I'll state my arguments. The use of cowbells is dependent on a particular artist interpretation (for example, you could play beatle's song on xylophone), in other words, the songs per se don't "feature" instruments. Moreover, a given artist sometimes change instrumentations at different concerts or presentations, and thus either this list becomes inaccurate or incomplete: if it includes songs always interpreted with cowbells it should be emptyied as differnet interpretations happen, or it would encompass pretty much any song that has ever used at least once a cowbell. -- <small>( <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrini_e6be.html" title="User:Drini">drini's page</a> <a href="../../../d/r/i/User_talk%7EDrini_c4b2.html" title="User talk:Drini"><big>☎</big></a> )</small> 04:56, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> after considering all the various issues. Here are my reasons:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>I'm <i>quite</i> inclined to vote Keep on any article that has previously passed deletion review, on the principle of <i>stare decisis</i>. I'm not super enthusiastic about the tactic of Well I didn't get it deleted, I'll try again in six months. Unless the article has greatly changed, isn't that kind of disrespecting the participants in the previous decision? I hope that the resolving administrator will take this into consideration.</li>
<li>On consideration, I'm not that troubled in this case by verifiability or original research issues. That is not intended to prevent <i>trivial and/or patently obvious</i> original research. It's not really "original research" to state that <i>Mississippi Queen</i> has a cowbell any more than it is to state that it has "Mississippi" in its title. It's just obvious. Similarly, verifiability is achieved just by listening to the song. (And if Ben was able to cite, say, a <i>Spin</i> magazine article as a source, well, the author of that article would have used the same research method: listening to the songs. So how would that be better?)</li>
<li>On consideration, I'm not worried about copyvio, even if the list is copied from somewhere else, which apparantly it isn't anyway. Simple collections of data are not copyrightable.</li>
<li>I find Ben's argument's convincing. Absent an original research issue or a copyvio issue, <i>of course</i> it should be kept. Are we next to delete (say) "List of symphonies scored for guitar". "List of concertos scored for glass harmonica". Is there a general hostility toward Wikipedia containing <i>any</i> information about nonstandard instrumentation in musical compositions, or am I missing something? <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">[[User:Herostratus|Herostratus</a>]] 04:09, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Notable songs, especially released singles, have precedent in terms of them having individual articles. I'm not entirely sure I'd vote keep on all Tool songs, or even all Tool singles, but a quick look at a variety of similar modern rock hits brings a similar situation. Even then, I'm likely to go over to the proposed guidelines and put up a little fuss over anything that would keep us from having notable songs like this listed. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> 03:36, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I retract my previous comment in support of deletion. If you google search The_Brenn (his online handle) you will get 233 results, all of which seem to be him. It makes sense that his noteability would manifest itself in this form, seeing as he is known for his online play. If he is taken down, we might as well take down all the articles that deal exclusively with online poker (pokerroom.com, etc.). If this guy is not decided to be noteable or worthy of inclusion, then the category itself just isn't worthy.</li>

<p>Despite the claims of thousands in the article, Calgary newspaper accounts reported a small and peaceful crowd. Here is a sampling:</p>
<p>"For their second day of action, protesters turned their attention away from the World Petroleum Congress to downtown oil companies. As was the case Sunday, the day passed without any major confrontations between protesters and police.</p>
<p>About 200 members of the End of Oil Action Coalition took to the streets at 7 a.m., blocking rush-hour traffic as they danced, chanted and marched." — <i>Calgary Herald</i>, June 13, 2005</p>

<p><b>Keep</b>. While the various protest marches during the weekdays of the conference typically saw numbers ranging from about 100-300 participants, the main opening protest event on Sunday, June 11, 2005, saw significantly larger numbers (it's been a while so I don't recall specifics, and I don't have my notes handy, but it was somewhere between 1000 and 5000). The protest events ran for about a week, including a "counter-conference" with participants and speakers brought in from around the world.

<p>This is certainly an article that is likely to grow. What would be better is adding an {{expand}} tag to add things such as his invitation to the WPT Young Guns event.

<li>He's twice been on the final table at WPT contests, and he's made over $349,000 at one tournament.

<li>Agreed, and as it's impossible to define who the top poker player is anyway, there's no reason for people to say he is not notable. I repeat Paul Cherry and <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Zee_b027.html" title="Ray Zee">Ray Zee</a> as examples of articles that should be looked at before this.

<p><b>Support</b> I don't think so. He is very well known in Canada for his extensive work on the BlackBerry wireless communication system and solutions that he developed in collaboration with independent software vendors, universities, and carriers. I would like to see mention of new technical standards as well, if an authoritative source can be found for this information, but I do not have this. I fixed some grammar and added mention of the publication of the developer journal to the article, though this may be less significant.216.9.243.104 08:53, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Delete</b> Virtually every google hit is some comment by this guy on other people's blogs. A Proquest literature search, including the ABI/INFORM database, returns 0 hits. <a href="../../../u/u/c/User%7EUucp_ab6c.html" title="User:Uucp">Uucp</a> 14:58, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Support</b> I wrote the original article. I disagree with using the number of google or proquest hits as a basis for notability for this subject. Four reasons: 1. The fine details of much engineering work is not published on the web because of companies' tight control over trade secrets and patents, so most google hits return pages dealing with his personal views and not professional work. Perhaps others can provide more data in this area. 2. Some third-party publications, such as development of technical standards for wireless communication through the IEC (international engineering consortium) to which he is known to have contributed, is published in conference proceedings but not picked up by proquest. I'm pretty sure I have print copies of these proceedings and if I can find them will cite them in an edit to the article. 3. Nor are the contents of print publications, such as Resource magazine and the blackberry developer journal, picked up by google. I am omitted references to these articles until I could find a suitable source for citation. I did however use google as a search for the quotations. 4. Where he has been employed by RIM since 1996 when it was a tiny company means that he was an early and influential player in wireless data communication, as they did not even release the blackberry until 1999, now there are around 4 million users of this device and the historical significance of the subject in this area alone should qualify this as a worthy article, certainly not vanity. This was my first draft of this article and I was hoping other contributors could fill in more information. - Frank R.Fragnal 17:22, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The subject could very well be notable, but the article in its current form does not prove the importance of the subject. The subject may be connected to the BlackBerry device, but the article fails to explain how. Yes, I agree that Google isn't always the best place to look to prove notability, but the article has no other references or publications posted, so it is my only source. I don't want to imply anything by this but I think it should be mentioned that the only editors to the article were Fragnal and 216.9.243.104, who both posted within 12 hours of each other.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sassan_Sanei&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sassan_Sanei&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> I have not voted yet, but plan to when I have made my decision.&#160;— <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheKMan_941b.html" title="User:TheKMan"><b><font color="#0000FF">The</font><font color="#FF0000">KMan</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheKMan_98f4.html" title="User talk:TheKMan"><font color="#000000"><sup><u>talk</u></sup></font></a> 17:45, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I understand what you are suggesting and no offence taken as I have already let several people know that I wrote this article in the hopes that they could add content.

<p><b>Support</b> I have worked in the wireless industry in Canada for several years, and in landline communication before that, and can affirm the importance of Sassan Sanei's contributions to wireless data communication standards including the BlackBerry system. 65.93.23.84 01:18, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Neutral</b>. <i>Reasons For:</i> While many of Sassan Sanei's Google hits refer to his blog, he is mentioned in a CNN article from 2001 <a href="http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/ptech/08/28/RIM.wireless.developements.idg/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/ptech/08/28/RIM.wireless.developements.idg/index.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, another article from 2001 <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/hn/xml/01/08/24/010824hnrim.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/hn/xml/01/08/24/010824hnrim.html" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>, and there is a short description of him on a technology conference page <a href="http://www.iec.org/events/2002/supercomm/attendees/t41c.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iec.org/events/2002/supercomm/attendees/t41c.html" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. The article is well writen, and might have some importance. <i>Reasons Against:</i> The few significant references to Sanei are from archived/old internet news articles from 2001. The only page linking to the article in question is the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Waterloo_4517.html" title="University of Waterloo">University of Waterloo</a>, and the addition was made by the anonymous contributor to this article. I think I should also note that there is a possibility of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">sock puppetry</a> or <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html#Meatpuppets" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">meat puppetry</a>. May the "let several people know" comment by Fragnal be noted. This in itself is not a criteria for deletion, but may influence the decision by the administrator to keep or delete (see <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_Articles_for_deletion_d5e2.html#Sockpuppets_are_bad" title="Wikipedia:Guide to Articles for deletion">Sockpuppets are bad</a>). <i>In Closing:</i> I do believe the article was created in good faith, but on a relatively obsure person. If this article is kept, I would recommend only keeping the "BlackBerry" quotation only. I'll leave the final decision to the deciding administrator.&#160;— <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheKMan_941b.html" title="User:TheKMan"><b><font color="#0000FF">The</font><font color="#FF0000">KMan</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheKMan_98f4.html" title="User talk:TheKMan"><font color="#000000"><sup><u>talk</u></sup></font></a> 17:26, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions. If I find more references I will add them to the article. I included the quotations which came up on various Google searches to give some insight into Sassan Sanei's views on things that have to do with more than just blackberry (personality insight). I have no objections if others want to edit or remove the others as TheKMan suggested and I can see that 65.93.23.84 already deleted one as "irrelevant" which I thought was actually an interesting one but I will not argue over it. Have we reached a consensus on whether to keep or delete?Fragnal 19:12, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>843 hits in Google (did you discount Wikipedia mirrors?) is not much for a supposedly well-known Internet activist. For example, usually all university professors who have written even few papers get that many hits and we don't think they are notable based on that alone. I think pretty much everyone here agrees that <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archimedes_Plutonium_ac8f.html" title="Archimedes Plutonium">Archimedes Plutonium</a> deserves his own page as a notable eccentric, but let me present this as a precedent: Edmond Wollmann gets 864 Google hits and is known among many Usenet participants as the winner of the not-so-prestigious "Kook of the Millenium" award by the alt.usenet.kooks crew. Yet his article was deleted because of lacking fame, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Edmond_Wollmann_5181.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Edmond Wollmann">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Edmond Wollmann</a>. <a href="../../../j/n/i/User%7EJni_807c.html" title="User:Jni">jni</a> 12:09, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

One small thing - I would remove the comment "He is not known to have grown up" from the article - it doesn't add anything to the article, which gives a fairly good summary of Zelenys' personality. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutarch_18bf.html" title="User:Autarch">Autarch</a> 14:53, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> I nominated the article for speedy deletion in the first place, and I contend that it was appropriate to do so on the basis that it is a vanity page and not notable. Michael wrote the article himself and added himself to the <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">Usenet</a> page. The first paragraph of the Larvatus article says: <i>Zeleny is a Usenetter known for lumpen-intellectual net postures, an absurdly pedantic sense of humor .... extravagant litigiousness, and nothing else of real consequence.</i> Is there any way to interpret this other than a self-definition of "not notable"? <a href="../../../t/w/p/User%7ETwp_3cd5.html" title="User:Twp">Tim Pierce</a> 19:49, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>As a side note I will add this: I don't bear Mikhail any ill will and am kind of amused to see thirteen-year-old flamewars dredged up in this context. I nominated this biography for deletion because it seems to be a profound violation of Wikipedia guidelines. The fact that he, or I, spent a lot of time flaming each other on Usenet is not a reason for either of us to have a biography to ourselves, and I would be quite happy if both of them were deleted. <a href="../../../t/w/p/User%7ETwp_3cd5.html" title="User:Twp">Tim Pierce</a> 19:49, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - I will not affect a neutral position in this debate. The relevant part of my partisan views worth advancing in this context is the lasting value of the Usenet culture. In this connection, I shall make three points. <b>1.</b> The idea of a reliable information medium and resource emerging from an open, self-correcting Internet forum has its unique origin in the Usenet. Wikipedia is a natural development of its precedent. Among many subcultures that deserve to be commemorated herein, Usenet stands out in its affinity to the forces and interests responsible for enabling this commemoration. We are history in its making. Let the record show this. <b>2.</b> Wikipedia <i>thrives</i> on unabashed promotion of personal and partisan agenda, prominently incorporating <i>self-promotion</i>. Encyclopaedic neutrality is not an attitude suitable for elective adoption by any single individual, but a painstaking product of innumerable individual conflicts. I am far from the best authority on applying stylistic guidelines to my own case. If it is judged worthy of preservation by the Wikipedia community in virtue of its substance, others can attend to its style much better than I. Otherwise, its stylistic faults are immaterial. <b>3.</b> As to the question of this or that subject being worthy of encyclopaedic mention or commemoration, it is seldom subject to definitive contemporaneous adjudication. This is particularly obvious in matters of culture, where popular success in one's lifetime affords no guarantee of lasting influence. <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van_Gogh_78b2.html" title="Van Gogh">Van Gogh</a> lived out his life as an obscure, parasitic non-entity, while <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bouguereau.html" title="Bouguereau">Bouguereau</a> basked in the loftiest honors and highest wages doled out to any artist. Our culture is impoverished by the shortage of contemporary records pertaining to social failures redeemed by posthumous acclaim. This lack is nowise compensated by the profusion of testimonials amassed in their lifetimes by the practitioners of officially certified arts. Storage is cheap. Memory is valuable. Make our memories matter. <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarvatus_255c.html" title="User:Larvatus">Larvatus</a> 23:46, 14 December 2005 (UTC)larvatus</li>

<ul>
<li>That strikes me as an excellent example of appropriate deletion criteria, actually. I think that Godwin's Law makes Mike Godwin a significant figure in the history of Usenet because the Godwin's Law meme became so widespread. So I think Godwin qualifies as notable but that neither McElwaine, Archimedes Plutonium, nor Wednesday do (and, for the record, I count myself as a personal friend of Wednesday's). If someone wants to put a list of my contributions to Usenet in an article, fine; if the Wikipedia community doesn't think that's notable and wants to delete it, that's also fine. Looking at the Larvatus autobiography I don't see any explanation of why you're a notable person, what notable contributions you have made to Usenet, or why "Larvatus" is a notable name. I'm sorry, old foe -- I think it's clearly a vanity page. <a href="../../../t/w/p/User%7ETwp_3cd5.html" title="User:Twp">Tim Pierce</a> 17:12, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The category in question is not concerned solely, or even primarily, with technical or structural contributions to the Usenet. Over the past fourteen years, I have attempted to contribute to its style and content. Whether or not one judges that to be notable or notorious, depends on his metric of note. Several people have credited my efforts in philosophical debate (<a href="http://rideau.carleton.ca/philosophy/cusjp/v16/n1/cohen.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://rideau.carleton.ca/philosophy/cusjp/v16/n1/cohen.html" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>), agonistic banter (<a href="http://www.20six.fr/Phersu/archive/2003/10/29/1fb2nhjd1hlj.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.20six.fr/Phersu/archive/2003/10/29/1fb2nhjd1hlj.htm" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>), and antagonistic persiflage (<a href="http://david.shackelford.org/?p=108" class="external autonumber" title="http://david.shackelford.org/?p=108" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>). I even claim having taken his breath away from yonder exemplary Usenet persona, <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Godwin_f7e2.html" title="Mike Godwin">Mike Godwin</a> (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.books/msg/e53db071eaf293c5?hl=en&amp;" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.books/msg/e53db071eaf293c5?hl=en&amp;" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>). Prior to the collation of old Usenet posts by Google, my generous fans regaled me with my own archive (<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22zeleny+archive%22&amp;start=0&amp;hl=en&amp;filter=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22zeleny+archive%22&amp;start=0&amp;hl=en&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>). Elsewhere, I have published a well-received scholarly book (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=zeleny+anderson+alonzo+church&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;filter=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=zeleny+anderson+alonzo+church&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>) and purged a publicly traded company of its child molesting founder (<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/larvatus/29125.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.livejournal.com/users/larvatus/29125.html" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>). Again, anyone is welcome to find all of this perfectly negligible. But the determination of notable or notorious character of Usenet personae is not entirely up to any given individual. In the present instance, I submit that other Usenetters have gone on record attesting to my contributions in a sufficient number and adequate manner. Likewise, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, as regards <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Pierce_1c58.html" title="Tim Pierce">Tim Pierce</a>'s track record of purging improperly created "alt." newsgroups. <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarvatus_255c.html" title="User:Larvatus">Larvatus</a> 19:50, 15 December 2005 (UTC)larvatus</li>
<li>FeloniusMonk, thanks for reminding me about the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WebEx_2f3d.html" title="WebEx">WebEx</a> article; the last 2/3 of that article really needs to be trimmed down to two or three sentences. We don't need to know irrelevant trivia about Yahoo Finance messageboards nor any purely speculative self-references to WebEx employees allegedly trying to whitewash Wikipedia. Also, why should I not nominate Erin Zhu article for deletion as a non-notable Usenet person? Or should every violent crime victim who has dated some random Usenet poster and Wikipedia self-promoter have her own article here too? <a href="../../../j/n/i/User%7EJni_807c.html" title="User:Jni">jni</a> 12:09, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As for "prolific output and longevity," merely posting on usenet for years does not give you the right to a wikipedia page.

<li>Setting aside the point that the alleged rapist is worth $100M, and his flight from the U.S. leaves a $1B publicly traded company rudderless, I agree with your objections. Hence my attempt to sum up my dubious discursive accomplishments. For whatever it's worth, I have my small but solid Usenet constituency. The category wherein I fit myself for our present purposes is that of Usenet people. For obvious reasons, it cannot comprise a <i>Who is Who</i>. But neither should it be restricted to a handful of "movers and shakers", even if anything of that sort could be reliably identified. We are documenting the emergence of a new culture, and its progressive and spastic refinement and retrenchment. This task calls for a great deal of tolerance. <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarvatus_255c.html" title="User:Larvatus">Larvatus</a> 22:17, 15 December 2005 (UTC)larvatus</li>

<li>The claim that this is a vanity page does matter, yes. See <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_guidelines_9511.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity guidelines">Wikipedia:Vanity_guidelines</a>. You make some arguments above that you are notable in the Wikipedia sense, but you're hurting your own case by being such an advocate. If a dispassionate person were to write the article, and make some effort to cite sources that are "<a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">credible, neutral and independent</a>", it would go down a little easier. As it is, it looks like Mikhail Zeleny primarily wants to keep the Legend of Mikhail Zeleny alive via Wikipedia. But what if said neutral person should edit this down, per Tim Pierce, and focus on the actual, verifiable sources of notability (as opposed to his failure to live up to his early mathematical promise, unverifiable allegations of teenaged "civil disobedience" in Dzerzhinsky Square, and the claim that his former girlfriend is married to Blixa Bargeld, which must be close to the very essence of grasping for notability)? When you expunge the unverifiable (claims to have named the Free Software Foundation), self-regarding ("attack philosopher"), and self-aggrandizing from the article, you are left with the facts that (1) he once sparred with some people who are <i>genuinely</i> notable for their achievements on Usenet, (2) he was given the thankless task, with which grad students are so often burdened, of assembling some papers in honor of his teacher, to be published in a volume likely read mainly by library cataloguers (Amazon rank 2,438,004!), and (3) he <b>publicized</b> his girlfriend's allegations of abuse by her father (slightly different than "purging" a company of him)---a decade and a half ago! Self-authored comparisons to Van Gogh notwithstanding, in other words, a non-notable person distinguished mainly by his desire to promote himself on the internet.

<li>One notable advantage of acknowledged autobiographies is the assumption of personal responsibility for their claims. Everyone and his uncle have the option of employing sock puppets for creation edits of their Wikipedia pages. By undertaking this edit myself, I remove all doubt as to being my own dog. "Pray tell me, sir, whose dog are you?" That aside, last I looked, the Dzerzhinsky Square venture was independently verified by the referenced testimony of Felix Kandel, whereas Cyrus Farivar still had his own Wikipedia page. <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarvatus_255c.html" title="User:Larvatus">Larvatus</a> 23:07, 15 December 2005 (UTC)larvatus a.k.a.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Zeleny (Larvatus) reached the highest level of USENET notability for non-crackpots. All of the following are verifiable evidence of USENET notability, and if Zeleny is not a notable USENET personage, who else could possibly qualify for the honor? Within USENET, Zeleny made the Net Legends FAQ and (unfairly, but whatever) the USENET Kooks list. Off the net, his discussions with Godwin made the Wall Street Journal, some English-lit professor tried to have him banned for discourse alleged to be harmful to her students, as did an Australian philosophy professor he had made a fool of. Zeleny's postings got Richard Stallman to post personally in misc.gnu.discuss. Tushar Samant created a Zeleny Archive, long before the days of weblogs. Again, all preceding facts are a matter of public record. Few posters were as prolific in as many newsgroups, or as well-known short of being a USENET founder or uber-admin (e.g. Gene Spafford, Steve Bellovin). This is a no-brainer: keep the entry.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Zeleny's significance is rather dramatically quantified by the fact that he is the only Usenet poster, out of several hundred thousand, to have ever had an unsolicited third-party archive created and devoted solely to his postings. The archive was formed by Tushar Samant in early May of 1998 (see threads in rec.arts.books with "Zeleny Archive On-Line" in the title) and initially contained 980 of Zeleny's articles. The archive was created on the basis of the high intellectual and rhetorical level of Zeleny's postings; as far as I can remember all other repositories of specific individuals' postings were just mockery of crackpots, as with (e.g.) Plutonium or McElwaine. User:Sqwik</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The current Wikipedia entries do not adequately convey Usenet's importance or Zeleny's status within "the Net", which as of the mid-1990's simply meant the Usenet. Usenet as a technology (let alone a subculture) was of comparable import to the WWW, ARPANET or Sendmail, and of greater import than BitNet or Wikipedia. Some of the customs and innovations now taken for granted, especially the multiply-indented interlinear reply format (stacks of "&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"), were developed on Usenet. Zeleny was exceptional for (1) the number of long and high-signal postings (not just one-liners, in-jokes, flames, mutual adoration, XOXO and other material typical of high-volume posters); (2) the number of sources, often recherche, cited or quoted in his postings; (3) the number of excellent translations of sources that he posted in the course of discussions; (4) the extent to which he used and treated Usenet as a scholarly and archival medium, including full quotation of the history-to-date and comprehensive interlinear reply within each posting; (5) the level of erudition displayed and complexity of vocabulary deployed (many people at the time remarked on both of these points); (7) the number of phrases and expressions coined, often as trenchant witticisms within a serious analysis of some text or issue; (8) the number and diverse range of newsgroups in which he was a leading or notable personality; (9) the number and extent of the episodes where his postings had effects beyond the Usenet, such as the Wall Street Journal coverage of his Internet dispute with Mike Godwin. Godwin is remembered in the Wikipedia for the phrase "Godwin's Law", but he also introduced the term "Zelenites" for Zeleny's fellow travellers on the Usenet. I don't know of many, or any, other Usenet personalities who were notable enough to earn a similar coinage. User:Sqwik</li>

<p>nn bio. She is a famous cloth doll artist according to the article. While the name generates 401 hits on google, some of them are forks of Wikipedia. Also, most of the hits lead to essays written by her on various <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> Gods on some web sites. The creator of this article <a href="../../../m/r/h/User%7EMrhyde_b22e.html" title="User:Mrhyde">User:Mrhyde</a> has been adding those links to the Wikipedia articles on Hindu Gods such as <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nandi_bull.html" title="Nandi bull">Nandi bull</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garuda.html" title="Garuda">Garuda</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narayana.html" title="Narayana">Narayana</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahma.html" title="Brahma">Brahma</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trimurti.html" title="Trimurti">Trimurti</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">Shiva</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vishnu.html" title="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/a/Draupadi.html" title="Draupadi">Draupadi</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganesha.html" title="Ganesha">Ganesha</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radha.html" title="Radha">Radha</a>. This means that either Madhuri Guin herself or a fan of hers is editing these pages. Also, some 20 days back, the number of google hits was in double figures, now it is 400+ because of the figuring of her name in the eponymous article and at least ten other articles in external links - Combined with the abundance of Wikipedia forks, my guess is that these actions have increased her presence on google by a staggering 300% at least. <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 09:36, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><s>*<b>Userfy</b> - I'd so love to say keep, and my personal beliefs are that something like this does Wikipedia no harm. It is a very well written article. If the author can come forward, then perhaps it can be userfied, and I see no harm in doing that. Whilst the fact that she is from a non-English speaking country (at least not exclusively English), that being India, and hence google, being an English-speaking search engine may be misleading, it seems that from the information that we have that she is not suitably notable. I could see no valid claims to notoriety, was unable to find a single review on her or her work and from what I can gather she just makes really nice dolls. As the nom suggests, this was likely written either by her or someone who personally knows her. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 09:52, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</s> I am withholding my vote (See below).</p>

<p>Now, the thing is that Madhuri Guin is being cited as a reference regularly. This is not the same thing as suggesting that Madhuri Guin is famous - I see no evidence in the other articles that anyone is trying to advertise Madhuri Guin in other articles. And this poses the question - are these references, as written by Madhuri Guin, reliable?</p>
<p>Now, I have looked at them, and they are well written, well researched, solid references. They look genuine. Indeed, they look like good references.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is an issue whereby we might suggest that this is all a big scam to try to increase Madhuri Guin's popularity. That is one way to look at things. Alternatively, however, if Madhuri Guin is famous and knowledgeable, then she would be able to write such insightful things, thus making this page notable.</p>
<p>I think that this is something that needs to be looked in to a bit further. If it is found that they are all nonsense, then we will have to revert all of the edits from all of the other articles as well. But if it is valid, then I think that there is a very good chance that this article is suitably notable to be kept. I would appreciate other opinions. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 10:14, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Comment:My Afd tag was for the article Madhuri Guin. Personally, I'd think that the links also shd go as she is not qualified (in terms of eduacation) to write on the subjects. However, I'm indifferent abt those right now but I strongly believe that Wikipedia should not be used as an advertising vehicle, either by design or by accident. That is the reason why I've nominated the article Madhuri Guin for <i>deletion.</i> --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 10:33, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That's an interesting thought. Is there any reason to suggest that what she has said in her references is wrong? From what I know of the folklore, they are all spot on 100% accurate.

Is this a coincidence or an orchestrated move to avoid further probing in the matter? It is also interesting that an artist famed for making dolls should find reference in a series of articles pertaining to Hindu Gods.

<li>Comment: I'll just make another comment here. Now, this all looks like its blatant advertising to advertise Madhuri Guin's web site "Dolls of India". It hasn't worked in terms of unique customers though, but perhaps long term it would. Deleting this page I think is a must. If the web page says "Famous, as per Wikipedia", then thats virtually an admission of guilt of advertising. Can't get much more obvious than that! But then we have the question of the links in other articles. Now, there is no reason to believe that anything that she has written is false. It all looks 100% factual to me. It is well written and seems to be reasonable. However, Madhuri Guin's personal testimony is probably not sufficient as a primary source. Besides which, all of those links have "Buy this vase", "Buy this doll" etc as part of the history. To me, this suggests that it is true, but at the same time it is advertising. It seems to me highly unlikely that she would make up history, especially religious history, in order to sell products. Her site would be closed down and she'd be hung if she tried to do that. So then the question is what do we do with them? If we remove the links, then the advertising question is fixed. But if we remove the content that was extracted from the links, then the articles that she improved lack substance. She improved the Wikipedia articles, and is a good editor. If we remove the links but keep the content, then we have verifiability issues. So perhaps the best thing that we can do, and this is my suggestion - see if we can find other links that say essentially the same thing as her links do - add those links in, remove hers, and then rewrite the articles to suit. Again, I can see absolutely nothing to suggest or hint that anything that she is saying is false. Unless someone has some other evidence to suggest that it is untrue, I am going to go with the belief that what is written is true. And this then means that we probably should talk to Madhuri Guin to see what her opinion is. It might help if someone sent to her an e-mail to ask her. As Mrhyde hasn't edited for a month, I doubt that talk messages will help. Perhaps I can write her a little e-mail and see if we can sort this out. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 17:52, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Okay, I just sent an e-mail. I am hopeful that we can sort this out amicably. I am confident that Madhuri Guin/Mrhyde did not intend any malice with any of their activities, and that they will work with us to create articles that are not advertising in nature. If I get a response by e-mail, I will write it here. I am hoping that Madhuri Guin will come to Wikipedia herself to respond in person. I think that we all should do a big <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> over this issue, and if we do, I think that we can resolve this amicably. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 18:10, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Okay - the mail did get passed on to me (that's <a href="../../../m/r/h/User%7EMrhyde_b22e.html" title="User:Mrhyde">Mrhyde</a>) by Madhuri Guin. She might come over in a day or two and write her own views regarding this. However, being the author of the article in question as well as the edits in question, I would like to air my response here. I completely understand and appreciate the apprehensions regarding the use of Wikipedia for advertising. Also now that someone's mentioned earlier that an article about a person should not be entered by someone who personally knows him/her, I suppose the article about Madhuri Guin merits deletion, since I personally know her very well. In fact we are a part of a very close knit circle of acquaintances. However this does NOT mean that her fame has been BUILT by me and then added as a link in her website by her webmaster. The dolls she makes are one of a kind and as already mentioned in the article, she HAS been formally recognized as a MASTER CRAFTSMAN by the Government of Delhi. Whether she is "famous enough" is something that I wholeheartedly leave to the judgement of all those participating in this discussion and the majority view is acceptable to me and I am sure, to Madhuri Guin as well, WITHOUT ANY PREJUDICE at all. Regarding the links to this article which have been placed in her website (www.dollsofindia.com) - well I asked the webmaster to add the link there simply because I put up this article about her and I wanted more people to know about her and getting him to put up the entire article on that website would have been difficult. Anyway, if that is a problem, I can get the webmaster to remove references to the article in question on her website. Also, if this article is deleted, as has been discussed earlier, then that link to this article anyway is meaningless. But let me assure you, Madhuri Guin's fame is more than simply "being listed on Wikipedia". Now regarding the edits and external links that have been added to various Hindu articles, I would strongly defend my entries simply because I am NOT a part of dollsofindia.com though I personally know its owner and the author of the articles on her website, Madhuri Guin. I do NOT think trying to make money is a crime and she is doing it transparently by listing items for sale which are relevant to her article on her website. I thought her articles are good and extracts/information from the same would do good to the articles on Wikipedia and so I used them as references for doing my edits. Madhuri Guin knows of this and she had no objections. I did NOT have any "Advertising campaign" of any kind on my mind while doing what I did. Madhuri will herself write in this forum but she told me over the phone just now while mentioning that people are writing about her article that she has not used any formal source for the articles n her website. Most of the content in her articles are actually common knowledge amongst Hindus who have a bent towards the Hindu religion. I do not see WHY having a well written article with actual good content which ALSO sells things cannot qualify as a valid external link. If that be the case, we have a number of links (for example the external link Shiva - The Sensuous Yogi by Sri Nitin Kumar points to shiva.exoticindiaart.com in the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">Shiva</a> article) that are actually e-commerce websites. The example link lists an article, in which if images are clicked they take you to a product page with "buy it" icons etc. I do not think what they are doing is any different from what Madhuri is doing, but as far as I know, this external link has been in existence for ages now. I think both should remain simply because they are good compiled sources of Hindu religious writings. To summarize, I would not strongly defend the Madhuri Guin article because I cannot be the sole judge of her fame but I would say she is famous enough, based on her recognition by the Delhi state government and her unique craft of doll making and having an article on her in Wikipedia is not mal-intentioned. Also, I think all my edits in the Hindu articles SHOULD remain INCLUDING the external links to her articles because her articles are the source of my edits and her articles have good content - mostly verifiable as local Hindu knowledge. Her listing items for sale on her article page does not and SHOULD NOT demerit her writings. Will await comments by both Madhuri Guin (hope she comes here soon&#160;!!) and others in this forum --<a href="../../../m/r/h/User%7EMrhyde_b22e.html" title="User:Mrhyde">Mrhyde</a> 19:59, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Would you be able to provide a link to where she has been approved by the Government of India as a master craftsman, and also put in to context what this means in terms of the difficulty of being able to achieve it? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 05:21, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To the best of my knowledge, while it is competitive to be recognised as a master craftsman, it is not very notable by itself; for several dying arts where there has been a family tradition of being engaged in such arts, it is much easier for those family members to get the status. It has to be noted that the status itself does not guarantee success; it generates contacts and international exposure - but it ultimately depends on the marketing acumen of the person. That is, the role of the government is more of an endorser rather than of a promoter. Also, about the links: the problem of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> remains and common knowledge, should be verifiable. One of the reasons I do not edit much with respect to articles on Hindu mythology is that most of the online sources are suspect and off-line sources are non-English. btw, not many editors seem to be active on the discussion as it seems to be long and disjointed at first glance. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a>, may I request you to re-arrange &amp; re-format the discussion as you deem fit? ('coz some of my comments are also not in right places). It is surprising to note that Indians cannot access this website; but some 20-25 days back, when this article first came on my radar, I can swear that I saw it functioning and also through goole cache just before nominating the article for deletion. --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 05:46, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not think I, or for that matter, Madhuri will be able to provide a link for the recognition extended to her because I do not believe the governement keeps such a web page of any sort. However she must be having a copy of the actual award which I am sure she can provide through a scan. What Gurubrahma has said is true <i>for several dying arts where there has been a family tradition of being engaged in such arts, it is much easier for those family members to get the status. status itself does not guarantee success; it generates contacts and international exposure - but it ultimately depends on the marketing acumen of the person. That is, the role of the government is more of an endorser rather than of a promoter</i>. However regarding the first part of the statement, regarding <i>dying arts</i> and <i>family tradition</i>, Madhuri's art is something that she created herself, without inheriting it from anyone else in the family or outside it. Such form of cloth doll making is not present anywhere, at least in India. But yes, I understand Gurubrahma's statement about a recognition by the government not being sufficient proof of fame. Zordac, regarding the "difficulty" in acheiving the recognition, its like this: the government of Delhi selects a few craftsmen (I think about 15 or so) every year for the recognition they bestow and given the HUGE number of pretty skilled artisans present in India, it turns out to be difficult to be chosen amongst the select few. But then again, I understand what Gurubrahma is saying and I am kind of beginning to see reason in Gurubrahma's arguments regarding the article on Madhuri Guin and am feeling doubt about my conviction about the rightness of the article remaining in Wikipedia even though I wrote it myself. I leave it to your good judgement to keep it or remove it and like I said, I will view the decision without any prejudice at all. I wish, though, Madhuri herself takes some time out and comes and writes about the whole issue herself. --<a href="../../../m/r/h/User%7EMrhyde_b22e.html" title="User:Mrhyde">Mrhyde</a> 07:23, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding the edits and referencing links in other articles, I STILL think they should stay simply because what is common knowledge IS based on what is written in ancient texts - Mahabharata, Ramayana, Puranas, Vedas, Upanishads and commentaries by various sages. One can use these texts as references but it would be more like saying that Jesus Christ was born in Jerusalem and use as a reference, the Bible. Hindu mythology is after all mythology present in ancient epics and religious texts. I used Madhuri's articles as references and I presented them as external links on various articles in Wikipedia and I still cannot see how I am wrong. Also, as I have earlier said, I would not object to the deletion of the article on Madhuri Guin but I surely have a problem with deletion of my edits and the reference to her articles since I do not think it would be right to undermine my efforts and hers too, when they are in no way malafide. --<a href="../../../m/r/h/User%7EMrhyde_b22e.html" title="User:Mrhyde">Mrhyde</a> 07:23, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gurubrahma Madhuri has had the website blocked in India for a long time - almost 2 years, except for a brief period of about 20 days or so about a couple of months back. But since then all IP addresses originating in India are blocked by a "under maintenance" page. Of course the site should still visible through "google cache" as Gurubrahma has pointed out. There is nothing <i>strange</i> about having the site blocked in India - it is a commercial fully online venture and Madhuri does not feel safe about credit card transactions in India and does NOT want to cater to queries which do not result in sales. I think she reserves the right to show or hide her website in a part of the world that she chooses to. --<a href="../../../m/r/h/User%7EMrhyde_b22e.html" title="User:Mrhyde">Mrhyde</a> 07:23, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>By the way, <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a>, you will not be able to view the website since you are based in India and Madhuri just now told me that the website is blocked in India because she "keeps getting trade inquiries she is not interested in, from all sorts of people". The site is available to people in India she chooses to give authorization to, and I, luckily, am one of those people&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../m/r/h/User%7EMrhyde_b22e.html" title="User:Mrhyde">Mrhyde</a> 20:20, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> There are a lot of words about borderline notability here which to me seems like a good indicator that this article needs to go. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a></small> 06:52, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>My Rejoinder comments</b>: I think that the links which cannot be accessed freely by all are certainly not suitable for inclusion in wikepedia pages, as wikipedia puts a premium on the freedom of the users and the editors, and non-accessibility of the site (dollsofindia) by the users located in India curtails the freedom of users/ editors of wikipedia. The natural corollary should be a consensus to remove such links. As regards, other commercial/ semi-commercial links, as and when spotted, should also be removed, as wikipedia is not a platform to promote commercial activities – directly or indirectly. --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 14:27, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Thoughts</b> - I've been thinking about this. I just got my e-mail back from Madhuri Guin. So I've been mulling this over for a while. Here are my thoughts:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1) I am not convinced that being labelled as a master craftsman is sufficiently notable for a Wikipedia biography. Whilst it is a great achievement and Madhuri should be proud of it, I am just not convinced that it is enough. I am not sure myself as to what it means, and am trusting Bhadani's judgement here. If someone else can convince me otherwise, then I might change my vote. As such, that is the sole reason why I am maintaining my delete vote.</dd>
<dd>2) I do not think that the links provided in other articles are advertising, and hence they should remain. However, given that they cannot be viewed by Indian users, I think that a note should appear on all sites which reference them to say "cannot be viewed by Indian users" and an effort should be made to have an alternate site to be listed. I also have no reason to believe that the links are inaccurate in any way.</dd>
<dd>3) I think that MrHyde is a wonderful contributor to Wikipedia and should be encouraged as much as possible. I think that this page should be userfied and not flat out deleted, so that it can remain on his page. I also think that dollsofindia should be encouraged to copy the biography on to their own page, as it is beautifully written. I think that having it on the dollsofindia site would be a great asset to their site, and a valid description of Madhuri Guin.</dd>
<dd>4) I think that we should make every effort to be respectful of Madhuri Guin and not be harsh in our words here. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 13:28, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Further comments</b>: Certainly, I agree with you on all points. And, surely, we all respect Madhuri Guin, and her contributions to the field of art and <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handicraft.html" title="Handicraft">handicrafts</a>. As a fellow Indian, and a citizen of the world, I wish her all the best. The matter as regards continuation of this article is still open for evaluation, and further comments by other users shall be useful. I do agree that the article is beautifully written, and I am sure that we shall continue to have contributions from Mrhyde. --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 14:32, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am sorry I am about to go a bit off-track here but I really want to say this: It is wonderful how the people here uphold the policies of Wikipedia by trying to sniff out suspicious activity and YET do not get carried away by this very zest of theirs AND manage to give credit to those who deserve it. All this while maintaining dignity in their discussions. I am new to Wikipedia (just about a couple of months, I think) and it is simply wonderful how the system does self-policing without turning itself into a police state. Congrats to the human brain for being able to create technology and sharing it and ensuring that its misuse is limited without stunting the growth of technology itself.</p>
<p>Now that I have written what was on my mind, here's a confession: I had no idea what "userfy" meant so I did a search and yes - that's what seems appropriate in this case. Of course, I like the suggestion by Zordac about having the article featured on the dollsofindia website. I have talked to Madhuri and she will talk to her webmaster to have this page featured on their website. I have also asked her to get the webmaster to remove the link on her website to the article on Madhuri Guin as soon as possible since its now obvious that the article SHOULD and WILL go. I however have no idea how I can "usefy" this article on MY userpage? I mean its after all an article about Madhuri Guin. So how do I shift it to the userpage of MrHyde? Any examples of this happening in the past? Sorry if this is not the correct forum to be asking such a question but I would hate to simply have the article vanish without at least having it on my user page.</p>
<p>Finally, I am going to go to each of the Hindu articles I have edited and remove the link to Madhuri Guin article in the external link AND mention that the link "cannot be viewed by Indian users" as suggested by Zordac. Also, I would like to join Gurubrahma in wishing Madhuri Guin the best of luck. She said she would be visiting this page soon - hope that happens SOON!! --<a href="../../../m/r/h/User%7EMrhyde_b22e.html" title="User:Mrhyde">Mrhyde</a> 20:24, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd like to note that this <i>"cannot be viewed by Indian users"</i> appeared quite misleading to me when I saw it in an article: I got curious what is meant: whether it is due to state law, moral law, or just a decision of the site owner&#160;;). Only having read through this discussion I could finally completely understand this statement. Perhaps, a tiny hint on the reason of the unavailability would help avoid the emergence of the strange interest in the topic by the readers, as it happened in my case.--<a href="../../../i/m/z/User%7EImz_9b33.html" title="User:Imz">Imz</a> 23:54, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Everyone, this is Madhuri Guin. I finally managed to get myself to visit this website and make known my views about the whole "controversy". MrHyde is very kindly sitting right beside me and helping me out write out all this since I am not very conversant with how these things work. I have read all that has been already written and I must say you all are doing a great job of compiling and disseminating userful and correct information to the masses. I have read MrHyde's article about me earlier and I was embarassed then and am more embarassed now, since it is a part of some sort of controversy. I completely agree to what all of you are saying regarding my "fame". I am not famous enough to be quoted in an encyclopedia - that is very much true. Yes, my dolls are slightly well known but even they are not famous enough to be represented in an encyclopedia. Having articles about me would mean many other people would be "famous" and there would be no end to how many people would want to get listed in your encyclopedia. I am thankful to MrHyde to have thought I am worth having a biography in an encyclopedia but obviously that view is slightly biased by our acquaintance.</p>
<p>Regarding what some poeple have said about my providing proof of the award - I do not think it is necessary anymore since the article is anyway not going to stay here anymore. But if it had to, I can have my webmaster upload scans of my award to where you want them. I shall get my webmaster to copy the article to my website, which anyway, is the proper place to have such an article. I do not know however when he will be able to get that done&#160;!!</p>
<p>I also read something about the website being blocked in India. Yes, that's true - my webmaster did that for another website (which, MrHyde tells me is ALSO a part of the reference links in some of the articles he has edited) and told me about it and I had him set that up for my website as well. Its not because I do not want Indians to view my website - I rather do - but my concerns about safety and commercial strategy has forced me to take this decision and stick to it.</p>
<p>I believe that is all that there is to say. Again, congratulations to you all for maintaining this huge encyclopedia. Thanks to Zordac for writing to me and apprising me of what was happening here. Thanks also to MrHyde for writing an article for me and for defending me, website and my efforts.

<li><b>Keep</b> He's probably a long-shot, but he is the candidate of the current opposition party in the country, and will likely garner a significant portion of the vote. Now, I don't have any intention of voting for him or his party, but he has the right to the page. If one reviews the current guideline on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html#People_still_alive" title="WP:BIO">Notability</a> you will see that political figures in national or provincial legislatures are included. Now, elections aren't covered one way or another there, but if you take the sports area, where even players on school teams are automatic entries ... and even "first team squad members who have not made a first team appearance may also be appropriate, but only if the individual is at a club of sufficient stature that most members of its squad already have articles.". Using this test, I think everyone can agree that the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_of_Canada_de3b.html" title="Conservative Party of Canada">Conservative Party of Canada</a> is the equivalent of a "club of sufficient stature"! <a href="../../../n/f/i/User%7ENfitz_2215.html" title="User:Nfitz">Nfitz</a> 04:08, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>That's a good argument to edit the article, and return it to it's November 27th version. However it isn't a good argument that there shouldn't be some kind of article at all.
<ul>
<li>If you want to continue with the sports analogy, of course a major team is noteworthy. But you would not consider those trying out to be noteworthy, would you? Once they make the team, it's another story. Ifnord 23:13, 15 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But he's made the team, and he's playing the game. The game is on! I think your arguement would hold, to stop pages being made for each of the people who were in the running to be the candidate, but failed to be selected. Not sure the big deal here, we looking at 308 ridings and 3 or 4 candidates each. Tha's only 1000 or so people, every 3-4 years. Compare to a major league sports team. 26 teams with 25 players per team. That's 650 people right there in one league ... and then when you include minor leagues, and even University leagues, and according to the notablity guidelines even College teams! <a href="../../../n/f/i/User%7ENfitz_2215.html" title="User:Nfitz">Nfitz</a> 00:37, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nothing in the article (which tells us about the subject's intensifying passions, his endorsements, and where his daughters go to school — none of which is sourced, by the way, and reads like it was taken straight from the candidate himself) indicates that this person satisfies any of the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria. Being a <i>candidate</i> for an election doesn't satisfy the criteria. One has to satisfy the criteria for some other reason, such as for being a candidate <i>who has also been the subject of significant (non-self-sourced) press coverage</i>. Searching reveals nothing that indicates that this person satisfies the criteria in any other way. The press coverage is about the major players for the seat, with Conroy being given just one-sentence "Peter Conroy is also running." mentions at the ends of articles. Wikipedia is not a hosting service for election candidate statements, nor is it a platform for equalizing how much people know about candidates for office. It is an encyclopaedia. If a candidate is known as just a one-line directory entry on a ballot form, or as a one-sentence also-ran at the end of news items, outside of Wikipedia, then that is how Wikipedia should reflect xem: as a one-row entry in an election results table for the constituency. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 07:08, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Consensus doesn't require a vote; if the discussion dies prematurely, then in the lack of a clearly defined policy statement the results that have actually been applied here in practice stand as the consensus.

Searching reveals nothing that indicates that this person satisfies the criteria in any other way. The only mentions that this person gets are inclusions in "also running in this election" lists in news articles, and a web logger saying that this candidate's web site was the worst of all of the candidates' web sites. At one point, I thought that I had something more substantial, with a search result summary that said that "Chris Tindal led the attack". But upon reading it, it turned out to be a news article about an Ontario ice-hockey player by that name.

<li><b>Retain</b>, Subject is a well known figure among a growing demographic of drug policy reformers across the globe. His contributions both on the political front and within the reform movement are certainly noteworthy today and will be even more so a hundred years from now. Considering the current criminalization of drugs has just reached its 91st anniversary, it's clearly an issue that has long term interest and consequences for the public and researchers in the future will find the biographical information on this candidate of great value.

<p><b>Arguments for retaining article Tim Meehan from StrangerInParadise</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events</b>
<ul>
<li>TM is a well-known figure within an emerging area of political endevor, specifically pro-cannabis Canadian politics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Published authors, editors, and photographers who have written books with an audience of 5,000 or more or in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more</b>

<ul>
<li>Yes on both counts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Expandability -- Will the article ever be more than a stub? Could the perfect article be written on this subject?</b>
<ul>
<li>Tim is still active in Canadian pro-cannabis activism, an area where developments are on-going.</li>
<li>Once prohibition of cannabis is repealed, who knows?</li>

<li><b>100 year test -- In 100 years time will anyone without a direct connection to the individual find the article useful?</b>
<ul>
<li>Anyone interested in the early history of the pro-cannabis movement in Canada, which presently is itself in a key point of struggle due to its proximity and historic ties with the United States, the principal driver in the global war on cannabis.

<li><b>Autobiography -- Has this been written by the subject or someone closely involved with the subject?</b>

<p>TM and his political and social work fundamentally pass the Hundred-Year test. While the last several Canadian federal governments have equivocated over both the decriminalization of marijuana for recreational use and the federal commitment to making marijuana legal and available for medical use, the direction of Canadian history and the will of the Canadian people are clear and obvious. The controversy here over including/deleting a TM article rests on TM's being five to ten years ahead of when the rest of the Canadian body politic will reach his same conclusions. But they will. The Wikipedia community would do well to recognize a political prophet and visionary now, thus educating the public now about a figure whose ideas will be mainstream ten years from now.</p>

Eighteen of the top twenty items on the writings link merely reproduce his letters to the editor. The other two are short Canadian news stories that mention him in passing.

<li>Consensus doesn't require a vote; if the discussion dies prematurely, then in the lack of a clearly defined policy statement the results that have actually been applied here in practice stand as the consensus.

<p>I hope that we can keep internecine problems out of the discussion. I understand my commentaries are not accepted by modern Christianity but no doubt would be more acceptable to the Essenes, whom I believe Jesus was a member.

<dd>After thought, redo this article, either as it's own piece or as a section in advaita. Don't go verse by verse, instead quote some advaita teachers who reffer to jesus, a quick summary of advaita and a few verses. It is not origonal research at all, it is common for Hindu teachers to quote Jesus and say his teachings are in line with advaita... just make it more of an article and less a piece of spiritual literature.<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethie_02d0.html" title="User:Sethie">Sethie</a> 19:00, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I suppose it is an interpretation of the term 'original research'; the Gospels are hardly original. I have offered an interpretation that is not the usual but would be accepted in an Eastern Philosophical sense. I'm just basing my article on what I have seen in other articles, where much interpretation and explanation has taken place. Also on the statement on guidelines about the socialist workers party's paper being less reliable than the NY Times..that again is only opinion. NY Times has recently published some glaring errors.

<dd>After 31 October 2005 I am going to delete all forum software that has no wiki article. This page is for """common""" internet forum software. That is the only criteria that has been applied to this page so far. Not having a wiki-page signals a forum software as """uncommon""" to me. So unless the following situation happen: (a)someone presents a new criteria on what software should be listed, (b) someone presents a resonable argument as to why a software is common, (c) someone creates wikipages for all of the software. You can expect a weeding to be done of this page. I feel the extra forums present no use besides clutter to the page.</dd>

<p>Non-notable local improv comedy group. Only 78 unique hits. AFAIK we don't have WP:COMEDYGROUP yet, but going by what's been established at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> I don't think this group would meet it--no indication of interstate, let alone international tours; no agreements with label-like promotional companies; no indication of national press; and they're less than six months old. I mean, I like to go watch something that makes me laugh, but not every local group that gives free performances is encyclopedic. Regforafd 03:33, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>First off, I think that you're abusing the "<a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_edit.html" title="Minor edit">minor edit</a>" feature to tag an article for deletion. That's about as major as an edit gets.</li>
<li>Second off, <b>Keep</b>. Where do you get "78 unique hits"? Is that for the Wiki article? If so, that's pretty good considering that it's less than 2 days old. It is encyclopedic, and here's why: while Variety Shac as an entity has never amounted to anything, its individual members have shown up in a wide array of media and are satellites to some of the biggest stars in American comedy (so yeah, they probably have promotional companies, they just don't mention them on their website). Sorry that I haven't gotten around to starting the individual members' pages yet, but again, it's only been 2 days. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">Mareino</a> 14:33, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. Verifyable (there were quite a lot of google hits), but at the moment the article doesn't assert why they are notable as Variety Shac. It isn't helped that the individual comics don't have articles here...which is odd at least in the case of Andrea Rosen (who I know I've seen around before). Going to do more searching... If it was expanded to include their notability then I would reevaluate. BTW - to address Mareino's question, I didn't see any hits to the wikipedia page in the first several pages...which is to be expected if the article is only a day or two old. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 15:16, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Allow me to explain the "unique hits" thing. If you type "Variety Shac" into Google and search, the thing at the top right says there were "about 663" hits. But if you actually go through and try to <i>view</i> those search results, Google stops on the 8th page with the message "In order to show you the most relevant results, we have omitted some entries very similar to the 76 already displayed." — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 17:16, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, I wrote the article and I am working on the translation.

<li>Comment: Every Wikipedia article (except protected ones, of course) can be edited by anyone with a working web browser, but the policy still stands that Wikipedia is not a place to write articles about oneself or one's own work. I'm a published poet with a book available for sale, but there's nothing on Wikipedia about me, because no one has cared to take enough note. I can't start an article with my name or the name of my book, just because others can edit it. I wish you well with your project, and perhaps if it becomes notable enough, someone else will write an article about it. —<a href="../../../a/s/d/User%7EASDamick_bcf2.html" title="User:ASDamick"><font color="blue"><b><i>A.S.

<li><b>Conflicted</b>. Sounds like an extraordinarily interesting project, and verifiable, to boot. But I suppose "interesting" isn't enough to establish "notable." An interesting project <i>idea</i> doesn't deserve an article in Wikipedia, but an interesting ongoing <i>project</i> with some discernable progress toward success does. To me it all comes down to the fact that the person who started and runs the project probably does <i>not</i> have standing to judge notability for Wikipedia. So what I'd really like to see is, either the article is deleted and if it is truly notable presumably some other, unrelated Wikipedians will create a new article on it, or else said Wikipedians will rework the article so that it's not written by someone with a vested interest in promoting the project. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> (<a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jdavidb_e085.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jdavidb">contribs</a>) 22:06, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>And on a personal note, Ronconte, all the best to you on your project. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> (<a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jdavidb_e085.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jdavidb">contribs</a>) 22:06, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Having looked at this, I would find it more likely to be considered notable if some of the longer books were completed, such as one of the five books of Moses, or one of the Gospels. As it is, it's difficult to truly answer the question "Will this project still be around in a few years?" and "Will it actually be completed by 2009?" Wikipedia does not need to look like sourceforge.net, full of pages for every incomplete project concept. That's not to discount the value of the work already done; that's just to raise the question of whether or not enough work has been done to justify calling it "notable." If CPDV has enough value to stand on its own without needing Wikipedia to bring attention to it, then it should be in Wikipedia. If it needs Wikipedia in order to attract enough attention that the project will succeed, it does not belong here. Kind of a catch-22, I know. It should be up to the project itself to establish merit with its track record. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> (<a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jdavidb_e085.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jdavidb">contribs</a>) 22:12, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This article on the CPDV differs substantially from someone writing an article about themselves or about a book they wrote because it is a version of the Bible. It is 23% completed by a count of the verses. The Book of Psalms is completed; the Psalms is the one book of the Bible that is perhaps most often published on its own. Also, I read somewhere in Wikipedia that some articles are accepted by someone writing about their own work (can't find it now). Therefore, I suggest instead of deleting this article, changing it to a stub, so that other persons can begin a new article from that point. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonconte_1841.html" title="User:Ronconte">Ronconte</a> 00:03, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It isn't a value judgment on the work, which may well be fantastic, on the level of St. Jerome himself. Should anyone who starts his own translation of the Bible get into an encyclopedia? Wikipedia's policy answer to that question is "no." Just as claiming to be God (a much more important sort of claim than making a Bible, don't you think?) isn't enough to get one put into an encyclopedia, making a version of the Bible is not enough, either. <b>Notability</b> has to be established, and it cannot be established by the fiat of the writer/translator/worker in question. Wikipedia records notability. It doesn't create it. It's not a place to get press for one's work. If your work truly is notable, making some sort of verifiable impact on Biblical studies/religion/etc., someone else will start the article. You suggest changing the article to a stub rather than deleting it, but is that because you fear that it wouldn't otherwise see the light of day? If so, then that even more proves the point about the need for notability to be established by someone other than the one with a personal interest. —<a href="../../../a/s/d/User%7EASDamick_bcf2.html" title="User:ASDamick"><font color="blue"><b><i>A.S.

<li>For what it's worth, I found this article while looking for a public domain Catholic Bible for a software project. The CPDV is exactly what I was looking for. Well, it will be when it's done anyway.&#160;:-) But Mr. Conte has more than enough done for me to get started. I'd like the article to stay. Or I would also consider writing a repleacement article once I am more familiar with the project. --LawfulGood 08:48, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Bk0 provided enough solid information to support this article staying up, but I also wanted to note that because of the internet and the way information travels, Plan-It-X is a rare label who has been able to develop a significantly large, albeit underground, fanbase while sticking true to it's original intentions, which is certainly something that they should be noted for. And with the new direction Against Me! has taken with their music, they can hardly be considered folk punk anymore. This leaves Defiance, Ohio as <i>arguably</i> the most notable band of folk punk. --Superradjoe (<a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuperradjoe_0b8e.html" title="User talk:Superradjoe">Talk</a>) 08:51, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As I said in previous deletion entries, I do not believe that this is a significant enough deviance from those provisions to warrant deletion. Those provisions actually work against a band like this who choose not to become "notable", so to speak, due to their personal beliefs about music and life. They are very prominently known among people in the underground punk scene and have a sizable national fanbase. Superradjoe 09:21, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>“It's hard to say whether Gelman has discovered a new direction for American design, or whether he's merely unearthed a mutant, semi-underground strain. But there's an introspection here that's rarely found in American design which even in its more avant garde guises maintains a muscular directness and immediacy.”

<li>The quotation from "Creative Review" is about Gelman's book as a whole, not about GH specifically. The book's website has an "About Infiltrate" section, which says: "Well known, lesser known and completely yet unknown studios are featured in the book". So inclusion in the book <i>as such</i> isn't much evidence of notability.

<li><b>KEEP</b> - I can't believe that there is even such a debate on this issue! Yes, from my understanding, GH do commercial work but are primarily an artist collective that remain so through such work. The huge explosion of street art and the ensuing school of design that stems from it is hardly deletable. If you do not allow GH in, who are a very well-loved (internationally) outfit, then you will need to remove all of the others who live and practise the same balance of art and commercial art. That means no Shepard Fairey, no Futura, nobody that has walked the necessary line of artistry and design work. Are you to deny people interested in this generations leaders in street art/design culture voice and a place in Wikipedia? That is simply ERASING culture...Benveenyc 21:00, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Generally, these appeals result in scores of never-used-Wikipedia-before users blindly voting keep based solely on their experience with the subject. I do not claim that you do not have some loyal members, but their lack of knowledge in the policies of Wikipedia regarding inclusion and exclusion of topics is not constructive to the AfD process, even if the subject turns out to be notable. — <span style="font-variant:small-caps;font-family:sans-serif;"><a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbush_Commander_08e2.html" title="User:Ambush Commander">Ambush Commander</a></span><sup style="font-family:serif;">(<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbush_Commander_60e0.html" title="User talk:Ambush Commander">Talk</a>)</sup> 22:59, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Nothing wrong with that. It simply is NOT what Wikipedia is about. It is not a popularity contest and it's not about winning votes. It also is not a soapbox for any old 'artists' collective' or advertising agency.

<li>it is interesting to note that newstoday.com's public posting about this AfD has brought both DELETE as well as KEEP votes from new users, rendering the topic of fairness of public posting questionable. it is also interesting that if you go to the newtoday.com site, one can see that there is a lively debate both for and against the article. also want to mention that newstoday is a totally separate entity from GH and not affiliated in any way. they posted this independently and of their own volition. <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInspectorpanther_cc78.html" title="User:Inspectorpanther">Inspectorpanther</a> 05:21, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - not notable. One of many thousands of advertising agencies. Calling yourself an artists' collective does not actually make you one. This is just a regular old commercial venture. Even if GH WAS an artists' collective <i>pur sang</i> it still wouldn't warrant inclusion due to their insignificance at <b>this</b> time.

Would like to say delete because of business's clear keep campaign primarily for purposes of advertising. Although it possibly comes close to notability according to the article's contents (which needs major cleaning up and de-advertising), it only does so by association with bigger names and has no notability in its own right (except that of a conference whose name is misspelt in the article). <a href="../../../j/n/o/User%7EJnothman_5c31.html" title="User:Jnothman">jnothman</a> <a href="../../../j/n/o/User_talk%7EJnothman_b83a.html" title="User talk:Jnothman"><sup>talk</sup></a> 00:14, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I <b>reiterate</b> my vote above for <b>deletion</b>. Lerner tried to make a personal appeal to me. I reviewed the article again. The small number of installations in minor galleries and museums reinforces my conclusion that this non-notable art collective does not deserve a Wikipedia article. I also note that not a single top-tier university library or museum has started collecting this group's work. The only people interested in this group's junk are third-rate scholars who couldn't get tenure at <a href="../../../u/c/_/UC_Berkeley_d44e.html" title="UC Berkeley">UC Berkeley</a>, let alone admission.

<li>"Delete". Sorry GHava - I have seen your work and been to see you speak at conferences. Your work is good but I would not say timeless nor particularly groundbreaking. I do not agree with tDR inclusion either.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I think this is clearly a vanity page. Did GHava author this? This article lists services offered, if you refer to an article on Jan Tschichold for instance, this article does not list the services he offered, the only reason I can see for listing this information is commercial gain, and not in keeping with the spirit of Wikipedia. Ditto that for Peter Saville's listing, Alan Fletcher's listing, and many others.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, Pentagram is not on here, one of the most important design studios of the modern era. They have been FAR more widely publicised, awarded, praised and have done FAR more to further the cause of modern design, have broken much more new territory and dragged graphic design in much more interesting directions. Particularly the collaboration between new media, graphic design and architecture that they foster.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is, in my opinion, laughable that GHava hold themself to the same strata of importance as REAL pioneers and trailblazers such as Paul Rand, Saul Bass, El Lissitzky, Jan Tshicold, Josef Muller-Brockman, Neville Broday etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In regards to their claim as a serious 'art collective' - they call themself an agency - that in itself an obviously commercial position to take. The work they list and show is mainly for premier brands, Coke, Adidas, Volkswagen and MTV - perhaps they came to design from a art background, but they are obviously and wholly working within the commercial design service realm, but maintain an 'artistic' practise on the side.

<li><b>KEEP</b> Mrethan 21:29, 16 December 2005 (UTC) I notice that many entries on this page keep being deleted. This is supposed to be a forum of open debate. Erasing others' statements is intellectually dishonest. One can only wonder if the vandals are employees of competing agencies. In any case, this is what I originally wrote: This company clearly meets wiki's requirements for inclusion, in spite of the fact that those requirements are slanted in favor of public corporations. GH--which is almost as much a collective of artists as it is a company, and deserves inclusion on that basis alone--is admittedly in no danger of being used to index stock prices any time soon. But these five individuals have made an impact far disproportionate to their numerical strength through their seminal work with many listed companies, such as volkswagon and MTV (aka Viacom). And unlike many design agencies, these guys have had fine art shows as well. Wikipedia is enhanced by their inclusion. It should be, among other things, a storehouse of current knowledge about design, not simply a memorial to past movements.</li>

Obviously someone that has free time to output negative are simply not using their time wisely. Time wasted on spreading negativity are neither proactive and most likely not productive. Negative chatter, in my mind, equals too much free time.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - There needs to be more discussion about the points the meatpuppets have brought up. Sure, they may be meatpuppets, but that doesn't make arguments they present any less valid. That only means that we should take them with a healthy dose of salt. Totally ignoring them, in my opinion, is not very good. — <span style="font-variant:small-caps;font-family:sans-serif;"><a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbush_Commander_08e2.html" title="User:Ambush Commander">Ambush Commander</a></span><sup style="font-family:serif;">(<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbush_Commander_60e0.html" title="User talk:Ambush Commander">Talk</a>)</sup> 20:40, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree. The purpose of AfD is not to delete articles without debate, but to examine the merits of articles. In this particular case, however, it seems to me that the meatpuppet comments above assert notability without proving (or providing significant evidence of) notability. Working with listed companies is not evidence of notability. The existence of entries for comparable companies is not per se evidence of notability (per HorsePunchKid above). And none of this addresses the advert/vanity issue, as the article was created and almost entirely written by one of the principals in the firm. The sock- and meat-puppetry (and two instances of vandalism) are secondary to the discussion; their importance is in the tally, which is why I've tagged them. | Klaw <small>¡digame!</small> 21:18, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>KEEP: If not for being blessed with talent &amp; creativity, then simply for being young, motivated and courageous. The people behind GH avisualagency have embraced the world with their ideas full force. Those of you who say they are not innovative are just plain silly (for lack of a better word). Is there any art or music that is not influenced by something that came before it? I have not seen everything that GH avisualagency has produced but what I have seen is extremely philosophical and having this article listed on this website is very necessary because it is one more resource that can help the lucky people who stumble upon it to grow and see other artists perspectives about this huge world we all live in together.

<li>Unfortunantely, talent/creativity/youthfulness/motivation/courage can manifest itself without notability. When we discuss a deletion, we do not discuss the merits of an organization. We know the article could be encyclopedic, and the main case being made against it is notability. Claiming that the site is innovative and philosophical doesn't mean much in this aspect: can you back up these claims?

<li>KEEP: Whether GH is categorized as a small corporation, commercial agency or artist collective is besides the point. It is just a title. What’s more important for this discussion is to focus on the work GH has created. As a whole, their work and skills range from commercial to fine arts and many times meet somewhere in the middle, a combination that is lacking in most commercial work today. Graphic Havoc is both a notable and creatively influential design organization. As a first time Wikipedia user, I have read through this entire discussion and am fairly surprised at the adolescent tone of the debate. I’d like to stay focused and say that I see no real reason for the deletion of Graphic Havoc. The vanity issue seems to be the most reoccurring point, however, I read through the guidelines and found this line, “it is preferable for the initial author not to be an owner or employee of or an investor in the company”. Note the word preferable. Grounds for deletion would surely need more backing than this.Katiedecker 00:20, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>While it's not official policy, notability is a guideline and is widely used in practice as a major criterion in AfDs. It has become accepted practice, although as you probably saw, it's an ongoing debate, with many users wanting to codify notability rules as policy, and many others wanting them eliminated. In addition, you've spent a significant amount of time arguing that GHava <b>is</b> notable, both in comments on this page and by filling the article with possible points for notability. Are you now arguing that notability isn't relevant? | Klaw <small>¡digame!</small> 01:33, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> Ghava™ is an art collective, not only one of most inspiring design studios in New York and in the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their work, artistic and commercial, is very important because of their original experimental multi-disciplinary approach. It's possible to find precursors of the figure of the artist/designer in the history of art and design (pre-raffaelites, the Bauhaus school, Kandinskij, Munari, Warhol, only to name a few) and it would be stupid to consider ghava™ only as a mainstream advertising company. They operate in the border zone between art and design, between experimentation and design work, between research and commercial needs. Keep ghava™ in wikipedia.

If this discussion has taught anyone anything, it is that the AfD process on Wikipedia is riddled with flaws. Hence, all the heated discussions surrounding policy changes.

<li>Wikimeister, please familiarize yourself with Wikipedia's <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#Sockpuppets_are_bad" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">deletion process</a>. Being a new user does not help your credibility on one sentence votes. You are welcome to argue and present facts in favor of the article's inclusion, but simply saying "I see no grounds for deletion here" does not contribute anything useful to the discussion besides another voice saying "I agree." For long-time contributors, their approval/disapproval means a lot, but without that credibility, people will be prone to discount your opinions if they are not backed up with facts.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - LOL. The term might have some validity. I was thinking more along the lines of people who roleplay pretending to be related to each other, which is a relatively common phenomenon that is explored a lot more online than elsewhere. I think they call it "incest play" and its often used in BDSM circles in a similar way to "rape play". But this one, as mentioned, is ridiculous. The likelihood of accidentally meeting your mother online is so hugely remote this is not even worth worrying about. Mind you, they once did this on <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neighbours.html" title="Neighbours">Neighbours</a>, with brother and sister. Actually, sorry, twice they did it on Neighbours. Once they ended up in an actual incestuous relationship - the other time they just went "ewww".

<p>The author objected to speedy, so I'm going to slow route. This article has no context with which to explain itself, and is borderline gibberish. After reading it, all I know is that "furry love" appears over 31,000 times in google - I still don't know what <i>furry love is</i>. Since the page seems to have a reason to keep built into its body (always a suspicious move), I'll simply say that the google test isn't everything. After all, "make a left turn" appears www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22make+a+left+turn%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search 272,000 times in google - it doesn't get a wikipedia entry either. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBachrach44_302c.html" title="User:Bachrach44">אריאל יהודה</a> 21:10, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> A stub will not be a fully fleshed out article. It might be better to give the thing a chance rather than moving it in haste.

<li><b><s>Keep or</s> merge</b> with <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">Furry fandom</a>. It's one of the larger geek fandoms and has a established following with quite a few annual conventions. There's a substantial body of art devoted to it including some artists from respected animation studios (who contribute under pseudonym given the family friendly nature of their day jobs). I'm not sure this subissue deserves its own article, but the surrounding phenomenon is encyclopedic. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 21:48, 14 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I look into this more, the distinction between furry love and <a href="../../../y/i/f/Yiff.html" title="Yiff">yiff</a> blurs. A substantial number of Google hits refer either to pets or to fetish handcuffs. The text here isn't exactly gibberish: furry fans typically identify with one particular animal. So the question about finding a love interest from the same "species" has some potential relevance within the subculture. I haven't found an outside source that verifies the claim. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 00:36, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, this is an indiscriminate data dump. No way are we ever going to have articles about any significant fraction of these codes.

<li><b>Reduce or Divide</b>, This article is very important, but some parts of the article is pointless, so i suggest that we reduce this article and only keep the important stuff.

<ul>
<li>What's to reduce? There's really not much to the article other than the list of references and a some prose (some of whch got moved to a separate article) that came about because people didn't understand what a character reference was or the fact that not all references are allowed in HTML. Oh good grief. I just noticed that even <i>that</i> was made into a separate article: List of unused HTML decimal character references.

<li><b>Keep.</b> <i>I need this article.</i> I type ALT+NUM LOCK+CODE POINT to produce a unique character when typing in foreign languages in order to avoid having to switch keyboard layouts. I'm adding this article to my <b>Favorites Folder</b> right now so I can reference it whenever I need it.
<p>Also, please don't divide the list--that will make the characters harder for me to find. The 32 kb rule is a rule of thumb, not a one-size-fits-all rule. It is meant to be used only in cases where it would make the article easier to read (as in the case of all stylistic rules). Most online encyclopedia articles (i.e., on World Book Online or Encylcopaedia Britannica Online) are much longer than 32 kb.</p>
<p>As for the dead links, I agree it has too many--that's why the links should be removed, but the entries kept.

<li>I have no problems with this being deleted. However - several members of this band are from other more known bands from the Cleveland music scene, which is the reason for starting the article. There is a genuine interest in knowing where some of these musicians ended up. I plan on creating entries for those bands as well. This could add to the richness of the Cleveland area music scene entries. - Venominjames 10:54, 16 December 2005</li>

<li>Saying that you've read doesn't mean that you really read it. If you had read the article or the AFD submittion note you would notice that it is about a student-run tv station which is less than one year old, which means that it is completely not notable. If you had read the AFD you would also notice that the site reads as a personal website of that student-run tv station. So, seeing that you aren't at all familiar with what articles should and should not be present in wikipedia, here are a couple of notes (<a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_propaganda_machine" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">here</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_free_host_or_webspace_provider" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">here</a>) which you may find useful not only in helping you learn about what wikipedia is and isnt but also as a reference and basis for future votes. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> | <a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecanismo_b2ea.html" title="User talk:Mecanismo">Talk</a> 13:31, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The links I supplied are what anyone should have read before casting a single vote on a AFD discussion. I supplied them to you because, according to your actions, it seems that you vote without any basis besides what some define as being somekind of frustrated personal attack. If you believe that suplying information is somekind of rudeness I believe you maybe feel a bit unconfortable participating in a project whose prime objective is to supply quality information to everyone. Regarding the personal attack, please keep your votes impartial and strickly to the subject instead of using them as a frustrated means of trolling. It is of your best interest that you stop that behaviour.

Is it an argument that the editors are native greeks and some are living in Greece?!

<p>It is a lie that the journal does not publish original contributions. Even when it reproduces articles (which were available before only to subscribers) it publishes mostly completely UPDATED versions of them and it even offers entire books published for the first time in English as special editions. Furthermore, as from the last issue (September 2005) the journal increasingly publishes original contributions like that by David Gabbard &amp; Karen Anijar Appleton and the next (January issue) will consist entirely of original contributions. Finally, the accompanying Newsletter consists entirely of new contributions (already 24 of them) and many of the contributions to the NL have already been reproduced in international papers, magazines, indymedia etc. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheVel_a964.html" title="User:TheVel">TheVel</a> 15:13, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b> The journal, following the example of several serious theoretical journals, is offered on line. This means there is no capitalist publisher involved and therefore the journal can be offered free to all internet users and also secures a much greater degree of freedom to editors from profit considerations. The contributions are still refereed as in the journal’s predecessor D&amp;N. To say that the articles appear as reproductions is a falsification, distortion, and affront to those international authors who have contributed to the journal.

<li><b>KEEP</b>It seems to me that the same disgruntled person who began the attack against the journal Democracy &amp; Nature last month (using then the Paul Cardan nick), after his real motives (i.e. his personal vendetta against <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takis_Fotopoulos_db26.html" title="Takis Fotopoulos">Takis Fotopoulos</a> became all too clear and the vast majority of users voted to keep the entry, came back now. In fact he cannot even hide his rage betraying again his real motive (‘vanity page –self promotion for ONE Mr Fotopoulos’)! As regards the Editorial Board, it consists of an Editorial Committee which runs the journal and its members are based in Greece (apart from Takis Fotopoulos, the editor, who is based in London, UK). The International Advisory Board consists of well known theorists and activists of the International Left. The same applies to its contributors. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENarap43_5b27.html" title="User:Narap43">User: Narap43</a> Webmaster of the International Journal of Inclusive Democracy

Just a few hours after the comment by <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENarap43_5b27.html" title="User:Narap43">User: Narap43</a> was made, DisposableAccount added the following comment to his own account WITH THE CLEAR INTENTION TO COVER HIS STEPS AND DECEIVE WIKIPEDIA ADMINISTRATORS: “I specialize in spotting users who write either using no username, or simply an ad hoc username which hasn't been used anywhere else in Wikipedia and will therefore probably be discarded soon afterwards.

<li><b>Comment</b> Your tactics are well known since your intervention in the AfD debate on D&amp;N. This intervention had nothing to do with supporting Wikipedia’s policy and had everything to do with Goebbellian tactics! Then, when we complained that the result of the AfD debate was summarized inaccurately by an administrator as ‘no consensus’’, at the very moment when the vast majority of users sided against deletion of the D&amp;N entry, you wrote: “Of course you're going to get a majority when the same people show up and vote over and over again in favor of keeping your journal. The point however is what ACTUALLY EXISTING Wikipedians voted”. And you wrote this, in full knowledge of the fact that this was a blatant LIE, since the vast majority of ACTUALLY EXISTING USERS (as we proved) had voted against the AfD. This, excluding all those who have not contributed anything before to Wikipedia (although properly registered users) who presumably, according to some silly Wikipedia regulation, are considered somehow second class citizens! As regards your ironic comment about the “Sherlock Holmes business” you never explained the “coincidence” that you remembered to define your function in the Wikipedia, as a guardian of the above mentioned regulation, a month after you began to play this role and—again “by coincidence”—always in relation to the same journal (i.e. The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy and its predecessor, D&amp;N).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>There is a simple way to prove that we are wrong: can you give us exact data about how many other interventions in accordance with your self-defined function you have made, apart from the ones related to D&amp;N and its successor The International journal of Inclusive Democracy? Also, we would be grateful if SarekOfVulcan, who as he showed in the AfD discussion on D&amp;N specializes in checking DNS addresses, could do the same with regards to the addresses used by <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Cardan_1994.html" title="Paul Cardan">Paul Cardan</a> and DisposableAccount. It would be very interesting indeed if he finds a close similarity between the two addresses. Particularly so if they both are found somewhere in Illinois, where it is well known that the …Greek student who used the <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Cardan_1994.html" title="Paul Cardan">Paul Cardan</a> username presently lives! I hope that you will not use the cheap trick again of “Sherlock Holmes” business in order to avoid a substantiated reply. User:john 19:14, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Request</b> How long is this going to last? Five days have already lapsed since the request and the discussion seems to have finished (with an overwhelming KEEP). I think it is quite reasonable to ask the administrators to remove the AfD banner from "The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy" --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheVel_a964.html" title="User:TheVel">TheVel</a> 18:00, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think the result is no consensus (once you exclude unsigned votes); that means a keep. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 00:31, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Why are the opinions of the Editorial Board disqualified and the opinions of Disposable Account (who we believe is the disgruntled ex-member of the Editorial Board who was posting also under the nick Paul Cardan) are not? We asked for evidence that Paul Cardan and Disposable Account do not have similar addresses and we haven't received a reply on this. Even if we exclude all those for whom Stifle and Sarek made dubious comments about john not signing as john sargis</li>
</ul>
<p>sandy not signing as Sandyshevack, and Stifle thanking Narap for identifying himself as webmaster of the Group, still this means that 66% of participants rejected the AfD. Isn't this a concensus? User:john sargis 21:22, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I just want to say that it was only a few hours ago that I realized there is an AfD on this page. Up to this point, I have NOT participated in it. I'd also like to point out that I had nothing to do with the AfD on the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy_%26_Nature_3533.html" title="Democracy &amp; Nature">Democracy &amp; Nature</a> entry. As anyone who is not blind can see, that AfD got started by <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarekOfVulcan_fb73.html" title="User:SarekOfVulcan">User:SarekOfVulcan</a> who is also not participating in the present exchange -- Paulcardan 23:37, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Good! But nobody provided yet the evidence requested about your address and that of DisposableAccount to persuade us that they do not refer to the same person. Also, although the AfD on the D&amp;N entry was started by User:SarekOfVulcan, the discussion page of D&amp;N shows clearly your crucial role in supporting it. Finally, I notice that the present Afd was made on 14 December and according to WP Deletion policy the lag time on articles for deletion is five days and at the end of this period a decision has to be made on whether to keep or delete the page concerned. Still, no decision has yet been made although seven days have already lapsed! User:john sargis 23:00 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: The number of people trying to push this to be closed is concerning me. I don't know why an administrator hasn't either closed this or marked it as a relist for lack of consensus yet. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 00:30, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: This is scandalous! In clear violation of WikiPedia rules the AfD banner remains 10 days after it was put there by a well known malicious user--as it was shown above!!! What forces this silence????--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheVel_a964.html" title="User:TheVel">TheVel</a> 11:10, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> I vote to keep, because Stifle is suggesting to stifle my vote and be discounted because I didn't sign "properly". The Journal is extremely important as a theoretical analysis that the anti-systemic Left badly needs. User: john sargis 10:20, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> I vote to keep the Inclusive Democracy journal , for its anti-systemic stance against the transnational elites' increasing concentrations of economic and political power. User:tommy silva 11:55, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
