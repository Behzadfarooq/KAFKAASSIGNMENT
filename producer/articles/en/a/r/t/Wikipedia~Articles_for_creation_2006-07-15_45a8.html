<dd><b>Comment</b>. Yes, your worry was justified.&#160;:) In order to use an article published elsewhere as a Wikipedia article, the author can't just have given permission to <i>distribute</i> the article; the author also has to have given permission for others to <i>modify</i> the article (since Wikipedia articles can be edited by anyone). This is extremely rare, and doesn't seem to be true in this case. The created article has already been flagged as a copyright violation. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 22:44, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Orpple is the name of a website begun July 4, 2007 by J G Gutierrez in Miami, FL. The idea came from a drink made by combining Orange Juice and Apple Juice in equal parts, thus making Orpple. It also implies the force of synergy of two different entities combining into one. The website is meant to be a portal for advanced graphic services including CAD and GIS as well as email services. It is yet under construction.</p>

<p>Brian was...is...one of the best, most superior coxswains produced in the sport of rowing, not only in Canada, but worldwide. He is an enigma. Brilliant, terrifying, unique, a character.</p>
<p>Many feared him, many admired him, many....</p>
<p>He won the elusive Olympic Gold Medal - at 6'0" and 110 lbs...not a minor feat. It resulted in bleeding from his ears - something many of his crewmen didn't realize.</p>
<p>He was a true athlete and Olympian, giving his heart and being to his team.</p>
<p>Winning the ultimate victory - the Olypmic Gold Medal in the 1984 Mens 8+.</p>

Marc's name has also been taken by a member of the rugby league forum - League Unlimited. This showed the respect Marc has commanded in his brief stint at the Raiders.</p>

<p>Terubozu, or Teru-TeruBozu, is a marionette made of cloth or paper used by Japanese children to send rain away.</p>
<p>The spirit of Terubozu can in fact bring fear on Amefushi (the spirit of rain). He is an enemy for children, who can’t go out to play when it's rainy.</p>
<p>Amefushi, actually, is not an evil spirit: he only wants to play with children… but he can’t, because he brings rain with him.</p>
<p>Terubozu and Amefushi are sworn enemies. To create a Terubozu, you need to cover a spherical ball (or something similar) with a piece of cloth or paper, and bound it up under this “head”. Then, you can paint eyes, nose and mouth. Hang it out of your window when it’s rainy, and he will bring fear to Amefushi… in this way sun will appear again!</p>

<li><b>Declined</b>. Judging from your username, you are the doctor in question, and submitting articles about yourself is generally considered <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">very bad form</a>. I did my best to look at your sourcing objectively, but it doesn't quite seem to establish the usual level of notability. Since you are a registered user, you could create this article yourself if you wanted to.

Team Turnip is a musical project based in Edinburgh, Scotland constituted by several members, some real some fictional. The real members provide instrumentation, moral support and the occasional chorused vocal whilst the fictional provide inspiration largely due to their insistence to chose their own paths in life which breed both comedy and tragedy, such is the rich and variegated pattern of life's unique tapestry.</p>
<p>The project is steeped in myth and lore but it is rumoured to be curated by a follicly challenged violinist who, in the early 90s, was prevalent in the north east folk music scene culminating in a tour with the legendary Shetland fiddler Aly Bain. The protagonist is believed to have been brought up in the North East of Scotland by his biological parents and forced to play the violin from the age of 4 and a half. The protagonist showed remarkable aptitude for someone who did not enjoy practising or playing said instrument. The protagonist briefly took piano lessons but was sacked by his piano teacher for not improving. Years later the protagonist's scars had healed and the piano was revisited, along with the guitar. It was only then that he was able to begin writing music.</p>
<p>Team Turnip specialise in melodic chamber-pop. Its compositions are based around guitar or piano lines which are then supplemented by simple string arrangements and a plaintive descanted vocal. The melodies are a highly contagious, air-borne form virus which cannot be cured by normal medical practices, a cure has not yet been found. The lyrics are generally driven by narratives and punctuated by character vignettes and are often tragic in nature.</p>

<p><br />
Play is a very special and important part of childhood. Playing permits a child to experiment with the things around him and the emotional world within him. We, as adults, call this ‘child’s play’, but a child starts his education from here. Through play, a child comprehends how to solve problems, develops building skills, overcomes physical and mental challenges etc. A toy helps in developing a child’s self confidence, creativity, independence, intelligence and clears his/her concepts. From the day of your child’s birth till he starts school, a parent is the educator or teacher he has. A parent is the most important and influential person in a child’s life. The informal education given at home lays the base for the formal learning at school. At home, a child always looks up at his parents for help. Children are like wet cement or clay; you can mould them the way you want.</p>
<p>For the development of their fine and large or gross motor movement, for the growth of a child’s hand - eye co ordination, it is extremely important for him to ‘play’ with the natural things around him. Sand or mud or clay and water play a significant role here. Splashing in water, squeezing a sponge, making lines in water and watching them disappear, blowing bubbles in water, swaying your hands in water, watching toys or objects sink or float in water, creating bubbles while filling bottles from a tub of water or watching water go up and down in a small piece of transparent hose pipe educates a child. Most of these activities can be conducted while we bathe a child. Similarly, sand, mud or clay play an important part in the development of a child as water does. Both help in the development of the fine motor movements and hand eye co ordination. Running, jumping, kicking, walking on and in a line help in the development of the large or gross motor movements of a child. It has been observed that children concentrate better after a run in the school compound, when they are physically tired but mentally alert.</p>
<p>Playing with educational or Montessori toys is extremely important for children as this enhances their Visual sense and helps in the cognitive or mental growth of a child. Visual sense deals with the sense of eyes, to perceive the difference between shape, size and dimension. It gives the child an opportunity to discriminate dimensional differences and grade the objects according to size, shape and thickness. They train the chromatic sense of the child, teaching him different colours and their shades, the intensity and purity in each colour. This in turn helps a child to express himself better and appreciate artistic expression. Knobs on puzzles prepare the child for writing through the correct holding of the knobs and a child learns to discriminate dimensional differences through the sense of sight. Educational toys help in making learning interesting, help in a child’s mental growth, build his imagination, sharpen his observation and memory, enhance his finger co-ordination and visual discrimination, increase his concentration, attention span and logic.</p>
<p>Holding dolls or soft cuddly toys gives a child a sense of security. For similar reason, some children hold onto a piece of cloth or sheet when sleepy. This is very important for them, let them hold. As they grow older and feel more secure, they generally get out of this habit.</p>
<p>Through play, you can develop:</p>
<p>• Visual and observation skills • Early mathematical skills • Self help skills • Listening and concentration skills • Early manipulative skills • Concepts of direction and position • Early language and reading skills • Concepts of time, colour and texture • Social and emotional development</p>
<p><br />
Pretend play is what children enjoy most. Objects or house furniture is included in their imagination. A chair is transformed into a car or a tennis racket becomes a gun. Imitating their teacher or parent is the favourite role of most children. He enjoys enacting what he has witnessed at home or at school. Superman and policeman come next in line. This shows the social behaviour of a child. Children take pleasure in dressing up for role play. It is a good idea to have a ‘dress up’ box for them. This box can have clothes, hats and caps belonging to all the members of the family even if they are rather large for the child. Pieces of cloth and objects the child generally uses for pretend play can also be a part of this box.</p>
<p><br />
As parents, you should join your child while he is playing but always wait for him to ask you to come. During ‘pretend play’, ask him who you should be, let him take the lead as he is the boss at that moment. Kids enjoy being in charge. Enter his world of imagination and fantasy and let him control you. This helps in building his self confidence and he feels secure and safe with you, in sharing his things and ideas with you. You build his self esteem and morale when you give him all your time and attention during pretend play. When your child realizes that things of his interest are important for you and that you appreciate his method of fun and play, he gets confident of himself.</p>
<p>Some children prefer ‘solitary play.’ These children are generally very lonely and have no one around to play with. They do not learn to ‘give’ or ‘share’, do not like to interact and always stay in their own shell. They prefer to do all their activities alone, just by themselves.</p>
<p>Kids learn to share through parallel play. They do not have to play with the same toy or share a game, just doing different activities while sitting in a group is parallel play. Gradually they start interacting and communicating with each other. Their social skills increase when they indulge in an argument or quarrel.</p>
<p>Usually from ‘parallel play’ children graduate to ‘co operative or group play’. This normally happens when they have learnt to share, care, give and take. They interact and communicate well with each other and prefer to do all their activities together. This shows that their social and emotional skills have developed and they are confident of themselves, of whatever they do.</p>
<p>Give your child time, play with him and make him a confident human being.</p>

<li><b>Declined</b>. This is a very good essay, but that makes it a very poor Wikipedia article in two ways. First, encyclopedia articles must be written from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. You're encouraging parents to play with their children, and I agree with that, but encyclopedia articles don't <i>encourage</i> anything; they just present the facts and opinions on all sides of an issue and let readers draw their own conclusions. Second, Wikipedia articles can (and should!) be edited by anyone; so they must be written from an anonymous point of view as well. You cannot sign a Wikipedia article, since that suggests that you <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a> it and that others should not edit it, which would be wrong. I wish you luck in publishing this essay, but Wikipedia isn't the place. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 00:09, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The Grand Prix of Minnesota 1996 - 1998 was an auto racing event held on a Alan Wilson designed temporary street course in Minneapolis, Minnesota near the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. It was known as the Children's Grand Prix of Minneapolis in 1996, changing its name to The Sprint PCS Grand Prix of Minneapolis for its final two years.</p>
<p>The Grand Prix of Minneapolis was started as the first professional auto race in the United States that would contribute all of its profit to charity. The goal of the grand prix was to make a $1 million annual contribution to Cancer KIDS Fund, part of the Children’s Healthcare foundation of the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>The grand prix was founded by Mark Cohn, president and CEO of Damark International, and his wife Claudia after their youngest son Tyler (1988 – 1997) was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of 4. They knew first hand what families dealing with childhood cancer face, and found that the Cancer KIDS Fund helped these families with some of the expenses that were not covered by insurance or other agencies, like parking fees and educational material for missed schooling. Rather than just writing a check, the Cohn’s decided to create an event that would provide long-term support for the Cancer KIDS Fund.</p>
<p>The grand prix debuted on July 6-7, 1996 with Boston Market as the sponsor, returned for it’s second year on July 4-6, 1997 with Sprint PCS as its sponsor, and was held a final year on June 27-28, 1998 again with Sprint PCS as its sponsor.</p>
<p>All three years had the SCCA Trans-Am Championship as the featured race. Supporting races in 1996 included the World Challenge Grand Sports Division - Sports 2 and Touring Division – Touring 1 and 2, Spec Racer Ford Pro Series, and a Vintage Car race. Supporting races in 1997 were the Barber Dodge Pro Series, World Challenge Touring Division 1 and 2, Spec Racer Ford Pro Series, and a Vintage Car race. Supporting races in 1998 were the Can-Am Series, GT Series, U.S. F2000 Series, World Challenge Touring Division 1 and 2, and the Dodge Neon Charity Challenge.</p>

<p>The classic B-52 cocktail shooter is reknowned for it's orange-and-coffee taste. The three ingredients are Bailey's Irish Cream, Grand Mariner Liquer and Tia Maria (although any coffee flavoured liquer will suffice).</p>
<p>The shot should be layered so the ingredients remain seperate. This means that when the shot is consumed, the drinker will first taste the creaminess of the Bailey's, then the strong coffee flavour and finally the orangey kick of the Grand Mariner's.</p>
<p>The shot is a variation of a BMW.</p>

<p>On the planet of music, in the year of 2002, there was a band born. This wasn't just any band, but a band that was destined to rock the city of Vancouver like it was 1999. This band consisted of a girl who strummed a guitar like a mad cavewoman (Jessica "Jurassica" Emdee), a girl who was inexperienced, but started banging on pots and pans anyways (Ariel "Areola" Kwiatkowski), and there was also a boy whos shredded on guitar. The name Chris rings a bell, but unfortunately these three parted, came back together and couldn't make up their minds like a woman craving different foods on her red days. After awhile of trying to make music, the three made a song or two, but they ended up parting for "good." Eventually, the two ships of Ariel and Jessica sailed together again and they made some music. Then they parted and Chris' battleship of rock came in and Ariel was making some music with him. In the end, Chris and Ariel jammed every once in awhile, but they weren't making music on a regular basis as a "band." Chris had other things to do, so he went away like Pokemon did. Pikachuuuu! Ariel had no one to play music with, so being quite lonely (1-800-Areolas Need Love Too - call if you're feeling lonely and need some guidance or perhaps your fortune read. I be like Cleo mah children!), she called another shredder, by the name of Teryn "Crazy Muscle Bump" Kilgore (Teryn had called Ariel previously, because of a flyer put up for a needed guitarist in the non-existant Ariel and Chris band). They started jamming and trying things out, which was going well because Ariel liked his skill and his influences of different music.Then, out of the blue, after Ariel had recieved a letter from Jessica about not playing anymore (when their ships parted), Ariel force-fed Jessica the chance to rock again like the old days. Jessica accepted it, and came back with even more creativity than before. Her great riffs, lyrics and singing style clashed really well with Teryn's very fast, impressive solos and strumming abilities. Ariel just hit a few things here and there and it seemed to match with the guitars.Jessica and Ariel started going to the crazy place full of crazy rockin' ladies known as the RRCFG (Retracting Robot Cucumber Female Genitals) or Rock N' Roll Camp For Girls. There, the two met Blake "Awesome Bassist" Petersen (who originally played guitar, but likes bass more because she likes to thump thump on it, ooh dirty). But really, she plucks it like a unibrow. After Blakie-poo was found, the band started to get everything together, play shows, and even get some recording done (not on a cheap-ass videocamera! Yay!). The band just finished their super cool, took-really-long-to-make demo with 6 songs on it, including the new, funny song "Midnight Vultures." The demo is going to be sold mostly at shows, but whenever from the band mates for $3, because we aren't mega-famous freakos that make everything too expensive to enjoy.Besides all of that loveliness, the band is continuing to play shows in Portland, hopes to get more shows and possibly tour soon around the Northwest (hint to all of the nice people who book bands and people in bands!). We love to play shows and have a dandy time with people, so if any of you cool cats and mammas are in a band around the Northwest and want to play a show or go on tour with us just message one of us about it. We want you!To all the fine ladies and gentleman that have already seen us live, give yourselves a pat on the tush, thanks, and we love you. So much that we want your company at every show from now on, and if you haven't seen us. Do it. We want everyone's company, love, and we want your badass selves to get into the pit and boogie 88.73.226.0 15:58, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Biography: Joe Simmons was one of the first internationally respected African-American, adult film stars of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Born with the given name Thomas Williams, he got his start in the entertainment industry by building sets. Later, he studied acting and participated in quite a few off-Broadway shows. He even appeared on Phil Donahue as a nude model.</p>
<p>After beginning a bodybuilding regiment, he appeared in several magazines and then worked as a model for photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. He was well-known for his great physical stature as he stood 6'4" tall. His prosperous career took a turn when he learned he was HIV-positive in 1994, and told his family. It brought them together much more closely, and he died in New York City with the family at his side. His death was associated with complications from AIDS in 1995. Some of his popular films included Black Magic, Black Power, Black Workout 3, and The Best of Joe Simmons.</p>

<p>Marty (played by Martin Klebba) features in both "Pirates of The Caribbean: Curse of The Black Pearl" and "Pirates of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest". He is the smallest member of the second crew Captain Jack Sparrow forms to man the <i>Interceptor</i> in order to persue Barbosa and the <i>Black Pearl</i>. Marty has only one line in "Curse of The Black Pearl" ("Jack owes us a ship") and functions primarily as an extra. However, his role in "Dead Man's Chest" expands somewhat and he takes a more active part in the film.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-15_45a8.html" title="Edit section: Minto Sailing Dinghy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Minto Sailing Dinghy</span></h2>
<p>The Minto Sailing Dinghy began its life as a skiff for a 24 foot sloop built by Hugh Rodd at Canoe Cove on Vancouver Island. The sloop was commissioned by a Vancouver Island printer who had made some money from an investment in the Minto Mine in British Columbia, and hence he named the sloop "Minto". After returning from WWII in 1946 Rob Wittlesey purchased the Minto and shortly thereafter traded the skiff, with "MINTO RVYC" carved into its transom, to Bob Schoen of Orcas Island for a smaller dinghy. The Minto skiff eventually got stored in Bob's barn, where his friend Heine Dole, a NW marine architect, saw it and convinced Bob it would make a great dinghy reproduced in fiberglass.</p>
<p>Heine took the skiff to Ed Hoppen, the Gig Harbor boat builder who was the original builder of the popular Thunderbird sailboats. After cutting out about two feet and reshaping the hull, Heine and Ed used the old Minto skiff as the plug for the first fiberglass Minto mold. Ed Hoppen produced a couple hundred EDDON Boat Yard Minto's in the early 1960's, and then in the mid 1960's licensed Howard Smith, the owner of Ranger Boats in Kent WA, to add the Minto to his increasing line of small rowing and sailing craft. Until Ranger was sold in 1999, "Smitty" produced about 1000 Ranger Minto's, becoming one of the most popular and recognized yacht tenders in the NW.</p>
<p>Although the little steamship graphic displayed on the sails of the EDDON, Ranger and Rich Passage Boats Minto dinghies implies a direct link to the SS Minto steamship that operated on Arrow Lake in British Columbia for over 50 years, the association was created by Ed and Heine. They were looking for a way to make the new little fiberglass dinghy distinctive and they thought there was a similarity to the life boats used on the SS Minto and so chose the steamship graphic for the Minto.</p>
<p>In 2005 Rich Passage Boats, LLC (<a href="http://www.richpassage.com" class="external free" title="http://www.richpassage.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.richpassage.com</a>) put the Minto back into production as the Rich Passage Minto, using one of the two former Ranger Minto molds.</p>

<p>Very few written accents exist in English. In some foreign imports like rôle, careful writers will use the circumflex accent as found in the original French. Some languages depend on written accents to differentiate between meanings of homonyms or to show pronunciation. Spanish is a good example: ésta, esta, and está are different words whose meaning, pronunciation or syntactical function are clarified and/or specified by the accent. The first ésta (is a pronoun meaning "this one", "the latter") is accented on the first syllable. Está is a verb (he, she or it is) and is accented on the last syllable. Esta is an adjective and accented on the first syllable. Tú is a subject pronoun meaning you, "tu" is a possessive adjective (your).</p>

<p><b>Hoshikawa Subaru</b>: To start, the main character's name is Hoshikawa Subaru. His father, who was working in space research had gone missing in the past, and as of yet has still not been able to get over that loss. Subaru is currently in the 5th grade, and has now, by meeting "Rock" opened up an amazing future for himself. The glasses Subaru wears on his head are called the "Visualizer". With that Subaru is able to see the Denpa Sekai (Radio Wave World), which from the pictures appears right above the real world (on the Wave Roads) only when Subaru is Rockman.</p>
<p><b>War Rock</b>: Subaru's partner in this game is an FM (pronounced just like the letters are, ef em), no, not Navi. An FM alien from space called "War Rock". War Rock finds it strange upon meeting Subaru that Subaru is able to see him, as he is under the impression that humans of that planet should not be able to see him. But during conversation, War Rock lets Subaru know to call him Rock (as it is short for War Rock). War Rock- sorry, Rock, seems to have a body of his own, but upon fusing with Subaru, their bodies combine and he becomes Subaru's Rock Buster and Subaru becomes a Rockman.</p>
<p><b>Ushijima Gonta</b>: The tough kid who acts like the boss of all the other kids. His mark is ox horns and the face, and he too has an FM.</p>
<p><b>Ox Fire</b>: Gonta's FM, and seemingly the first boss. Other characters aside from Subaru too, of course have FMs. Ox Fire seems to fuze with Gonta (although looks nothing like Gonta) to fight against Rockman. Ox Fire has burners on the back of both arms and often charges from the back row at Rockman. He too, of course, as an FM is an alien to the planet Earth. No information about how Gonta came in contact with Ox Fire, nor does it say for sure that Ox Fire is Gonta's FM... but based on the kanji used in Ushijima (ushi - cow/ox) and the mark appearing on both Gonta and Ox Fire, it seems obvious that this is indeed so. Shirogane Luna<b>: A daughter of an high class family who shows much self-importance, and one of Subaru's friends. Little information is given on her, but based on the poster given with the <a href="../../../c/o/r/CoroCoro_efa4.html" title="CoroCoro">CoroCoro</a> she will have an FM too where she will likely turn into the character who has a heart logo and a guitar also shaped a bit like an heart.</b></p>
<p><b>Saishouin Kizamaro</b>: A well informed kid who is one of Subaru's other friends. Nothing else much is said about him yet, and I can't really guess at his FM or if he has one (which he probably does).</p>
<p><b>Amachi</b>: A man working for JAXA (?). He's shown very briefly in one small image of the gameplay showing the conversation system where he's being introduced.</p>

<p>Background: the theorem is a result of a research about soap opras concerning the probability of the character "Don Pedro". The initial asumption was that the character apears in every soap opera, but it was declined by an soap opera warld class expert. And so after many sleeples nights and endless hours of watching soap operas the theorem was found.</p>
<p>The theorem: (Don Pedro)^2=(Betreyal)^2+(Murder)^2</p>

<p>“glantern,” rumored to be the novelist Thomas Pynchon, is a regular poster in internet discussion forums, most frequently the Portland TrailBlazers forum at oregonlive.com. His posts are characterized by dry wit, lowbrow humor, and obscurity in cultural and literary reference.</p>
<p>One example of this can be seen in glantern’s nickname for the former Portland TrailBlazer Ruben Patterson: “Captain Funions.” Ruben Patterson served a long suspension from the team during the 2005-06 season due to a conflict with head coach Nate McMillan, during which time he stayed in his hometown of Cleveland, Ohio. glantern speculated that he spent his time eating and imagining himself to be a superhero, and observed that in Act 1 of Shakespeare’s play Antony and Cleopatra, Cleopatra refers to her youthful licentiousness as her “salad days.” But Patterson, as glantern noted, would be extremely unlikely to be passing his time eating salad greens. Thus, the reference to vegetable-<i>flavored</i> junk food in his superhero name, Captain Funions.</p>

<p>Pacifica High School is a high school serving grades 9-12 in Oxnard, California. The school itself is the newest in the Oxnard Union High School District. The school's location, suburban residential, is part of the sub-community of West Village in the NorthEast specific community which also includes an elementary and junior high school nestled inbetween 1,200 homes. The school serves this community as well as the adjacent neighborhood, La Colonia Barrio and Rose Park among others. The 2005-2006 school year was enrolled with almost 3,500 students, 1,000 more than its original capacity of 2,500, making it the school in its district with the most students. The school has been recently accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.</p>
<p>History</p>
<p>Pacifica High School was established in 2001, only having a freshman and sophomore class that year, making it the school's smallest class for that year. Throughout the upcoming years more and more students enrolled at Pacifica making the schools desk supply run short. The school had to make special adjustments to accept the many new students by ordering new supplies and by removing their beach volleyball courts and introducing the fastest solution to ease an overcrowded school, portable classrooms, which are very common and widely seen in Oxnard schools, this because of Oxnard's close to 200,000 population. Pacifica High School now additionaly houses 14 portable classrooms apart from its 96. Special procedures have also been arranged with teachers, that being the sharing of classrooms, one teacher uses their classroom half of the day, while that teacher leaves home or to another classroom, another comes and uses that teacher's classroom.</p>
<p>Technology/Design</p>
<p>Despite the enrollment issues, Pacifica High School is a state of the art school with many technological advances and versatile classroom designs, and a very strong and united student body, which give it an enjoyable learning ambiance to spend four years at. Nine buildings and an East Coast School design make up the school and 14 portable classrooms fill in empty spots around the school. The school at first sight may seem like a higher education facility, but this only explains the beauty of the campus such as its design and versatility. The school, complete with many amenities, such as a Performing Arts Center and a Gymnasium, serves many extra-curricular activities, that without these facilities, would otherwise not be occuring.</p>
<p>Student Body</p>
<p>Pacifica's student body includes diverse ethnic backgrounds. The strong student government plans many school activities during non-teaching times that make the school an all around fun place to be.</p>
<p>Mascot/School Colors</p>
<p>The school's mascot is the water god, Triton, the school colors are black, green, and white.</p>
<p>Alma Mater</p>
<p>Forever our legacy endures With honor, strength, and pride. All hail the glorious victories Of the Masters of the Tides. In battle, Tritons never fail, For there's nothing that they lack. And all the powerful, strong, and true, Hail PACIFICA Green and Black!</p>
<p>Publications</p>
<p>The school's yearbook does not have a set name, changing every year, its current yearbook title is "From Blueprints... to Footprints," the school's new newspaper is called Currents.</p>

<p>A hyper coaster built by giovanolia at Six Flags Over Texas. The ride lasts three and a half minutes. on the way up to the top of the lift hill the dog chains create an huge amount noise. It is 245 feet tall. But has a drop of 255 feet with the use of a tunnel. Making it one of the few coasters with a drop longer than the height of the hill.

<p>KMJK 107.3 bills itself as Magic 107.3 which carries an urban adult contempary format for the Kansas City Area. Orginally in 1999 the station started with an R&amp;B Oldies format known as K-107 The Rhythnm and Soul of Kansas City which played R&amp;B from the 60's 70's and 80's. At the time the call letters were KNRX which were the old call letters for the old 107.3 The X which was a alternative station. They also carry the Tom Joyner Morning Show. In October of 2000 the station started to see success in the ratings and started adding music from the 90's into there playlist. On September 9, 200, three days before the attacks on the world trade center they flip the station to an Adult R&amp;B format adding Todays R&amp;B to the station. When Smooth Jazz 106.5 The City KCIY flipped to country they added smooth jazz to their playlist on sundays hosted by jazz artist Max Groove. In 2004 Cumulus bought the station along with sister KCHZ FM and tweaked the format to a more upbeat R&amp;B station. Currently now KMJK is rated #5 in the ratings.</p>

<p>Yes, believe it or not, Christmas wasn't the only holiday that nasty Grinch scored a television special out of. "Halloween Is Grinch Night," debuting in 1977, took the scourge of Whoville to the very bowels of All Hallows Eve, proving that annual treats that go to the well more than once a year are annual treats nobody wants to watch on television. The show has probably been rerun with some regularity over the years, but it's rarely been a candidate for prime time along with "It's The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown!" and that other one where Garfield ninja kicks a pirate ghost. It's worth a look for devout Grinch obsessors, but for the rest of you, just wait till Christmas.</p>
<p>The main problem is, it just doesn't seem very inspired. In "How The Grinch Stole Christmas," we're given so many pretty things to see and hear, I still couldn't name half of 'em despite having seen the special dozens upon dozens of times. Here we get something that feels more like an all-too-extended short. It was nice to see the Grinch again, but he could've told this story in two minutes flat. Dragged out for a thirty-minute time slot, the people behind "Grinch Night" had to resort to scenes where -- literally -- the green creature does nothing but rhyme gibberish together for minutes on end. Not "gibberish" as in "Whoville speak," "gibberish" as in "warbling gurgles." It's not the Grinch I know and love, but either was Jim Carrey, and I still watched that movie enough times to be committed. With Halloween's reservoir of TV specials sorely lacking, I'm personally glad for "Grinch Night" -- even if it did kinda suck.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
With that, we're back in Whoville. On top of looking different without those Whobilation decorations all over the place, Whoville also appears much smaller and nondescript. The freaky citizens notice a foul, odd wind blowing towards the town, and know what it means: GRINCH NIGHT is coming. The town boards up the doors and locks down the forts, deciding that the best way to defend against an impending Grinch onslaught is by turning their homes into tombs. They even show mother birds leading their babies into little caves with garage doors, a sight that would've caused more of a stir in a show that wasn't so decidedly Seussy. The idea, I as understand it, was that the wind led to this chain of events where animals hoot and holler all the way up the side of the Grinch's mountain, ultimately awaking that nagging voice inside him that dictates an insatiable need to frighten the Whos.</p>
<p>All of the action is underscored by what's gotta be the worst song ever tied to Dr. Seuss, but it serves a purpose in introducing us to the show's star characters. The little kid's name is Eukariah, and he's sort of your hero or something maybe. While his parents, of similarly stupid and difficult to spell names, are big proponents of this whole "BOARD UP THE HIZOUSE" plan, Eukariah feels that there must be alternative, better methods for dealing with Grinch Night. Just as he's approaching a Linus-like level of genius, Euka goes and ruins everything by announcing his trek towards the local "Euphemism," the Whoville outhouse. Kind of like detailing how to cure cancer and following it up with "I think I'm gonna go take a shit."</p>
<p>Even though his parents are acting like an unlocked front door is an invitation for murder, they happily let their #1 son do his #1 (I hope) business. Thankfully, they dissapear until the end of the show after this scene. Eukariah grew on me, but his parents were like these obscene alien dandelions who wouldn't stop talking about how they wouldn't open the front door for "one dollar and fifty cents." Something like that, I can't really remember because, after seeing Big Momma's House, I went to a neurologist who dabbled in alternative medicine to get surgery that'd let me block out the memories of painful movie scenes. Aside from the part where Martin's "hiding another flashlight under there," it's been an incredible success.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
And look, it's the GRINCH! Boris Karloff doesn't return to do the voicework, with the reings being handed to Hans Conried. The Grinch looks mostly the same, save for a few facial gestures that seem to confirm my belief that this is just some Who in a Grinch costume looking for a good time. Max the Dog is back, and though the pair were seen getting along famously by the end of Grinchie's Christmas special, now they're back to the more sadistic relationship where the G-Man snaps whips and speaks ill of Max's mother. Hmprf. Must be a prequel.</p>
<p>The Grinch, mostly in song, echoes the thoughts of those scared little Whos down in Whoville -- he's coming, all right, and he's thirsty for blood. The bloodthirst thing is more implied than actually said, but what else would you expect from a show that calls shit huts "Euphemisms?"</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Speaking of which, Eurakiah inadvertantly stumbles into the Grinch while on his merry way to the piss tank, and that spells trouble. Still, Eurakiah is a selfless soul, and he decides to stall the Grinch's trek in an effort to save his family and friends from whatever awfulness the monster had in store. What a guy! Oh, for the record, right before this happened, the Grinch was seen chasing down a fuzzy pink animal who bore a striking resemblence to a more flourescent Stephen King in his post-alien plant phase from Creepshow. I'm just saying.</p>
<p>To meet his desired ends, Eukariah decides to goad the Grinch into wasting time scaring him instead of the people down below. He confidently and almost insulting asks if the Grinch is really the Grinch, prompting the world's 376th antihero to laugh off the inquisition with amusement. Is he really the Grinch? He proves it with the scare heard 'round the world...</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Wait, no -- he's just mumbling incoherently, only in rhyme. I'm absolutely serious. The Grinch gets a whole song number here under the premise of scaring Eukariah, and spends the entire time speaking in tongues while his detached eyebrows float above his head. I didn't get it, and neither did Eukariah.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
The Grinch grows annoyed and weary, and upon seeing Eukariah's rather boastful disposition about the whole thing, opts to show him a "real scare" on their second meeting. This time around, no punches will be pulled. Eukariah is going to be transported into the Grinch's Haunted Dimension of Horrible Horrors, and if he can survive that, he can change his name to Eureka and do a touchdown dance.</p>
<p>If there's anything "Grinch Night" is remembered for most, it's the following scene. Some have said that what I'm about to show you was actually too scary for the wee little ones who'd be watching this thing, and while it's no Jason Voorhees or anything, yeah, I can see that. Imagery is just as powerful as action and the spoken word, especially to people still of the age to be totally usurped by whatever they see. Here's what Eukariah must endure in the Grinch's tormenting dungeon lair...</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
It's basically just this huge montage of spooky ghosts and monsters, with our hero running around like he's got the runs, trying to escape each new peril. What's shown in the above spread is only a small sampling -- there's too much going on to even keep track. There were gigantic ocean lobsters, spooky eyes, dancing ghosts, cloaked crows, and even a few living embodiments of bunny rabbit shadow puppets. Pretty cool, actually. I'm not sure if this is the kind of thing that would've had my crying to Momma, but then, it really shouldn't have been anyway.</p>
<p>This is also the only scene in "Grinch Night" that makes us remember the unending intricacies that made his X-Mas deal such a trip. Yeah, I said "such a trip." I haven't really done that in real life; this just seemed like a nice testing ground. Are you down with it?</p>
<p>At heart, we haven't so much watched "How The Grinch Stole Christmas" for its story, and maybe not even for its tunes -- it's all about those countless nooks and crannies, the kind that worked so well for Thomas' English Muffins. When Eukariah finally exits the Grinch's House of Horrors, so do my precious nooks and beloved crannies. It makes me sad when I watch "Grinch Night," and even sadder now, because this is the first time I've ever had an excuse to work "crannies" into an article. And now it's over. Thanks, Grinch.&#160;:(</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Alas, Eukariah survives the Chamber of Doom and announces that IT'S OVER. See, he previously theorized that the Grinch couldn't scare Whoville unless that ominous wind continued to cause a chain reaction of annoying sounds. He was right. The wind dies out, and with it, the Grinch's motivation to go medieval on the Whos. Eukariah's stalling has paid off -- if he didn't get the Grinch to waste time showing him dancing ghosts and monster eyes, the guy probably would've made it downtown just in time to scare the old ladies of Whoville into strangely spasmodic comas.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
The Grinch is confused, and who can blame him? He's somehow obligated to cease and desist because the wind stopped blowing? What kind of bullshit is that? The worst part is, he eventually accepts this amazingly convenient plot twist as an absolute truth, ordering Max to follow him on a sorrowful trip home. Max proceeds to ditch the Grinch, instead going home with Eukariah after a face-licking scene that seemed just a little bit too foxy for a kiddy show. Would the real Grinch have given up so easily? Ponder that.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Meanwhile, back at Whoville, Eukariah's become some sort of town hero for keeping the Grinch at bay. Just as the place starts showing signs of that Christmastime personality, the camera backs away in a decisive tease. I guess the working theory was that Whoville, a society established as being pretty oddball, would celebrate their version of Halloween by making the community appear as boring and lifeless as possible. What looks banal to us might be perfectly spirited to them. Look closely and you'll spot Max the Dog posing for a newspaper shot with his new master. Traitor. Canine. Crannies. Sorry, I couldn't resist.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Before the Grinch ascends offscreen, he promises to return another day, for another Grinch Night. Not gonna happen, pardnah. May as well give Easter a try because you totally blew your October shot. The video also featured a bunch of trailers for other Seuss toons, some of which starring the Grinch. Let me tell you -- compared to those, "Grinch Night" is a monkey's paw wish. Though he could never recapture the magic found in a land full of blinking lights and roast beasts, I enjoyed catching up with the Grinch here. It's not all I could've hoped for, but to be honest, I haven't really spent much time praying for more and better Grinch shows for any considerable amount of time. Maybe I'm to blame? I thought I was one of the good ones.</p>
