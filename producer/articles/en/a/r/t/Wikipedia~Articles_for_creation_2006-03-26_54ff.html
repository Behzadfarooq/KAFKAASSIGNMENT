<p>The Kachin National Organization is a political organization founded on the 9th of January 1999. This formation was the result of extensive discussion between the overseas Kachins and the elders from the Kachin homeland.</p>
<p>Since the cease-fire agreement on the 24th of February 1994, the Burmese military dictatorship has steadily built up more garrisons in our country with the clear intention to continue and establish military occupation.</p>
<p>Contrary to the people's expectations, the Kachin homeland today is without security due to the lack of definitive political policies. There is no economic opportunity amidst rampant inflation and people are reduced to the lowest level of subsistence. Equally lacking are proper healthcare and education.</p>
<p>This is an insidious destruction of the Kachins and at the same time a devious way of identifying the Kachinland with Burma.</p>
<p>The main goals of the Kachin National Organization are to regain the inalienable rights of people by establishing an independent Kachinland and restore their pride and freedom.</p>

<p>On Tuesday January 8, 2002, at approximately 1:30-1:40 PM in Dallas Texas, artist Tom Hendricks, walking home from a Taco Bueno restaurant, had an idea that became a conceptual art event that would challenge the abuses of modern art and suggest new directions in art. It was in response to Martin Creed winning the Turner prize that goes to the best art work from a British artist younger than 50. The prize was a check for $31,500 that was handed to him by Madonna. Turner got the prize for his exhibit of flashing light bulbs in an empty room. Creed had this comment, "If I can make something without adding any objects, I feel more comfortable". Hendricks, an artist himself of portraits, landscapes, stilllifes, abstracts, illustrations, etc; felt this was the ultimate in a long line of modern art abuses that have led away from technical skill, relevance, and art that communicates clearly to the viewer. He said in his essay "The end of modern art"&#160;: "And then it dawned on me. I would bring modern art to its end. I would suggest the ultimate, the ultimate in baffling minimalism.I would get the plastic check from Madonna. So on Tuesday 1/08/02 at 1:30 - 1:40 PM, as I was walking home from the taco place, I took art to its ultimate. This was the last minute of modern art. It could go no further. Where Creed had flashing lights in an empty room. I would imagine a gallery in my mind that would have no lights on at all! And I did. And that moment marked the end of modern art."</p>

<p>Serenity Now is an Alliance-faction <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guild.html" title="Guild">guild</a> in the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> computer game, on the "Illidan" realm. Illidan is a <a href="../../../p/v/p/PvP_f9e8.html" title="PvP">PvP</a> realm, meaning players can attack opposite-faction players (Horde vs. Alliance) in most geographic areas of the game. "Serenity Now" is a <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seinfeld.html" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a> reference, to a 9th-season episode about a failed relaxation technique. Serenity Now has a web site at serenity-now.org, and its members post frequently to an Illidan realm site called illidrama.com, where forum posts regarding the memorial subject are considered a bannable offense.</p>
<p>Memorial Video</p>
<p>The guild Serenity Now has become somewhat famous after members released a video where an in-game memorial is crashed. The memorial was to honor a respected player who died in real life from a stroke. The time and location were announced on public forums in advance - in an area where PvP was allowed. Most mourners were Horde faction, but did not challenge Alliance mourners. A raiding party of about 20 Alliance players surprised and "killed" about 50 unarmored Horde mourners, making for an easy kill. The raiders gained "honor", or credit for kills, but not money or items. Players do not lose money or items when killed. Most of the members of the raiding party were members of the "Gnomeland Security" or "Serenity Now" Alliance guilds. There are a few versions of this video available from the Google video search engine when "Serenity Now" is searched for. There have been many different reactions to this video, some good, others bad. However it has turned this guild into a name that many players of World of Warcraft will immediately recognize, for better or worse.</p>
<p>The Downfall of Serenity Now</p>
<p>The common misconception over the event is that many players on Illidan had an issue with the crashing of the memorial itself, they did not. The primary issue most had was with the comments made after the crash, varying the gambit from "she deserved what she got" and "I would have killed her if I saw her <a href="../../../i/r/l/IRL_9d17.html" title="IRL">IRL</a> too." Many Serenity Now members disapproved of this.</p>

<p>. Racial preferences came about in a number of differant ways. They can be attribute to a long history of segregation. They can also be linked some thing as simple as the different races having differatn comfort levels with other races. There are clear links that segregation in housing and housing choices has a number of links to lower status jobs, poor educational choices, and lower overall income. This than compounds the issue of housing which becomes a self prepuating cycle. AS Camille Zubrinsky Charles states in her article Can We live Together sociologists have linked blacks ans Hispanics and a small degree of Asians with feeling that racial descrimation and structural barriers are systematic. Sociologists have also shown that the oppisate opinion is held by whites. This is very important when discussing housing opportuinity 4.245.45.215 04:41, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aussie Rules UK was set up in London in April 2005 to introduce children in the UK to one of the most exciting and rapidly growing sports in the world – Aussie Rules. Thanks to the generous assistance of the UK Sports Minister, Richard Caborn, Aussie Rules UK is based in the offices of Sport England, the Government agency responsible for providing the strategic lead for sport in England. Two of the major aims in introducing Aussie Rules to the UK are to use its novelty appeal and focus on participation and fun to: 1. help combat the growing rise of obesity amongst children in the UK ‘Get a Kick out of life!’, and 2. help reduce the number of underprivileged children who get into trouble with the law ‘Kids in Sport are not in Court’.</p>

<p>In the mid-90s a bunch of students a bunch of guys from Salisbury (UK) jumped on the ska bandwagon and formed a ska-pop band called Spankboy. Originally consisting of three members, Tim Moore (singer/guitarist), Oli Toose (Drums)and Jo (bass) the band became ever popular in the Salisbury area after playing various venues, including The Salisbury Arts Centre.</p>
<p>The band were later joined by Richard LaVelle (Saxophone), Johnny Jennkins (Trombone), Jeremy Dunham (trumpet) and Paul Fields (guitar). After releasing their first album 'Adventures In Blue Flash' and the 'Medication' EP the band found new fame and notoriety after a UK tour with Spunge and joined the allegiance of The Moonska Europe label (<a href="http://www.spunge.co.uk" class="external free" title="http://www.spunge.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.spunge.co.uk</a>)</p>
<p>The band then recorded their second album with Philip Johnstone, on Led Zeppelin fame and changed their name to Solabeat Alliance. Dan Cole joined, replacing Jo on bass and helped them make their first video to the single 'All or Nothing'. After another lower key tour with Spunge the band finally dissolved in 2005.</p>

<p>In this era of Latin influences and the rising of Latinos in the United States, the emergence of Spanish language Hip Hop comes to no surprise. The increasing popularity of the lyrical style has taken off. A leader and major contender, Kinto Sol, holds its own, making a name for itself in a territory that is hard to conquer---the streets. Kinto Sol’s music is unique due to the vision of its members. The members, who were raised in different backgrounds, bring and mix various perspectives of life in their lyrics. Three brothers, Skribe, Dj Payback Garcia, and El Chivo, all born in Mexico, left their childhood behind in Mexico and were raised as teenagers in the United States. They have incorporated their childhood memories and their American experiences into their music. El Gordo, of Mexican Ancestry was born and raised in the United States of America. This is why Kinto Sol has the ablility to naturally relate to people and the ability to penetrate across both sides of the Mexican-American border. Kinto Sol captures life and portrays it in its music to the eyes of its audience. This dynamic group powerfully conveys the story of who they are and the people they represent in their style, sound and lyrics.</p>

<p>The story of Drew Pritt is one of the American experience. His father's family have been in the hills and valleys of West Virginia and Virginia since 1688. They helped build and run one of the areas railroads. His mother's family was one of those who immigrated to America, seeking the dream that has brought so many people to our nation's shores.</p>
<p>Pritt was born the son of a Presbyterian minister and a nurse. He was the youngest of four sons. At an early age, as the son of a minister, as a Cub Scout then a Boy Scout, or running errands for a crippled neighbor lady, as a child, even later in life, training in the uniform of the U.S. Army, or as a public school substitute teacher, my life has been one of service. Growing up in a family committed to the belief of service before self, Drew's father and my mother instilled in him, at an early age, the value of giving back to others.</p>
<p>He graduated from High School and attended the University of Arkansas system. In between college classes, Drew started to get paid as a professional political consultant. He also sought a commission in the U.S. Army as an ROTC Cadet.</p>
<p>He has spent time since graduating from high school as a substitute teacher in the public school system, a bartender, and even took and passed an EMT-Basic Course, and worked in an Emergency Room in a rural hospital, triaging patients.</p>
<p>Always very active in church, Drew is a member of Episcopal Diocese of Arkansas. He has served as a summer diocesan camp counselor. Also, in 2003, he served at the Episcopal Church's General Convention in the House of Bishops. He also was nominated by the Bishop of Arkansas, that same year, for Young Adult Service Corps. This is an Episcopal-based missionary program for young people.</p>
<p>However, Drew felt called to serve in the political process, as an advisor on GLBT issues, and staffer to General Wesley Clark in his Presidential Campaign. In the snows of New Hampshire, Drew saw firsthand the excitement of the political process at its finest. After working on the Clark campaign, Pritt went to work as the field coordinator and advisor to Matt Flynn for Congress in Wisconsin, then the Wisconsin Coordinated Campaign for the Democratic Party. Afterwards, Pritt moved home to Arkansas, his home, to make a difference.</p>
<p>Pritt is an avid sportsman; enjoying hunting and fishing. He also loves baseball, cooking, and reading. He says that in Lieutenant Governor, he will be a voice for every Arkansan, because his life experience has allowed him so much insight into the lives, the struggles, and the ups and downs facing so many Americans today.</p>

<p>Manuscript Society (founded in 1952) is the youngest of the secret societies with tombs. Though its tomb is the smallest in size, this physical stature does not reflect the prominent members who grace the membership, including notable journalists, academics, and entertainers. Among the Yale faculty and staff a few high ranking figures hold membership: Cyrus Hamlin (Yale University Professor), Thomas McDow (Yale University – Branford College Dean), Robert P. Jackson (Associate Director of Yale College Admissions), Stephen Parks (Beineke Library Curator) and Richard Brodhead (former Dean of Yale College – current President of Duke University).</p>
<p>Manuscript’s tomb was designed by famed architect King-Lui Wu. Though from the outside the building looks to only have only one level, it claims several: one ground level floor and three subterranean floors. The tomb’s seductive backyard is surrounded by a fascinating wall that guards off intruders, despite the fact that the society is more open (i.e. less secretive than its cohorts).</p>
<p>Each year, the senior class throws a small and highly-selective Halloween party (as noted in chapter “WOO” of Tom Perrotta’s novel Joe College [Perrotta also wrote the novel, Election, which was later turned into an acclaimed Hollywood film starring Academy Award winning Reese Witherspoon]). To be invited as a junior means that there are eyes upon you, thoughtfully considering your candidacy as a member (BEWARE). To be invited as a senior means that you are, likely, a combination of one of three things: Political and Powerful, Posh and Privileged, or Pretty and Popular.</p>
<p>Though Manuscript sometimes loses distinguished junior candidates to other societies because of its age and size, it is considered to be one of the most alluring and enchanting of the groups. Unlike the other societies, Manuscript is rumored to have a unique admissions process which includes faculty members, alumni, and the current senior delegation. Though each senior class to be chosen for the society is racially, culturally, extracurricularly, and academically diverse, Manuscript has often been considered to be the most promising of the societies because of the caliber, character, and charm of its members. Many of its members graduate and rise to prominent or distinguished post-graduate positions rather quickly (particularly in the field of entertainment, law, or academia). Additionally, many of the members have graced the Rumpus’s ’50 Most Beautiful People’ annual edition, and many are considered to be the most popular in their class.</p>
<p>RUMOR HAS IT  - When the trustees of Skull and Bones kicked their seniors out of the tomb for admitting a class that included women, the society continued its meetings in Manuscript’s Tomb (due to Manuscripts openness and generosity). - The senior delegation tends to be so attractive that they have occasionally held orgiastic events as a group, outside of the society’s building.</p>
