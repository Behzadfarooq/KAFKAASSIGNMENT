<p>Pokemon fan fiction webcomic, found <a href="http://pokemonx.comicgenesis.com/" class="external text" title="http://pokemonx.comicgenesis.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It's hosted on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_Genesis_e932.html" title="Comic Genesis">Comic Genesis</a>, which if you don't know is like the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geocities.html" title="Geocities">Geocities</a> of the webcomic world. Although the main author of the article keeps on insisting that the webcomic is popular in the article, I see no evidence of this. The alexa report for Comic Genesis do not even mention this comic, as seen <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=pokemonx.comicgenesis.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=pokemonx.comicgenesis.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

"How is this random website notable? How is it more notable than a typical blog, geocities personal or random fan fiction?" - Random website? Wow, really reaching there, aren't you? First off this isn't anything like a blog, it's an established webcomic that's been around a pretty good amount of time. Geocities personal? You of all people should know the difference between a geocities personal (You've posted enough) and a webcomic. Random fan fiction? Well let's see here, first off.. it's not a fan fic, it's an adaptation, definitly not a fan fic, so if these are the reasons that notorious webcomic basher Hahnchen, has to delete this article, and these are the reasons behind this whole AFD, doesn't it seem a bit pointless, I really don't think Hahnchen has even checked out this website to verify anything.--70.185.237.167 03:31, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No Vote/Comment</b> — Comics are similar to copy &amp; paste material, and content of latest comic is rather crude and immature.

<li><b>Question:</b> - How is this comic similar to copy and paste material, I don't see any evidence of that at all. Unless you're refering to how the frames of the comics are the same everyday so he must be cutting the images from his own source and pasting them into a template or something with each page. And what exactly did you think was crude, was it when Brendan said "I'm going to go on deck and play with my rod?" Yes, Brendan is a bit crude, that's how he is as a character. --70.185.237.167 03:31, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> I went to go read this comic after seeing this dispute, it doesn't really qualify as "fan fiction" as for popularity, since everyone knows Alexa doesn't list individual comics hosted by keenspace or comic genesis, you can't really check through them, this comic has been around a long time, updates frequently and has a pretty big fan base according to the amount of people registered at its forums, I think before you condem this article, you should work on better ways to prove it's not notable, rather than Hahnchen going off his hatred for all webcomics.--70.185.237.167 07:58, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Absolute Delete</b>. Pretty much your standard Internet fad AfD, complete with the nerfherders suddenly appearing in its defense, no doubt alerted by whatever party put the article up in the first place.

<li><b>Don't delete:</b> I see no evidence supporting that this ISN'T popular. All I see in support for deleting this page due to it's so called lack of popularity is this Alexa rankings page, which has been said by multiple commentors to not be an accurate ranking of a comic's popularity. I also see one commentor saying that Hahnchen, who appears to be the creator of this delete motion, has a hatred for all webcomics. Isn't this a bit biased? I believe one should have to provide more proof than an inaccurate rankings page and his/her hatred of webcomics. And just because YOU haven't heard of Pokémon X before doesn't mean the comic isn't popular. I feel more proof should be provided as to the status of popularity (and on that note, popular to who? The entire population of the earth? Wikipedia users? Web comic readers? Please clarify this.) before a deletion occurs. Mjc0961 13:22, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I'm a fan of these comics. This comic is running for two years and a half now, and even has its own small cult following it around. Nevertheless, I don't see many claims of notability provided on the world wide web...I actually don't see any at all, apart from some minor webcomic-lists, such as Top Web Comics. It received 67 votes last week..that's not enough to justify a keep in my opinion. Therefore, delete.<a href="../../../w/e/a/Image%7EWeather_rain.png_5995.html" class="image" title="Image:Weather rain.png"><img src="../../../upload/shared/3/3b/Weather_rain.png" alt="Image:Weather rain.png" width="16" height="16" longdesc="../../../w/e/a/Image%7EWeather_rain.png_5995.html" /></a><b><a href="../../../s/o/o/User%7ESoothingR_cd35.html" title="User:SoothingR"><span style="color:#AAAAAA;">Soothing</span></a><a href="../../../s/o/o/User_talk%7ESoothingR_fba1.html" title="User talk:SoothingR"><span style="color:#9AB9EB;"><i>R</i></span></a></b> 13:47, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Answer:</b> Considering that Pokémon X is rated 36 and Megatokyo is rated 43, I'd have to say less votes. I can't actually find where SoothingR got the number of 67 votes for the week, but if Megatokyo is lower, Megatokyo got less votes. Mjc0961 12:52, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - That's not because of popularity though, Pokémon-X probably can't go into print because pokémon holds the copyright, and also because it's a sprite comic, I don't recall a sprite comic ever going print, even if it has original sprites like A Modest Destiny.--70.185.237.167 19:31, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Point:</b> - I don't think it really matters how popular this webcomic is, the point is this, it's an established comic, that much is obvious, it's been around almost 3 years. It has over 400 pages, and it has a lot of history behind it. It may not be mentioned all over the web like some webcomics, but it does have a rather large following. And if some of you would take time to read it, it's actually a quite inventive adapataion of the games.--70.185.237.167 01:25, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> — Seems to me there's just a lot of arguing going on both ways without anyone giving any actual proof of anything. Alexa's rank means little, as Comic Genesis hosts many extremely popular comics, meaning a comic could actually become quite popular without getting a mention on Alexa. What this page actually needs is some reference to notability, and possibly a report of how many members reside in their forums. The only things I've gathered from this discussion are that it's not mentioned on Alexa, and it's been around for 3 years with a large archive. I took a look at it myself and while I'm not a fan of sprite comics it's certainly on the higher end of the quality spectrum. I will vote upon further proof of notability but for now I'd lean toward keep. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZaron_4a89.html" title="User:Zaron">Zaron</a> 18:48, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

Having a midi automatically play on your site is something of an automatic decrease to your notability, I'm afraid. -<a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhymeless_6a19.html" title="User:Rhymeless">Tim Rhymeless</a> <a href="../../../r/h/y/User_talk%7ERhymeless_4dd3.html" title="User talk:Rhymeless">(Er...let's shimmy)</a> 09:48, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> This webcomic is of great quality, has a consistent plot, and owns a reasonable fanbase who cares about the comic and its author. I began reading it four days ago under suggestion from a friend, and I was surprised to look it up here and see that it is in danger of deletion. This comic has been in the works since 2003, and although I know there are people like myself who are willing to read though the whole archive, a Wikipedia aticle will benefit those who want to just start at the current page, by providing the in-depth information on the characters and plot the site itself cannot produce. For those who have been reading it for a long time (and from I have seen, there are quite a few), an article can also provide any information they might have forgotten. I find it ironic that for a comic that is "unpopular," its article is quite a bit longer than say... <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inverloch_%28comic%29.html" title="Inverloch (comic)">Inverloch</a>, which nobody dares to challenge. I am aware that there are WikiCities or the like specifically tailored for webcomics, but in my opinion those are more aimed towards those who read a large number of comics and/or have the patience to even find those sources. Finding the article on the main Wikipedia site is quick and easy. -<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarranduin_ddbe.html" title="User:Sarranduin">Sarranduin</a> 23:52, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>The quality or consistency of the comic is <i>absolutely irrelevant,</i> and I see no evidence that the fanbase is significant. If the author wants a description of the plot or characters to bring readers up to speed, the author can do so on his or her own site; being Cliff Notes for webcomics is beyond WP's scope. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 07:30, 15 February 2006 (UTC)
