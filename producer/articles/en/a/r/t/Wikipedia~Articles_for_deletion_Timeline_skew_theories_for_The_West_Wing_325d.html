The issue of what happened to shift the timeline in the show is a large one. A large portion of this article was built from an article appearing in a British television magazine, <i><a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_Zone_ff84.html" title="TV Zone">TV Zone</a></i>. The fact that this theory is news-worthy, according to <a href="../../../n/o/_/WP%7ENo_original_research_1420.html" title="WP:No original research">WP:No original research</a>, makes it a valid encyclopedia article.

<p><b>Delete</b>. Very interesting material, but I'm having trouble seeing it as part of Wikipedia. Not all magazine articles qualify as news. Mentioning the sloppy writing and consequent inconsistent timeline on the West Wing page seems more appropriate to me. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 07:36, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>clean up</b>. There are other articles on similar TV-show based theories (I forget the name of it now, but there's the one connected with <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Elsewhere_3fa8.html" title="St. Elsewhere">St. Elsewhere</a>, for example). The citing of a magazine article, plus use of examples from the show itself, removes it from the original thought criteria, IMO. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 13:09, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I think a deleting this article and retooling the mention in the main article should suffice. The main theory of the one magazine article, that the 25th wasn't passed when it was in reality, is disproved almost immediately afterwards in the Time Skew article, so suggesting that that article makes the article valid is silly, as it is almost immediately set aside in exchange for fancruft theories. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaxringold_44f9.html" title="User:Staxringold">Staxringold</a> 23:20, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Fancruft is what wikipedia is all about. Or at least, partially about. As Scm notes, discussion of canon in various fictional universes is a common topic in wikipedia.

<li>The notion that cruft justifies more cruft is abhorrent to me; it seems like a very slippery slope.

<ul>
<li>I was being somewhat facetious. I do, though, think it's generally unfair if there's a long-standing section in an article which gets too long, and is split off into its own article, which then gets deleted as fancruft. It is to be added that this issue is far more central, I think, to the constructed universe of <i>The West Wing</i> than, say, the <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endor_Holocaust_90d5.html" title="Endor Holocaust">Endor Holocaust</a> is to the Star Wars universe. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 18:53, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep and Clean</b>. The article is of interest to certain readers of Wikipedia, generally <i>West Wing</i> fans, so the material is germane since the show has a large number of related articles. Given the potential size of this article, it should be its own separate entry. It does need to be cleaned up to the point where it appears as its own entry rather than a sub-entry, but that's all that it needs. -<a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeillan_309e.html" title="User:Keillan">Keillan</a> 17:11, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: A potential idea. Perhaps, instead of an article entirely devoted to timeline skew theories, we could create an article on what is known about the fictional alternative history of the show and the ways it deviates from actual history, which would include a discussion of the timeline skew issue. That way the timeline skew issue wouldn't get a whole article devoted to it, but it wouldn't all have to go in the general <i>West Wing</i> article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 18:58, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> about the previous comment. "The West Wing" is fiction, and fiction that isn't terribly careful about internal or external consistency on non-central points. For example, in the current West Wing universe, the Secret Service isn't providing (visible) protection for Santos and Vinick. Should I revise the timeline skew article to suggest that RFK wasn't assassinated, or Wallace wasn't shot? Maybe the timeline skew goes back much further -- there is, after all, no country called "Qumar" (or whatever) in the here and now. For it to exist, we pretty much have to go back and change Middle Eastern history in the aftermath of World War I. The whole timeline skew morass rests on a single comment about "2002" in a single episode, and all that the real "evidence" suggests is that an actor had a slip of the tongue, or that a writer made a minor mistake. Where does this sort of babbling stop? (Semi)-scientific speculation about how side effects of a nuclear power plant keeps the characters in the Simpsons from aging? Speculation about the continuity in the comic strip B.C. and how its characters appear to know about contemporary social issues (and how characters in the B.C. period know about events reported on or about 33 A.D.)? What kind of scientific advances have been made in the CSI universe to enable them to conduct DNA analyses in only a few hours, when in the here and now the tests take much longer? In the Disney universe, why has Goofy (a dog) had a pet dog of his own (Pluto)? (And why has ownership of Pluto changed so much, anyway?) Fiction is less consistent than reality, and Wikipedia shouldn't pretend otherwise. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 19:59, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The Secret Service <i>is</i> giving both candidates coverage. That would be why there are all the tall, silent men in black suits in the rest room with Vinick when Frost briefs him, why there are tall, silent men in black suits all standing around at the Al Smith dinner, etc. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaxringold_44f9.html" title="User:Staxringold">Staxringold</a> 00:33, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>one more <b>Comment</b>. But not consistently enough. Remember in particular the scene where the two candidates meet in an apparently unsecured kitchen at the Al Smith dinner. It's a budget thing; in scenes calling for extras, a few are playing agents. But in other scenes, they're not to be seen. You're right that I wasn't clear enough, though, I should have said (consistent) rather than (visible). <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 01:44, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>But you aren't listening. There <i>were</i> agents in the kitchen, not to mention that President's often have to come in through kitchens (we've seen Bartlet do it before). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaxringold_44f9.html" title="User:Staxringold">Staxringold</a> 11:13, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, mostly because I'm reluctant to outright delete content that was forked due to article length. This needs a rewrite by someone familiar with the series to correct for structural issues (move the discussion of timeline differences above the theories, etc.), and it could probably use a more intuitive title as well (Irregular Timeline in The West Wing?). -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 17:29, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> When I forked the article, I had trouble coming up with a name for it. I tried for the most intuitive thing I could, but I forgot that in addition to the theories, it is also a discussion of the differences. I agree that the name change is necessary. That, however, is an issue for after the AfD. -<a href="../../../s/c/m/User%7EScm83x_dc0d.html" title="User:Scm83x">Scm83x</a> 19:51, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
