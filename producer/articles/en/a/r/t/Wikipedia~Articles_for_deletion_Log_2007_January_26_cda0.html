<p>Seems like an indiscriminate collection of information. I'm indifferent to Bill O'Reilly but do we need some sort of "rogue's gallery" of people who do not like the guy? Should we have Critics and rivals of Howard Stern?

<dd><b>comment</b> Certainly is 'an indiscriminate collection of information', has alot of refs but thats just because its info from a lot of critics newspaper articles and such. There are calls for articles on "criticism of..." but they are needed when the parent article is VERY significan, like the Bush presidency or something. Then again, it's valid, referenced info, but it needs to be moved/merged/cleaned up or something if its going to stand on its feet.... argh, I'm torn. <a href="../../../s/g/g/User%7ESGGH_ea0b.html" title="User:SGGH">SGGH</a> 00:37, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> I must disagree with you people. Vlada Frey is very popular in the alternative art scene in Serbia. The reason he is not listed on many web pages is because Vlada is quite repulsive towards Serbia's modern art and culture overall, thus being in disagreement with many of Serbian artists and art galleries. But that does not mean he is not popular. Many alternative and abstract artists consider him a genius. When one of the users mentioned Frey as "underground" artist, he clearly meant different, a little bit anarchistic and anti-commercial. Just like punk and metal music. And I see these two music genre's, even though, considered "underground", have large articles on wikipedia, as well as many of the bands playing this music. Vladimir Stojkovic Frey is playing a huge part in Serbian performance art of today, and he deserves place on wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Vuk Filipovic (<a href="../../../v/u/k/User_talk%7EVuk_Filipovic_06a8.html" title="User talk:Vuk Filipovic">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vuk_Filipovic_eb4d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vuk Filipovic">contribs</a>) 04:32, 26 January 2007 (UTC).</small> <small>— Vuk Filipovic (<a href="../../../v/u/k/User_talk%7EVuk_Filipovic_06a8.html" title="User talk:Vuk Filipovic">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vuk_Filipovic_eb4d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vuk Filipovic">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>Reply</b> Okay, I'm feeling very negative emotions, and anger coming from the user called "Kesh". Listen dude, I don't know if you have anything against Serbian art, culture or people overall, but if you do, I think you should keep it to yourself. Just because you haven't heard of someone, and I presume you haven't got all the knowledge of the world, that does not mean that person doesn't exist. With comments like that you are disrespecting Vlada's art and everything he is fighting. When I sad that Frey deserves a place in wikipedia, I just wanted to make regard, that if whole "underground" punk and gothic scene can find it's place here, one talented performance artist surely can. All I have for "evidence" is complete Vlada's discography. If that will make you feel any more convinced, I will upload it.
<ul>
<li>Calm down. He's just stating policy. I'm sure Vlada is a great guy, and I'm sure he exists. I'm also sure Kesh just loves Serbian culture and has an entire collection of Serbian folk records. We're not doubting he exists, but the article needs to assert notability, and it doesn't. What you need to do, to try and keep this article, is find an independent source to back up the claims. Go to <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>, find the criteria he meets it under, and give us a source. Even if he's entirely underground, if he's leading a new artistic movement, <i>somebody</i> has to have written an article on him.

<li>Well, I have no negative emotions about either Vlada Frey or the Serbian people in general. I'm just pointing out that this particular musician does not fit Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion in an article. I've known underground bands that I loved, but they're not notable enough to put on Wikipedia either. No disrespect is intended, but I have to be blunt: he does not satisfy the requirements for having an article here. Yet. Maybe one day, he will. As for your evidence, a discography doesn't help satisfy <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. We need articles published in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> about the artist and/or his work. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 22:01, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><i>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person</i>- sources? A google search only turned up the politician.</li>
<li><i>In addition, for authors, which you've added: Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work.</i> - can you direct me to independent reviews? And Amazon.com-esque and user-submitted ones don't count.

<li><b>Delete</b> While I'm not completely opposed to relisting, I am really skeptical that any of these would survive individual AfD's. Not many individual songs are notable enough to have their own articles; the album they appear on should be sufficient.

<li><b>Keep</b>: I could possibly see the B-Sides being deleted however the main songs in the album were released on the album itself and there are also many other bands with all if not most songs in a article. But if the B-sides need to be deleted then they should but the main songs are from a notable album that was released.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There is plenty of relevant information about the songs themselves and the stories behind them, and if that can be provided, then, no matter how insignificant the articles seem to you, then they have a right to be posted. Also, though it is a b-side, there was a lot of speculation, argument, and confusion over <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kill_All_Your_Friends_bd1d.html" title="Kill All Your Friends">Kill All Your Friends</a> because it was mentioned in passing in the album's limited edition, but no one verified when it was coming out or what it sounded like, so several people thought it might be Track 14. Thus, this article, if not the others, should be kept, as there is still some confusion about it.American_kohaku</li>

<p>Existence of the show this page is about is disputed. No citations at all on the page. Seems odd that no citations can be found for a radio show which featured someone dying on air. One editor reinstated text on the basis that "no evidence could be found for non-existence"?? If this show is merely a joke mentioned once on another radio show, is that notable? Bad for Wikipedia's reputation to have reference to a joke as if it was real. The onus is on editors to find some sort of evidence of the show's existence - if anyone does then of course delete request should be withdrawn Hobson 01:36, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>As I was writing the above, an editor re-wrote the page - now saying the show did not exist - with citations. I don't believe the show is notable if it was a one-off joke, but the current version (as I write this - it seems to get reverted a lot) is not as bad as the one ten minutes ago.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Though the reason given in the nomination is invalid grounds for deletion, this article has no reliable sources documenting notability and authenticity. The first and fourth are unreliable and unusable sources by Wikipedia standards, the second source does not mention death erection, and the third concerns neck trauma, which is totally unrelated. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Graves_78e0.html" title="User:Nick Graves">Nick Graves</a> 18:23, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The neck-trauma article contains a list entitled "Signs of spinal cord or brachial plexus injury", which states "Priapism and loss of the bulbocavernous reflex may occur". That supports the claim that erections can result from neck trauma, which is certainly what hanging creates, so that's an apparently reliable source confirming the effect in some situations (though not for the reasons or situations described earlier in the wiki page). <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 19:17, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The second source, which you say "does not mention death erection", contains the sentence, "Death by hanging is often accompanied by partial erection." It is a medical text published in 1900. Since there are medical sources documenting that cerebellar or spinal injury is the cause of priapism in dead people, I don't know why pointing out that it also causes priapism in people who survive their injury is a real problem. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 22:33, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Get out of the old state of mind, people. These articles suck ass, no one will ever fix them, and they only encourage people to use Wikipedia as their "OMG" fansite of useless trivia. There never was a consensus to make articles for every episode because a minority can so easily make episode articles. Then people come on to Wikipedia, see that, and assume it was a thought out decision. It's not, it's just a big mess of "OMG, others have episode articles, we should have episode articles" misconception. Why can't we end this insanity?

<li>Most like vandalism, bad articles should not be allowed to exist indefinitely. While I didn't feel this was a candidate for the <i>speedy</i> process, it was surely worth an AFD submission. Furthermore, as one user once told me, AFD brings problems to our attention, and rarely makes mistakes. If <a href="../../../e/n/z/Enzyme_inhibitors.html" title="Enzyme inhibitors">enzyme inhibitors</a> had been submitted within the same timeframe, I'm sure it would not be deleted. This article, however, does not have same potential, nor the notability or interested editors. The author has abandoned it, and the only edit since—not counting mine—was yours. <i>One</i> edit, which has clearly done little to change the emerging consensus. I'm sorry, but you and Matthew are fighting the wrong battle. If a <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_character.html" title="Fictional character">fictional character</a> article like...Stiffler's mom is made and deleted/merged, articles like <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supes.html" title="Supes">Supes</a> still have nothing to fear. The deletion of inherently <i>bad</i> episode articles will not hurt or endanger good ones. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">Ace Class Shadow</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">My talk</a>. 19:08, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It doesn't matter if the creator hasn't edited it since, or how many edits it's had. If it can be improved, and it can, then it should stay and be improved. It takes a while to create a comprehensive television encyclopedia; deleting this page just makes more work for when it's recreated. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine_Fisher_e4db.html" title="User:Peregrine Fisher">Peregrine Fisher</a> 19:27, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agreed, but every single article theoretically can be improved to be something in the possible future. And although we are not on a timetable, there is no reason we should cripple wikipedia with these kinds of articles for current readability either in my eyes. There is a perfectly well working and well agreed upon method of avoiding this, which is to create "List of .. episodes" articles and expand from that if something proofs notable enough. It's an encyclopedia, not a factbook, nor a directory, nor a mirror of the web etc. etc. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDJ_515e.html" title="User:TheDJ">TheDJ</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheDJ_8bc8.html" title="User talk:TheDJ">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TheDJ_82c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/TheDJ">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../t/v/_/WP%7ETV_d668.html" title="WP:TV">WikiProject Television</a>) 20:02, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article seems to be generating little interest, lacks sources, and seems to have been edited mainly by anonymous users. Also it has a rhyme on it that seems to translate too perfectly in the English, however, I'm not the best translator so can't comment on that. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooserr_aa51.html" title="User:Chooserr">Chooserr</a> 01:54, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Note</b> - when I first nominated it for deletion I didn't know about the interwiki links, so it probably should be kept, but I still think it needs a desperate rewrite.

<li><b>Comment</b> - This was noticed on <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_95_Theses_ecb4.html" title="Talk:The 95 Theses">Talk:The 95 Theses</a>, as it appears Tetzel was one of the individuals targeted by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a> when the theses were publicized. From a quick glance around Google, there seems to be sources for this, but the article currently lacks much citation at all.

<li><b>Keep</b> Sparking the Protestant Reformation is a pretty notable achievement, however unintended. Numerous sources cite Tetzel as a major factor leading Luther to write the 95 Theses, and support the truth of Tetzel's marketing jingle. Why is a rhyme unlikely? Remember the OJ murder trial and the repetition of "If the glove don't fit, you must acquit!" Added an easily found ref to the 1911 Britannica, but literally dozens or even hundreds of print references exist going back several hundred years, and he is prominent in any good history of the Reformation. So he is a notable subject, and the article can always be edited and improved to show both the Catholic and Protestant perspectives. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 17:16, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This sourced article is about a historical person who appears in multiple standard reference works. FWIW, the rhyme moves easily from German to English because the underlying root words are cognate. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 18:27, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Opinion.</b> I don't know whether "anti-fibonacci number is a neologism or not. It's clearly not fully covered in the other two articles you showed me. I think the most logical choice is to merge and redirect with <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generalizations_of_Fibonacci_numbers_4e12.html" title="Generalizations of Fibonacci numbers">Generalizations of Fibonacci numbers</a>. Either that or keep it as is because the content belongs in the general subject of Fibonacci. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 02:40, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The only material not present is the convergence on 1/phi, which I have not seen published anywhere, and its derivation is not given in the article. The inverse phi doesn't even make much sense intuitively- seeing as the sequence is just basically the Fibonacci sequence with alternating signs, it should converge to negative phi. The rest of the article is basically listing some of the numbers. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 03:08, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This term does not appear to be used anywhere outside pages that copied this article. If the sequence is notable (I don't know what it'd be called if there is a name for it - alternating Fibonacci sequence?), then merge to <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generalizations_of_Fibonacci_numbers_4e12.html" title="Generalizations of Fibonacci numbers">Generalizations of Fibonacci numbers</a>. <a href="../../../p/o/m/User%7EPomte_3bc0.html" title="User:Pomte">Pomte</a> 02:59, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: not worthy of its own article. A mention in <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generalizations_of_Fibonacci_numbers_4e12.html" title="Generalizations of Fibonacci numbers">Generalizations of Fibonacci numbers</a> would be sufficient. Also, -1/phi is suspect. -phi seems more likely to me. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 04:13, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect</b>. This is a common-enough extension of Fibonacci numbers to negative indices. The recurrence is still F(n) = F(n-2)+F(n-1) for all n not in {0, 1}. (The ratio -1/phi corresponds to F(n)/F(n-1) as n goes to negative infinity in this way of viewing the sequence.)

<li><b>Delete</b>; do <b>not redirect</b>. We are not going to have this term in <a href="../../../f/i/b/Fibonacci_number.html" title="Fibonacci number">Fibonacci number</a>; it's not sourced. No one uses it, and if anyone searches just to find out if there is such a term, <a href="../../../f/i/b/Fibonacci_number.html" title="Fibonacci number">Fibonacci number</a> will come up. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 23:35, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> if it is an unreferenced term, it shouldn't have mention either on the parent article or any other until it canbe verified. <a href="../../../s/g/g/User%7ESGGH_ea0b.html" title="User:SGGH">SGGH</a> 19:03, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> Can also be found in the OEIS (<a href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A039834" class="external text" title="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A039834" rel="nofollow">ID:A039834</a>), where it's also linked to Wikipedia. Can-Dutch 22:49, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So it looks like someone read the Wikipeida article and submitted it to OEIS, and there are no independent sources of the term. <a href="../../../p/o/m/User%7EPomte_3bc0.html" title="User:Pomte">Pomte</a> 23:12, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>But, unless it's removed from the OEIS, too, then the article should be redirected, instead of deleting it entirely. Can-Dutch 00:20, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Redirects are cheap. WP has all sorts of informal redirects. Redirects are often kept at RfD with the argument that someone created it, therefore it must have been considered useful. A fortiori here, where someone created an entire article based on the term. If the term "Anti-Fibonacci number" is not used by professional mathematicians, then perhaps it shouldn't be used in an article. However, that does not mean a redirect from the term to <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generalizations_of_Fibonacci_numbers_4e12.html" title="Generalizations of Fibonacci numbers">Generalizations of Fibonacci numbers</a> isn't a useful search aid for someone who knows the concept of a negative-indexed Fibonacci sequence without knowing a proper name. Also in regard to previous statement, the value -1/phi is the same as 1-phi, which is mentioned in <a href="../../../f/i/b/Fibonacci_number.html" title="Fibonacci number">Fibonacci number</a> as the "other root" of the defining equation. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 23:21, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Looked for various uses of the term, and found two academic sources, both in music, but with different meanings. One refers to an "anti-Fibonacci expansion" where something typically developed using a Golden Ratio is reversed or reduced by that ratio. The other refers to "anti-Fibonacci" pitches, which are associated with numbers <i>missing</i> from the standard sequence after some transformation. (The latter sense is used in Cessu's blog.) Also found a page at The Media Desk, which refers in passing to "Anti-Fibonacci numbers" without explanation, but with a link to A00045 it suggests the WP page.

The order of those words creates different results, not only a different sorting order.<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=4+flag+rock+umbrella&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=4+flag+rock+umbrella&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[13]</a><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=rock+4+flag+umbrella&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=rock+4+flag+umbrella&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> Of course, since no common phrases can be created by rearranging the words <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock.html" title="Rock">rock</a>, <a href="../../../4/_/_/4.html" title="4">4</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag.html" title="Flag">flag</a>, and <a href="../../../u/m/b/Umbrella.html" title="Umbrella">umbrella</a>, there will not be a great difference in search results. If you rearranged the words in a phrase such as these two searches<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=ea+battlefield+2+dice&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=ea+battlefield+2+dice&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[15]</a><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=battlefield+2+dice+ea&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=battlefield+2+dice+ea&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> you will notice a drastic difference in results, an increase in hits of approximately 296%. <a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunnerMike89_d5f6.html" title="User:GunnerMike89">GunnerMike89</a> 17:49, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I would like to remind you both that we are not here to discuss how to search on Google, nor are we here to discuss the results of different combinations. GunnerMike89, the point that Fuhgettaboutit was making was that searching for the terms sans quotes will indeed look for pages with any or all of the search terms in it, ergo your massive result. Search for the term "Top gun mach 2" without quotes results in thousands of results; putting it in quotes results in precisely four, and putting a more refined search (+"Top gun mach 2" +Ontario +band) results in precisely zero. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 17:58, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your "refined" search method is fatally flawed, and negates your argument. For example, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Holocaust+of+Nazi+Germany%22+%2B%22World+War+Two%22+%2B%22extermination+camps%22+%2BRacism&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Holocaust+of+Nazi+Germany%22+%2B%22World+War+Two%22+%2B%22extermination+camps%22+%2BRacism&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">this reasonable search</a> would "prove" that the Holocaust did not occur. I'm sure you <s>were</s> weren't implying that the atrocities of the Holocaust did not happen, but I think Google, while an excellent search tool, should not be used to prove or disprove the accuracy of an article. --<a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunnerMike89_d5f6.html" title="User:GunnerMike89">GunnerMike89</a> 18:41, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>.

<li>Another failed argument attempt. The <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazis</a> were not mentioned, nor was an attempt at comparison made. Remember how Iran made news recently when it held that Holocaust convention, where they <i>evaluated</i> the likeliness of the Holocaust occurring?

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Although this article needs a lot of work and cleanup, the character was a recurring one throughout the original series and was also brought back (played by the same actor) for Wrath of Khan. I'm actually surprised an article on the character hadn't been made a long time ago. Kyle is actually more a major character than some of the one-time characters that do have articles about them. Memory Alpha is not Wikipedia and just because something is covered by them doesn't mean we can't do it too; I don't accept MA inclusion as any criteria against Wikipedia inclusion, barring an actual policy being implemented. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 23:57, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This page is up for deletion for the reason: <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> (specialized and unclear terminology and/or misnomer) per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_neologisms" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_neologisms" rel="nofollow">Wiki criteria for deletion - neologisms</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>To quote from Wiki "AVOID NEOLOGISMS": "An editor's personal observations and research (e.g. finding blogs and books that <b>use</b> the term) are <b>insufficient</b> to support use of (or articles on) neologisms because this is analysis and synthesis of primary source material (which is explicitly prohibited by the <b>original research</b> policy).</p>
<p>"To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers <b>ABOUT</b> the term — not books and papers that <b>use</b> the term. (Note that Wiktionary is not considered to be a reliable source for this purpose.)"</p>
<p>The references cited do not DEFINE the term, nor do they DISCUSS the term. Furthermore, there is no such place as "Hollywood North" and it is vague, not widely used, and undocumented and unverified exactly what "Hollywood North" is. Unlike other citys named "Moscow" or "Hollywood" it is not a specific, nor documented "place". The editors of this page have argued and fought over whether it is Vancouver, Toronto or the entire country of Canada. Again, this is vague. It is also confusing because there is a real city called <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Hollywood%2C_California_8e58.html" title="North Hollywood, California">North Hollywood, California</a> as well as an already existing <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood%2C_California_ebf3.html" title="Hollywood, California">Hollywood, California</a> and a real <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood%2C_California_ebf3.html" title="Hollywood, California">Hollywood</a> filmmaking community (which this is not) -- so it is misleading and confusing and is attempting to make contact by nefarious association with the real <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood%2C_California_ebf3.html" title="Hollywood, California">Hollywood, California</a> film community and attempting to benefit financially from it. This page also has original research as well as unverifiable and/or uncited or completely inaccurate or self-serving PR-based research and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a>. It is also blatant <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advertising.html" title="Advertising">advertising</a> for the Canadian film industry and various related groups and companies. If not deleted, this page should absolutely be renamed the "Canadian film industry". - Donteatyellowsnow 04:02, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - It's documented and verified, the article just hasn't been verified per Wikipedia standards, and whatnot.

<li><b>Delete</b> - It is not a "documented" nor verifiable term. It has never been defined in any common form -- those from Toronto trying to claim it as well as those from Vancouver (and apparently others). The attempt to define it without appropriate sources for its definition constitutes "original research" and is not permitted. There is only one Hollywood proper and it is not in Canada. Also it is blatant advertising for the Canadian film production community and various film commissions and/or groups. 76.174.42.95 04:29, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The wording and style of the previous item by "76.174.42.95" is identical to that of User:Donteatyellowsnow. An IP address search is unable to locate a point of origin for this IP address, suggesting it originates in a corporate network rather than a nationally/state/city-identifiable locale. Given these considerations, and the various demosntrations of misleading and misrepresentative nature of Donteatyellowsnow's role in the recent history of this article, as well as the near-identical wording, a checkuser report should be filed to determine the validity of this "vote". Even though IP address "votes" are automatically discounted.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 04:45, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Actually, while IPs are discounted at RfA, they aren't at AfD. In addition, donteat could have accidentally logged out.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Very well referenced, does not read as advertising. The article <i>does</i> need some cleanup to be encyclopedic, though. No need to Wikilink all those movies and TV shows there, when there's a <i>See X for complete listing</i> right above them.

<li><b>Keep</b> - well-documented, all one has to do is listen to, watch, or read the news in Canada and elsewhere to find the term in use. Notion that a Wikipedia article will influence major Hollywood producers to film in Canada is ludicrous. Misuse of AfD process, related to edit disputes at <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_North_85d8.html" title="Hollywood North">Hollywood North</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runaway_production.html" title="Runaway production">Runaway production</a>. --<b><a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECkatz_0c62.html" title="User:Ckatz">Ckatz</a></b><i><small><sup><a href="../../../c/k/a/User_talk%7ECkatz_91bf.html" title="User talk:Ckatz"><font color="green">chat</font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ckatz_cb51.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ckatz"><font color="red">spy</font></a></sub></small></i> 04:39, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is well-established term in both Canadian and American media, and has currency within the US film industry, and not just when its personnel are in Vancouver or Toronto or any other Canadian film centre; a simple Google search will find innumerable references, not all of them from Canadian points of origin; even if they were, if it were only a Canadian-only term this still doesn't not disqualify it as being of encyclopedic interest. This AFD is spurious and only the latest part of a hostile and destructive campaign by User:Donteatyellowsnow to undermine the article, which has included misrepresentations of edits and content and references placed by other editors; this campaign is in and of itself apparently a p.r. campaign and entirely self-promotional on the part of a Hollywood-industry loyalist hostile to <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runaway_production.html" title="Runaway production">Runaway productions</a> (who has also attacked the Canadian film industry in that article...)). Please note above that Donteatyellowsnow has called this AFD a "candidate for speedy deletion", which an AFD is not, although earlier tonight this user tried to place the speedy deletion template, as well as other "nuisance templates", all to advance a one-sided campaign to erase "Hollywood North" as a term from existence at all. It has over 15 years of history and a widespread literature attached to it. A literature to which Donteatyellowsnow is hostile, but which exists nonetheless, and will continue to despite Donteatyellowsnow's insistence that it be done away with.....<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 04:45, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Also the Canadian Film Production industry is vastly more complicated than the scope of <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_North_85d8.html" title="Hollywood North">Hollywood North</a>. Essencially the articles would also talk about different subjects since <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_North_85d8.html" title="Hollywood North">Hollywood North</a> mainly talks about how the term "Hollywood North" came to be and the evidence to support. While a lot of information about productions is included such as the number of productions, the article <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_production_in_Canada_261e.html" title="Film production in Canada">Film production in Canada</a> should truly talk about independent films, Canada Council, Canadian film process, IATSE, budgeting, world scope, competition with US films, etc. and not about records held by Canadian cities on a North American plane. In my opinion =). I think <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_North_85d8.html" title="Hollywood North">Hollywood North</a> is a fine article that talks about a well documented and interesting topic.

<p>The result was} <b>speedy delete</b> as yet another re-creation of a deleted dictionary of slang.

The <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> policy applies.

<p>This list has not a single reference. I would love to go through and clean it up using Wikipedia standards for sourcing (and also notability)... but it would be empty. This is simply a harbor for neologisms. Notable slang terms, if there are any, should be (and are) included in the articles for the particular drugs they're referring to — "marijuana" at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannabis.html" title="Cannabis">cannabis</a>, "coke" at <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>, etc. 98% of this is simply intoxicant-listcruft.

<li><b>Keep</b> Ok, so maybe this list isn't sourced right now. Here's three <a href="http://www.nida.nih.gov/DrugPages/DrugsofAbuse.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nida.nih.gov/DrugPages/DrugsofAbuse.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> <a href="http://www.drugs.indiana.edu/slang/home.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.drugs.indiana.edu/slang/home.html" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>,<a href="http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/streetterms/default.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/streetterms/default.asp" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. If anybody wants to rewrite this article using these sources, or others, they certainly can, and probably should. So the only question is whether or not this kind of information should be collated on Wikipedia. (The nomination certainly supports including the information in articles on the drugs themselves, so the inclusion of the information is not immediately at issue). So far as I can see, I don't see why not, none of the opinions here have expressed any kind of argument addressing that issue. The names themselves are important enough for law enforcement to care about, and while articles shouldn't use slang, that's not the same as saying we shouldn't have articles on slang. Somebody get back to me if you can address that issue, and not the unimportant one about sources. That, as the links I provided show, is easily addressed. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:33, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">is not</a> an indiscriminate collection of information, which this list certainly seems to qualify as. Your sources actually strengthen this point: the second source, for instance, lists 536 different slang terms for marijuana alone. Your third source is equally long-winded; your first mercifully only lists a few examples for each. But this demonstrates that even "official" lists such as these are not at all definitive, unless you're suggesting we include everything on their list simply because it's there? Those other sites allow themselves the latitude to randomly compile information; we do not. If individuals are interested in the slang names for particular drugs, they're able to look those up and find them in their respective articles. Better yet, they can go peruse urbandictionary.com, a project dedicated to documenting exactly this sort of information. If there were a source stating the importance to police of being up on drug slang, that information would be relevant at <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slang.html" title="Slang">slang</a>. But neologisms huddling together for warmth as they do here, or being put on a context-less list by drug agencies, do not make them Wikipedia material. <b><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a></b> <small><a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">JDiscourse</a></small> 23:20, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, your nomination(and several of the further opinions expressed) complained about sources, I demonstrated that it's not a real issue, as there are numerous sources available. It took me literally seconds to find these. Thus it would be better to not even try to argue that, as it's rather easy to show why it's meaningless claim. If you want sources, they exist. Perhaps you could strike that reason from your nomination? That might concentrate matters on more relevant reasons to delete. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DICT" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DICT</a> is probably a better argument in this case, and I suggest seeing if Wikitionary has it already. You aren't objecting to the information itself after all, as you have supported putting these slang terms on the individual drug articles. I think a collation is helpful myself, but I don't care if it's here or there. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:11, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> While I would agree that the article does not necessarily meet Wikipedia standards per se, I do think that it compiles an interesting amount of information, not necessarily inaccurate. Is that not what Wikipedia was meant to be? And yes, they're neologisms but I think they're very important socially. If it's not here, it won't be anywhere.

<li><b>Delete.</b> One album, and the only Google hits for "Symphonic Illusion Records" refers to this record, so it may be just their name for a self-release. No entry on allmusic.com (the string takes one to "Inasense", an different entity). If "has a strong following" is true, it doesn't show on their web site, which lists no upcoming shows, and a grand total of two previous shows, in suburban spaces - in February and March of 2006. Granted, they may just not update their web site, but what else are we supposed to go on? In the "News" section of their website, what do we have but "IN-A-SENSE on Wikipedia" as their big news, which doesn't put me in an especially good mood toward this whole endeavor.

<p>Since there is no agreed upon notion of "interracial", I don't think there's any way for this list to survive without being a POV mess. Note also that if we're going to actually list any politician or activist which has parents of different ethnicities, the list will be endless and would pretty much be on the same level as Blonde politicians. I could maybe see an article about "interracial" politicians, whatever that means, who are particularly known for addressing issues related to ethnicity and race. But the current content,imho, is salvageable. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 06:52, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete or Transwiki</b> It's truly, utterly <i>ridiculous</i> that this article has existed more than <b>0</b> seconds. 90% of the stated characters do <i>not</i> have noteworthy appearances in the TimeSplitters storyline. The only character I <i>know</i> is noteworthy is Sgt. Cortez, the main character in TS 2 and TS:FP. I stated the "Transwiki" vote for the possibility that this info may not be in its respective wiki, though I'm confident most is.

<li><b>Comment</b> I also feel that, not only does <i>this</i> article needs to be deleted, but all connected articles dealing with unnoteworthy characters should be deleted, as well, if that can be done easily enough. ♣ <a href="../../../k/l/p/User%7EKlptyzm_14bd.html" title="User:Klptyzm"><font color="blue"><b>Klptyzm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/l/p/User_talk%7EKlptyzm_0579.html" title="User talk:Klptyzm"><font color="#FF0000">Chat wit me</font></a> <b>§</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Klptyzm_dc1b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Klptyzm"><font color="#FF1234">Contributions</font></a></sup> ♣ 07:11, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I'm tempted to call it db-empty. I voted in above to merge the individual article into a list such as this, but this list needs to be pruned down significantly, and the notable characters explained in greater detail. Perhaps the best way to do this is to start over. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 07:48, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep, but delete the spinoff articles</b> - this article contains a number of links to bios of characters who do not merit their own article, e.g. Booty Guard. If all this info is merged into the article it will contain enough info to be viable; and most other fictional universes have their own "list of minor characters in..." article at present. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 18:17, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How would it be "viable?" Like I said above, most of the characters in this article are, by any means, noteworthy because, for one, most only appear in multiplayer, and not enough information is known about them to merit an article any bigger than a stub; I feel they don't even deserver article <i>creations</i>. Also, they, technically, aren't even <i>minor</i> characters, in most cases, but miscellaneous characters, if that makes any sort of sense. Most other articles that list minor characters list characters that have some sort of influence on the plot of the game, if not a minor one; this details characters you don't even see more than once (if at all) in the story. ♣ <a href="../../../k/l/p/User%7EKlptyzm_14bd.html" title="User:Klptyzm"><font color="blue"><b>Klptyzm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/l/p/User_talk%7EKlptyzm_0579.html" title="User talk:Klptyzm"><font color="#FF0000">Chat wit me</font></a> <b>§</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Klptyzm_dc1b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Klptyzm"><font color="#FF1234">Contributions</font></a></sup> ♣ 18:24, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>That there is information, but not enough information for a full article, is exactly the scenario where the <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> guidelines state that merger into a "list of characters in X" article is appropriate.

<ul>
<li>So one <i>ounce</i> of information justifies the additions of literally insignificant characters to this list? Like I said above, 90% of these characters have <i>no important role in TimeSplitters or its story.</i> More than half of the info pertaining to each character is consisted of large amounts of OR, at best. <s>If this doesn't get deleted, then all unimportant characters should be removed from the article, i.e., all characters that play no major role in the storyline.</s> ♣ <a href="../../../k/l/p/User%7EKlptyzm_14bd.html" title="User:Klptyzm"><font color="blue"><b>Klptyzm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/l/p/User_talk%7EKlptyzm_0579.html" title="User talk:Klptyzm"><font color="#FF0000">Chat wit me</font></a> <b>§</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Klptyzm_dc1b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Klptyzm"><font color="#FF1234">Contributions</font></a></sup> ♣ 20:00, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Initally prodded as an advert (which it is). Tagged for speedy as a copyvio (which it is not). I am bringing it here for consideration.

<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>See also the comments from Veltkamp in Talk. I don't agree with the reasons given above for deletion:</li>
</ul>
<p>Advert? No, the entry is describing a technology development which has been taking place since 2000. Three competing companies which have produced products meeting the standard are named but no individual products are identified or endorsed. Images of their products are included to enable the reader to see what completed systems systems look like. The focus of this article is to describe the design concepts and the advantages of this approach.</p>
<p>Too specialised? This article deals a technology set, Process Analytics, which is present in every single refinery and petrochemical plant in the world, and in each of those plants there may be hundreds of such systems. Put another way, Process Analytics is a technology sector worth several billions of dollars per year. There is a Wiki entry for Laboratory. Process Analytics has a similar degree of specialisation as Lab Analytics. In fact I'd recommend further expansion of both Laboratory and NeSSI to describe analytical technologies in greater detail.</p>
<p>Non-notable? There are tens of thousands of Process Analytics systems in the world. The NeSSI approach will dramatically change the way that such systems are designed and used. This is noteworthy.</p>
<p>Individual research programmes at universities? No, this is an industry-wide initiative with most of the work being done by industrial companies (both vendors and end-users). CPAC at the University of Washington has provided a neutral umbrella under which these companies have been able to meet and make progress. --JJG UK 13:07, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The volume of public articles (over 20+) in trade publications and journals and the series of presentations and devoted sessions at national and international conferences (50+) should lay the <i><b>notable</b></i> issue to rest. The remaining issue of whether this topic is too specialized seems like a weak argument for deletion -- all new technology is <i><b>specialized</b></i> when it is first introduced. Just because the community this page serves is a technical one is not justification for deletion -- there are many (most?) Wikipedia pages that serve small special interest groups. In writing this page we attempted to distill the essence of the topic down to a broad introduction that would give the reader a sense of what NeSSI is and why it is important. Most of the specialized technical content (including a complete history of its development as reflected in technical presentations and papers given at various conferences) remains on the main NeSSI web site included as an external link. <a href="../../../v/e/l/User%7EVeltkamp_2b96.html" title="User:Veltkamp">Veltkamp</a> 21:16, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In response to the argument that this is too specialized, how is this different than an article on <a href="../../../s/o/a/SOAP_4de9.html" title="SOAP">SOAP</a> (Single Object Access Protocol). That is a protocol that was developed for commercial use in a specialized environment. The functionality that the NeSSI initiative is attempting to bring to current analytical sample system designs mirrors the type of development that SOAP has gone through.<a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECIRCORTech_151e.html" title="User:CIRCORTech">CIRCORTech</a> 21:54, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>No, we simply pointed out that that we were publicizing the planned submission of a Wikipedia article on our existing web site as a "heads-up" and a mechanism for soliciting comments from our site visitors relative to the proposed content for the eventual Wikipedi page<a href="../../../v/e/l/User%7EVeltkamp_2b96.html" title="User:Veltkamp">Veltkamp</a> 22:25, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Sheesh...I cannot beleive this is so controversial. The NeSSI Wikipedia page was submitted based on 2 criteria:<br />
1) The growing maturity and acceptance within the chemical processing and manufacturing communities of the NeSSI concepts for developing new sample conditioning and handling systems as a viable alternative to tradtional sampling system practices. The NeSSI effort (while it started, and is obstensively managed, out of the CPAC consortia at the University of Washington) is an open industry-wide initiative open to anyone. The NeSSI effort is not interested in private commercialization as a goal (although we do encourage the development and commercialization of products by interested companies which support the end-user's ability to implement the NeSSI concepts) nor do we collect any fees, royalties, or compensation for individual or corporate involvement or use of NeSSI. We currently have 300+ individuals suscribed to our mailing list and the active participation of over 50 major international companies. To date the NeSSI effort has resulted in over 600 new commercial products, an ISA/ANSI standard, and over 150 installed systems in companies around the world. It is fair to say the NeSSI concepts are being embraced as a <i>de facto</i> standard for many sampling system needs within industry.<br />
2) Our view is that Wikipedia serves as an open-source repository for information (general and specialized) that provides a reference point for individuals using the internet to research a topic. Our NeSSI page submission was prompted, in large part, by the volume of requests we have received for background information from editors and reporters wishing to provide media reports of NeSSI, as well as requests from individuals wishing to learn more about this topic. We have made a sincere attempt to craft the NeSSI Wikipedia page to conform to the encyclopedia-nature content consistent with the Wikipedia guidlines. Perhaps we fell short in this attempt...but isn't that what the discussion facility (suggestions for how to improve the content to make it more suitable) in Wikipedia is designed to address? It seems that suggesting a contribution be deleted simply based on a reader's lack of familiarity or understanding is counterproductive and limits the "openness" Wikipedia is attempting to promote. Of course, we could simply write-off Wikipedia as a potential reference source for disseminating NeSSI information and continue to provide our own resources (web page and mailing lists which we plan to maintain independent of Wikipedia) to serve the public requests. Obviously, we still believe that there is a place within Wikipedia for information about emerging trends and new technology -- but if that is not the community view then so be it.<a href="../../../v/e/l/User%7EVeltkamp_2b96.html" title="User:Veltkamp">Veltkamp</a> 22:09, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>NeSSI is not an advertisement. It has been featured or covered as an example of new technology made possible by industry/academic collaboration by several chemical and process analytical journals. For example (short list): Chemical Engineering Progress (Dec. 2003), InTech (August, 2001 and Feb. 2002), Control (March 2003), Chemical and Engineering News (May, 2004), Instrumenta UK (Dec 2003). RD Canada.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> We received some constructive comments from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ryanpostlethwaite" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ryanpostlethwaite" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ryanpostlethwaite</a> and its clear that some edit is needed to more clearly define the nature of NeSSI and its relationship to University of Washington, companies participating in NeSSI commercialization, end-user companies supporting NeSSI, and the general public. This edit will likely appear early next week. Also, we will also attempt to supply more of a context for NeSSI that is less technically orientated (again next week). Hopefully that will help make the page more generally interesting and informative. <a href="../../../v/e/l/User%7EVeltkamp_2b96.html" title="User:Veltkamp">Veltkamp</a> 18:22, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I used the term "failed history" as a working title - some variant on "Commemorative objects which weren't" would be appropriate, for the "list of things" - which is at least as "useful" as the entries on Paul Katzoff, Sam Chisholm, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Prairie_Independent_School_District_7ee7.html" title="Grand Prairie Independent School District">Grand Prairie Independent School District</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/u/Fauntleroy%2C_Seattle%2C_Washington_14d0.html" title="Fauntleroy, Seattle, Washington">Fauntleroy, Seattle, Washington</a> - to pick out four entries I called up on Random Article.

<dd>It's not fair to compare one insignificant article to another insignificant article as justification to keep one. This article also seems to introduce a new term (<a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>) with no reliable sources ([[WP:RS}]) to indicate it existed prior to WP. This article also seems to be simply an outlet for original research (<a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>).

<p>Alternative suggestion regarding the list of objects (which do exist - many people will have seen the photo of Truman holding up the newspaper in question, and some of the others could be traced otherwise. As the objects are <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephemera.html" title="Ephemera">ephemera</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/m/Commemorative.html" title="Commemorative">commemorative</a> items, the list is transferred to those pages (or the talk pages thereof) and reference to the individual items on the several topic pages. Thus, if someone wishes to reconstruct the article under a better heading and with more references etc, it can be done.</p>
<p>I was kite flying - and sometimes such articles develop into something interesting - eg <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Year%27s_Resolution_9838.html" title="New Year's Resolution">New Year's Resolution</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disgusted_of_Tunbridge_Wells_aeb8.html" title="Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells">Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells</a> (both of which I suggested were potential Wiktionary terms) and at other times there are alternative solutions. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackiespeel_edf5.html" title="User:Jackiespeel">Jackiespeel</a> 23:48, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Uh... this is getting profoundly silly, so apologies in advance. You do realise what print media <i>means?</i> There's this "printing house" that "prints" things to "paper" and then "distributes" these copies via "postal mail" to "subscribers". There are even "libraries" that "order" these copies and make them available to you if you "walk" in the library and "ask" for them to be viewed. Quite a lot more complicated than the Web, but also quite a lot more effective in preserving the information. In short, <b>if the site says the mod was mentioned in PC Gamer May 2003, you go to the library and see if it checks up by looking at a real copy of the real magazine.</b> The fact that they have provided a scan of the article and it happens to be 404 right now has <b>absolutely no bearing whatsoever.</b> (You also say we should delete <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socrates.html" title="Socrates">Socrates</a> because the guy's printed works don't exist?

<dd>I don't see any press coverage outside of game sites; seems like nothing more than a popular mod, that said popularity only generated by the popularity of its respective game.

<dd>(⇐ Outdenting...) So this is a "popular" mod now - I thought our general principle was to <i>keep</i> the mods whose popularity can be demonstrated! In case you haven't noticed, our notability guidelines do not talk about "anything big". The only big thing we've always needed were <i>multiple non-trivial third-party</i> sources. The G4 bit isn't much, but it's not exactly trivial in the sense we've usually defined it (generally entails something like "there's this mod", and a web link, and nothing else - interview with the creator, no matter how low of journalistic merit (generally speaking), is in my opinion light years ahead of <i>that!</i>) Have you checked all of the mentioned magazine articles and can honestly claim all of them qualify as trivial mentions? <i>Even the alleged two- and three-page articles?</i> The bottom line is: If you want this thing dead, say the sources don't check up, <i>or</i> say that they do and are entirely trivial. Don't claim they don't <i>exist</i>. Point the second: What makes "popularity only generated by the popularity of its respective game" a bad thing? (That description covers most of the mods and even commercial add-ons, incidentally; few mods or expansions cause role reversals of Counter-Strikean proportions.) "Nothing more than a popular mod" is a bad thing now? We could delete a whole lot of stuff with that attitude. (Let's just delete some article about a random president with the rationale "nothing more than a popular bigwig, I don't find any press coverage that says he's anything more than an instantly forgettable ribbon-cutter.") In closing, I'd actually appreciate a point-by-point rebuttal; I find your arguments a little bit too vague myself. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 10:35, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>First off, I don't feel that you can compare a <i>mod to a video game</i> to a <i>president of the United States;</i> a game and someone who has ran a <i>country</i> can't possibly compare to one another. The "respective game's popularity" is, in my opinion, it's <i>only</i> notable characteristic. Plus, some of those article links are broken, and, by some, I mean all; I don't know why or if it's temporary, but they are. Also, its reason of nomination brings up good points too: G4 bit is breaking copyright (though, maybe not likely, a better one can be found), and a screenshot, perhaps the only valid source, as far as availability, is unnecessary, and the "press" link is broken. Pertaining to my "popularity" statements, I said its <i>only</i> popularity was generated by it's respective game and nothing else; I never truly called it popular on its own; even then, I feel that another major part of that popularity is only generated by, not necessarily the mod, but its concept: Grand Theft Auto multiplayer, which has been "wishful thinking" among fans of the series for quite a while. Pertaining to the sources, once again, I don't seen any press outside of game sites and shows that specialize in games; how can we call it "press coverage" when only those that either have an affinity or specialize in games have covered it? Why not find some 3rd party sources outside of the gaming community? In the end, I still feel its nothing more than a popular mod, once again, that said popularity being "run off" from its respecitive game; I don't feel anyone would be "jonesing" for a Hitman: Blood Money multiplayer mod, which popularity is dwarfed by GTA's. ♣ <a href="../../../k/l/p/User%7EKlptyzm_14bd.html" title="User:Klptyzm"><font color="blue"><b>Klptyzm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/l/p/User_talk%7EKlptyzm_0579.html" title="User talk:Klptyzm"><font color="#FF0000">Chat wit' me</font></a> <b>§</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Klptyzm_dc1b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Klptyzm"><font color="#FF1234">Contributions</font></a></sup> ♣ 16:04, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, point for point: 1) I wasn't comparing this mod and a PotUS (and specifically, I was just saying a "president", think globally =). I was making a comparison between <i>allegedly</i> popular game and an <i>allegedly</i> popular person. It was a decidedly exaggerated comparison to make a point: You can say this is absolutely inconsequential mod, and demand it deleted; I can say some random president of the US is a competely unknown person and demand it deleted. (I have absolutely no idea what most of the US presidents did. Heck, I have no idea what most of the Finnish presidents did, and we're only up to the 11th president right now. =) Sure, <i>we're just both ignoring the big picture entirely</i>, which is why <i>neither</i> of us would have anything valid to say in these cases. <i>That</i> was my point. 2) The game is popular. Apparently, the mod is popular. What, again, is the real sin here? I do get the idea what you're chasing here, but the logic really doesn't check up: There's many reasons a mod may become popular, and this just happens to be one way. One might say the Camera Hack for Neverwinter Nights was popular before the client had tunable camera, but that was a minor functionality point; this one has <i>potential</i> for a bigger article, don't you think? We'll need to think of the scope; what would you say about <i>merging</i>, if this really is even minorly popular mod? Abundance of sources clearly says that this <i>can</i> be covered in an article. 3) I already said this above: <i>these are print magazine references</i>. The fact that scans of them aren't available any more is irrelevant; such is the case for quite a lot of articles. Our sourcing policy doesn't require online sources. 4) Like I said, the fact that the video-as-posted-on-Youtube is breaking on copyright is completely inconsequential. You don't rely on YouTube to verify a source anyway. <i>The source isn't YouTube, it's G4TV</i>. Go to the G4TV web page, find the contact information, and politely ask them "hey, you showed a segment on Multi Theft Auto with an interview of the author, is this correct?" Or grab a telephone. <i>That's</i> source checking. 5) Please educate a dumb foreigner: is "PC Gamer" nowadays a "game (web)site"? The <a href="../../../p/c/_/PC_Gamer_a838.html" title="PC Gamer">PC Gamer</a> article says it's a magazine; has it turned into a website before May 2003, and no one has bothered to update the Wikipedia article since then? It still says it's a magazine. (I assume this is a rhetoric question, but if this <i>really</i> is the case, the article clearly needs updating.) Same with <a href="../../../g/a/m/GamePro_8d45.html" title="GamePro">GamePro</a>, and other magazines listed in the list. 6) What, exactly, is the problem with "shows" that focus in gaming? Are you discrediting television as a journalistic medium? (hint: another question exaggerated for rhetoric effect) 7) Now you're demanding something a little bit too much: Mainstream media (that is, general news media, <i>not</i> mainstream videogame media such as nationally or internationally distributed gaming magazines) rarely touches game mods at all, and whatever coverage they have of gaming at all is very shallow. If we started demanding sources from "outside gaming community" (whatever that means again), we'd be on a very shaky ground. Should we also get sources to theoretical physics or microbiology articles from "outside the scientific community"? --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 18:16, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's pretty certain that <i>even if</i> the author himself scrapes through the notability test, he's not notable enough to make every single play of his worthy of an article. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html" title="User talk:Yandman"><font color="red"><b>yandman</b></font></a> 13:14, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I strongly disagree with your strong disagreement. We do not have articles for many works of <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Schiller_7210.html" title="Friedrich Schiller">Friedrich Schiller</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moli%C3%A8re.html" title="Molière">Molière</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlo_Goldoni_7754.html" title="Carlo Goldoni">Carlo Goldoni</a> which are among the foremost dramatists of their nations; we have stubs for several Nobel prize winners for literature, and we should have articles for every single unpublished play of a minor writer? I know that we judge each article for its own merits, but even so, I cannot see the merits neither of these plays, nor of having sometimes dragged-out plot outlines, with no hint at their notability... --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoochelaar_237d.html" title="User:Goochelaar">Goochelaar</a> 15:15, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Might I suggest a compromise? Contingent on the author being deemed notable - which is far from certain anyway - we move all the plays into a list in his article (keeping the long summaries somewhere, userfied to someone's page would seem the best option). Then, when a Turcophone editor or two is able to verify any more details about the play, we can eventually spin it back out as a separate article. Essentially, we'd be doing the same thing as we do with songs on an album: As they get released as singles and generate press coverage, they become viable articles. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 21:55, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's not really sensible. People searching for the plays don't want information on the guy who wrote them. Meanwule, if we're missing articles on works by Schiller, Moliere, and Goldoni, we have a lot of work to do, don't we. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:25, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We have indeed. As for people searching for these plays, I do not foresee there will be that many. Anyway, this is the whole point of ascertaining notability. Who inclines towards the deletion believes not many people are going to look for these articles (and so miss them if they are deleted). On the other hand, if you know the title of a play, chance is, you also know its author and could get the idea of looking for his article... --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoochelaar_237d.html" title="User:Goochelaar">Goochelaar</a> 12:27, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Some of this may have to do with the fact that it is an "internet event" in which individual pages of the contributors may not be correctly meta-tagged or commented by the authors (due maybe to using a template system to produce those pages), and hence slip through. In either case, it fails the strict <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> criteria, and it's initial inclusion reflects my lack of experience in editing wikipedia.

<p>Non-notable musician. Having googled, Beit Nun does not appear to have any reliable source external links, all that google threw up were entries by Beit Nun as are all of the external links on the page. I appreciate that as a musician, Beit Nun has to pass a lower threshold of notability than for other types of articles but this musician appears not to have completed a national tour nor released anything other than a demo. I can't find any cultural impact of any kind. If this article were to be deleted, I would also recommend the deletion of Innit Records for the same reasons. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 09:47, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article was nominated for speedy deletion per A7 (non-notable band), but there is some assertion of notability. What I think is the main source of confusion is the mention in the first sentence of "born in 1989". This refers to the band, not to the band members. There are some pov/advertorial issues bordering on G11. No opinion for the moment. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><font color="blue">A</font></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis"><font color="green">ecis</font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis">Bravado</a></sup> 11:23, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I changed "born" to "founded" since that appears to have been a mistranslation; my guess is that this was all translated from Italian since I know at least the Spanish word for "founded" also translates to "born". If anyone knows some Italian, it may be worthwhile seeing from where this was translated, if indeed it was. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 23:19, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> Carol Cox was a pioneer in online sexuality. I heard of her as early as 1997. People who are notable for advances in sexual freedom are often not covered by the mainstream press because of prudery and other forms of squeamishness. They are underground celebrities. Despite the blackout, sex workers have contributed greatly to the development of Internet technology. See the Globe and Mail article about her by Craig Silverman: <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060425.wxrosb1porn/BNStory/specialSmallBusiness/home?pageRequested=all&amp;print=true" class="external text" title="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060425.wxrosb1porn/BNStory/specialSmallBusiness/home?pageRequested=all&amp;print=true" rel="nofollow">Naked Ambition</a> by</p>

<dd>VHS wasn't the only technology to be quickly co-opted and championed by the porn industry. "As it stands now, new technology is probably sexualized in the first 10 minutes of its development," said Michael Storch, a professor in McGill's faculty of religious studies, in an October, 2005, interview. The first pay-TV channels relied heavily on porn for profits, as did (and do) hotel pay-TV offerings. The adult industry was also among the first to monetize the internet through mail order, and then via monthly memberships paid by credit card. The trend continues. Some $400 million was spent worldwide on mobile-phone porn in 2004, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm in Boston, and it predicts the mobile porn market will be worth $5 billion by 2010</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Many of today's most commonly used and valuable internet applications were either invented or perfected by the adult industry. It was instrumental in driving the introduction of on-line credit-card processing, improving video streaming and perfecting the compression of images for on-line viewing. Porn-site operators introduced webcams and private chats long before they made their way to the average desktop. When DVDs and digital video cameras hit the market, pornographers were the first to jump on board. "If it wasn't for the adult market," says McAlear [her husband and business partner], "live and streaming video wouldn't have developed as fast as it did."</dd>

<p>Carol Cox is a figure of historical importance. The article could use some more detail about her significance, but should be kept because it is of interest to social commentators such as myself who follow underground trends and phenomena that are often much more important than their mainstream coverage would indicate.

I cannot accept Jreferee's point that the material in the Hola article is not superior to what is in this article, since it is both more extensive and makes suitable reference to different scholarly interpretations of the event. <a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPabailie_cc24.html" title="User:Pabailie">Pabailie</a> 18:48, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have merged the relevant data to the pirate bay as suggested, however i still think there is significant information in this article. I have added a significant amount of sources. 6 sources, and 8 relevant links. This is much more than most wikipedia articles. I believe I have made a valid argument for each of the complaints on this page, or i have corrected them. So i don't think this should be deleted.
<dl>
<dd>And on a more personal note. I dont understand the opposition to new information being added to wikipedia just because it is not commonly know. If a word is used by more than a small isolated group of people it should be acceptable. Local bands, high schools, small companies, towns, mayors, etc should all be acceptable. If it can make it into the news whether local or global, it should be acceptable. Wikipedia should not be so picky about what is acceptable information and what is not. I knew about mp3s before most of the world knew of them, no one i knew was aware of them. so should i have kept it secret until it made it on cnn. If <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraunhofer.html" title="Fraunhofer">Fraunhofer</a> had written an article would it be self-promoting, and for quick deletion. If somebody wants to know what a kopimist is they should be able to find it on wikipedia.(i have found a couple of forums were people have asked that very question) I am an archivist and have archived about 100,000 <a href="../../../d/a/t/Datasheet.html" title="Datasheet">datasheets</a> at <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archive.org.html" title="Archive.org">archive.org</a> most of those chip are almost completely unknown and very few if any care about them.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The term "kopimist" or "kopimi" doesn't seem to appear on the piratebay website you linked to, even on their "About" page. Therefore, it's not a source for the term. On the kopimi.com site you linked to, there's just a public domain logo. Nothing about the "information wants to be free" philosophy the article mentions. The Urban Dictionary definition for "kopimi" just says that it means something can be copied. Basically, it seems to be a logo signifying that something is in the public domain. Again, nothing about this philosophy. Furthermore, Urban Dictionary isn't generally considered a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. The no-war-against-ladonia.blogspot.com talks about "Kopimists" but never really defines the term. Again, blogs are not generally considered reliable sources.

The page is about kopimists not kopime, that page is cited only in that portion. not the main artical. It is not in academic papers but i would imagine 90% of wikipedia articles do not have them as sources. Urban Dictionary isn't a reliable source that is why i have multiple other sources to back the definition up. Kopimi is relevent because multiple sources describe that as the origin, so its would inproper to not mention that. <a href="http://no-war-against-ladonia.blogspot.com/2006/07/how-kopimists-conquered-internets-and.html" class="external free" title="http://no-war-against-ladonia.blogspot.com/2006/07/how-kopimists-conquered-internets-and.html" rel="nofollow">http://no-war-against-ladonia.blogspot.com/2006/07/how-kopimists-conquered-internets-and.html</a> , <a href="http://www.kopimi.com/kopimi/" class="external free" title="http://www.kopimi.com/kopimi/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kopimi.com/kopimi/</a> , <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kopimi" class="external free" title="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kopimi" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kopimi</a> all talk about the term not just use it. It is true that not all the sources are <i>reliable</i>. But many are and all pages confirm that same thing. It is true that many of the sources are self serving, but is would be improper to not cite them and many of the the sources are not self serving. So i think i covered all the arguments listed about. But even if all my arguments are bunk, whats the harm in having more information. It the word gets more popular them more will be added. if it doesnt is remains a small unpopular article for anyone that wants to know about it. <a href="../../../z/y/m/User%7EZyMOS_4fc8.html" title="User:ZyMOS">ZyMOS</a> 21:53, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

The opening paragraph looks like a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">dictionary definition</a> but the inclusion of the film discounts that. It appears to meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability requirements</a> since it is the subject of multiple independent discussions in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> and more exist (and should be added).

<li>Yes, although the original prod was placed before the movie and recent usages sections were added. Adding these sections makes this article more than a dictionary definition. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 14:11, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> — the article consists of a definition copied directly from somewhere, and two pieces of trivia. This is an encyclopaedia, not a dictionary of idioms. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosenkreuz_8bdd.html" title="User:Rosenkreuz">Rosenkreuz</a> 14:32, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This appears like a dicdef. Any etymological trivia can be added on wiktionary. I don't agree with Gwernol: there doesn't appear to be an encyclopedia article struggling to get out of this. I'm not of the view that it's offensive, although that was presumably the original intent.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Sorry, just adding "They made a movie with this title" doesn't mean it's not a dictionary definition anymore. If you feel you can make an article out of the film title, go for it. As it stands, though, it's just a dicdef.

<ul>
<li>On the contrary: An article on the etymology of an idiom is <i>exactly</i> dictionary article territory. You are most likely thinking that the article cannot be a dictionary article because it isn't a short, 1-sentence long, article. "Short" and "dictionary" are not synonyms. Don't let what one can find in "pocket dictionaries" fool you. An article is a dictionary article when it gives (one or more of) the meaning, etymology, usage, inflections, pronunciations, translations, synonyms, antonyms, homophones, alternative spellings, derived terms, and so forth of a word or an idiom. A <i>non-stub</i> dictionary article can be quite long. This article falls into that category. It doesn't discuss the person/concept/place/event/thing that the word/phrase <i>denotes</i>, which is encyclopaedia article territory. It gives the meaning of the idiom, discusses its etymology, and points to some modern usages, noting the connotations of the idiom. It <i>nowhere</i> discusses important facts that are not disclosed, the concept that the phrase denotes. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:42, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Except this is a phrase, not simply a word. The history of its origins and usage is encyclopaedic. Do normal encyclopedia contain such things?

<li>Please remember that Wikipedia is not censored, and that the definition explains the term - so while the term is indeed racist, it gives an etymology behind said term.

<li><b>strong keep</b> It's really quite simple. <b>WP is not censored</b>. Now un-used slang that would now be considered racist is included. In fact , even contemporary racist slang is included, if material for an encyclopedic article can be found. There is much else to say, including comparisons with similar slang in various countries, and a look at likely pre-Google era material should find quite a bit. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 00:39, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Please stop making that argument</b>. Nobody is saying it should be censored. In fact, it's the keep voters that keep bringing up the censorship issue (making it <i>really</i> hard for me to assume good faith). Simply because we don't censor things doesn't mean that everything potentially vulgar is instantly notable. The issue at hand is whether or not this article is a dictionary definition, or whether the article is notable. I believe that it is, and it's not. Adding a history of the word doesn't make it any less of a dicdef, and while a movie from 1904 is mentioned, there's absolutely <i>nothing</i> about it on the page. This "movie", by the way, is 10 minutes long and there is nearly no information about it over at IMDB (the only source provided for it). --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 03:20, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article about some strange meditation technique. It would appear to have been mentioned in two newspaper articles, but I don't think that constitutes notability. It is also written in some garbled language which bears only the most superficial resemblance to English: 'The principles of the Path that are pillaring, lead to and from the Spiritual Unfoldment meditation are the Unfoldment of the Heart, the finding of Greater happiness, a life of Philosophy that is a living philosophy under a non-denominational / non-sectarian spectrum'. Wikipedia would be a much better place without this article, as well as the article on the <a href="../../../f/i/s/FISU_%28Foundation_for_International_Spiritual_Unfoldment%29_06b6.html" title="FISU (Foundation for International Spiritual Unfoldment)">non-notable group who promote this activity</a> and the <a href="../../../g/u/r/Gururaj_Ananda_Yogi_b7f3.html" title="Gururaj Ananda Yogi">chap who came up with the idea</a>.

<li>Hello, i don't think it should be removed since it's been practiced by thousands of people who have seen these benefits. Also, as for the benefits of meditation concern shortly links will be added from medical articles proving these theories. How can Gururaj Ananda Yogi be removed from here when his profile is accepted by Wikipedia terms in the spanish version? <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gururaj_Ananda_Yogi" class="external free" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gururaj_Ananda_Yogi" rel="nofollow">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gururaj_Ananda_Yogi</a> .

They have taught over 100,000 people in the UK and a similar amount in America plus many thousands more in European countries and Autralia. I totally disagree that Wikipedia would be a better place without this article. I think those comments are even predujuice or make by someone who has not discovered the spiritual path. Our methods of Spiritual Unfolmdent are unique and indivually prescribed for each person that comes to learn. There is no such organsiation in the world with our track record or achievements.

<p><b>On the other hand...</b></p>
<p>Greetings. This is regarding the initial comments of the debate, by user <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosenkreuz_8bdd.html" title="User:Rosenkreuz">Rosenkreuz</a>. I hope this helps to clear up some things.</p>
<p>If you find this meditation technique "strange", then probably you may find all meditations techniques "strange" if you have never practiced meditation.</p>
<p>This is already an existing opinion that consider "all these things from the east" as "strange", especially in the western world. You may share that opinion as well and this is respected. Nevertheless, it's a personal opinion.</p>
<p>If you consider as "garbled language" which bears "only the most superficial resemblance to English" as anything you do not comprehend and share, it is, again, your own right and opinion. Maybe you will consider "garbled language" what it says <a href="../../../m/e/d/Meditation.html" title="Meditation">here</a>? Please note that the translation of eastern texts and notions in English is indeed a "tricky" business. You would be amazed what obscure words and sentences are used by scholars in order to accurately transfer the meaning e.g. from ancient <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> texts to English. As a prominent example of "garbled language", please see the translations of Thomas Cleary on ancient Zen documents - and Thomas Cleary is a recognized leading authority on ancient Zen transcripts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I will have to disagree with the crude labeling. This "language" that is used in the specific article text was reviewed by native English speakers that share common interest into Meditation for Spiritual Unfoldment and was approved.</p>
<p>About the lacking of media references, there are references regarding this article (and the other related articles), but those I personally have are not properly dated. There was a request for the community to help, as myself and other mates are sorting out the references.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Gururaj Ananda Yogi wasn't the "chap" that "came up with the idea". At least please check <a href="../../../u/n/f/Unfoldment.html" title="Unfoldment">Unfoldment</a>. People and movements like <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immanuel_Kant_5dcb.html" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>, <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einstein.html" title="Einstein">Einstein</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> are not just some "chaps that came up with this idea" of Unfoldment.</p>
<p>I am terribly sorry for the misconceptions and the prejudiced language that was used.</p>
<p>Please also note, that in the past there were some ongoing discussions regarding notability etc of these articles and the result yielded for these articles to remain as such. The truth is that the community did not contributed as much as it should, maybe because of the notion that "since the articles were "approved" once, updating is not so urgent". But is seems that we need to update them ASAP, in order to avoid future misunderstandings.</p>
<p>So, expect more updates.</p>
<p>Thank you. Apologizing for any discomfort caused.</p>

<dd>The English in the article is indeed mangled, but that is no indicator of the conceptual depth of the topic; it is the product of someone who cannot speak the language properly. If the language was, as you say, 'reviewed' by native English speakers, then they are either lying about their home language or not very good at it, because the language truly is very bad indeed. But that's incidental, really, since if the subject matter merited an encyclopaedia article, the language could be fixed. Incidentally, Einstein most certainly did not come up with the idea of 'unfoldment', and nor did Kant. Please don't misrepresent the status of your beliefs. If they are valid, they ought to stand on their own, without spurious references to well-known thinkers. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosenkreuz_8bdd.html" title="User:Rosenkreuz">Rosenkreuz</a> 15:31, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Nope. no lying here. I really have no reason for that, I wouldn't waste my time in lying, I prefer doing things that I believe I enjoy much more than that. In the meantime, a team including myself are trying to be constructive and update the pages in question, in order to clear things up.</dd>
</dl>
<p>About the rest, please read <a href="../../../u/n/f/Unfoldment.html" title="Unfoldment">Unfoldment</a> more carefully, because that article as well displays some "spurious references to well-known thinkers". If you do not agree with <a href="../../../u/n/f/Unfoldment.html" title="Unfoldment">Unfoldment</a>'s "spurious references to well-known thinkers" then you are most welcomed to express it and if you still wish to call me a liar, then please do because it's really not something I consider harmful for me.</p>
<p>I will come back to the discussion in the light of the new content that will be added in the next 24 hours, or if someone wishes to help us out.</p>
<p>So, whoever wants to delete any articles is most welcomed to do it. For two long years we have been fighting with the <a href="http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk" rel="nofollow">Charity Commission for England and Wales</a>, having to deal with similar mentalities, but in the end it was a <a href="http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/showcharity.asp?regno=1061185&amp;submit=Run+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/showcharity.asp?regno=1061185&amp;submit=Run+Search" rel="nofollow">success</a>. And whoever dealt with the Commission knows very well what it takes to be approved as a <i>UK Registered Charity</i>: after exhaustive check, you have to be be proven 100% clear and with rightful purposes in order to be registered. So if you really think that our "chaps" and "garbled language" have actually managed to deceive the Commission (that in effect represents the British Public), then please report us using the Commission's <a href="http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/tcc/complaints.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/tcc/complaints.asp" rel="nofollow">complaints form ("Dissatisfied with our decision?")</a> and tell them that some "chaps" managed to deceive them with their "indeed garbled language".</p>
<p>We will just have to deal with this as well, no matter how long it will take; it's just a matter of time because the determination to set things straight will not deteriorate. In the meantime, why not be amused in <a href="http://www.fisu.org" class="external text" title="http://www.fisu.org" rel="nofollow">here</a>?</p>

<dd>I don't appreciate your passive-aggressive stance, MarekTT. The article on 'unfoldment' is an appalling mess, and full of original research. It does indeed mention Einstein, stating that he had an affinity for Buddhism, a dubious fact which needs a citation. The fact is, many people are not really very aware of the intricacies of the philosophical debate between Niels Bohr and Einstein regarding quantum mechanics, but more than a few second-rate popularisations of science, many of which focus on Bohmian mechanics, take comments of Einstein out of all context. I was not accusing you of lying. I merely believe that you are misinformed if you think that Einstein came up with the idea of unfoldment a la David Bohm (in fact, Einstein dismissed Bohm's work as being 'cheap', and for that I <i>can</i> provide a citation).</dd>
<dd>I have no intention of reporting anyone to any boards or anything. The Commission does not judge any institution on the objective validity of its spiritual practices; it merely makes sure that institutions are not set up to make people money. Being a non-profit entity does not make an organisation, or practice, <i>de facto</i> notable. And what is being discussed here is the notability, not the validity, of spiritual unfoldment. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosenkreuz_8bdd.html" title="User:Rosenkreuz">Rosenkreuz</a> 17:40, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>No Rozenkreuz what you discussed is the validity of the spiritual unfoldment(read your very first comments at the top)where you say: "Wikipedia would be a much better place without this article..." and about a chap who came with this idea. I think your comments shows a prejudice on our organisation. If you don't understand what a meditation organization is all about and how it works how can you judge of what we are trying to do here. All your comments shows your confusion about the subject.

<ul>
<li><b>Weak delete pending citation of further sources</b>, no claim of notability in the article, questionable whether existing sources are enough to provide verifiability. The first "reference" is from UKPRwire, and is just the group's promotional release, not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. The second "reference" is the group's own website, also not the kind of source that can establish notability. That leaves the article with just two mentions in a single Cyprus newspaper. Perhaps there are multiple featured coverage in reliable sources, but this article should be kept only if some are found and cited. Before I get accused of hating and being at war, I'm not making any value judgment about the group or its practices; I meditate, especially to avoid getting upset with people who think that their most important function is getting their special interest covered in Wikipedia. Such a priority leads people to suspect that the true goal is promotion, not spiritual improvement. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 21:24, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>OK, it's true that we could spare both epithets and passive-aggressive stands. It seems that all speak but none actually listens to each other, so I only have a definite comment to make, at least for now. If we look at the history of the articles in question; when they were first created they were merely stubs, but nevertheless there was some discussion going on on whether they should exist or not. Some were deleted and then revived, tagged, marked for deletion, deleted again, and then revived and so on... At a final phase, the discussions yielded that these articles would remain (no consensus and stuff). Eventually all tags and markings for deletions and notability were all (maybe but one) removed, and the articles were "clean". It seemed then that they would be allowed to exist and gradually be developed in time. Then we come now, after less than a month, with no much initial debate, within less than 24 hours, two articles are marked and deleted (Jasmini Ananda, Rajesh Ananda), and suddenly, when all articles were "clean" and seemed that would just "let be", are marked for deletion, to be merged and so on. At this point, I really do not want to repeat the discussions that took place less than a month ago, because what is said was said, and the turnout was that these articles would remain. So, the twofold ladies and gentlemen, is whether these articles will remain, let some voices heard and be given a chance to grow?- Or delete the articles and silence those opinions expressed in them? I realize that the articles are not (were not) perfect, much more info was yet to be added and the community participation was not as massive as expected, but I think they have potential, they do constitute notability (that yes, has to be proven) and therefore my opinion is to stay, let them be and let them grow. In the case they are deleted, then as community of people interested into this domain we must prepare a proper more "reinforced" articles before we actually upload them and definitely draw the community's attention to it so there is a steady and healthy participation. I am calling off for tonight, have a good one.

<li><b>No deletion</b>.I think the articles constitute a satisfactory degree of notability, because they have sufficient references . I have personally read all the books published by Gururaj Ananda Yogi and I have found them really interesting.I also disagree that the articles should be deleted because Meditation for spiritual unfoldment is practiced by a large number or people. I personally know more than a 100 people practising the techniques of Gururaj Ananda Yogi and noticing tremendus changes in their way of thinking changing their lives for the better.I should say that before you condemn something you should first try it.Spiritualbutterfly 22:17, 27 January 2007 (UTC)<small>— Spiritualbutterfly (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Spiritualbutterfly_f318.html" title="Special:Contributions/Spiritualbutterfly">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> No that's not the case Kesh. In the 'Books and References' section the books 'In Tune with the Infinity', 'Wholeness and the Implicate Order' and 'The Undivided Universe' are secondary sources because their authors don't perform the practice. Especially the last two books approach this philosophy from the scientific point of view. Yet don't forget that the primary sources used here represent thousand of people around the globe.

FISU, as an organization, only utilizes this method. So these notions constitute two distinct issues, therefore it is suggested not to be merged but to be kept as two distinct articles.

<li><b>strong keep</b> In this debat I wish to contribut with a citation from Gururaj Ananda Yogi:</li>
</ul>
<p>" Is a meditator foolish or is he a fool? Why meditate? Most people are forever seeking a joy in life, and to seek joy of life one has to be an innocent fool. For in that foolishness brings the very joy that you want. So rather be a foolfilled meditator than a concentrated one. Concentration is a mental quality but a true meditator has heart quality. Would you like your mind to be filled with foolishness or would you like your Heart to be filed with innocence? If the mind is filled with various thoughts, that mind be sure to know, rambles on from thought to thought and ends up in contemplation and not meditation. Contemplation leads to analysis, where one thought battles with the other and this creates conflict. But in meditation one is freed from the conflicts created from the mind. So be a fool! In systematic meditation the very foolishness brings fullness, where you, being a fool, as I am, would learn to enjoy yourself. Get away from the mind. For in getting away you rid yourself of all attachments and cravings, and what you are left with then is the true fool, and only that fool can ever know the meaning of fullness. The fool in his foolishness becomes fulfilled in his innocence." ...Gururaj Ananda Yogi...March 1986.

I also stress that these 3 articles (<a href="../../../g/u/r/Gururaj_Ananda_Yogi_b7f3.html" title="Gururaj Ananda Yogi">here</a>,<a href="../../../m/e/d/Meditation_for_Spiritual_Unfoldment_492d.html" title="Meditation for Spiritual Unfoldment">here</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/s/FISU_%28Foundation_for_International_Spiritual_Unfoldment%29_06b6.html" title="FISU (Foundation for International Spiritual Unfoldment)">here</a>) they may have a relation, but by no means they are corporate belongings or trademarks of a sole organization (in this case, <a href="../../../f/i/s/FISU_%28Foundation_for_International_Spiritual_Unfoldment%29_06b6.html" title="FISU (Foundation for International Spiritual Unfoldment)">FISU</a>'s).

And they do. In fact, some use it very differently from each other (but that's another story - if members of other organizations found out about this discussion it would go on forever). Anyway, a simple search at Amazon yields these books (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss_w_h_/026-2414735-7721244?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=spiritual+unfoldment&amp;Go.x=16&amp;Go.y=12&amp;Go=Go" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss_w_h_/026-2414735-7721244?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=spiritual+unfoldment&amp;Go.x=16&amp;Go.y=12&amp;Go=Go" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>) and they are from different authors, different point of views (some their commonality may not go any further from the title) and so on. Also, a more thorough examination of the current references (books, external links, websites etc) can show that they are referred from different sources (organizations, societies, individual authors etc) and also some of them are not related / directly related (solely) to meditation, nor meditation to spiritual unfoldment. Anyway, those books that were found will be used (for content, as references and so on). Please keep comments coming.

<p><b>No Deletion</b> <i>The mind is a Universe. Meditation can be used as a vehicle to explore and understand it. To go through all the layers and reach the "Source", the "Oneness", the "Wholeness".

Thousands of people want to practise this, but don't know how. From the beginning of the existence of the human race, people have been searching. People will always be searching.

<li><b>strong keep</b> Substance is of the essence. Beeing aquainted with the methods and teachings of Gururaj Ananda Yogi and the wast library of spiritual teachings as can be found at <a href="http://www.fisu.org/acatalog/Gururaj_Ananda_s_Tapes.html" class="external free" title="http://www.fisu.org/acatalog/Gururaj_Ananda_s_Tapes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fisu.org/acatalog/Gururaj_Ananda_s_Tapes.html</a> it would seem very clear that Gururaj has his given place in any encyclopedia. I can find no qualitative difference between Gururajs writings and talks and those of Vivekananda, Ramakrishna, Rumi and Milarepa whom all are represented and rightly so in the wikipedia. Possible flaws in the language are no argument for deletion (and doesn't bother me personnally being natively Finnish/Swedish). These and and other superficial issues can easily be corrected and should be. The beauty of the wikipedia is it's evolution. Hopfully towards something we would refer to as Truth.

<li><b>Comment</b>: this is a discussion, not an attack. The expressed point here is clear and everybody can realise it too, without needing the "no-ideas" and the "you-come-heres".

<li>I disagree. I find the desultoriness of jumping into such conclusions rather disappointing. If the search is performed without the quotes then the results are tens of thousands. Just because there is not an exact matching, (as this diversity was already mentioned), it does not mean that the same / mostly the same thing is not expressed in many other close terms. And in this case, it does. I really find most unnecessary to repeat (but it seems it is needed) about the importance of a thorough examination of ALL books, links, references, websites and whatever else is mentioned in these articles, before jumping and expressing with such a crude way into these kind of incendiary conclusions. So I plea for one more time to those that want to post an opinion: before doing as such <i>please carefully review <b>all</b> the books, references, websites (AND their content), other related wikipedia articles etc that are mentioned in the articles</i>. It is most unfair to spend half a minute for a mere hasty and non deictic Google search where others have spent so much more time and effort into this. People can also understand an argument without the use of the word "crap"; not exactly the most helpful thing. Thank you. MarekTT 01:01, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>None of these lists give any sources to back up the claim that the music in the games listed is notable. As far as I know makes them both original research and point of view material, and probably count as indiscriminate information as well.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Care to give a reason besides 'useful'? I don't find them all that useful. And good they certainly are not. I hate deletionists too, but with these articles, it's really pretty justified. Most of the /truly/ notible soundtracks are already listen somewhere in the game music article, and unlike say, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_important_operas.html" title="List of important operas">List of important operas</a> or similar lists, there's just not enough OUT THERE to prove anything is notable over another. Maybe if someone could find a few notible articles, and use them as reference for ONE list, that would work. But as they stand now, they either have to be all inclusive (that is, replicating the list of games per system and adding composer info), or deleted. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelodia_4ad5.html" title="User:Melodia">♫ Melodia Chaconne ♫</a> 18:11, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Although I wouldn't have nominated this type of article, I agree with above points that it is difficult to provide an arguement as to why they should stay.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Most of these articles were created in 2005, so are over a year old, and a couple have had "sources needed" tags for over 6 months, so I'm not sure if they're really "babies" in Wikipedia terms. I wouldn't object to an article on "notable game music" (stuff like won awards / multiple articles from major publications or websites that praise it / soundtrack release sold a zillion copies), but I personally think such an article would be basicly be a rewrite from scratch, rather than trying to retrofit some sort of notability criteria onto what's basically a "list of game music that random Wikipedia editors think is good". <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredOrAlive_8809.html" title="User:FredOrAlive">FredOrAlive</a> 23:53, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Despite being a game music fanatic, I'd been considering nominating all of these for a while now.

Where are the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a> saying that all of these have been "noted"?

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, games have become famous on the basis of their music and the music indepently won awards for it.

<li>That isn't the issue here. It has nothing to do with liking or disliking VGM; it has to do with the fact that these articles are unverifiable original research listcruft.

<li>The Point is, as it stands now, the articles are basically all POV pointlessness.

<li>I get a lot of your points, however you have put up a massive big pile of them to be deleted at once. If they had been done one at a time then I too would have been voting delete for a fair few of them, while the others (very few admittedly) that could be worthwhile I'd vote for keep.

<li>Uh, every one of these lists is the same thing. A statement saying "these games have notable soundtracks" and then a list of games. Not one of them have any sources that establish what is meant by a notable soundtrack, or back up the claims that the games listed have notable soundtracks.

<li><b>Comment</b> - actually I have soundtrack albums for several games over in my CD rack.

There may be a list of notable game music to be made, but these are just lists of games with music random wikipedia editors like. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredOrAlive_8809.html" title="User:FredOrAlive">FredOrAlive</a> 15:23, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. The current criteria- "quality" as determined by random passerby - is clearly unsustainable. However, it's vaguely possible that new criteria could be set that is not POV, for instance "Video game music composed by noted composers" or the like- <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Gregson-Williams_064c.html" title="Harry Gregson-Williams">Harry Gregson-Williams</a> (Metal Gear Solid 2) is a well-established movie composer, <a href="../../../y/u/k/Yuki_Kajiura_16a9.html" title="Yuki Kajiura">Yuki Kajiura</a> (Xenosaga II &amp; III) has done lots of animes, <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremy_Soule_b771.html" title="Jeremy Soule">Jeremy Soule</a> while mostly doing video game music has received a ton of acclaim and orchestrations, etc. It'd need vigilant watching and cleanly set out guidelines so that the POV part doesn't transfer to "which composers are notable," but that's an easier question. For starters, something like "the composer should have a bluelink and at least two pages of content in their article that aren't simply lists of works" would seem passable, though people who know the music industry better are certainly free to suggest something better. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 18:32, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> That still doesn't cut it. For starters, the size of the Wikipedia article has absolutely zero direct relation to notibility. Furthur more, there's plenty of games out there with well-noted music by otherwise non-notable composers (can you name who wrote <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katamari_Damacy_7d86.html" title="Katamari Damacy">Katamari Damacy</a> off the top of your head? How about <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Metroid_d7dc.html" title="Super Metroid">Super Metroid</a>?). Whatever, I gave the better argument above, and there's basically NOTHING in any of these articles that's more than a list, so making a new general article instead of trying to keep an clean these up is a lot better choice, either way. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelodia_4ad5.html" title="User:Melodia">♫ Melodia Chaconne ♫</a> 18:53, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Psst, Super Metroid might be a bad example because <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenji_Yamamoto_fcea.html" title="Kenji Yamamoto">Kenji Yamamoto</a> isn't actually <i>that</i> obscure. <a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVoretus_d72f.html" title="User:Voretus">Voretus</a> 20:59, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, yes. I'm proposing a refocusing of the list, since "quality of score" seems like a POV magnet. And I agree with what you say about Wikipedia articles not being the be-all and end-all of how notable a person is, but they are a start, and they're easy to check. I've seen a similar requirement used for listing artists from a topic with tons of (graphical) artists- only list artists with non-trivial WP pages <i>at the least</i>, since if they don't even have that, they probably don't matter. Anyway, it's not a huge deal, but there could be non-trivial history in these lists that could provide a start to someone trying to make a proper article, so if deletion is decided, at least redirects to "video game music" would ensure that the history could still be checked and used. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 21:34, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure if the lists can really be "refocussed" myself, as I've said before, you'd basically be trying to retrofit a set of criteria onto the existing lists. IMO it would be better to create a set of criteria then researching the soundtracks that fitted them. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredOrAlive_8809.html" title="User:FredOrAlive">FredOrAlive</a> 23:49, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Fictional character from TV cartoon show. Article is all original research, has been here for over a year and has no references, and I could not find independent reliable and verifiable sources where this cartoon character was a principal subject as required by <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. A mention in the article about the show should suffice. Appears to lack reliable independent sources adequate to support a stand-alone article. Liking the show or character does not confer notability, and does not justify creating a spew of articles sourced only to the show itself or to the producer's website or fansites and blogs. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:07, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> If the other characters have good sources they should stay, and if thay are pure unsourced original research they should go. I have not looked at them. If each character had a paragraph or so with an illustration in the article for the show, that might be all the coverage justified until a character has reliable independent coverage. The same standards should apply as for anything else. Notability is not a matter of whether something is interesting to someone, it is a matter of whether it has been noted.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:54, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The quality of the article in this case is not related to the reason for keeping. As a major character in a notable television show (being broadcast on a major nationwide television network), I'd say Wikipedia should have some information on him. Is this article the best way to do that? No, I wouldn't say that, as it needs a bit of work. However, I don't know that I object to an individual article on him, or any of the other major characters of the show.</dd>

<dd>You know, you already nominated it, you don't need to weigh in again with the same argument. If you want to respond to people, respond to them, don't just repeat yourself. It might appear misleading to an administrator. As it stands, I would say that the problem with the article is more a clean-up issue, and less a notability one. There is no argument that Wikipedia should have an article on Xiaolin Showdown, and that this character will be covered in it. I'd be satisfied with a redirect myself, leaving the further expansion of the article to some future need should it arise. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 20:33, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There is a certain part of the writing about fiction guidelines being completely ignored here. "Major characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be covered within the article on that work of fiction. If an encyclopedic treatment of such a character causes the article on the work itself to become long, then that character can be given a separate article." Both the main article and the list of characters are quite long. This seems to call only for clean up and rewriting, not deletion. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 21:52, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Tag any particular statement you feel is original research with {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} and I'll remove any statements of fan opinion and cite any direct fact to the appropriate episode, some things were explicitly stated but may seem to be an opinion. It'll take a lot more work to make a "Concept and creation" section, but deleting the article won't inspire people to do any research. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 01:09, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The book `The Corporate Culture Handbook’ indeed exists but appears to not be significant in anyway beyond existing. Article appears, considering the other additions, to be for self advertising and progression of imageonly considering the prevelant weasel words talking up the individual. –– <b><a href="../../../l/i/d/User%7ELid_b8c5.html" title="User:Lid">Lid</a></b><sup><small>(<a href="../../../l/i/d/User_talk%7ELid_6320.html" title="User talk:Lid">Talk</a>)</small></sup> 16:54, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The comment above seems to short-change Gabrielle. `The Corporate Culture Handbook' is listed in the top 1% of best business books for 2006 as voted by USA industry leader Business Book Review.

She is a sought after speaker at conferences such as 'The 7th International Conference on Knowledge, Culture &amp; Change' and is a visiting lecturer on 'Culture &amp; Change' at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.<small>— Jdrinan (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jdrinan_71bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jdrinan">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li>Yes, this is true, but it hardly matters in discussion about notability imho. Truth is there are several other articles about CMS's linked to in the comparison list that don't show any signs of notability and are not being discussed for deletion. Found at least three; the only thing they have going in their favour (compared to this one) is being older than it. Of course anything I say will come out as whining for my article to be kept, but there's nothing I can do against that. <a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwizec_3e74.html" title="User:Swizec">Swizec</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure that there is a clear notability standard for news, but this seems fairly non-notable to me. On the other hand, this appears to have at least some basis in truth. Madsen's article claims that the Nairobi and Bukavu documents were leaked to <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Soir_84ed.html" title="Le Soir">Le Soir</a>. From what I can tell, the cite for that article is probably: "Colette Braeckman, “Irak: Dans quel pays Bagdad a-t-il tenté de faire sonshopping?” Le Soir, September 30, 2002", but I can't find the article online. Unless someone is willing to put in the research to find some reliable sources on this issue, it probably should be deleted, or merged into a broader article on accusations that Iraq attempted to purchase uranium from the Democratic Republic of Congo. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 19:07, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Apparently the material at his site hasn't been published, so it is not reliably sourced. I cannot support Morton's statement that it has even 1 citation. Conspiracruft.

<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>. I have had to discount comments from a number of new accounts, including comments which include the same formatting anomalies, which heavily suggests sockpuppetry. Even if the comments from these users are taken into account, there is a strong lack of relevant arguments. Factoring all of this in, the remaining relevant arguments from existing users seems to clearly indicate a consensus to delete. <a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigerShark_1e1f.html" title="User:TigerShark">TigerShark</a> 14:28, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>In addition to my comment above, I would like to add my post from the"Talk" page for everyone to read my reasons why I believe this article should be <b>kept</b>:</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe the notability criteria are met here still ( <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> ), referring to the 1st 2 points (as they are the only ones that apply here I believe).</p>
<p>"Keeping in mind that all articles on Wikipedia must meet our policy on verifiability using reliable sources, notability on Wikipedia for people is based on the following criteria. This is not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted.:" - Obviously her not being a "mainstream" celebrity, such as a pop star, footballer, noble prize winning scientist etc, makes it more difficult for her to fit the criteria... "The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.1" - EBRD publication referring to her as a Senior Banker at EBRD<a href="http://www.ebrd.com/pubs/general/ar/ar91de.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ebrd.com/pubs/general/ar/ar91de.pdf" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>- German language version &amp; <a href="http://www.ebrd.com/pubs/general/ar91.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ebrd.com/pubs/general/ar91.pdf" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> - English language version. Article in the Swiss Chamber Poland referring to her company <a href="http://www.swisschamber.pl/pl/download/bulletins/2004_03_bulletin.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.swisschamber.pl/pl/download/bulletins/2004_03_bulletin.pdf" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> "This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, magazine articles, books, scholarly papers, and television documentaries2 except for the following: Media reprints of the person's autobiography or self-promotional works.3 Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that just mention the person in passing, telephone directory listings, or simple records of births and deaths.4 " "The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record <b>in their specific field</b> (<b>note that her specific field should be seen as a banker/consultant - JavazXT</b>).5" - historical contribution #1 (economic restructuring of post-communist Poland): taking part in the restructuring of Poland in the 90s (as per the article: "...Bogusława Cimoszko decided to join the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in London as a Senior Banker with responsibility over restructurings in Poland.") - historical contribution #2 (setting up of UBS's Easter European operations - UBS being one of the biggest international banks/investment banks)- as per the article:"...In 1995 she joined UBS in Switzerland with a view to help launch their Central and Eastern European business.".

<li><b>Delete</b> all the article really makes clear is that she is a senior manager for large companies. That doesn't make her notable. What's the evidence that she played a major part in the Polish restructuring in the 90's as a <b>senior banker</b>? What's that even mean? Are there real verifiable accomplishments?

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> <s><b>DON'T Delete</b></s> This article shows that not only the politicians are responsible for changes in Poland since it broke away from the communist block. This is one of very few articles which mentions a Pole working on behalf of a multinational organisation (EBRD) who had a direct impact on bettering the situation in Eastern Europe, and directly facilitating a coutry's entry into the EU without being a politician. If the current form of the article is found unacceptable, I suggest rewriting it rather than deliting it. <b>Euzebia Zuk</b><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Euzebia Zuk (<a href="../../../e/u/z/User_talk%7EEuzebia_Zuk_c4ab.html" title="User talk:Euzebia Zuk">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Euzebia_Zuk_82ca.html" title="Special:Contributions/Euzebia Zuk">contribs</a>).</small></li>

Also here is the English language version of the EBRD publication used as a reference in the disputed article: <a href="http://www.ebrd.com/pubs/general/ar91.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ebrd.com/pubs/general/ar91.pdf" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. I suppose these can prove notability, and are in English rather than German, so possibly understandable to a wider audience. I also found a mention of Cimoszko's previous firm on a Polish-language magazine website biznesspolska.pl: <a href="http://www.biznespolska.pl/?p=2&amp;companyid=14290&amp;search" class="external text" title="http://www.biznespolska.pl/?p=2&amp;companyid=14290&amp;search" rel="nofollow">[pageno</a>=69#baza_firm]--Abu-Bakr69 21:31, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Really? The Swiss chamber article is a description of the firm and the polish article is nothing more than a directory listing. So we have established at a business exists. Too bad that was never in question. The EBRD annual report says nothing about anything the subject has done. It says that she is a senior banker. That was never in question. The question is whether unbiased sources exist that say that the subject has done X or accomplished Y. Nothing has been presented. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontco_3514.html" title="User:Montco">Montco</a> 22:10, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>--&gt; I believe so, also if you look at the firms listed in the Swiss Chamber, you soon realise that they are quite prominent indeed: <a href="http://www.swisschamber.pl/pl/act/pokaz.php?co=memb&amp;jak=k&amp;act=all" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.swisschamber.pl/pl/act/pokaz.php?co=memb&amp;jak=k&amp;act=all" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>. e.g CMS Proalfa is preceeded on the list by Cigno Consulting, and itself preceeds Credit Suisse. The article about CMS listed in the Swiss Chamber has to be objective, as it isn't in the Swiss Chamber's interest to boast about some firm which is not even worth boasting about. Furthermore, I believe also Zoominfo (which states her involvement in e.g. Eastern European reconstruction, or talks about her setting up the East European operations of UBS) is objective/ unbiased as it is neither Cimoszko's (ex-)employer, or her own website, but an independent database of information about bankers and financiers. --Abu-Bakr69 16:51, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Thanks for the info, I hadn't noticed! <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_League_of_Heroes_9918.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/League of Heroes">The previous AFD</a> was closed speedily because the article was blanked by the author, who has now reposted it. Since it didn't have a full discussion period, I'm inclined to let this AFD run its course. (IMO, {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-repost_a444.html" title="Template:Db-repost">db-repost</a>}} doesn't clearly apply to articles that are speedied out of AFD.)

<li><b>Delete</b> it reads like a hoax (comics can be farfetched but this?) and there aren't any references. No notability, it even said it had 5 issues which is an assertion of NN. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames086_6f65.html" title="User:James086"><font face="comic sans ms" color="#006400">James086</font></a><small><a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJames086_1a79.html" title="User talk:James086"><font color="navy">Talk</font></a></small> 00:43, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Plausible G4 justification notwithstanding, this is a hoax. A post-apocalyptic nuclear series by DC in the 70s would have been big news even if it was terrible. But DC Comics doesn't mention this, Diamond doesn't mention it, and Overstreet's catalogue doesn't mention it. As further proof, this would predate Miller's 1986 <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Batman%7E_The_Dark_Knight_Returns_5b08.html" title="Batman: The Dark Knight Returns">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a></i>, making the idea of a dying, dark-future Batman wholly implausible for something supposedly written before 1980. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 08:19, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I can't see why a disambiguation page should be deleted unless there's no possible ambiguity.

<li><i>Strong Keep</i> - DABs are cheap! The entire point of a disambiguation page is to send people to the right place; and as the history of this and related articles shows, there are people who mean different things by the phrase, and documents from some periods will mean different things by it than documents from other periods. The old DAB article was finally pretty darned good, and now people are seemingly determined to mess it up, for reasons I don't understand (other than Madison supremacism, a theory I am rejecting on the "assume good will" principle). --<a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemike_a411.html" title="User:Orangemike"><font color="darkorange">Orange Mike</font></a> 18:01, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b>. Seems to be part of a publicity campaign for Julez Edward, a non-notable musical act.

<p>Sorry, If it seems like that. Julez Edward is an artist I recently saw performing at a concert last month. I like his music very much, and he is quite notable. I had a brief chat, and started the Emotronica and the Julez Edward page. Sorry if that is not by your rules. His music is really something new and refreshing, and I believe that spreading the word is something fans do for ages. I think letting the page stand for a few months will dramaticly increase the content quality. I found all my information on the net or got it by emailing with his management. Thank you for having this democratic form of discussion. Creepingturtle 02:10, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> as the article creator.

Certainly, the creator and CEO of one of the better known snack food vendors is worthy of an article, and plenty can be said - it's only a stub and I haven't had the wiki-time to sit down and do research on anything past that since I put this article up. Plenty of references available, plenty to base an article off of, I'm not sure I see the problem. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:12, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Yes, it's a stub, but ironically the references that demonstrate subject notability takes up more space than the actual article content. The article certainly can expand. The additional article that the nom provided just adds to evidence of notability. And I'm very troubled by the nom's opening <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> comments.

<li>I do know that the title is a good-natured jest that nobody objects to.

<li>Yeah, Jeff got it. The reference was included only to explain why I didn't bother with prod (and, honestly, to poke a bit of fun at Jeff, which he thankfully took well).

<li><b>Keep</b>. Tons of sources are available, from just about all major business magazines. Based on my perusal of them, though, it may be somewhat difficult to create an adequate article for this businessman separate from that for his company. However, that issue should be worked out in the articles' talk pages once a little more development occurs, rather than at AFD. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 08:51, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> from nominator. I'm not trying to be a stick in the mud, but after reading all the keep&#160;!votes, I still don't see it. The two articles I linked to give the most coverage to Ehrlich, but they both talk about him for a few paragraphs then veer into other, related subjects, so I don't think Ehrlich is the primary subject. I don't see these business magazine articles in the google results or listed at <a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirate%27s_Booty_4bb6.html" title="Pirate's Booty">Pirate's Booty</a>, unless those are the ones you are referencing. (My Lexis access is down, unfortunately, otherwise I'd be checking that, too.) Finally, I don't think his company ranks up there with Frito-Lay, Planters, Keebler, etc. Anyway, consensus is obviously trending to keep, and I'll accept that even if I disagree with it.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 11:49, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

There is also some discussion of the FDA's reaction to his labelling and ingredients (they sent him a letter, nothing changed). I'm uncertain whether he could be considered the <i>primary</i> subject of this material, but he is certainly well-discussed media-wide in general. As I noted, I'm not at all certain where the balance should be between the articles on the businessman, the company, and the products.

<li>I'm torn on this one, as the concept itself has clearly been around for a long while - see Cundy and Rollett's seminal book on mathematical models for more details - but the name used here seems to be a neologism. The concept is often used as a pedagogical tool, and I suspect it's sufficiently widespread and recognised that it should have an article in Wikipedia. This particular article, though, is too much like "something made up in school one day" to really fill the bill, and has the scent of OR. On balance, <b>Delete</b> without prejudice to re-creation as a better and more widely referenced article. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 13:42, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>weak keep</b> She certainly isn't a slam dunk. She appears to have a pretty senior position at Moveon Both Salon and LA Weekly credit her with creating a reasonbly well-known and controversial ad among other things.

"Laura was the executive producer for all of the celebrity directed commercials for the 10 Weeks Campaign, conceiving and creating the campaign and working on every aspect from the initial outreach to directors, writers, and actors, to the conception, execution, and airing of each commercial." is probably a bit much for my tastes. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontco_3514.html" title="User:Montco">Montco</a> 02:59, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Like the nomination said, it needs to <b>WIN</b> to be considered notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I agree the BBC mention is trivial, but regarding the Zoinks! Magazine article, you argue that the newspaper doesnt seem notable? Setting aside the fact that you do not back this statement up, the newspaper itself does not need to satisfy the notability requirements, the article simply needs to be non-trivial and from an independent source. The fact that a non trivial article about the comic was written in an independent print newspaper is a point in favor of notability. And the Destructoid reference above is an article completely devoted to Dueling Analogs, talking about it's subject matter, tone and style. This is a non-trivial, independent reference to Dueling Analogs. According to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability_(web)</a> web content is deemed notable if "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself." These two articles satisfy this requirement and establish the Dueling Analogs comic as notable acording to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability_(web)</a>. <a href="../../../f/f/o/User%7EFforde_1c66.html" title="User:Fforde">Fforde</a> 08:50, 20 January 2007 (UTC) <small>— <a href="../../../f/f/o/User%7EFforde_1c66.html" title="User:Fforde">Fforde</a> (<a href="../../../f/f/o/User_talk%7EFforde_e4c5.html" title="User talk:Fforde">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fforde_26f4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fforde">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li>Read the article yourself. That article has nothing to do with notability. It has to do with verifiability which is completely different. But since verifiability <i>is</i> a requirement for a source, lets take a look. There are two criteria listed that could make a source dubious. Either the publication has a poor reputation for fact checking, or it is self published by the subject of the original wikipedia article. Neither of these cases are true so the publication passes the test for verifiability. Perhaps you meant to question the fact that the magazine referenced is a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Non-scholarly_sources" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, rather than that it is verifiable or notable. It has been published (in print) since 2001 <a href="http://comixpedia.org/index.php/Zoinks!_magazine" class="external autonumber" title="http://comixpedia.org/index.php/Zoinks!_magazine" rel="nofollow">[63]</a>, and as the magazine focuses on webcomics it could be considered an expert on the subject at hand. The magazine practices editorial oversight and all content is attributable to an original author<a href="http://www.boneflake.com/zoinks/index.php?page=contributors" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boneflake.com/zoinks/index.php?page=contributors" rel="nofollow">[64]</a>.

<dd>I already have disputed all the sources. The award was only a nomination, not notable. The BBC article admits itself that the webcomic is not notable. The magazine is a publication dedicated to webcomics and covers hundreds of other webcomics deemed not notable for wikipedia. Once again, and I hate to sound like a broken record, but independent verifiable OUTSIDE sources are needed to show why the general public would care about this in 10 or 100 years. It looks like no information exists that would establish why anyone outside the webcomic fanbase would care about this article. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> applies to all articles, not just the ones you listed.

<li>Zoinks Magazine is a magazine devoted to the best of the best of web comics. It does not contain hundreds of comics as you suggest, in fact they have been criticized for including too many articles and too few comics. This is an independent outside source. The <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destructoid.html" title="Destructoid">Destructoid</a> reference is also a non trivial, independent reference to Deuling Analogs. Yes web comics certainly are a niche interested but I was not aware that a topic had to appeal to everyone to be included in wikipedia. My arguements are not personal preference, in fact I am not even personally a fan of this comic, but as you said this does not matter. I feel it is notable, based on Wikipedia's guidlines for notability, and I think it would be a mistake to remove it from Wikipedia. I am not going to go back and forth on the reputability of the sources provided any more though. I feel the sources are reputable and establish notability. <a href="../../../f/f/o/User%7EFforde_1c66.html" title="User:Fforde">Fforde</a> 21:04, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>While I feel that the article may be a weak keep, I just wanted to point out to Pierski that he has already made a "keep" statement" above: it is custom that you only say "keep" or "delete" once (you are allowed to change your mind of course), and add further comments with a "comment" or similar note.

<li>There's a <b>big difference</b> between the two. <i>Resident Evil</i> has grown into a multimedia franchise spanning at least 14 games (including spinoffs), as well as a series of novelizations and films, since the release of the original game. <i>Dino Crisis</i> only had two sequels and a spinoff, all which could be easily mentioned and linked in the original game's article. Jonny2x4 18:25, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But, instead of doing that, you could leave things as they are and not having other unrelated articles linked within a page where they don't belong cluttering it up. I see no harm how it is now -<a href="../../../1/3/7/User%7E137.222.10.67.html" title="User:137.222.10.67">137.222.10.67</a> 20:51, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Unrelated how? The sequels and spinoff are obviously linked closely to the first game and they could all be easily mentioned within the original game's article with no trouble at all. They wouldn't clutter the article in any way that it's already is and the <i><a href="../../../d/i/n/Dino_Crisis_%28video_game%29_5139.html" title="Dino Crisis (video game)">Dino Crisis (video game)</a></i> article is in need of a cleanup anyway. <a href="../../../v/i/e/Viewtiful_Joe_6476.html" title="Viewtiful Joe">Viewtiful Joe</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil_May_Cry_0667.html" title="Devil May Cry">Devil May Cry</a> are more popular franchises than Dino Crisis, but they're not large enough to warrant having an overall series article (although DMC might get one soon, considering it's already up to its fourth game and a new anime series).Jonny2x4 21:29, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah, because adding information about sequels and spinoffs onto the page isn't shoving useless information in. Oh wait, yes it is. It's a page about the game, <i>not</i> the series, <i>not</i> the sequels or spinoffs. Also, bear in mind the linked <a href="../../../v/i/e/Viewtiful_Joe_6476.html" title="Viewtiful Joe">Viewtiful Joe</a> page is a mess and very difficult to navigate and cements this pages existence. -<a href="../../../1/3/7/User%7E137.222.10.67.html" title="User:137.222.10.67">137.222.10.67</a> 19:29, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The Dino Crisis (series) article differs greatly as stated above. Unlike <i>Resident Evil</i>, <i>Dino Crisis</i> isn't a popular franchise and is not going to expand anytime in the near future. A series page that lists four games and is unlikely to grow is a rather useless page, and everything on the series page can be included in the original <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dino_Crisis_%28video_game%29_5139.html" title="Dino Crisis (video game)">Dino Crisis (video game)</a> article. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 00:18, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Isn't popular? How <i>neutral</i>. Like I say, dumping all this content on the <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dino_Crisis_%28video_game%29_5139.html" title="Dino Crisis (video game)">Dino Crisis (video game)</a> is just cluttering it up, as that page is about that game NOT the series. -<a href="../../../1/3/7/User%7E137.222.10.67.html" title="User:137.222.10.67">137.222.10.67</a> 19:29, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nobody's saying <i>Dino Crisis</i> is unpopular, but when compared to other PlayStation-era franchises, it isn't exactly as praised or remembered either. In fact, the last game got really mediocre scores from GameSpot and IGN. But that's besides the point. The <a href="../../../v/i/e/Viewtiful_Joe_6476.html" title="Viewtiful Joe">Viewtiful Joe</a> article isn't cluttered, it has a very brief section covering all of them. Doing the same for <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dino_Crisis_d1e4.html" title="Dino Crisis">Dino Crisis</a> won't clutter it. Likewise popular film franchise that aren't really long like <a href="../../../l/e/t/Lethal_Weapon_e91d.html" title="Lethal Weapon">Lethal Weapon</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scream_%28film%29.html" title="Scream (film)">Scream</a> don't have series article dedicated to them. I don't see what's so special about Dino Crisis to warrant one.Jonny2x4 01:37, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Nobody's saying that it isn't popular? Well, aside from <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a>, I think you mean. And I disagree with you - I think those pages would greatly gain from disambiguation pages with an overview of the series, it's developers, its history and short summaries similar to the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> page.

<li>You do realise, anonymous user, that there's <i>nothing on the Dino Crisis (series)</i> to clutter anything up? We're not doing a merge. We're deleting an empty series page, putting a short summary in the main <i>Dino Crisis</i> page and removing the disambiguation page. Rather than have a rather pointless disambiguation page and an empty series page, keep the series information centralised into the article readers are most likely to visit. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 02:18, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm saying adding several Wikilinks that are barely related to the main game is cluttering it up. Rather than having a simple, short, disambiguation page, you're shoving a bunch of Wikilinks onto a page where they aren't really needed.

<li><b>Delete</b> There's no reason for the page to exist. Unlike other game franchises, Dino Crisis does not exist outside of the games produced for the series.

<li><b>Comment</b> I fail to see how the articles require a seperate article about the series when the individiual game articles are mostly stub-class (or not much better). It's not that we're going to delete the Dino Crisis individual game pages, just the Dino Crisis (series) page. While I could see supporting the creation of a Series page for <b>certain</b> game series, the Dino Crisis series doesn't really fit the bill. There are four games in the series, and the only two with similar gameplay are Dino Crisis and Dino Crisis 2. The third is practically unrelated and the fourth game is a Gun Survivor spinoff. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 14:10, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Much less mess, and it goes along with other articles (there is no "Splatterhouse (series)" page or "Final Fight (series)" page), and that'll still let you expand these articles as is.

<li><b>Very strong keep</b> The above comment admits his work is recognized in his field, per GS, but oddly says "not in the wider world." That is not the standard. Notability in the field is the standard. Read WP:N, there is no reference to the wider world, or to people in general, and for good reason: Almost every single game article in WP is not notable to he wider world. almost every single school article is not notable to the wider world. almost every single highway article, almost every railroad station, etc etc . Almost every article about specific plant or animal or chemical or mathematical theory or historical figure is not notable to the world in general. Most music articles are notable only to those who listen to that particular kind of music. Almost all towns and villages in the US and elsewhere are notable only regionally, and the wider world knows of their existence only thru WP and directories. Very few counties in the US are notable to the wider world, and very few radio stations, and rivers, and mountains, and even automobiles. <b>N is judged by notability amongthose of its kind.</b> (Incidentally PROF is a <i>proposal</i>, not a policy or even a guideline, but anyway he does indeed meet it. All tenured faculty at major universities meet it, having passed several external reviews by experts for their notability in the profession. We dont establish notability, we see if the profession has established notability. That's what Koowloonese meant.

His research in cancer treatment is mentioned, but there is no claim that the research is primarily his (most of what I have read list many names, and his name isnt first), or that it is ground breaking (I see little press besides standford web pages). My guess is that the patents for instrumentation are to do with the "microarrays"; if those two facts can be linked by evidence (a patent number), then it shows that he is leading the way.

<dd>Thanks for the research DGG, but still no sign that he passes WP:PROF (or WP:N). Looking at the Google scholar hits, I see that he is rarely listed as the first author; on 8 of the first 10 hits, for example, he's listed <i>last</i> among groups of 2, 3, 4, or even 5 collaborators. The Scientist article you linked to is <i>not</i> about him and the research described there is never described as "his work" as you wrote in the Wikipedia article. The Scientist article suggests that he is knowledgeable about the research being described there (as he was used as a source for the article), but that he was <i>not</i> one of the main develepers and was never a primary investigator of this research. (A complete Wikipedia article about that research would probably not even mention him.) Finally, the other references in the References section of the Wikipedia article are not independent of him. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 16:19, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>first authorship</b> Pan, in biomedicine the first or the last position is the principal authorship. PubMed keeps track of both of those, because it varies. (This is not the case in most other subjects). My advisor always listed himself last. .James Watson went one step further and never listed himself at all--but it was understood who was the main intellectual contributor to work coming form that particular lab. But you do not have to take my word for it:</li>
<li><b>to be absolutely objective</b> his most cited paper-- for which he was first author--has been cited <b>697 times.</b> His next cited paper, for which he was also the first author, was cited <b>393 times</b>. These are remarkably high values--not all Nobel laureats have papers cited that many times. That is notability. when we look to see the reputation of a novel, we look for the sales of the work. This is the same principle.</li>
<li>And the evidence is <b>independent</b> of him. It's provided by the journals, the RS in the field They are --all of them, for all his publications, in the highest quality journals .and recorded in the internationally accepted index, which is WoS. Knowing that not everyone has access to it, I copied the results onto the article. These citations are independent documentation of N at a level of independence that many WP subjects outside the academic world can intrinsically not demonstrate. These are the judgements of those qualified. You are substituting your own. I am not using mine, except perhaps rhetorically. He (not I) stands documented by the <b>numbers.</b> <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 08:32, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Actually, what you say about "last being first" (so to speak) makes sense to me, because it seems unlikely that somebody would be the <i>least</i> valuable contributor to so many papers as in my above interpretation of the Google scholar hits. Also, I looked up his Nobel prize winning brother on Google scholar and I see that he also is listed last many times. So pending further evidence/discussion, I'm happy to concede that point to you (can't speak for others of course). I'm uncomfortable though about relying on number of citations to show notability. Just because work A is cited in work B doesn't mean B relies in a major way on A. The question I'd want answered is, per WP:N, is there enough independent material out there to fill up this Wikipedia article about Chu's work (and is the work identifiable as actually being his)? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 18:59, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree with DGG. Many college professors don't do first hand research on their own. All their ideas are worked on by the graduate students under their supervision. The quality of many research projects depend on the mastermind of the supervisor more than those who get their hands dirty. So it is important to find out what comes out under the professor's supervision, not necessarily restrict to those papers written solely by himself. If you really want to trim down the biographies on wikipedia based on notability, you probably end up with a tabloid like publication. Honestly, how can Gilbert Chu ever be more recognized than Michael Jackson? If you ask me, I would rather delete 10 Michael Jackson like articles for each article on college professors that really contributed to science. Traditionally, paper based encyclopedia had to trim down the breadth due to the cost associated with the maintenance and printing of articles. I disagee that wikipedia should follow the same approach. I personally don't agree with the heavy hand trimming policy going on here. One quality of wikipedia I enjoy is the breadth of coverage. The depth is important, but the breadth also guarantee that wikipedia can be used as a starting point for any research in all topics. Even a stub that points to a significant external article is better than a missing entry in my opinion. Some argue that Google gives you a lot of leads to any reseach also, but the relevancy decided by Google is algorithmic vs. any links provided in wikipedia added some human evaluation and filtering that improve the quality of information. That alone is what makes wikepedia stand above Google search. The heavy hand trimmings can only reduce the breadth of the coverage which is hurting one special strength of wikipedia in my opinion. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKowloonese_2c09.html" title="User:Kowloonese">Kowloonese</a> 00:58, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Sounds to me like you would enjoy surfing some university websites more than Wikipedia. The same kinds of links from the Wikipedia article that you find useful are available <a href="http://cmgm.stanford.edu/~chu/" class="external text" title="http://cmgm.stanford.edu/~chu/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, for example. (Please don't take that the wrong way, I'm being serious, not sarcastic or anything.) But Wikipedia is supposed to be an encyclopedia, not a directory, which is why stubs do tend to get deleted if they show no promise of growing with multiple reliable sources. I'm not sure what a Wikipedia stub on Gilbert Chu can offer you that you can't find on his Stanford website that I linked to. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:21, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This particular criterion would apply to quite a lot of articles; as it happens, not all of it was from his website because he is apparently a rather modest guy and didnt even list the papers. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:23, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>However, you are quite right that a being quoted in b is not necessarily enough,depending on the notability nd authority of b. But a being quoted in b1, and b2, and b3, and b4, and b5, and b6,...and b697, is another matter entirely. This is what is characteristic of true recognition by ones peers, the ones who write articles., That's what the academic world is about.</dd>
<dd>It is very rare for an experimental biologist (this also applies in some but not all sciences) for a person to be the sole author of an experiment primary research paper. Labs don't work that way. Easy example: Watson&amp;Crick. They both won the Nobel prize, and this is true for most Nobel prizes in Biology or Medicine--they go to more than one individual for their separate or joint work. Where you see sole authorship is (sometimes) when a person writes a review article, analyzing other peoples earlier works, or writes a summary of his career in his 60s. There is nothing wrong with not knowing the way science works. It is perfectly honorable to not be a scientist. In evaluating scientists, though, it is useful to know something about this, and you might want to browse a few of the more detailed WP articles and get a better idea of how scientistd publish. I dont contribute to AfDs on video games or many other topics, because I haven't the least idea of how they are to be judged. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:31, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger topic." This article consists of nothing but a plot summary.

<li><a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> says "All text created in the Wikipedia main namespace is subject to several important rules covering criteria for articles (what Wikipedia is not)...Articles and text which are capable of meeting these should usually be remedied by editing, but content which fails inclusion criteria for Wikipedia...is usually deleted." Sorry to resort to quoting policy, but it seems to me it should be obvious that WP:NOT is a perfectly valid reason for deletion that can't be trumped by any guideline, and certainly not any centralized discussion page. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 10:50, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Thank you for those unconstructive comments. Now go sit in the corner for 5 minutes. After you do that, read the nom again. After you do that, look for appropriate sources to back up your keep vote (yes you can look for sources <i>even though</i> you don't watch the show as you said below). <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 21:13, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>But the article does not fail inclusion criteria, significant editting would make the article meet all of the criteria. Based on what you just said this article should not be deleted but should be editted as we've been suggesting. Your own argument is actually a reason to keep this article, not delete it. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 18:51, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>(Starting to repeat myself again, as I did in the thread below, so this'll be my last comment for this thread.) "Significant editing" that will make these articles pass WP:NOT is not possible without sources. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 21:13, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>There was at least one valid third party source on Matthew's list, TV Guide can be used to ref the original airdate. Until you find that there is no dvd commentary to write a development section, do not call it impossible. Besides, there are two acceptable options here, delete is not one of them. They are "clean up and expand" and "merge and redirect", both of which point to avoiding afd. A decision of delete here would set a very bad precendent. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 21:46, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Say what? A director's commentary is about as primary as I think you get. As for WP:NPOV: do you understand what that really means? NPOV does not mean exclusion of a particular point of view. NPOV is that no particular point of view dominates others. Just because the director is, well, the director does not make him so biased that his knowledge can be excluded. NPOV means the director's commentary is in as well as anyone else of reliability (if that's a word). <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is the key. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 01:20, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Good first step.

<ul>
<li>Starting to repeat repeat myself, so this'll probably be my last comment, but the point is that it's likely not <i>possible</i> to improve the articles without conducting OR. The kind of sources we'd need for a Wikipedia article are, for example, reviews of the specific episodes by independent critics. Just because something has lots of Google hits, doesn't mean that any of those hits are suitable as sources for these articles. That's why I used Lexis-Nexis -- wading through Google hits is a drag. But anyway, looking through the first few pages of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22french+twist%22+%22gilmore+girls%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22french+twist%22+%22gilmore+girls%22" rel="nofollow">these 17,600 Google hits</a>, I see unreliable sources that discuss only plot summaries. Nothing that we could use here. (By the way, not that it matters, but there aren't 160,000 hits; you didn't use quotes in your search. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 20:26, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
