<p>Beth Rodden is one of the strongest most successful American rock climbers in the world. Born in Davis, California, Beth began climbing at the young age of 14 at the local indoor climbing gym, Rocknasium. Beth fell in love with the sport, and through dedication and hard work, she improved quickly and won the Junior National Championships in 1997, 98, and 99. Soon, plastic and indoor competitions lost their splendor to Beth, so she soon turned to the outdoors for rock climbing on real rock. Beth proved to be successful both indoors and outdoors, and by the age of 18 Beth Rodden redpointed "To Bolt Or Not To Be" 5.14a in Smith Rock, Oregon, which made her the youngest woman to ever complete such a grade. Beth made many other notable climbing ascents, which was interrupted by a horrifying kidnapping event in Kyrgystan when Beth was in the middle of a 2000 climbing trip with her now husband Tommy Caldwell, John Singer, and a friend Jason. Although all four climbers made it out safely, Beth was left in fear and put her climbing career on hiatus while she focused on her family and recovering from the terrifying event. Beth Rodden married her long time boyfriend Tommy Caldwell in 2001, and eventually started to climbing again. She came back stronger than ever and has great accomplishments such as freeing "Luking Fear" 5.13c on El Cap and the first female first ascent of a 5.14b route, "The Optmist" at Smith Rock. Currently, Beth lives with Tommy in Estes Park, Colorado and they still climbs and has sponserships with Marmot, La Sportiva, and Petzl, to name a few.</p>

<p>John Fiocco Jr. is a 19 year old freshman art major at The College of New Jersey in Ewing, New Jersey. He was last seen in the early morning hours of Saturday, March 25, in the Wolfe Hall dormitory after attending an off-campus party. Several friends and associates have said that Fiocco was intoxicated when he left the party. Since Fiocco was reported missing, the focus of the case has revolved around the garbage system at the school. The chutes in the dormitory have been searched extensively to no avail. It was confirmed through DNA analysis of Fiocco's parents that blood found in a dumpster outside of the dormitory did belong to the student. Authorities have focused their efforts on two Tulleytown, Pennsylvania, sites which are believed to contain either the body of Fiocco or clues that could lead to his location. The disappearance is currently being investigated as a missing persons case.</p>

<p><b>Chancellor Sebastian</b> is the villain from the animated movie A Monkey's Tale.</p>
<p>Sebastian dreams of power and begins to plot against King Lankoo. He employs the wicked Governess and his foolish sidekick Gerad to help him overthrow King Lankoo and take the throne for himself.</p>
<p>Sebastian starts to target the king's daughter and heir to the throne Princess Ida. He starts to poison her and she becomes very ill. King Lankoo is deeply saddened by his daughter's condition and Sebastian begins to "console" his king. During this time, a monkey from another tribe the Wonkoos, called Kom is discovered. The King orders him to be educated, this is something does not go down to well with the Lankoo monkeys as they see the Wonkoos as dirty savages. Sebastian begins to play on the thought that King Lankoo is going mad.</p>
<p>The chancellor is fully aware of Lankoo law, in the case of King Lankoo defaulting Princess Ida must inheirt the crown and throne, however as she is too ill to govern, the chancellor of Lankoo, being Sebastian would govern in her place until she recovers and becomes fit to rule. Just as Sebastian thinks that his plan has succeded, King Lankoo reveals that the water has frozen with ice and now the Lankoos can cross the ice and enter the new kingdom that has long been their dream. King Lankoo leds his army across the ice towards the distant land, and Sebastian's dreams of kingship are thrashed, or are they?</p>
<p>As King Lankoo crosses the ice it begins to melt. The king's physician Master Martin enters Sebastian's chambers and warns him of the king's plight. The chancellor replies "You have done well to tell me. But it is too later. They are too far away by now." as Master Martim leaves in a shock, Sebastian watches the events unfold from his telescope. He laughs maniacally as the ice melts and King Lankoo is drowned. His plan is set for fruition. Sebastian orders the Governess to kill the princess after he has been crowned. However the plot is interrupted by Kom, who rescues the princess and exposes Sebastian's plot to everyone. A violent conflict takes place between Kom and Sebastian, which ends with Sebastian falling to his death from the castle balcony.</p>

<p>The Sockets Direct Protocol (SDP) is an InfiniBand specific Protocol defined by the Software Working Group (SWG) of the InfiniBand Trade Association (IBTA). It defines a standard wire protocol over IBA fabric to support user-mode stream sockets-compatible (SOCK_STREAM) networking over IBA. SDP utilizes various InfiniBand features (such as remote DMA (RDMA), memory windows, solicited events etc.) for high-performance zero-copy data transfers. SDP is a pure wire-protocol level specification and does not go into any socket API or implementation specifics. Work is under way to separate the SDP wire-protocol, which is transport and O/S agnostic, from the IBA transport dependencies. This separation will enable transports other then IBA fabrics.</p>
<p>SDP facilitates direct mapping of stream connections to InfiniBand reliable connections (or virtual circuits). IP-Over-IB (IPoIB) specifies a mapping of IP (both v4 &amp; v6) protocols over IBA fabric and treats the IBA fabric simply as the link layer. IPoIB specification is currently being worked on by IETF working group and will be published as an IETF RFC. The IPoIB RFC will define the packet level format of IP packets on the IBA fabric, and also describes an InfiniBand address resolution protocol (IBARP).Conceptually, the IPoIB driver in Linux will look like a network driver and will plug-in underneath the IP stack as any standard Linux network device. The IPoIB driver exposes a network device per IBA port on the host system, and these devices could be used to assign (statically or dynamically - using protocols such as DHCP) IP addresses. The SDP stack simply makes use of these IP assignments for endpoint identifications.</p>
<p>SDP only deals with stream sockets (TCP), and if installed in a system, allow bypassing the OS resident TCP stack for all TCP connections between any endpoints on the IBA fabric. All other socket types (such as datagram, raw, packet etc.) are supported by the Linux IP stack and operate over the IPoIB drivers. The IPoIB stack has no dependency on the SDP stack; however, the SDP stack depends on IPoIB drivers for learning about local IP assignments and for address resolution.</p>
<p>Nowadays latest linux kernel can support the complete infinband modules</p>

<p>Bujidao are a four piece band largely from North Yorkshire, comprised of David Budd (lyricist/vocalist/guitarist), Laurence Budd, Jo Birch and Tom Du Plessis. They have been described as an amalgamation of Turin Brakes, Jeff Buckley, Cat Stevens, and Paul Simon.</p>
<p><br />
Biography</p>
<p>The name ‘bujidao' reflects the broad eclectic background of the two founding members David and Laurence Budd during Bujidao's inception. Having played and sung together for the best part of 20 years David and Laurence decided to make it official in the spring of 2003 and went on to perform as an acoustic duo at venues in Manchester and Leeds until winter 2005. During this exploratory period, David and Laurence were able to develop the unique sound of bujidao and become a solid performing, and prolific writing, duo.</p>
<p>Early 2006 has seen the addition of a cellist in the form of Thomas Du Plessis, an anthropology student at the University of Manchester , and percussionist Jo Birch who, as well as being an incredible drummer, also brings expertise as a professional sound engineer and producer to the band.</p>
<p>Bujidao are appearing at venues throughout the North West during the Spring / Summer of 2006, including: Manchester 's Late Rooms and Night and Day Café, Leeds' Joseph's Well and New Roscoe, and as far afield as the Dart Music Festival in Dartmouth in May.</p>

<p>MADWHA PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>Sri Madhvacharya is our loving and worshipful GURU. The Philosophy of Sri Madhawa is "DWAITA VEDANTA". Sri Madhva is a third Avatar of Shri Vayu Devaru.</p>
<p>Prathamo Hanuman Nama Dwitheeyo Bheema Eva cha |</p>
<p>Poornapragna Treetiya thu Bhagavat Karya- saadah ||</p>
<p>He was born near Udupi on Vijayadasamiday in the year 1238 A.D. He took to Sanyasa in his 16 th year and became known as 'Ananda Teertha'. Sri Acharya disappeared, while teaching Aitereya Upanishad Bashya to his disciples, in Ananteswara Temple at Udupi in the year 1317 A.D., He is still alive in the Badrikashram on the Hi,ayas with his Guru Sri Vedavyasa Devaru. The full Biographical details of Sri Madhvacharya are told in "Sri Madhva Vijaya".</p>
<p>The first Avatar of Sri Vayu is Hanuman son of Anjana Devi. His wonderful feats and service to Rama Devaru are described in RAMAYANA.</p>
<p>The second Avatar is Sri Bhimasena, in Dwapara Yuga, Sri Vayu Deva appeared as Bhimasena and played the most important part in the destruction of the enemies of God. In the whole of Mahabharata, Bhimasena is the most important person who never slipped from the path of righteousness and served Sri Krishna.</p>
<p>Thus, he served God as Hanuma in Ramayana, as Bhima in Krishnavatara and as MAdhva, served Lord Vedavyasa Devaru. He is the greatest spiritual benefactor of MAnkind. This isshort, is the story of Avtara Traya.</p>
<p>The Philosophy of Sri Madhwa is simple, easy and very convincing vedanta, called "DVAITA VEDANTA".</p>
<p>To Sri Madhwa, Vishnu is supreme. Vishnu or Lord Sri Hari can be known only through Vedas.</p>
<p>Madhwa philosophy is summerised in the following sloka, attributed to Sri Vyasa Tirtha :-</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>1 . Harih para tarah - Hari is the Supreme Being.</p>
<p>2 . Satyam Jagat - The world is Real, not Mithya or illusion.</p>
<p>3 . Tatvato Bhedah - Difference is Real.</p>
<p>4 . Jeeva Gana Hare ranu charah - All the Jivas are Hari's Servants.</p>
<p>5 . Neecho cha bhavam gatah - with gradation among them.</p>
<p>6. Muktirnaija sukhanubhutih - Mukti is the enjoyment of (the soul's)innate bliss.</p>
<p>7. Amala Bhaktischa tat Sadhanam - pure bhakti is the means of attaining mukti.</p>
<p>8. Akshadi Tritayam pramanam - there are three sources to gain. knowledge namely :-</p>
<p>a. Knowing things through "Eyes and other Indriya Prathyaksha",</p>
<p>b. knowing by inference, "Anumana" , and</p>
<p>c. By Shastras 'Agama". Tru Knowledge of the world can be gained by the above three means. It is "Tritayam".</p>
<p>9. Akhilamnaiyaika Vedyo Harih -Lord Sri Hari can be known by Amna (or, Veda) only. This sloka contains in a nutshell, the essence Dwaita Philosophy.</p>
<p>Sri Madhwacharya has written as many as thirty seven works which are monumental.</p>

<p>Bristol is one of, if not the, biggest rugby communities in England, and the Bristol Combination has played a vital role in sustaining local junior rugby, and providing many of the players who have gone onto represent Bristol, England and the British Lions. The Bristol and District Rugby Football Combination was founded in 1901 to promote rugby union and the mutual well being of rugby clubs in Bristol and the surrounding area. Clubs who are members of the Combination are also members of one of the two Constituent Bodies of Gloucestershire RFU or Somerset RFU. 53 clubs are members of the Combination, with <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Rugby_13e3.html" title="Bristol Rugby">Bristol Rugby</a> Club as an honorary member.</p>
<p>The Combination runs cup competitions in the Bristol area, as well as sevens tournaments and merit table competitions for teams within clubs who do not play in formal leagues. The CHARLES SAUNDERS COMBINATION CUP is a knock out tournament organised by the Combination for local clubs. It also provides the Bristol and District Rugby Development Officer. It also manages a charitable trust ground.</p>
<p>Its representative side is a showcase for local talent, and has regularly provided a step up from junior rugby to the top of the game for players whose abilities might otherwise go unrecognised. This was more true in the past, but in recent years a number of players have gone on from the Combination to play for Bristol United (the club’s second team) and in some cases the first team as well.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the Combination has looked after the interests of the city’s junior clubs, while the senior clubs (Bristol and Clifton) have been concerned with competing on a national stage. More recently, Clifton have dropped out of the National Leagues and their position as the second team in the city has been taken by Dings Crusaders RFC.</p>

<p>Royal dynasty of medieval Serbia. Stefan Nemanja, Grand Zhupan of Rascia, is considered a founder. His second eldest son, Stefan (the Firstcrowned) Nemanjic was crowned by the Pope. Nemanja's youngest, third son Sava (Sabbas) became a monk at an early age. He would become the first bishop of the Serbian Church and its founder as distinctive church organization in the Eastern Orthodox tradition (prior to that Serbs of Rascia and other Serbian dukedoms in Southeast Europe were mostly members of the Greek Orthodox Church, some being Catholic, and some gnostic Bogomil). Nemanja's eldest son, <a href="../../../v/u/k/Vukan_Nemanjic_78cb.html" title="Vukan Nemanjic">Vukan Nemanjic</a> was the Prince of Zeta (today's Montenegro). Vukan has descendants who haved lived in Montenegro through the Ottoman period. Sucurs of Piva, Montenegro, and Zaharics of Uzice, Serbia, succeed him. Milutin and Dragutin Nemanjic ruled an extended Serbian medieval kingdom. Stefan Dushan Nemanjic, son of Stefan Decanski, married Jelena, sister of Bulgarian tsar Ivan Alexander. He expanded his lands from Macedonia (in Serbian kingdom) to Bulgarian and Greek parts of Macedonia (from Balkan mountain in Bulgaria to Kavala in northern Greece) and was crowned Emperor of Serbs and Greeks.

<p>A Defense platform is an orbiting Space Station placed around Earth's colonies during the war against The Covenant.

<p>Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co. 488 U.S. 469 (1989) Docket Number: 87-998 Abstract</p>
<p>Argued:</p>
<p><br />
October 5, 1988</p>
<p>Decided:</p>
<p><br />
January 23, 1989</p>
<p>Subjects:</p>
<p><br />
Civil Rights: Affirmative Action Facts of the Case</p>
<p>In 1983, the City Council of Richmond, Virginia adopted regulations that required companies awarded city construction contracts to subcontract 30 percent of their business to minority business enterprises. The J.A. Croson Company, which lost its contract because of the 30 percent set-aside, brought suit against the city. Question Presented</p>
<p>Did the Richmond law violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment? Conclusion</p>
<p>In a 6-to-3 decision, the Court held that "generalized assertions" of past racial discrimination could not justify "rigid" racial quotas for the awarding of public contracts. Justice O'Connor's opinion noted that the 30 percent quota could not be tied to "any injury suffered by anyone," and was an impermissible employment of a suspect classification. O'Connor further held that allowing claims of past discrimination to serve as the basis for racial quotas would actually subvert constitutional values: "The dream of a Nation of equal citizens in a society where race is irrelevant to personal opportunity and achievement would be lost in a mosaic of shifting preferences based on inherently unmeasurable claims of past wrongs."</p>

<p>Taynuilt is a small village on the west coast of Scotland with a population of around 800. The name Taynuilt means "House by the stream" and could refer to the present Taynuilt Hotel which stands at an ancient crossroads between Glasgow and Oban and is situated beside a stream. Taynuilt is set at the foot of Ben Cruachan which is a 3600 ft mountain with many rocky peaks. There are two large rivers running through the village, the River Awe and the River Nant, both flowing from lochs of the same name to Loch Etive. Taynuilt also contains a well preserved ancient iron furnace (1753) known as Bonawe Iron Furnace.</p>

<p>Discrete Event Systems (DES)are discrete state varibles and event-driven state transion systems. Some systems are naturally DES such as sequential digital systems. DES can be modelled using Automata or PetriNet.</p>
<p>Unlike DES, physical systems are continuous state varibles and time-driven state transition systems, which are modelled by differential or difference equations. However, physical systems can be modelled as DES by abstraction, which are called Hybrid Systems.</p>
