<p><b>Delete</b> Non-encyclopedic. Author deleted all citation-needed tags, so I reinserted them. Article tries to define acronym but reference sources are a school parody and chat room banter. No reliable sources provided that actually use the term 'm7'. Slippery slope: accepting this wiki "informal" definition opens door to endless stream of rumor-mill vanity definitions such as "E6 (economics schools)", "Magnificent 11 (business school)", "F9 (fashion schools)", etc. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPaloAlto_dd09.html" title="User:PaloAlto">PaloAlto</a> 17:31, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete, disambiguate and categorize</b> M7 appears to be a legitimate shorthand term for the 7 largest business schools, used in ranking and recruiting, as in "Did you graduate from one of the M7?" Compare to <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Four_auditors_7890.html" title="Big Four auditors">Big Four auditors</a>. At this point there is nothing useful or extra in the article except the names of the schools. Recommend creating a category "M7 business schools" and linking to each of the schools, and adding M7 business schools to the M7 disambiguation page (giving a brief definition and linking to the seven individual schools). Then delete this page. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 19:33, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Recommend against Thatcher131's new suggestion above to create a "7 largest business schools" category and add new school links, and against the related suggestion to add a new link to the M7 disambig page. (See "slippery slope" discussion in nom.) Also disagree with Thatcher131's contention that m7 appears to be a "legitimate" term - those aren't even the 7 largest business schools nor the highest ranked (Dartmouth's business school is ranked higher than several of them). <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPaloAlto_dd09.html" title="User:PaloAlto">PaloAlto</a> 23:16, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Save</b> The term M7 is used by publications such as the 'Economist' to discuss these schools. There have been in the past M7 career forums. While its not as prevalent a term as say, Ivy League, it is a fairly well known concept for those at these schools, and for those that recruit from them. It rather should be cleaned up along the lines of <a href="../../../t/1/4/T14.html" title="T14">T14</a> for law schools.</p>

<dd>PaloAlto, feel free to add a mention that it is an "unofficial" group, with no verified membership but with &gt;130'000 results in google (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=m7+business+schools" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=m7+business+schools" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=m7+business+schools</a>) it is clearly something people might want to look up and happy to find in a wiki article.
<dl>
<dd>I concur. Indeed, I concur. Its more something you would hear in 1. Interviews 2. Admission discussion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>PS Until final decision on deletion of this article I re-insert a link from the <a href="../../../m/7/_/M7.html" title="M7">m7</a> to fuel discussion. <a href="../../../w/u/n/User%7EWunschha_98cf.html" title="User:Wunschha">wunschha</a> 18:20, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Response to wunschha's assertion that a Google search gives "130,000 results": That's just totally abusive to this process. A Google search on "m7 business schools" gives less than 80 results, virtually all of which appear to be copycat entries on shaky-looking advertising websites. What the anonymous voter (who voted Save above) refers to as a "fairly well known concept" seems anything but, according to Google search results. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPaloAlto_dd09.html" title="User:PaloAlto">PaloAlto</a> 16:54, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Searching for "m7 business schools" is unneccassarily restrictive as the term "m7" doesn't appear before the term "business schools" all that often. Searching for [m7 "business school" -wikipedia] gives me 12,100 hits, including businessweek.com, answers.com, and ivyedge.com. It's difficult to restrict those to cases where M7 refers to the idea we are discussing here as it's somewhat generic, but it does appear in this usage on a number of sites I looked at. I think the better idea is to keep and expand possible, though I'm not strong in either direction. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreznor_d894.html" title="User:Treznor">Treznor</a> 03:48, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Response to Treznor's assertion that a Google search gives "12,100 hits, including businessweek.com, answers.com, and ivyedge.com." To reiterate, virtually all of those "hits" appear to be copycat entries on shaky-looking advertising websites. As for the Businessweek.com "hit," the mention of the term is not in an actual Business Week article, it's in a chat room post from an anonymous person. The Answers.com "hit" is just a carbon copy of this Wikipedia article. The Ivyedge.com site is an admissions advice site that appears to be legitimate. So maybe we can agree there is one legitimate Google "hit" here .... not 130,000 or even 12,100. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPaloAlto_dd09.html" title="User:PaloAlto">PaloAlto</a> 19:09, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Could the mention be restricted to the disambiguation page?</dd>

IMO, the two valid keep votes above are based on Google results that are argued against quite successfully, and the four delete votes provide a much better argument. However, I'd prefer to get more feedback before I delete. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><b>e</b></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">ath</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 21:31, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</div>
