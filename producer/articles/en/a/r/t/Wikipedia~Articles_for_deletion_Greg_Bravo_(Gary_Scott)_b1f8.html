<li><b>Keep</b> since positive, official, and reliable sources that can be easily <i><b>verified</b></i> indicate that he definitely is performing as the lead singer of the band Steam, at least in the past two decades. No <i><b>reliable</b></i> and accurate sources that can be <i>verified</i> show that he is not or was not what the article says. From what I can see, Fortheloveofhampsters is also trying to mold history to meet his own beliefs and expectations without meeting the Wikipedia rules and guidelines on the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_%28band%29.html" title="Steam (band)">Steam (band)</a> article.

<dd>I also heartily invite everyone to look at the <b>history tabs</b> of every page involved with the article, including your own mediation reference (above), <b>to see how well you edit out everything that you do not like that people say about you or your side of the story, and how you make the story lean only in your favor!</b> I'm sure that the savvy administrators look at the tabs anyway, so take it light! And <a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">User:Ideogram</a>, if you read the policy you would know that Wikipedia <i>is</i> a democracy and not a DICTATORSHIP! That is why it was created in the first place. If the shoe fits wear it! If not, don't worry about it. - Ronny Stabile</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> because since anyone can write or edit on here, leaving it on here may give someone the impression that Greg Bravo may have written this himself. Any entertainer would have to be out of his mind to engage in such cheap PR tactics or even want this. I don't know who is right or wrong about the above gibberish, and do not even care. The intensity and controversy is very interesting, though--ad nauseam.

<p><b>*Comment</b> There is no reason to add my vote because it is pretty clear in which way this <i>vote</i> is heading, perhaps for the wrong reasons though some definitely seem to be right! It's hard to ignore the fact that this is all like whoever brings the most friends to a gang fight wins the day! There definitely is no fairness or impartiality involved, and that is truly remarkable for an organization that touts itself as an encyclopedia. Please stay away from the Beatles' articles! From what I can see above, my comment will probably be removed as though we were living under the order of the Third Reich. SunKing --71.249.8.236 18:10, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> ""Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye" in 1969, that later became an anthem at sports stadiums around the world." - sorry I have been in many sports stadia and seen even more on the box but I've never heard this one. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 23:47, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
