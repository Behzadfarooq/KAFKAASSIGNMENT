As the creator, artist and writer of said webcomic, I object to the comments made above. Firstly, with regards to the forums. The forums have never been very active but then this has never been a sign of the popularity (or supposed lack of it) of the comic. I recieve e-mails and talk to fans of the comic over MSN regularly and I have recieved nothing but positive feedback from them, apart from one or two comments relating to artwork that I have since rectified. The writer of the above comments shows their obvious lack of attention to detail when they state that the comic has "probably" over 100 strips. If they had read the comic at all, or the newsposts, they would find that the comic has indeed had over 100 strips (as illustrated in a anniversary comic) and that it is in fact, almost upto the sum of 150. I myself doubted the popularity of my comic at one point, but I have recently installed a statcounter on my site and am happy to report that Rooms now recieves more visitors (and more returning visitors) than it has done in the history of the comic and this is currently on the rise. I also would like to call into question the amount of traffic cited as being reasonable for a web-comic. A friend of mine, who has been a long time supporter of the site, described it as "ludicrous", and I myself have to concur. There are many webcomics on the internet, with articles on this very site, which have lower levels of traffic than the proposed number. I therefore propose that the subject in question is not whether Rooms should be deleted but whether any of the many small webcomic entries of wikipedia should be allowed to remain. I personally believe that they should not be removed as there are always people who will be interested in procuring information about less well known comics and to deny them this opportunity would be a grave shame. The description of my comic as "totally unnotable...in every way" in the above comment is also very subjective. It seems to me as if the comment was written by someone who just decided that they didn't like the comic (or possibly myself) and therefore it was worthy to be removed from wikipedia. I know for a fact that my readers wouldn't describe my comic as "unnotable" and I believe this subjective viewpoint to weaken the rest of the writer's arguments. Obviously, the final verdict is upto you but please consider the matter carefully before you reach your verdict. For it is not just the fate of this entry that you will be deciding but of all small-time comic entries. Thank you. - Euan Mumford 17:05, 1st October 2005</p>

<li><b>Reply</b> - Do you know that your webcomic is already at <a href="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Rooms" class="external text" title="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Rooms" rel="nofollow">comixPedia</a>. Comixpedia is the place for small time webcomics, as you yourself have said. And regarding the mention of webcomics at wikipedia which are even more non notable. We will be deleting them too, AFD takes time. My concern has been that guidelines at <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a> have been overly lax, compare say with <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Had your the article in question not been in the webcomic category, and listed as a website instead, it would have definitely be deleted. My opinion of your webcomic did not come into play during this nomination, or any nomination that I may make. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 23:57, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is another example of Hahnchen's poorly worded, baseless, and aggressive AfD nominations. This exact same thing happened <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Built_for_Comfort" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Built_for_Comfort" rel="nofollow">last week</a>, with that comic described as having 'hardly any' readers and as being 'minor minor' - despite having page views into the thousands and almost 550 strips in the archive. It seems that no statistics decide which articles get deleted except the whims of Hahnchen himself, who has admitted on his talk page to having no real knowledge of webcomics. --<a href="../../../h/i/j/User%7EHijamiefans_b84c.html" title="User:Hijamiefans">Hijamiefans</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> - I object, my nominations are usually very well worded and arguments explained. Webcomics are not inherently more notable than websites, no matter what you may claim on my talk page. There are many more popular blogs/pornsites/forums than the webcomic in question, we should not judge webcomics with a totally different criteria. As for real people going to wikipedia to look up small time comic entries, they should be going to comixpedia. If that isn't good enough for those budding webartists, then obviously it's a problem with their ego. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 12:47, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
