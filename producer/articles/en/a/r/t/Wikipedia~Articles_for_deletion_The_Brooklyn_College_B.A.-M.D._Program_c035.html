<p>Brooklyn College's B.A.-M.D. is a notable program at the City University of New York. It receives 500 applications a year from some of the New York Tri-state Areas brightest students, of these, it only accepts 17. B.A.-M.D. is also a pipeline program that the princeton review mentions in its guide of medical schools under SUNY downstate, the major state medical school of NY and the only state school in NYC. Lastly, AAMC cites it under its book of medical schools with BA/MD programs. <b>keep</b> <a href="../../../m/r/b/User%7EMrbabymonkey_5ac9.html" title="User:Mrbabymonkey">Mrbabymonkey</a></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Mrbabymonkey. I know he voted keep, but I believe his argument justifies the opposite.

<li>The program accepts 17 of <i>500</i>, not to mention <i>many more</i> that are advised not to apply by school counselors due to the program's extreme selectivity (most students in the program finish in the top two percent of their class, and the median SAT score is in the 98 percentile). Also, the program has as much credence as the <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophie_Davis_School_of_Biomedical_Education_ac46.html" title="Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education">Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education</a> which the program rivals.

<li><b>KEEP</b>. Combined programs are very different from standard pre-med undergrad in that they often have their own unique courses and curriculums. Although the Brooklyn College BA-MD program is affiliated with both Brooklyn College and SUNY Downstate, it cannot be grouped under either educational institution for this reason. It is simply different. This page is a KEEP. Pooja.bhatt

<li>check the ip addresses, no sockpuppetry here. Although i must say there is something awfully wrong when someone tries to add content to wikipedia but is shot down everytime for apparently little reason. What does it need to be notable enough to have its own page? does it have to be affiliated with an Ivy-league? Do you have a problem with the fact that someone who wrote about it is a "n0ob" maybe? Should I write a cute "about me" page first? B.A.-M.D. has been around for 37 years and is a fairly well known program in the New York tristate area. Just because the wikipedia deletion police has never heard about it, does not mean it does not exist. Wikipedia is for the people, not the select few who patrol it. <a href="../../../m/r/b/User%7EMrbabymonkey_5ac9.html" title="User:Mrbabymonkey">Mrbabymonkey</a></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree with <a href="../../../m/r/b/User%7EMrbabymonkey_5ac9.html" title="User:Mrbabymonkey">User:Mrbabymonkey</a> that the Brooklyn College B.A.-M.D. program is real. However, I do not believe that Wikipedia needs to have individual articles about joint degree programs merely because they exist. The only thing that Wikipedia needs to say about this program is "Brooklyn College offers an 8-year B.A.-M.D. program with SUNY Downstate Medical Center," with a link to the program site at <a href="http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bamd/bamdmain.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bamd/bamdmain.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<li><b>KEEP</b> The BA-MD program at Brooklyn college has been in existence for almost 40 years and has graduated over 600 physicians, almost all of whom are in active practice to this day in almost all fields of medicine ranging from primary care physicians in underserved areas, to cutting edge research, to highly specialized surgeons. By allowing this entry to remain, and added to, wikipedia allows those who search out physicians who have such a broad educational background provided by the BA-MD program a place to find them - via a (hopefully) eventual graduates list like many other educational institutions. Yes, the program is small, but that is what makes it unique. With so many high school students choosing to apply to such programs, and wikipedia increasingly being used as a de-facto search engine, this is an excellent way for students to find such relevant information. With so many articles on relatively useless topics ranging from cartoons to pornography, this entry has positive social implications and should be expanded upon.Chakrabs 02:20, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>""KEEP" This is a credible entry. The information is accurate as can be confirmed by comparing it to the linked websites. The number of students in the program has nothing to with whether or not this article should be included. The primary issue of concern should be the accuracy of the content. This article can be a source of valuable information for students who are applying to the program as wikipedia is becoming a popular source. Often time official websites can be hard to find or present a lot of information that can be presented in an intimedating way. This article allows students to learn about this program in clear way. Because the program is relativly small and many times unfamiliar to many potential applicants, an article about it is even more important. For these reasons this entry should be kept. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Anon123 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Anon123_0073.html" title="Special:Contributions/Anon123">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>KEEP This school has admission rate of 3.4% of its applicants with a median high school GPA of 3.8 unweighted and median SAT scores in the 98th percentile. That academic criteria alone only grants a student an interview, during which the students charachter, extra curricular promise, problem solving skills, cultural refinement, and interpersonal skills are evaluated. For nearly 40 years we have been offering a superb medical education while still allowing students to pursue the benifits of a liberal arts background at the minimal cost to the student. For example, the undergraduate education is FREE because these exceptional young students are elite to say the least. They defer admission to schools such as Dartmouth, Yale, Columbia, Georgetown, Cornell, Brown University, and Washington University St. Louis to name a few. Students in this program also have a mean MCAT score of 32.3 which is well above the national average, as well as the average MCAT score for matriculating students. By not allowing this program to have a full entry students who are very bright, talented, and the paragons of success may not have access to an education; furthermore, this page must be seperate from Brooklyn College's because most of these elite students are interested in the program itself, and thus may not be able to reap the programs advantages and opportunities if it is merged with brooklyn college's page - Ravi815 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 172.134.137.77 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.134.137.77_a671.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.134.137.77">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Strange how there are suddenly all these experts on this school's particular academic program coming out of the woodwork.

<li>Yes, because I, like most people, have at least 10-15 computers at my disposal. Perhaps, this program just effects more people than some of us previously thought. And hypothetically speaking, in the <i>ridiculous</i> event that I don't have 25-gazillion computers, shouldn't the movement of so many people to save one article, that is, to setup accounts and learn how to edit wikipedia, be enough to preserve this one article? <a href="../../../m/r/b/User%7EMrbabymonkey_5ac9.html" title="User:Mrbabymonkey">Mrbabymonkey</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I'd like to point out that any given college student has access to "25-gazillion" computers. And to answer your question, no it isn't. I'm pretty sure that editors who have actually spent time on WP, rather than new users who started just to protest this AFD, have more weight in issues such as this. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 06:03, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>First, let us not be presumptuous, and assume I am a college student. Let us not assume anything including that these new users have set up accounts to protest this one issue. Second, the City University of New York is closed for passover break, and assuming I am affiliated with it, I certainly wouldn't have acces to "25-gazillion" computers at 2 in the morning. <a href="../../../m/r/b/User%7EMrbabymonkey_5ac9.html" title="User:Mrbabymonkey">Mrbabymonkey</a>

<li><b>Comment</b> The quality and ability of editors on Wikipedia cannot be based solely on how many edits have been made in the past. I have been an avid Wikipedia user for a while now. Just because I did not create an account and make edits does not indicate that I am unaware of how Wikipedia works and the policies that it keeps. I also particularly take offense to people claiming that I do not exist, and that I am actually just another of the gazillion computers at Brooklyn College run by Mrbabymonkey. It is in fact possible that more than one person exists who passionately and articulately expresses their defense of the page. You can check the IP addresses, and you'll notice that my computer does not have Brooklyn College's IP address. So for all of you "valid editors" of Wikipedia, I'm sure everyone would appreciate it if you backed off on your false accusations and trivial "comments" and just listened to what we have to say. Pooja.bhatt
<ul>
<li>It isn't. And your comments are welcome. However, since there is no way to distinguish accounts with no previous edits from people who've just signed up for one to influence an AfD discussion, their remarks are given less weight.
