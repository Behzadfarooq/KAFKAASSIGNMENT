<li><b>Delete</b> Yes, as the original author of the article, I too, believe it should be deleted. I did not know there was other pages dedicated to this. BUT, as a compromise, someone needs to edit the Autobot page to include the year released. The Decepticon page already includes this. Please update the references to this article too, when it is deleted. Also, this was my first page created, but I learned a lot from doing it. Sharwood - Psy1123eu 2:16, 14 February 2007 (CST)</li>

<p>This article was written shortly after its subject's murder in 2005. However, being the victim of a murder does not automatically indicate <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">encyclopedic notability</a>, and there are no other indications of notability. Also, the article is written like a crime log, and not <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">an encyclopedia article</a>. <b><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Core</a><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoredesat_227a.html" title="User talk:Coredesat"><font color="#3399FF">desat</font></a></b> 00:22, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b><s>Weak delete</s></b> <b>Weak keep</b> <i>I guess I am now convinced this was enough of a national thing...</i> I'm not convinced that yet another murder victim, even a high-profile one, deserves an entry.

<li>Brian, it looks to me that you are looking for a threshold of "importance", where WP calls for "notable" and the guidelines clearly state that the two are not the same. Notable is defined as being noticed, and media coverage to this degree is being noticed, whether the legal issues are important or not. Dito for Otto below. It's not for WP to judge the quality of mainstream journalism (e.g., Nancy Grace) but to offer factual information as a balance to the potential sensationalism. Again what is the harm of inclusion of this and other articles? --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 18:51, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, my arguments are based in notability, not importance. I have argued here and elsewhere that there is a qualitative difference between something being "newsworthy" and something being "notable." <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> specifically states that the two are not the same. Even assuming that this particular murder is notable, which I'm not convinced of, that does not automatically confer sufficient notability to the victim. See my Brinks and Capitol shooting article examples below.</li>
<li>As for judging the quality of journalism, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> do require that we evaluate the reputability of the sources used for articles.</li>
<li>"What is the harm," with all due respect, is perhaps the worst argument for including an article. No article (other than false or libelous ones) actually "harm" Wikipedia. That doesn't mean that every article warrants inclusion. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 19:48, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Etc., etc., etc. Seriously, take your pick. I'm not vouching for every individual story, but the overwhelming volume (A Nexis search confirms over 500 stories nationwide) and the fact that this was covered in huge news outlets all over the country. Maybe you could argue The Washington Post is local coverage, but honestly 20 times (says Nexis) in WashPost? That's not "anybody who gets murdered" coverage, that's something exceptional by itself. And as for "no sources attesting to this" the article itself already sites sources that mention this stuff.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I understand both sides of this argument, however after a little investigation I discovered that Wikipedia has articles on murderers whose only notability is that they have been executed. The facts of their cases have been obscured through the years. Take for instance <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_W._Peoples%2C_Jr._5b3f.html" title="John W. Peoples, Jr.">John W. Peoples, Jr.</a>. In addition, this is one of the few instances where the victim gained more notoriety than the murderer, and that alone bears importance. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESectryan_1ba0.html" title="User:Sectryan">Sectryan</a> 14:33, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Agree with one of the Richmond papers cited that this is just another case of a missing white girl getting disproportionate newspaper coverage that the other 99 missing people in Richmond that year did not.

<p>This is yet another non-notable web comic. Its Alexa ranking is over 600k (very poor), and the only places mentioning it seem to be blogs, forums, chat rooms, social sites, and other pages of little to no value or notability. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a DMOZ-style directory, and we should only be listing notable web comics - i.e., those which have had <i><b>a noticible effect on culture, society, and media, and are cited by established publications</b></i>.

<dd>Just because it is technologically and economically possible to list every named thing in the world, there is no practical reason to do so. Most of these webcomics have had no influence on the world, short of giving a bit of amusement to a very small and homogenous readership. The articles on them only appeal to strong fans of webcomics, who are seeking to discover new strips - other than that, nobody is going to read them or take interest in what they have to say. Such a page is basically the textbook definition of "fan site". Wikipedia is not a search engine or directory, and thus, should not be used to compile a list of every actively published strip currently in possession of a web address. Please tell me how these dime-a-dozen strips or the J. Random Cartoonists who pen them are notable. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetOracle_6091.html" title="User:NetOracle">NetOracle</a> 02:35, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No; I agree with you to an extent. For example, I believe this particular webcomic (Flint Again) is more fancruft than anything and doesn't really need to be featured here. However, not every webcomic is fancruft, and it would appear that you and I have very different interpretations of what sort of publicity or cultural influence characterizes a webcomic as notable. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENiffweed17_42c4.html" title="User:Niffweed17">Niffweed17, Destroyer of Chickens</a> 04:28, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Short of published server logs, Alexa is basically the only way of assessing how much traffic a site is receiving. It isn't perfect, but the only sites whose Alexa rankings are of no value are sites whose primary userbase detests the very idea of software analyzing their browsing habits, or whose users tend to use systems on which Alexa will not run. Even though I would never let it near my computers, I am not going to deny that tens of millions of clueless users run Alexa and follow links based on the exposure of those links. The site in question can't seem to muster up even a numbered ranking, which tells us that either it isn't very popular at all, or it is very popular but visited almost exclusively by powerusers and Linux users. Linux.com is currently at 5629, yet its primary audience isn't typically thought of as installing invasive toolbars on Windows systems. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetOracle_6091.html" title="User:NetOracle">NetOracle</a> 08:28, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: As noted, this is not yet ready for Wikipedia based on our standards of notability. However, I commend the editors of the article for their creativity, wish them well, and hope they can contribute to some other articles, perhaps on SF/fantasy topics. I also did some light spelling/punctuation cleanup of the article which you might note for your other site. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 17:09, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. We have to delete this article because although the books may have been written, they are not yet published and in the public domain, and documented by independent references ( that is, people and sources that aren't in some way directly connected to the authors ). One of our basic rules is that "Wikipedia is not a crystal ball": we can't have articles about things that haven't yet happened ( like the publication of books ). If the authors happen to read this, I'd like to say: keep working at your projects, and do the best you can, and the success ( and encyclopedia entries ) will come along when you're not looking for it ( and when you've completely forgotten about this debate, probably ). Best wishes for the future. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 19:23, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is yet another non-notable web comic, whose appeal seems very limited. The only places mentioning it seem to be blogs, forums, chat rooms, social sites, and other pages of little to no value or notability. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a DMOZ-style directory, and we should only be listing notable web comics - i.e., those which have had <i><b>a noticeable effect on culture, society, and media, and are cited by established publications</b></i>. This comic doesn't seem to have had much of an influence at all. Including any and all buzz found on Web 2.0 sites only leads to fancruft. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetOracle_6091.html" title="User:NetOracle">NetOracle</a> 01:49, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>keep</b>. as the article states, the webcomic has received some acclaim. As there is no real policy on what makes a webcomic notable, this article should be preserved. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENiffweed17_42c4.html" title="User:Niffweed17">Niffweed17, Destroyer of Chickens</a> 01:55, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I'm not disputing that. My problem with this webcomic-cruft is that the acclaim and praise comes from a very small segment of the population, as posted on personal sites, blogs, forums, etc, rather than from notable published sources. There seems to be an endless number of aspiring artists and adherents to the "Internet media culture" who can do little more than <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regurgitate.html" title="Regurgitate">regurgitate</a> <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_meme.html" title="Internet meme">memes</a> and engage in self-promotion.

<dl>
<dd>Well, why invalidate the feedback of blogs? The very presence of positive feedback, even if only largely present among internet communities, should account for some notability. It might not under Wikipedia policy. but such a distinction is immaterial as there presently is no policy to govern the treatment of this medium. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENiffweed17_42c4.html" title="User:Niffweed17">Niffweed17, Destroyer of Chickens</a> 02:21, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Blogs in general are not a reliable or noteworthy source. There are exceptions, of course, but the vast majority of blogs are sites for personal ramblings, and devoid of any audience not known to the author personally. We're talking about several orders of magnitude here. Basically, anything can be considered notable if personal sites are allowed to serve as a basis for notability. It is not hard at all to establish a personal site, and participate in enough community-driven forms of media to build several hundred references to that site by means of self-promotion. Thus, how can anything present in the non-notable blogs, but nowhere else, be considered notable? <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetOracle_6091.html" title="User:NetOracle">NetOracle</a> 02:41, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Once again a small minority of wikipedians are trying to delete notable webcomics. It's notability arises from 1) it has been published somewhere OTHER than it's home page (MMORPG.COM), which is NOT a just a "blog, forum, etc", it's a huge portal of content for MMORPG gamers. 2) There are over 7 million people playing World of Warcraft across the world, and the comic has been featured notibly on the WOW home page. 3) It has been nominated for awards - and as much as a large quantity of wikipedia editors don't want to recognize it - the web comic choice awards ARE a big deal in the field of webcomics, and being nominated meets notablity guidelines. All three of these items make this comic notable, notwithstanding the critical reviews included in the article. So to nominate it for deleteion SOLEY for the fact that it's not mentioned in the "buzz" on Web 2.0 sites this makes is absurd. And to nominate it for deletion because the reviews don't meet some personal criteria of "notablity" when there are other obvious reasons for notability is also unwarranted. Finally your editing comment "(Non-notable web comic, and we're going to sack it.)" shows you to be extremely biased on this topic in general, and your neutrality on this issue now brought into question. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimmccloud_d946.html" title="User:Timmccloud">Timmccloud</a> 02:48, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Note:</b> I find it a FASCINATING coincidence that the nomination for deletion has occured during the authors annual vaction (She won't be back until Feb 18th) so arguably the best reference for information about recent notabilty events is convienently away during the nomination for deletion. I don't suppose that the AFD might possibly be withdrawn until she returns? <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimmccloud_d946.html" title="User:Timmccloud">Timmccloud</a> 03:08, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd><b>Reply</b> The sources of supposed notability that you reference suffer from many of the same pitfalls of blogs, forums, and chat rooms.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First, this "ubersite" looks to be fairly open, and thus, the words of any one poster do not carry the weight or the reputation of the site as would the words of a senior staff writer for, as an example, <i>Forbes Magazine</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Next, we will address "MMORPG.COM". The only reference to the article's subject is the presence of one single strip, along with a link to the strip's website. There is no review or assertion of notability, and we don't know who is endorsing the comic, or why. Once again, the existence of a mention on a large or notable site does not necessarily convey any weight when determining notability. If I post an classified ad for used computer parts on <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craigslist.html" title="Craigslist">Craigslist</a>, is it proper to say that I am a "Active secondhand electronics distributor featured on an <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexa.html" title="Alexa">Alexa</a> Top 100 website"?
<dl>
<dd><b>Reply</b> Duh. The CURRENT comic is reposted on MMORPG every time a new one comes out. This has been happening for over a year - that constitues "publication". And it's part of the main site navigation, which means that it is PART OF THE WEBSITE. It's not just "posted" by someone. Unfortunately the press release that stated the publication is no longer available on the web, so all that can be done is post the link to the current page. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimmccloud_d946.html" title="User:Timmccloud">Timmccloud</a> 17:39, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you comment on an upstart technology company, it does not make them notable. If <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Berners-Lee_4c85.html" title="Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gates_65fa.html" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a>, or <a href="../../../b/u/s/BusinessWeek_6dfe.html" title="BusinessWeek">BusinessWeek</a> makes the same comment, then it may very well make the company notable. The common theme here is that "what is said" and "where it is said" is less important than "who says it".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the "Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards", this "organization" is not notable in itself. It appears to be some loosely-organized group of Internet cartoonists, established for the sake of mutual promotion. Awards are only notable if given by a notable organization, and this organization seems to be little more than a hastily constructed site maintained by a very small number of people who share a hobby. Every E-Mail address on the site is some form of free mail, and the site itself is poorly built. Furthermore, the site is hosted and operated by "Keenspace Entertainment", apparently for the purpose of drawing attention to the webcomics it hosts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are a great many notable websites which provide a constant stream of linkage. Most of this linkage is, however, not notable. Should everybody or everything which gets featured on the front page of the abomination known as "<a href="../../../d/i/g/Digg.html" title="Digg">Digg</a>" receive an article on Wikipedia?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The problem I have with the criteria being used here is that any single person, or a few devoted fans, given a few sockpuppets at user-driven sites, or just a regularly updated personal blog, can, under the criteria, elevate a personal creation to a level of notability warranting inclusion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The majority of these webcomics have become entrenched because their main readership - namely, those who are on the Internet for recreation constantly - edits Wikipedia with a frequency far removed from the general population. Some of these webcomics, which are essentially personal hobbies of their creators, have articles which far exceed multi-season national television shows and major motion pictures, in both depth and length. Think what you will about the worth and notability of webcomics, but please do not suggest that encyclopediac integrity is served by such a horribly disproportionate representation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please, again, tell me why these webcomics are notable, and how they matter in the overall scheme of things.</dd>

<dd>Your comment concerning the timing of the discussion, and the <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">hushed accusation of my intentions as being based in bad faith</a>, is rather inappropriate. I couldn't have named a single webcomic as of yesterday, and only began to care about these things yesterday after I saw a solid case for deletion destroyed by insane levels of meatpuppetry and fanboyism. I have a strong concern that postponing this discussion until the author returns will only allow time for a similar meatpuppet army to assemble. I'm not here to attack a specific strip - I only became involved in this because I saw the professionalism of Wikipedia being compromised by a steady encroachment of fancruft, and <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">wanted to remedy the situation</a>. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetOracle_6091.html" title="User:NetOracle">NetOracle</a> 03:41, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>UM. Where to begin... let's just focus on the things I can handle at 5am. The WCCA has been around since 2001 and also awards comics outside Keenspace (as a quick peek and ANY list of nominations would have told you), so it's hardly hastily assembled or promoting Keenspace comics. It has also been covered on TV, radio and has received half an article in the New York Times. This year's nomination will be at Megacon.</dd>
<dd>Your "meatpuppet army" will be the people who maintain the article. Sorry to tell you that, but slipping in an AfD while the comic is vacationing (and thus the editors may not feel the need to check the Wiki article since nothing changed) is going to look fairly bad.</dd>
<dd>May I ask what your "solid case for deletion" was? There have been 50+ (by now possibly 60+) such cases for webcomics alone during the past month, so it's somewhat hard to guess which one you mean. The recent wave (to which you just contributed) also explains the "meatpuppet" syndrome you oppose so much - The webcomic world is pretty much up in arms right now because of the dozens of AfDs that axed a few entries of comics that steadily updated for half a decade or so. Another entry of a published comic got axed and had to be recreated via DRV.</dd>
<dd>Oh, and somehow, your last paragraph makes it VERY hard to assume good faith. You effectively made the nominations because you saw another AfD being flooded. "Assuming good faith is about intentions, not actions."</dd>
<dd>Didn't you stop to think WHY the AfD got flooded? Your effort only contributes to the larger problem - the reputation of Wikipedia in the webcomic world. But considering that you "couldn't have named a single webcomic as of yesterday", I assume that this is not one of your major concerns. --Sid 3050 04:45, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The WCCA is not notable. Its website is of shoddy quality. It is hosted by an entity with a set of comics to promote, and therefore not impartial. Its awards seem to be distributed based on raw popular vote. Its coordinators have failed to establish their notability. Please provide evidence of "TV coverage". Is everything mentioned in any small capacity now suddenly notable?
<dl>
<dd><b>reply</b> not every non-profit orginization has the funding to hire the best webmasters, often these notable groups do with voulenteer work. Your assertion that the orginization is not notable based on 1) the quality of their website and 2) keenspot sponsering it has no merit. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimmccloud_d946.html" title="User:Timmccloud">Timmccloud</a> 17:39, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You said that the creator is on vacation, yet you assert that there is a large group of legitimate editors who wrote the article. Why should the creator's vacation have anything to do with this, unless you anticipated him rallying a group of puppets to action?</dd>
<dd>Have you considered that the trend of AfD'ing webcomics might be the result of a general backlash against fancruft accumulating within a <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walled_garden.html" title="Walled garden">walled garden</a>? Not everything is a vendetta or conspiracy.</dd>
<dd>I made the AfD because I saw another AfD in which a meatpuppet army tried to save an article about a non-notable subject. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ugly_Hill_e38e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ugly Hill">Ugly Hill AfD</a> was flooded with meatpuppets, and possibly sockpuppets. This should not be happening, and reflects poorly on those who engaged in ballot stuffing. This is the result of external fanboyism spilling over into Wikipedia. This sort of passion for a specific and generally non-notable string of subjects and characters is best reserved for a specific Wiki hosted by a Wikia-esque service.</dd>
<dd>Have you <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">considered</a> that I might have made these nominations for deletion because I honestly believe in principles such as <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Self-published_sources_.28online_and_paper.29" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>, and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Wikipedia%7EForum_for_Encyclopedic_Standards_ea28.html" title="Wikipedia:Forum for Encyclopedic Standards">encyclopedic standards</a>?

The website is easy to navigate, and I don't see how it is "shoddy". Subjectivity, much? And an official Wal-Mart site had been <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/02/06/walmarts_new_downloa.html" class="external text" title="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/02/06/walmarts_new_downloa.html" rel="nofollow">completely broken</a> in Firefox for a good while. Would that mean that Wal-Mart is non-notable? (No, don't answer that, I just used the example to stress the point that "good website" is not a notability criterion).</dd>
<dd>I did not "anticipate" a rally, but common sense implies that article editing frequency is in some relation to event frequency. When is it more likely for most editors to visit an article? When the primary information source does not update or when it does?</dd>
<dd>I am in no position to judge why dozens of major comic entries get vaped in large waves, but the nominations I saw hint that there either is bias or that the nominations were made by people with little knowledge about webcomics at all. The fact that the webcomic awards were quietly edged out of the Web Notability rules and then got vaped from Wikipedia (surrounded by quick nominations for comics that based their notability on them) sort of makes it hard to assume good faith for the whole situation.</dd>
<dd>Yes, I feared that you meant Ugly Hill. It's an award-winning and published webcomic, so of course the webcomic community (already in a "I might be next!" mood) spread the word about this nomination. There is a world outside of Wikipedia, and you can't expect it to stay silent during these deletion waves. Right now, the reputation of Wikipedia has suffered immensely in the eyes of webcomic communities, so you should expect a strong reaction to AfDs, especially for major comics. I'm not saying that I think this is a good thing, but I am realistic enough to see that it is quite inevitable.</dd>
<dd>Before your comments, I did assume good faith. But now I only see somebody nominating articles of a genre he knows nothing about, for the sole reason of retaliation for an AfD going a way you don't like. Your actions seem noble, but your motivation is not. I simply cannot assume that you act in good faith. This is just you going all "Oh, so you didn't like that, huh? Let's see how you like THIS!". So please spare me the "My only goal is to improve Wikipedia" talk, it sounds mighty hollow. --Sid 3050 12:38, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

And all of a sudden, a well-sourced article becomes not sourced at all. If an Admin suddenly declared CNN or the NYT to be non-notable, how many articles would fail to stand on their own? You cling to policies, but blindly accept that the wikiality suddenly changes. If/when WCCA gets restored, will you say "Yes, of course it fulfills policy"? I surely hope so.</dd>
<dd>A webcomic with more than five years of archived material, hundreds or thousands of strips and a dedicated fanbase don't count AT ALL in the current Web Notability rules. Without a dedicated newspaper article or a lengthy TV report, such a comic will be declared as non-notable as the average Geocities page. And thanks to the eager Admins who quickly got rid of the major webcomic awards, Wikipedia has become a "Get published or get out" site. So please tell me this: Is that the greater goal of Wikipedia? Kick out everything that hasn't changed the fate of mankind?</dd>
<dd>And I honestly ask you: What hurts the reputation of Wikipedia more: A few articles about things that have a large following, or pissing off thousands of people that read about Wikipedia's mass deletions on tons of blogs and webcomic news?</dd>

<dd>I never leveled an accusation of meatpuppetry or solicitation of meatpuppetry against any specific editor. I merely pointed out that a recent AfD had been plagued by an invasion of meatpuppets hell-bent on perpetuated the fancruft within. If an article can only be saved through meatpuppetry, its subject probably isn't notable to begin with. When I stand accused of timing my nomination to coincide with the vacation of a webcomic's author, I have to question why the author's vacation should even enter in to the equation. <i><b>Is the motion for postponment based strictly on a desire to see one person be able to comment on the AfD, or is it a cover for something more sinister, such as the author making a website, forum, chat, or blog entry soliciting meatpuppet activity?</b></i></dd>

<dd>I cannot speak for other editors, but I did not put forth this nomination as an underhanded and hostile way of calling for sources. We have templates which are used to request sources when an article which probably meets notability guidelines is lacking the sources which make it whole. I put forth this nomination because I have a genuine belief that this webcomic does not meet notability guidelines, and the sources it is built on fail to establish notability and importance in a manner which maintains professionalism and encyclopedic integrity. Wikipedia has policies on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Self-published_sources_.28online_and_paper.29" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>, and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Wikipedia%7EForum_for_Encyclopedic_Standards_ea28.html" title="Wikipedia:Forum for Encyclopedic Standards">encyclopedic standards</a> for good reason. I feel the letter and spirit of these policies is breached by this article and the sources used to support its alledged notability.</dd>

Regardless of whether the article is deemed to be notable or not, this and many other webcomic-related articles have articles in size and depth which are grossly disproportionate to their notability and importance.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I had not heard of this strip prior to perusing the AFDs in examining the contention that webcomics are being targeted. Alexa ranking (32,000) bears out what the various links within the article and the previous VFD indicate, namely, that this is a very heavily trafficked comic with great prominence in the online RPG community. That is has been published independently online as well as in print make it clearly notable by the standards of Wikipedia. I will further note that the assertion of the WCCA as non-notable is disputable. I do not wish to assume bad faith, but I find NetOracle's expressed desire to "sack" this article to be a disturbing indicator of such. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 08:47, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I am an avid reader of the comic, as well as many people I know both personally and through the internet. We are certainly not meatpuppets and I take offense at this insinuation. Through his claims of ballot stuffing and meatpuppetry, NetOracle could explain away any kind of following or rallying in defense of this comic without any proof. Simply because he does not take interest in this webcomic or others does not mean it is not notable. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESheora_8d3c.html" title="User:Sheora">Sheora</a> 09:48, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I fail to see the validity in NetOracle's argument on notability. Among webcomic circles, The Noob is regularly very highly ranked on two of the three comic listings, and has a very active and supportive reader community. If this was a "Webcomic Wiki" there should be little doubt that all webcomics that are a) active and b) regularly updated should be represented. So why here is the judgement made that being only a webcomic individual instances that have not been presented in mainstream national media should be considered not notable?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>You admit yourself that you hadn't really encountered webcomics - you are most likely a totally inappropriate person to judge the notability of an individual entity in a sphere that does not interest you. Someone may be interested in military modelling and do an article on a specific era of modelling -- totally uninteresting to me, but probably extremely useful for some die hard modelling fanatics, and good for them. Wikipedia is precisely about having in depth and accurate articles broadly across as many topics is possible for the information and reading of the general public. On the whole I only come to Wikipedia to look up things I don't already know about.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You claim that the support comes from a small section of population? So does most support for things that are not worldwide phenomena, so why would that make them less interesting as included articles as a whole? I suspect there is more current interest in The Noob than, for example, the Roman writer <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columella.html" title="Columella">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columella</a>, yet he manages to escape any need for deletion. Why not have every writer from every culture ever that there is some kind of written record of? Most of those will not be at all notable to vast swathes of the population, yet I suspect there will be little complaint about such historical figures.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You talk about main media resources. I doubt for a second that BBC News, Reuters, Tim Berners-Lee, Bill Gates, ZDNet or anyone else has written about Columella, so lets sack that article too. In fact, lets Google for each Wiki article we find that looks obscure, and if there appears to be no large international media story or commentary about them then sack those articles too! And so we can steadily destroy the fantastic library of genuine interest articles that Wikipedia has managed to set up.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This site builds its reputation for two reasons. Firstly, it is on the whole well researched, works hard to avoid bias and provide a balanced argument in areas of contention, and is well presented and supported both by users and moderators. Secondly, it is extremely broad with a wide reach into the most obscure of subcategories in any given subject. Webcomics are now popular enough that some writers earn their entire living from donations, and I cannot see how your personal interest in them can be used as a judging factor in whether or not they should be allowed on Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So having already had so many comments that it should be kept in this discussion, perhaps it is notable to enough people to keep, especially as so far your reasoning for removing it appears not to have gathered much momentum? And perhaps webcomic entries should be moderated and marked potentially as AfD by administrators and content moderators with some level of interest in webcomics as a whole? <a href="../../../t/o/p/User%7ETopazg_da42.html" title="User:Topazg">Topazg</a> 11:02, 10 February 2007 (UTC) <small>— <a href="../../../t/o/p/User%7ETopazg_da42.html" title="User:Topazg">Topazg</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Topazg_69f1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Topazg">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Can we all slow down a bit here before we get carried away? On all sides? The debate has been getting pretty heated. Timmccloud, even if we had any reason to assume that NetOracle knew the comic's author was away, it wouldn't make a difference. Articles are supposed to stand on their own merits. Getting authors involved is in no way policy, required or common, nor has it been beneficial in several cases where one did get involved. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 11:24, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

The train wreck at Ugly Hill was far from usual, the worst one I've seen in this field. Your assumptions - the WCCA are for self-promotion, meatpuppetry is to be expected - are broad, severe and, well, wrong.<br />
Sid has a point, too.

<li><b>Keep</b> This comic is generally well known, it has been referanced on major sites (web comic awards, Blizzard main page, various gaming sites), and as shown above even published. My own initial exposure to it came from ingame references from other players and images from it being used as forum avatars/linked inside posts, on the World of Warcraft forums. Which says something about it having a following in the gaming community. There's probably 5-10 or so other webcomics of similar notability that i can think of, and i don't think cutting off most of the webcomic content on wikipedia helps anyone who actually has any interest in the subject. --Helixdq 02:32, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I would like to disagree. What calls the reputation of wikipedia into question is the fact that a small minority keep on calling wikipedia's <b>objectivity</b> into question by deleting what they have <i>subjectively determined</i> to be subjective content. The objectivity of wikipedia is of more value to the site's reputation than anything else. If wikipedia is not objective, then how can it be trusted at all? Just because it contains vast amounts of what could be considered trivial data (please note that the articles regarding Knuckles the Echidna and Hitmonchan are longer than the article on European History), that does not mean that this data is not a valid reference for those who seek it. Furthermore, due to the open nature of a wiki they are going to struggle for a long time to come before they are regarded as "solid and reliable". Right now, objectivity is all that wikipedia has, and it is being fast eroded by the same pomposity displayed in the passage I have quoted. <a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETotalnerduk_0f92.html" title="User:Totalnerduk">TNUK</a> 00:52, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why do you classify the articles as "objective", yet deletion decisions "subjective"? I agree with you that objectivity is essential, and that is why I launched this deletion process to begin with. Writing a long, in-depth article about a subject <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">because you like it</a> conflicts with established principles of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Self-published_sources_.28online_and_paper.29" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>, and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Wikipedia%7EForum_for_Encyclopedic_Standards_ea28.html" title="Wikipedia:Forum for Encyclopedic Standards">encyclopedic standards</a>. The articles you mentioned are far too long for an objective encyclopedia not associated with a specific form of pop culture, and probably shouldn't exist. Writing a long and detailed article for a non-notable subject only gives it a false sense of notability to those not familiar with it. Wikipedia needs to be objective, and part of this involves fans of a particular entertainment medium or specific work controlling the impulse to bypass encyclopedic standards and source integrity simply because the subject in question made an impact on their life. <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> frequently sacks articles profiling small, non-notable bands. The people writing these articles (generally the members themselves, or their close friends) do so in good faith, but without the objectivity of a neutral observer. There are thousands of non-notable bands, just as there are thousands of non-notable webcomics, and neither belong on Wikipedia. Inclusion in Wikipedia can give a reader a false sense of notability, and readers of Wikipedia should not be deceived as to notability because several people <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">like it</a>.</dd>

<dd>Conversely, holding a distaste for something is not a valid reason to delete or prune it. At this point, let us make an important semantical distinction: not liking something is not the same as disliking something. Of particular concern are some of the comments that I have received indicating that someone who does not like webcomics has no business in pruning them down or deleting them. <b>This notion is misguided; if only people who like webcomics participate in those articles, then they will fill up with biased fancruft.</b> How can an article be objective if only one viewpoint is considered? The only people who should not participate in webcomic-related discussions are those who have vendettas against webcomics. I don't have a vendetta against webcomics; I simply don't find them humorous, and I don't associate with the typical nerd/gamer stereotypes portrayed in them. If I were to go around nominating things which I dislike for not being entertaining at all, I would have started with <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speed_2.html" title="Speed 2">Speed 2</a>, as pretty much everyone agrees that it sucks. If I were going to <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">troll</a> the genre, I would have started with a notable webcomic such as <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_Arcade_4103.html" title="Penny Arcade">Penny Arcade</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The reason this discussion seems excessively long is because a significant amount of <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">biased editing by fans</a> has transpired in the past, and the community as a whole needs to develop standards for webcomic inclusion. This debate has already been had with other fancruft-prone subjects, such as <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a>, and the articles in those genre have been evaluated for notability, and much of the cruft transwikied to places which exist specifically for non-objective writing. When we look at articles, we must do so from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. If multiple, non-trivial published sources document a subject, then it meets inclusion criteria, and should be documented in an objective way that does not falsely misrepresent the notability of the subject to multiple, disinterested third parties. I have a concern that the cruft found in many of the webcomic articles is both not useful and misrepresentative to those reading Wikipedia as an objective encyclopedia. I could have just as easily gone after other instances of cruft; the massive number of articles on non-notable <a href="../../../i/d/o/Idol_series.html" title="Idol series">Idol</a> contestants is ridiculous too, and had I encountered it before I did similarly problematic articles on webcomics, I'd be off trying to apply encyclopedic standards to it, instead of here. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetOracle_6091.html" title="User:NetOracle">NetOracle</a> 04:33, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The presence of cruft in an otherwise notable article is a symptom of the same <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">ILIKEIT</a> editing which has created non-notable articles to begin with. Thus, non-notable webcomics do far more harm than fancruft-filled articles like the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_62cc.html" title="Final Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a> series. An article such as <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinfest.html" title="Sinfest">Sinfest</a> would be much more deserving of a cruft cleanup tag than an AfD tag. Completely unencyclopedic articles are a much greater concern than articles with a bit of cruft; i.e., cruft in itself is less misrepresentative to a reader than the existence of an article which probably shouldn't be around in the first place. AfD is not a substitute for cruft cleanup, and we haven't established that this webcomic is notable, given that this AfD is still open. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetOracle_6091.html" title="User:NetOracle">NetOracle</a> 06:14, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Perhaps AfD it again a little bit later? --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 09:39, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>In response to NetOracle:</b> You ask why do I classify the articles as "objective", yet deletion decisions "subjective"? The answer is simple. Wikipedia uses set criteria to assess objectivity in articles - criteria which the article under discussion certainly meet. Deletion (and even the motion to delete the article itself) is therefore subjective, by the standards of wikipedia. This blatant display of double standards is the reason that I felt compeeled to add my two pennorth', and the reason why I am very close to giving up on ever being able to treat wikipedia as being an objective, credible source.<br />
You may or may not be aware of my meaning in my initial response to you. I am unsure, because you say things like <i>"The articles you mentioned are far too long for an objective encyclopedia not associated with a specific form of pop culture, and probably shouldn't exist."</i> as though this adds weight to your query regarding objectivity. In actual fact, you have merely repeated my setiments quite succinctly. You go on to say that you are trying to "apply encyclopedic standards to articles" such as this one. What I think you mean is that you are deleting articles entirely subjectively. Case in point: this article meets the required standards, and therefore in order to apply encyclopedic standards, one merely needs to clean up the style (not the content) of the article so that it may be brought into line. You say that "the community as a whole needs to develop standards for webcomic inclusion", yet instead of this, you are acting in an highly subjective manner by removing content <i>before such standards have even been established</i>.<br />
You refer to "cruft". If "cruft" is the problem, then why not remove "cruft" from the article and ensure that it properly conforms to the required standard, then protect it. Surely a basic article giving objective and encyclopedically delivered facts is far better than a gap in the supposedly omniscient databank that many editors seem to regard wikipedia as?<br />
I can only hope that the madness does not spread, or next any article that mentions God (or references another which mentions God) will be deleted for not having an ojective enough worldview, and being about entirely subjective worldviews (which is of course an entirely subjective opinion as God's existance can not at this point be proved or disproved, and any attempt to do either on the site would be frowned upon as "original thinking". If this happens, then who knows where it will end?<br />
The pomposity and hypocrisy of those who would seek to control and/or limit the flow of information across the internet never ceases to astound me. Just as I think I have seen the worst example possible, another crops up that is ten times as bad (and often this is the case when one bad yet impassioned idea is raised in support of a previous and equally execrable idea).<br />

<li><b>Keep</b> - Notable because of its history and references. In addition, most mall articles were/are not this detailed and sourced. Finally, no valid reason for deletion has been presented. It has already been noted, but I think it should be reiterated: each article should be considered on its merits; in the case of bundled nominations, criticism of one article should apply equally to all. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:13, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> The history here does appear to be murky; the web site claims that the pageant has run since the mid 60's, but it is unclear whether the pageant winners in the 60s were in the same pageant, or just one with the same name. It would be nice to have a reliable third-party history, and we don't have one. It has clearly never had much notoriety outside the "adult" community, except briefly in the 60s when Playboy was publicizing it (if that was in fact the same title.) If more sources were found, I might change my vote. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 03:02, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless more sources are found. I've heard news stories about this contest for years (on legit news programs, to boot). I'm really surprised there's no web site for this contest, especially in this age of all sort of "adult content" on the web. (Maybe I should start one, eh??) Does seem a bit odd, so dump it. <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealkyhick_ef0f.html" title="User:Realkyhick">Realkyhick</a> 04:03, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> google nets almost 450 distinct hits, which I think is enough to prove that this thing actually exists. I can't find any real press for the contest, which is kind of arbitrary since there are no notability guidelines for beauty pageants. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENiffweed17_42c4.html" title="User:Niffweed17">Niffweed17, Destroyer of Chickens</a> 04:35, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">PNC</a> applies here just as it does elsewhere, as indeed does our <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> policy. If you cannot find anything at all written about the pageant, how do you expect an article to be written about it? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 07:51, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I would argue that there are enough reliable sources that make minor mention of the subject so that it passes <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a>. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENiffweed17_42c4.html" title="User:Niffweed17">Niffweed17, Destroyer of Chickens</a> 18:48, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would agree if the information can be used to build a meaningful article, but mere mention of its existance 500 times, doesn't build the text. See my note below about a Miss Nude Pageants article. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 19:51, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>So where are these reliable sources that tell us about this subject, then? Please cite some. You appear to be conflating a non-zero count of Google search results with the existence of sources. <b>Counting Google hits is not research.</b> It's necessary to actually read the things that Google turns up. Do so, and you'll find that there's scant information that is directly about this pageant. I've yet to find a reliable source that gives the year that the pageant started, for example. If you find one, please cite it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:49, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> One would think that given how big porn is on the net, and that this pagent has apparently been running since the 60s, there would be some reliable sources. Damned if I can find them, however. This suggests to me that while we can verify its existence, it simply is not notable. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 05:17, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, there appear to have been at least two, possibly separate, Miss Nude Universe pageants -- the one that <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitten_Natividad_b9b3.html" title="Kitten Natividad">Kitten Natividad</a> is said to have won in the early 1970s, and the one owned by Rio Rivers that folded in 2005 after "15 years" in the business (<i>pace</i> infrogmation). --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 05:44, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Page 124 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0595309267</a> confirms that at least one Miss Nude Universe pageant exists. But that is <i>all</i> that it says about it, including it in a laundry list of "other special pageants". I can also find sources that state that there was a Miss Nude Universe Pageant held in Naked City (<a href="../../../r/o/s/Roselawn%2C_Indiana_7b8a.html" title="Roselawn, Indiana">Roselawn, Indiana</a>) in the 1960s and 1970s. But Naked City closed in 1986 when Dick Drost left, and, once again, the sources don't actually say anything about the pageant since it is Naked City that they are in fact discussing. Indeed, there are several that say that it was actually Miss Nude America, not Universe. I can also find several biographies of people that state that they were "winner of Miss Nude Universe" in some year or other.
<p>There's tangential information all over the place about other things that mention this pageant, or some other similarly named one. There are people who are recorded as having won a title of Miss Nude Universe. There is a nudist camp that is recorded as having hosted a contest by that name. But the important 3 words are "about other things". There's scant information that is actually about the pageant directly. I am unable to find out even basic information about the pageant itself, such as a list of year-by-year winners, or even that all of these disparate snippets of information in discussions of other things are actually about the same single contest. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 07:51, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per Brianyoumans' and Uncle G's comments. It appears difficult to get reliable information on the thing. Perhaps if someone later actually gets that information and actually types it in, the article could be revived.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 15:00, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral Comment</b> There might be enough here to write an article about Miss Nude Pageants: World, Universe, America, Australia etc with redirects from each and discuss the history of the various pagents.

<li><b>Keep</b>, being a stub isn't a good enough reason for deletion. I think it is a clear from this discussion that something of this sort certainly has existed and been mentioned in the media multiple times.Though future editors should also take heed of this discussion and be carefull in building up this page as clearly this subject has a confusing and murky history. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 06:12, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-notable director who is only credited with two episodes and has done little else of note. It has already been established that merely writing or directing a few Simpsons episodes is not notable enough. The problem is that random editors create these pages and don't add any categories, meaning these pages can exist for months without anyone knowing. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 02:59, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Using the criteria of a ban or restriction assesses the response of a community or powerful authority figure to a piece of literature, and therefore, is a noteworthy fact.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The essential subject, "controversial literature", seems like the kind of thing we ought to have an article on. I don't know if the article should extensively list examples the way it does, but I feel we can handle the general topic in some sort of sensible, NPOV way. We could look at how various types of literature are restricted or frowned upon by societies in various times and the reasons for that, how literature can highlight polarization when different elements in societies react to it in sharply different ways, and how it can bring an issue to the forefront of debate, etc. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:24, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I argue that schools are notable because they have a profound affect on their pupils (this could be several thousand people, depending on the age &amp; size of a school).

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with Niffweed. Schools are a very debated topic and no real policy exists in dealing with them. There are many high schools that have articles on wiki. Does the controversy arise from the fact that this is both an elementary school and high school? --<font color="#0000CC"><a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysepsion_8adb.html" title="User:Dysepsion">† Ðy§ep§ion †</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/y/s/User_talk%7EDysepsion_77d7.html" title="User talk:Dysepsion"><i>Speak your mind</i></a></sup></font> 19:52, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> High school, elementary school, or a combination, there has to be <i>something</i> to say beyond the mere directory info. I usually say delete, but thats only because the articles usually say nothing notable about the school. <i>The solution to the problem of what to do with school articles is to write better school articles.</i> <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:43, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> now that the sourcing issue has been dealt with, the school does appear to be somewhat notable partially due to its sports program. <a href="../../../%28/j/a/User%7E%28jarbarf%29.html" title="User:(jarbarf)">(jarbarf)</a> 17:19, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Referencing back to the first comment, I want to remind everyone that there is not policy of notability on schools. The requirement of stating some assertion of notability is mainly created on the fact that millions of articles that are <i>commercially based</i> or focused <i>individual</i> self-promotion would be littered all over wikipedia. I believe that if any article that is not advertising in this said manner is viable. In addition, as an additional requirement, I believe that articles should have some substance and according to policy, they should have some referenced material or at least list some legitimate sources. This article appears to have some information, and I am sure that in the future, individuals could work on and improve the article based on these sources. --Thank You. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh17_09da.html" title="User:Sukh17">Sukh17</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><sup><a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh17_5dc2.html" title="User talk:Sukh17">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sukh17_a7a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sukh17">Contribs</a></sup></span> 19:29, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> this POV-laden, OR-laden article. Superheroes' personal timelines are nto generally pinned down to specific "years ago". Batman's age is not specified. The issues cited for some of those items refer in no way to specific dates or connected to now. All fiction is supposed to be written in present tense anyway. Real world calendars do not correlate with superheroes' fictional personal history, and the fictional personal history is rarely dated. It exists on a well-established sliding scale of time without exact spans of time. Even when exact spans of time are mentioned, they continually shift to fit the sliding scale of time for the fictional history.

<dd><i>"Superheroes' personal timelines are nto generally pinned down to specific "years ago".</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This is debatable as no official stance has been provided on this. If you can provide one, please do.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Batman's age is not specified."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>True. However if you'll read the hidden comment I placed next to that section you'll find determining the character's age (approximate with a 1-2 year margin of error) is a matter of simple addition.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The issues cited for some of those items refer in no way to specific dates or connected to now."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Character's ages, such as Tim Drake's, are often mentioned in the comics (they vary). The time differences between the points in this article are based on the differences in the given ages of the characters between stories.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"All fiction is supposed to be written in present tense anyway."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by this. There are clearly chronological gaps in the Batman stories, as shown by the changes in the characters' ages.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Real world calendars do not correlate with superheroes' fictional personal history"</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This article is a chronicling of a fictional personal history and doesn't refer to real world history.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"the fictional personal history is rarely dated."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>No dates are given in the article.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"It exists on a well-established sliding scale of time without exact spans of time. Even when exact spans of time are mentioned, they continually shift to fit the sliding scale of time for the fictional history. Batman and his supporting cannot naturally age."</i></dd>

<p>I realise that the timeline the DC universe uses is not parallel to that of the real world. This seems to be the misunderstanding here.</p>

<dd>I see this article as no less relevant than a plot summary in a film article. It is a list of the most siginifcant events in the current version of the character.

The <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_the_DC_Universe_4e02.html" title="Timeline of the DC Universe">Timeline of the DC Universe</a> is not fancruft, it is an official DC comics institution, featured in their comics (usually on Annuals or Secret Files specials) and used as reference by both creators and comics fans. It therefore deserves inclusion in Wikipedia as much as the timeline of any other fictional series or universe. Complaints that it might contain inaccuracies are irrelevant, as we're trying to present the facts as DC publishes them, not getting into fan arguments. (Whether Batman deserves his own separate timeline or should be merged with the main DC Timeline is debatable- I understand an official Batman timeline <b>was</b> once published but have no access to it.) - <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilfredo_Martinez_bee1.html" title="User:Wilfredo Martinez">Wilfredo Martinez</a> 03:06, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I would not necessarily delete an article for a lack of notability in the case of schools and other institutions if the articles contain some substance. I believe that the assertion of notability is far more important in articles on individuals or say, commercial institutions. My delete vote here is inherently based on the fact that this article has very little useful information, has no references, and provides no external links or evidence that it could be formed into a functioning article. If one of the previous editors could provide a credible source of information, regardless of any notability, I could consider keeping the article. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh17_09da.html" title="User:Sukh17">Sukh17</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><sup><a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh17_5dc2.html" title="User talk:Sukh17">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sukh17_a7a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sukh17">Contribs</a></sup></span> 19:14, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'd created dozen or two "... in popular culture" leaf pages by offloading the main text and my personal experience is that this works: the people who add this kind of references (and nothing else, typically) do use these leafs and stay away from the main article. I do remember lenghty discussions on Village Pump on what to do with this kind of "information", resulting in no action or decision. The idea to create leaf pages grew gradually popular for lack of alternatives. IMO this problem is impossible to fix until stable version will be implemented (freeing up some time to work here). One such page, <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_depictions_of_Joan_of_Arc_d22a.html" title="Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc">Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc</a>, has been elevated among features articles as a result of heroic effort of an editor, so there's some hope. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 12:34, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Look at the difference between the JoA article and this one. First off, the subject matter is wildly different. One documents cultural representations of a saint and national hero. The other documents the appearance of guns that kind of look like the C96. The JoA article is completely referenced and sourced. The C96 article is completely unreferenced and unsourced. The intro to the JoA article provides real-world context for its subject matter. The intro to the C96 article provides no real-world context and isn't even spelled correctly. I have nothing against the "...in popular culture" concept, but I expect that such articles be held to the same standards as every other article and this one clearly falls so short of basic standards that it should be deleted. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 14:09, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Last summer I had a long debate with <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESophysduckling_0ce3.html" title="User:Sophysduckling">User:Sophysduckling</a> about whether translations which are <b>created by wikipedia users rather than published sources</b> should be considered original research, as well as whether pages like this one, which focused more on the text of a poem than significance and meaning, belonged on wikipedia or wikisource. You can read the debate at <a href="../../../s/o/p/User_talk%7ESophysduckling_Archive_4_3f48.html" title="User talk:Sophysduckling/Archive 4">User talk:Sophysduckling/Archive 4</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Catullus_18a2.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Catullus">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Catullus</a>. We reached a sort of truce in which most catullus articles were removed, but the fundamental debate about whether an original translation violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> was left unsettled. This page was originally redirected by Sophysduckling, as he thought it was not notable enough for an article, but it has been remade by <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlakazam138_978a.html" title="User:Alakazam138">User:Alakazam138</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - please note the NOR policy: a translation does none (or should not do any) of the 7 things listed at <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> (copied below). A translation replicates content <i>exactly as is</i> without changing its meaning, and only replacing words with their equivalents in another language. If the translation is not available in a source (i.e., it is an original translation), that should be noted and source(s) provided for the original language version, but I don't believe it constitutes original <i>research</i>. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 08:05, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>An article is OR if and only if:
<ol>
<li>It introduces a theory or method of solution;</li>
<li>It introduces original ideas;</li>
<li>It defines new terms;</li>
<li>It provides or presumes new definitions of pre-existing terms;</li>
<li>It introduces an argument, without citing a reputable source for that argument, that purports to refute or support another idea, theory, argument, or position;</li>
<li>It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source;</li>
<li>It introduces or uses neologisms, without attributing the neologism to a reputable source.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>It seems as though someone is looking too closely at the words of the NOR policy, as opposed to the spirit. But to humor you, a translation of a published work makes an implicit argument about what a proper translation of that particular published work should look like. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 09:00, 10 February 2007 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi
<ul>
<li>I am indeed humoured by your comment. It seems to me that looking at the "spirit" of a policy rather than its text falls under "original research". There are no assumptions about what a proper translation looks like. As long as two different languages have words for the same objects and concepts, they can be translated without any "assumptions". No assumption is needed to translate the English "flower" into the German "Blume".

<li>Although <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#BUR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#BUR</a> states, "Follow the spirit, not the letter, of any rules, policies and guidelines if you feel they conflict." (and I believe this to be an excellent idea), I do not feel the NOR policy includes translations (if that is the case, shouldn't we also delete any articles that were translated from a foreign-language wiki?). If a translator makes any kind of implicit or explicit "argument" or "assumption", then she has failed in her task, which is <i>only</i> to replace e oncombination of letters denoting a concept or object with another such combination that refers to the same concept or object (minor changes in the word ordering to conform to appropriate sentence structure does not, if done properly, affect content). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 01:52, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hello. I recently wrote this article, but I'm sorry that I wasn't aware of the situation with the poems. I'm only a newbie and I apologise. Should I write these sorts of things up at WikiSource? After all, Catullus is a great poet and there is so much meaning that can be derived from every poem. Surely a collaboration between all the Latin scholars can make each poem worthy of its own page? Obviously it is my fault, (probably for rushing in to Wikipedia too quickly), but it is slightly annoying as I did feel I was doing a service, rather than a diservice. However, as a newbie, I'm not exactly sure how I can fit all of Wikipedia's criteria for articles, nor am I to make the decisions, that is for you good people here. Sorry again for causing a bother. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlakazam138_978a.html" title="User:Alakazam138">Alakazam138</a> 10:38, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Oh, for crying out loud: Are there noncopyright translations that aren't bowdlerized or in stilted 19th century language? If so, the translation can be replaced. If no such a published translation exists, or isn't available, then the editor's translation is useful and should be kept. <b>Samael1775</b>, as to notabiity: after two millennia, I think his poems have become notable enough to warrant individual Wikipedia articles, and I see nothing wrong with every work by every major Greek and Roman author getting the same treatment. <b>Alakazam138</b>, even if you were wrong, and I don't think you were, there's no need to apologize -- you did just what you're supposed to do around here, jump in and be bold. Thank you, and please don't stop. <b>Allon Fambrizzi</b>, even with a poem, a translation can be as "objective" or "neutral" as possible, particularly in more literal translations, which seems to be in keeping with the NOR policy, both in letter and spirit. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 15:35, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I just had another look at the article -- ORIGINAL research? It's all very straightforward, uncontroversial, obvious information of use to readers who, for instance, are unaware of the Atalanta myth. Although a citation is always nice, it can also be overkill when the facts are well established. There is no reason for a deletion here at all. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 15:44, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Translations, especially translations of poetry, are based on judgements of the translator, it is impossible to precisely translate every aspect of a poem, because there are all kinds of things like idioms and connotations that can't be directly reproduced in another language.

<li>Ozymandias is a 14-line poem that's actually a bit larger than <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catullus_2.html" title="Catullus 2">Catullus 2</a> (one less line, slightly fewer words). Frankly, it's hard to come to a better understanding of a short poem when to refer back to it you need to jump between WikiSource and Wikipedia. As a reader, wouldn't you prefer to see short poems included in the articles about them? Samael, you make a better point concerning translations -- ANY translation done by an editor here (or done anywhere else) will necessarily involve word choices. But Wikipedia does, in fact, allow translations because sometimes their usefulness is more important than the potential harm of a bias. Anyone with a competing translation of a word or line could perhaps note it in the article with a simple "or ...".<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 22:32, 10 February 2007 (UTC) (slightly self-edited)</li>

The content of this article relies entirely on the judgments of Wikipedians, not on outside sources; that's original research.

These belong on our sister project, Wikibooks.</i></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>We don't have a textbook here. We have the beginning of an article with the necessary foundation for further information. This poem isn't nearly as important as <a href="../../../o/z/y/Ozymandias.html" title="Ozymandias">Ozymandias</a> and the article will hardly have as much information as that article, but if you notice the "Analysis" section of the <a href="../../../o/z/y/Ozymandias.html" title="Ozymandias">Ozymandias</a> article, you'll see something very similar to what we have here (aside from the necessary translation information). Is the article attempting to teach subject matter? I see it as presenting enough information to understand the poem in some detail, which is necessary to get enough of an understanding of the poem to make the article of any use to the reader.
<p>Here's another policy statement from that same policy article, under the section "Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy" or <a href="../../../b/u/r/WP%7EBURO_89d3.html" title="WP:BURO">WP:BURO</a>:</p>

<li>Policy is <i>quite</i> clear. What you are constructing is what is known as a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a>. You've just quoted the second half of the full sentence, which, in full, reads "Wikipedia articles are not simply textbooks or annotated texts.". That's quite clear that Wikipedia articles are not annotated texts. You've then proceeded to argue that since the article isn't a textbook, which no-one said it was in the first place, it doesn't violate the policy. That's a straw man argument. The article is a canonical annotated text. It contains the text of the poem, a translation, and line-by-line annotations. (See <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Annotated_texts#What_is_an_annotated_text.3F" class="extiw" title="b:Wikibooks:Annotated_texts">b:Wikibooks:Annotated texts#What is an annotated text?</a>.) Policy is quite clear, saying so in as many words, that that one of several things that Wikipedia articles are not.
<p>The latter half of your argument is largely irrelevant, and, in attempting to make the argument that policy should be ignored (which is not what that section is about at all), is merely a strong indication that the former half of your argument is exactly counter to clearly stated policy. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:32, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Excuse me, but since when did your pronouncements become clear Wikipedia policy? I was quoting Wikipedia policy, not your personal pronunciamento, and the only spot where I could find the words "annotated texts" in the Wikipedia policy article you linked to. The only clear thing in that policy page regarding annotated texts is that the idea of annotated texts was closely wedded to the idea of textbooks. I was assuming that your citation of a Wikipedia rule had some relationship to the actual text of the rule. If policy is so clear, simply give me the quote from the relevant sentence or sentences. I did. And to say that there are limits to bureaucratic rules is to cite a Wikipedian bureaucratic rule, not to <b>deny any</b> Wikipedian bureaucratic rules. Again: I cited, you pronounced. Here's a sincere (if a little angry) suggestion for you: Rather than searching for debating points to score, you might want to search for ways of reaching consensus, a Wikipedia goal which appears to have eluded your marshalling of rhetorical weaponry.
<p>Looking back on your comments, I found your reference to <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Annotated_texts#What_is_an_annotated_text.3F" class="extiw" title="b:Wikibooks:Annotated_texts">b:Wikibooks:Annotated texts#What is an annotated text?</a> a useful, very constructive point which brings up some (nonrhetorical) questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you really want to say that no references to the specific parts of a text are appropriate in a Wikipedia article about that text? Could they be part of an article?</li>
<li>Could an article that starts out as annotating a text grow into a proper Wikipedia article? I've already made a (small) change to the article so that it is not, now, 100 percent text and annotation. I see no reason why that process should not continue until the article is mostly something else. But as I've said above, annotated text is an integral part of understanding a poem, particularly a translated poem.</li>
<li>What do you think of the "Analysis" section of the <a href="../../../o/z/y/Ozymandias.html" title="Ozymandias">Ozymandias</a> article that I mentioned? Inappropriate?</li>
<li>If this article were to be kept, if only in name and subject matter, what would it include in your opinion to be a proper Wikipedia article?</li>
<li>How would it work in conjunction with a Wikibooks annotated text?</li>
<li>What subject matter would be appropriate to each, in your opinion?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>I'm open to agreeing with you. Let us (all) reason together.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 03:09, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><i>Excuse me, but since when did your pronouncements become clear Wikipedia policy?</i> — These are not my "pronouncements". <b>This is the very text of the policy as written right there in front of you.</b> "Wikipedia articles are not simply textbooks or annotated texts." are the exact words directly from the policy. You ask for the relevant quote. <b>You've been given it twice already.</b> It's even in boldface in the policy. To say that I've not been citing the policy but "making pronouncements" and "rhetoric" is highly disingenuous, and is another strong indicator that your argument is exactly counter to clearly stated policy. For the third time: Policy is quite clear on this. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:20, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Response:</b> My apologies, there must be something wrong with my computer and with my eyes. I typed your quoted sentence, even parts of it, in the page-search function of my computer and tried to find even part of that sentence on that Web page and I couldn't find it. Perhaps you could help me out by telling me what section that sentence appears in. Seriously, I can't find it. Also, I'm afraid I was a bit irritable in my previous replies to you, and I apologize for that. What we have is a serious disagreement over what Wikipedia policy actually is (I also don't think your view of it is actually workable, especially for articles on poems, given how poems work and what a reader generally needs in order to understand them). Please take another look at the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catullus_2.html" title="Catullus 2">Catullus 2</a> article, which is much changed, and tell me if you think it works better with translation and translation notes present on the page or moved to Wikibooks. My point elsewhere in this discussion is that to understand a poem the reader goes back and forth over various aspects because it is the interaction of those aspects where the power of a poem coheres. For an encyclopedia reader of an article about a poem, understanding the poem is not the only aspect, but it remains an important one, and to understand the history of the poem, having the text readily at hand is important. I'd be interested in your opinion, and also how you think the Catullus 2 article might be further improved. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 13:26, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Specific parts of a text are appropriate when used for analysis. However, these Catullus articles seem to focus entirely on the text of the poem, and specifics about translation, which is much more the domain of wikibooks. While the potry of Catullus as a whole is certainly notable, I don't think there is much to be said about individual poems of Catullus. If you look at <a href="../../../o/z/y/Ozymandias.html" title="Ozymandias">Ozymandias</a>, you will notice that the text of the poem is in a small box off to the side, unintrusive. The table on Catullus 2 dominates the page and the rest of the article is little more than a collection of footnotes. According to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, "Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot."</li>
<li>Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> the place for annotated texts. While <i>sourced analysis</i> of a poem may be appropriate, an annotated text is not an encyclopedia article. While I agree that in some cases annotations could grow into a full article, I don't think Catullus 2 meets wikipedia's notability guidelines. While the poetry of Catullus is notable, there aren't many of the individual poems that have been the subject of multiple nontrivial works other than translations.</li>
<li>There is a differnce between annotated text and analysis. Annotations focus on explaining specific points of a text, analysis focuses on the whole.</li>
<li>I don't think that this article should be kept at all, as I don't think the poem is significant enough to justify an encyclopedia article.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/a/t/Catullus.html" title="Catullus">Catullus</a> or <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetry_of_Catullus_4939.html" title="Poetry of Catullus">Poetry of Catullus</a> would link to the wikibook, which would provide annotated texts of individual poems.</li>
<li>Wikibooks should contain information about specific parts of specific poems, such as what this idiom means, what this refers to, ect. Wikipedia should focus on analyzing poems or corpi of poetry as a whole, such as what techniques the poem uses, what this poem is about, how this should be interpreted, as well as inspiration and impact. Also, <b>Analysis on wikipedia should be from the interpretation of published critics, and should be sourced</b>. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamael775_28db.html" title="User:Samael775">Samael775</a> 04:24, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>As I say in my comment below, I think all aspects of a poem interact with each other and so the best way to present a poem to a reader (if space considerations allow) is to do it all on one page so the reader can easily look back and forth at different aspects (discussion, notes, text, translation). As for notability, see the comment by the academic in paragraph 2 of the article. The poem has been the subject of serious articles, but, as with most poems its size, no books solely on the poem. But I don't think that's determinative.</li>
<li>Again, all aspects of the poem interact with each other.</li>
<li>There is too much worthy information in this one article now for it to be combined easily with articles on more of the poems. I just don't think that would work now.</li>
<li>Covered in other comments.</li>
<li>Covered in other comments.</li>
<li>Yes, a Wikibooks article on the poem could concentrate on the meaning of specific parts of the poem, but that's all tied in with discussions of the poem's theme, so you're either divorcing two elements that would go well together, forcing readers to bounce back and forth between pages, which wouldn't help comprehension at all, or you're repeating much (all?) of the same information on two different Web pages. I agree that Wikipedia articles should do all the things you say they should do, and my additions to the article go part of the way toward doing that.

<li><b>Keep</b>. If you feel you must, for the sake of doctrinal purity, move the text and translation to Wikisource, do so if it isn't already there; but keep the brief commentary, and the article to link to it. There needs to be a better way to integrate Wikisource content into articles beyond merely having a link. FWIW, I feel strongly that translations produced by editors for Wikimedia projects are not original research in any meaningful sense. They advocate no new theory, and are subject to emendation for greater accuracy by the ordinary collaborative process; and finally, they are more desirable than copyrighted recent translations and likely superior to old PD translations. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 18:38, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

The article subject matter itself is noteworthy, so the only real dispute seems to be over <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, which is not grounds for deleting an article. Simply add references for any unreferenced claims (including disputed translations or academic disagreements over translation, which Wikipedia should report on, not weigh in on). Moreover, I see no policy or guideline saying that it is original research to translate a text, as long as the translation agrees with general academic consensus. As for the Wikibooks issue, this seems to be a case of sacrificing useful information for bureaucracy; there is no value to our readers in forcing them to go to an external website to view a short passage that we could just as easily quote here. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 08:34, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>cleanup</b>. First, I'm not sure translation constitutes original research, especially a very literal translation like this. After all, we have a whole department of Wikipedia encouraging editors to translate foreign articles. What do we do if we find literary texts in them? Leave them untranslated? I'm not sure about the status of the detailed vocabulary guide and other features of this article which I've never seen elsewhere on WP. But I think the poem does pass notability, though maybe the article should also include Poem 3, which is on a similar theme. Both influenced a whole line of later poems about pets, from pieces by Martial and Ovid to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Skelton_da8c.html" title="John Skelton">John Skelton</a>'s <i>Philip Sparrow</i> and beyond. This should definitely be included in the article (yes, I can dig up most of the necessary references, though I'd appreciate any help). --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 10:39, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>:I've made significant additions to the article:
<ul>
<li>It is no longer primarily a text with annotations. There is significant discussion (all of it reporting, not original) of the poem and its theme, and everything is annotated. This should meet some of the objections above.</li>
<li>The discussion of theme is intimately connected — interwoven — with discussion of the Latin text. I don't see how those two aspects of the poem can easily be separated. This doesn't make <i>Catullus 2</i> unique, by the way — <b>any</b> poem, to be discussed adequately, should be discussed with a lot of interplay between various elements, often including theme, sound, form, individual words and, in the case of a translation, often alternative options for translation. I think that's all part of the business of describing a poem. That's why I think the full text of a short poem needs to be in the Wikipedia article about it, along with a translation for poems in other languages, and textual notes. They're all intimately connected. My additions are only a start and should be added to, especially with an expansion of sources, and they should be looked over by others. I'm putting a note on the discussion page to that effect. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 19:59, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - It is definitely not spam and I think we all agree on that one (as a side note, I'm Lebanese and have listened to those guys' podcasts and interviews, no spam detected anywhere). The article is appropriate for wikipedia and does not bypass any of the requirements. Not having a high Alexa rating is not an indicator of genuineness anyways. Objectively and through some common sense, this article is valid and should add value to the wealth of wikipedia and should be treated no different than some very valid entries as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_two_cents_%28idiom%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_two_cents_%28idiom%29" rel="nofollow">/ My two cents</a> . 30LL is another idiom and the article explains that with the source behind it.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The article seems to be objectively written, and accurately describes the website and its features. There doesn't seem to be any promotional material in the article and therefore I don't think it can be considered as spam. Regarding notability, 30ll.org seems to be a respected web media outlet in the online Lebanese community. I would also note that its podcast is rather unique and that its format is somewhat of a first in the field of Lebanese and Arab media. I say keep it. -- Kartrab 22:10, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><small><b>Keep</b> nominator's condition has been met, but I'd say keep, or at worst merge or redirect to an appropriate Simpsons article.

<li><small>Because they're not that team, but a fictional one found in the Simpsons (And in several episodes to boot). If this were Mr. Burn's employee softball team, I'd say redirect to that episode, but you can't redirect to 3+ episodes.

<li>I am actually rather familiar with the Sri Lankan civil war (note my rather strong comment ("it is a fact that...") regarding the HR violations committed by the Sri Lankan state), but mostly through academic books. I was, however, unfamiliar with UTHR beyond knowing that it's Jaffna office closed soon after opening (I followed a link from the source provided in the article). Thus, as I have little doubt the incident did indeed occur (and the UTHR source adds credence to this), the only question becomes notabiliy as demonstrated through a multiplicity of coverage. I possess a few books on the Sri Lankan civil war and will look through them for references to the massacre. If I find anything, I will post it here or in the article. In any case, thanks for the clarification regarding UTHR. Cheers, <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 06:21, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>My two cents on this...If anyone who comes here to vote should take a look at the articles talk page..Not only the sources are dubious ,they also gives us (UTHR) the impression that there was indeed an LTTE leader among the death..And some eye witness even recall a noise of a bomb explosion!! Which means the forces were clearly attacked so even if we believe these sources(which seems impossible), I don't know why the Author of this article wanted to defame the SL forces alone&#160;?? Ohh..about the UTHR ,they do contradict a lot..Esp when it comes to reports which they made in the early 1990's, when they were extremely pro LTTE or very much sympathetic to their course!! I have followed their paper publications even before the start of the internet era,and let me tell you , there is a clear bias towards tamils and for LTTE..They became anti LTTE after 1995 ,when LTTE started killing their leaders ,such as DR <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajini_Rajasingham_Thiranagama_cc43.html" title="Rajini Rajasingham Thiranagama">Rajini Rajasingham Thiranagama</a>..They nearly killed Dr Raja Hoole too..And UTHR recent reports are some what neutral (except for the issues regarding SL history) .we can take it as a neutral source ONLY when we talk about incidents happened after 1995 ..BTW, since you seems to be interested in our issues , i would like to recommend you the Books written by</li>

<li>If I'm not mistaken, the LTTE used that as a tactic--attacking security forces in Tamil-populated villages in hopes they would retaliate (they did this especially with the IPKF). Although I'm inclined to believe that this event took place and that most of the dead were civilians, and although the Sri Lankan security forces have committed their share of human rights violations, the LTTE is certainly no saint! Due to the lack of reliable sources to establish notability, I am supporting deletion of the article.

So in that case my opinion is, this article is another blatant attempt to embarrass a sovereign and recognized country and its distinctive special force unit front of the baseless accusation of a terrorist group which is trying to raise a separate state on the Sri Lanka. --<a href="../../../l/a/h/User%7ELahiru_k_90e0.html" title="User:Lahiru k"><font color="blue"><b>♪♫ ĽąĦĩŘǔ ♫♪</b></font></a> <a href="../../../l/a/h/User_talk%7ELahiru_k_232b.html" title="User talk:Lahiru k"><font color="blue"><sup>Walkie-talkie</sup></font></a> 19:42, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>: The references are from biased sources which are anti government of sri lanka and are pro-ltte and LTTE frontends.

<li><s><b>Comment</b></s> DELETE As the creator of this article I have come to have my doubts as to whether it should stay or not because like many have pointed out I still have not found the credible sources outside of pro- LTTE sources except <a href="../../../u/t/h/UTHR_440c.html" title="UTHR">UTHR</a> hence it does fail notability to an extend. I was thinking about renaming it as Kumarapuram incident or something similr to it. I will look around.

<p>Non-notable, fails WP:WEB and other criteria under WikiProject: Webcomics. Alexa ranking search for "www.starslip.com" yields no traffic data whatsoever even though the site has been up for two years. Furthermore many other comics on the internet have been around for more than two years without attaining notability, let alone Wikipedia's inclusion requirements. The article also includes reference to the Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards, which has been found non-notable by Wikipedia editors. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalby_5be8.html" title="User:Salby">Salby</a> 06:09, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This is clearly a notable webcomic as its critical accolades indicate. I could also point out that exact phrase search turns up 101,000 hits on Google - this is a strip that has been much talked about, especially for a strip only a couple years old - and also that this webcomic has published three "real" books to date.

<li><b>Comment</b> Indeed. "We're trying to delete all these other webcomics, so it's okay to delete this one too" is a circular argument.

<li><b>Comment</b> The <a href="../../../u/g/l/Ugly_Hill_cdc8.html" title="Ugly Hill">Ugly Hill</a> discussion is loaded of meatpuppetry after the author linked to the AfD, so I wouldn't look to vindication there. As for <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil_Inc._754f.html" title="Evil Inc.">Evil Inc.</a>, there have been several AfDs put forth in good faith, which indicates an issue.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I assume you're referring to the "Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards" as far as the website winning an award. Those awards were found NN despite even a television appearance and NY Times mention in an article about webcomics. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Web_Cartoonist%27s_Choice_Awards" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Web_Cartoonist%27s_Choice_Awards" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> This article falls way below that. <a href="../../../l/k/e/User%7ELKeith30_af2f.html" title="User:LKeith30">LKeith30</a> 21:30, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I disagree with the claim that the WCCA are not an indication of notability. The WCCA are the most prominent webcomic awards in existence, and thus an indication that a webcomic is notable as a webcomic. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 01:01, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I might agree, but the WCCA article <i>itself</i> was deleted recently for failing to meet WP:N. That's the definition of non-notable (and another argument entirely!). If the article <i>supporting</i> a lesser article is deleted for being NN, how can the supported article use it as proof of notability? <a href="../../../l/k/e/User%7ELKeith30_af2f.html" title="User:LKeith30">LKeith30</a> 01:07, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Three reasons. First, the reasons offered in the AFD for the WCCA being notable (i.e., mention in a New York Times article) are applicable to saying that winning the award is a notable. Second, WP:WEB suggests not that an award be "notable" by Wikipedia standards, but simply states that the award be "independent and well-known." Even if the Oscars were not notable in and of themselves by WP:N, i.e., if no newspapers or other print sources talked about them, the fact that a film had won an Oscar would be still an indication of a film being a notable film, since the Oscars are well-known and the judges are (I like to think, at least) not too closely tied to film producers. The WCCA seem able to qualify as well-known even if this fame does not translate into more than several secondary sources analyzing the WCCA. Third, the AFD for the WCCA appears likely to be appealed in the near future; it was carried against a 7-4 vote on the basis that non-trival mention in the New York Times was not an indication of notability. If it's not put up for deletion review within the next couple days, I'll stick my neck out and do so myself, because that's a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Web_Cartoonist%27s_Choice_Awards_6058.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards">questionable AFD</a> if I've ever seen one, and I've watched some pretty hotly argued AFDs. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 01:42, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> as per Tappel. I'm tired of seeing this bloody-minded campaign against webcomics. If those among you are truly interested in getting rid of as many webcomics as possible, why not just go ahead and blanket delete all of them? I'm sure it's bound to give a few people a sense of satisfaction, and might even just do wonders for credibility. Starslip Crisis is not on the top tier of comics, but reasons have been listed that warrant its continued inclusion here. I'd make further arguments along the lines of those of Aclapton, but I've serious doubts that those here most interested in deletion would see them with any merit. Go and stew yourselves, for all I care. -<a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhymeless_6a19.html" title="User:Rhymeless">Tim Rhymeless</a> <a href="../../../r/h/y/User_talk%7ERhymeless_4dd3.html" title="User talk:Rhymeless">(Er...let's shimmy)</a> 06:58, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b>. The strip is not notable in the webcomics world. Google search for "starslip crisis" yields 99,000 hits, but most of them are from the Crisis site itself or others maintained by Straub. Alexa ranking is far below that of PvP, Megatokto, Ctrl-Alt-Del, PA, et centera. This author is a little surprised at the number of votes to keep. Echoes of the Ugly Hill debate perhaps? Has Straub linked to this page and incited his readers against the AfD in poor faith? <a href="../../../y/o/t/User%7EYothSog_43e2.html" title="User:YothSog">YothSog</a> 09:07, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Note that the comic changed name from StarSHIFT Crisis and that name should also be checked when researching it. Also I thought Alexa had been discredited as a measure of popularity. Nice accusation of 'Poor Faith' that hasn't even been checked on the subject site, something that would be easy to do. Plus 'incitement against AfD' can be entirely in good faith and need not even be deliberate 'The Wikipedia entry for this comic is up for deletion, I don't understand why' is pretty much a precis of the initial reaction of most artists so far. Then they progress to annoyance when they look at how many other entries are being eliminated, together with one of the principle ways quality etc. is judged within the industry (the WCCA). Not that any artist action is needed at the moment as many Webcomic readers are on the lookout for yet another AfD related to a significant comic.--<a href="../../../b/o/a/User%7EBoatThing_308a.html" title="User:BoatThing">BoatThing</a> 10:34, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: <i>Alexa ranking is far below that of PvP, Megatokto, Ctrl-Alt-Del, PA, et centera.</i> So, do you propose that we should delete all articles about webcomics that gather an audience of less than 20,000 readers per day (Starslip crisis gets around 10,000)? This would leave probably some thirty or fewer comics, plus maybe another dozen that would be included because of their historical significance. I do agree with the guidelines stating that every fact should be sourced and referenced correctly. I do agree that the article about Starslip Crisis fails these guidelines. But I don't agree that we should delete articles based on unverifiable claims of non-notability, when there's reasonable argument for the notability. (In fact, if we base our perception of notability on the size of readership, I think the bar should be somewhere around 2,000 to 5,000 daily readers, and less if there are other reasons to believe the comic is culturally significant.) Of course, if sources are requested and the article does not improve in a reasonable timeframe, then it should be deleted. --<a href="../../../t/a/p/User%7ETappel_ab06.html" title="User:Tappel">Tappel</a> 11:27, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The accomplishments of an Emmy Award winner are often seen by millions of people. There are also regional Emmy Awards, and those are less notable because the works have had less distribution.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I just wanted to share one more piece of information that I have found and added to the school's page. Gomes Elementary is tied for 5th in the state in terms of performance with a recently released API Growth score of 989. This is not the first time that Gomes has been included within the top 50 or even top 10 of all schools. I am still compiling research, and I will finalize this edit later on, but meanwhile you can check out the reference that I have provided for that fact. Hopefully this will clarify the status of this article, and consensus can be reached on its apparent and evidenced notability. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh17_09da.html" title="User:Sukh17">Sukh17</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><sup><a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh17_5dc2.html" title="User talk:Sukh17">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sukh17_a7a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sukh17">Contribs</a></sup></span> 3:26, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>TpoltronYes, I'm a marketing guy at IPextreme and was trying to create an unbiased entry on our company (and admittedly it can be hard not to drink your own Coolaid). I use Wikipedia almost daily and appreciate your efforts to keep it unbiased but IPextreme engineers have published papers on technologies such as Bluetooth: <a href="http://pd.pennnet.com/display_article/279061/21/ARTCL/none/none/Bluetooth_stereo_realized/" class="external free" title="http://pd.pennnet.com/display_article/279061/21/ARTCL/none/none/Bluetooth_stereo_realized/" rel="nofollow">http://pd.pennnet.com/display_article/279061/21/ARTCL/none/none/Bluetooth_stereo_realized/</a> and FlexRay: <a href="http://www.automotivedesignline.com/howto/193501262" class="external free" title="http://www.automotivedesignline.com/howto/193501262" rel="nofollow">http://www.automotivedesignline.com/howto/193501262</a> . The company is significant because we are the exclusive worldwide source to license such notable technologies as: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldfire" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldfire" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldfire</a> . IPextreme seems every bit as significant as many other companies with Wikipedia entries, can someone just verify and edit the entry as appropriate? thanx, trentTpoltron</p>

No! This is legit. Richie is a classic, and a part of countless of childhoods all across the midwest.

This article - <a href="http://www.threepointchampion.com/page3.html" class="external text" title="http://www.threepointchampion.com/page3.html" rel="nofollow">1</a>- agrees with the nominator in claiming that no such category exists as a record.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This has been dealt with before. The article is not a slang guide. It covers in a topical way numerous subjects that are referenced throughout the encyclopedia. If this article was deleted dozens of stubs would have to be created otherwise many dozens of articles would make no sense. Please withdraw the nomination.

<ul>
<li>This is a misconception often repeated by those who never took the time to get to know Wiktionary. Linking to Wiktionary is as easy as linking to Wikipedia; I did it above. If this article was deleted, all you would have to do is link to <i>the exact same entry</i> at Wiktionary. In addition, ease-of-use arguments don't argue for something being encyclopedic anyway. Wouldn't it be easier if how-tos, source material, galleries of images, and lists of quotes were articles here? Does that make them encyclopedic? Please offer a rationale as to <i>why</i> this is encyclopedic and not a dictionary definition list. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 20:27, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's self-evident. Did you even read it? It does not appear so. Some of the entries are definition sorts of things, but others are stubs explaining a practice or usage, not definitions. As for "Linking to Wiktionary is as easy as linking to Wikipedia" then lets not needlessly create work for people for absolutely zero benefit. There is no rationale for messing with a very useful and sensible article, and certainly none for why dozens of stubs should be created. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 22:16, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This doesn't make sense; you just replied by repeating the same fallacious arguments. 1) If linking to Wiktionary is as easy as linking to Wikipedia, which it is, then what needless work are you talking about? It's easy. 2) What do you mean by saying that it's not just a list of definitions, but some explain usage? That's what dictionaries are for. Please note the first sentence of <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>: "Wikipedia is not a dictionary, <i>or a jargon or usage guide</i>." If it is only about the word usage, it is not encyclopedic. 3) I have no idea what dozens of articles you think would need to be created. As I noted, a link to Wiktionary would suffice. You're acting like the projects are existing at cross purposes here, when really they are intended to enhance each other. 4) Please actually provide a rationale as to why this is encyclopedic beyond it being self-evident, accusing me of not reading it, or saying it's useful. In fact, I think you would benefit from reading <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html" title="WP:USEFUL">WP:USEFUL</a>. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 22:34, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I would like to point out the list is not <i>only</i> dictionary definitions, but also clarifies several smaller concepts that would not merit an article. It's not just about the word usage.

<li>The article is <i>already</i> at Wiktionary. I linked it in the nomination; it's at <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Poker_terminology" class="extiw" title="wikt:Appendix:Poker_terminology">Appendix:Poker terminology</a>. There is absolutely no difference in difficulty in linking to the Wiktionary article. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 23:04, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>But the article <i>already</i> at Wiktionary is months out of date, unindexed, and a virtual solid mass of redlinks. Also no one looking for anything from it will find it if they search here (which is the more likely scenario)--Invisifan 23:42, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I said the first time you said that, what's your point? <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">Wiktionary</a> is a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a> too. <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Appendix:Poker_terminology&amp;diff=2089927&amp;oldid=2087142" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Appendix:Poker_terminology&amp;diff=2089927&amp;oldid=2087142" rel="nofollow">It's "up to date" now</a>. You could ave done that yourself instead of complaining here. I fail to see how that has any bearing on whether the article is encyclopedic or not; you're bringing up red herrings. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 01:01, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My point is that even if this list is better as an Appendix in Wiktionary than a list here moving it is not as simple as copying the article from here to there -- it would need to be completely overhauled to have the appropriate links point back here (a huge job in itself if done correctly since many should really point to Wiktionary entries which may not exist r be the exact spelling/capitalization), and worse everything in Wikipedia that "links here" needs to be fixed (a simple redirect won't work even if you could properly redirect transwiki since many of the references are to anchor which can't even work as a secondary redirect in the same wiki). So a massive amount of work needs to be done '<i>during</i> the move, and you seem utterly uninterested in making that effort (personally <i><b>I</b></i> have no interest in poker per se, and better things to do). if/when the WT appendix is fully functional as well as up to date &amp; all the relevant links to this article are pointing there. <i>then</i> I'd support deleting <i>this</i> article. --Invisifan 21:19, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Whether or not it's a slang or a technical dictionary is immaterial, as both are forbidden under WP:WINAD.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> These are not slang terms - most are technical names with precise meanings, some of which need to be disambiguated from their non-technical context. Many of the terms listed would indeed become stubs or dicdefs if separated out, but that is what makes a page such as this valuable. Many technical articles on aviation refer to multiple (up to a dozen) terms on this page, so for a reader needing to understand their meanings it is far less efficient to have to load multiple pages. What's more, it would seem that a large number of editors do not know how to link to Wikitonary (or never think of doing so) so the result would be a large number of redlinks. I would reconsider if Wikipedia had a mechanism for automatically checking if a redlink was defined in Wiktionary and altering the link if there was a match - or for using httpd-request to load short definitions of dicdef linkwords. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDramatic_bee8.html" title="User:Dramatic">dramatic</a> 19:42, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/slang" class="extiw" title="wikt:slang">slang</a>: "Language that is unique to a particular profession or subject; jargon." It is slang even according to your own explanation. You don't have to link to dozens of pages, just write {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWiktionary_73a4.html" title="Template:Wiktionary">wiktionary</a>}}. Ease of use is not an argument that something is encyclopedic: storing all dictionary definitions and source material and quotations here might be easier, but that's missing the point.

<dd>That's a rather drastic redefinition of slang, which none of my dictionaries agree with - the nearest they get is "the jargon of thieves and disreputable persons" (Chambers) which might describe some profesions&#160;:-) But seriously, isn't the explanation of pitch in this article much more relevant and simple for the user than <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pitch" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pitch" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>?

<dd>Please see above; how is the explanation of pitch at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_aviation%2C_aerospace_and_aeronautical_terms.html" title="List of aviation, aerospace and aeronautical terms">List of aviation, aerospace and aeronautical terms</a> better than the one at <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Aviation%2C_aerospace%2C_and_aeronautical_terms" class="extiw" title="wikt:Appendix:Aviation,_aerospace,_and_aeronautical_terms">Appendix:Aviation, aerospace, and aeronautical terms</a>? You'll note they're the exact same, which is the whole point. As for your complaint about pitch, I'm very sick of people that think Wikimedia means the English Wikipedia. Wiktionary is a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a>, sharing Wikimedia's goal for all projects of disseminating knowledge freely. It's insulting to Wiktionary editors that Wikipedians use places like this to demean their project and complain about problems (when you know very well Wikipedia is a work-in-progress too) instead of, say, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=pitch&amp;diff=2098356&amp;oldid=2069672" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=pitch&amp;diff=2098356&amp;oldid=2069672" rel="nofollow">taking the 20 seconds to copy and paste the definition</a> to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pitch" class="extiw" title="wikt:pitch">pitch</a>.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. We have a pretty extensive coverage of aviation-related topics in Wikipedia, and a number of the terms there are technical in nature.

<li>Surely you know that the exact policy wording is "Wikipedia is not a dictionary, or a <b>jargon</b> or usage guide."

<li>On the reason why this is less useful in Wiktionary, I'll refer to the "What links here" link on the article, where you will find numerous redirects. People wondering what "Revenue Passenger Miles" may well look it up on Wikipedia, and as it is now, they will be redirected to a page which explains this to them. As far as I know, cross-project redirects don't work and we therefore lose some functionality by putting it in an other project. Hmm... actually I have taken a look at <a href="../../../s/o/f/Wikipedia%7ESoft_redirect_2a27.html" title="Wikipedia:Soft redirect">Wikipedia:Soft redirect</a> and think that putting one of those useful things here will be much better than making this a redlink (which might leave our readers in the dark). <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 13:26, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As it was not possible for the people in the middle ages to imagine that the earth is not flat, it is just as impossible for the modern day inquisitors in the cosmology to accept the idea that [crazy]. It is just these limited minds of the inquisitors which have been suppressing the multi-level cosmological model and who have been erasing it from the search engines and from the Wikipedia. Just because the earth is flat - in their minds - it must be flat also in the minds of the rest of the world.</dd>

<dd>The part that is not notable generally is his family life and personal virtues. The part that might be is his civic contributions. But to establish them for a WP article they need documentation. If he is known to royalty, then there should really be at least one or two articles about him in national newspapers or magazines. If they should happen not to be in English,it helps to provide translations of the key lines. Its the documentation that does it. But it has to document something more specific than "good relationships"--being friends to any number of people is not enough, he has to have done some notable work himself. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 02:11, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. To begin with, I want to remind everyone that there is not policy of notability on schools. The requirement of stating some assertion of notability is mainly created on the fact that millions of articles that are <i>commercially based</i> or focused <i>individual</i> self-promotion would be littered all over wikipedia. I believe that if any article that is not advertising in this said manner is viable. In addition, as an additional requirement, I believe that articles should have some substance and according to policy, they should have some referenced material or at least list some legitimate sources. This article appears to have some information, and in comparison to precedents, it is far more developed. I think some templates regarding style, etc. could be added to the page based on the issues that are being addressed. Nevertheless I am sure that in the future, individuals could work on and improve the article based on these sources. --Thank You. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh17_09da.html" title="User:Sukh17">Sukh17</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><sup><a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh17_5dc2.html" title="User talk:Sukh17">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sukh17_a7a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sukh17">Contribs</a></sup></span> 19:34, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

No evidence of multiple non-trivial independent reliable sources, special live show on a campus radio station seems to be about the measure of it.

<dd>What exactly would you deem "multiple non-trivial independent reliable sources"? Is <a href="http://www.metalreview.com" class="external text" title="http://www.metalreview.com" rel="nofollow">MetalReview</a> a trivial website now? Is <a href="http://www.lordsofmetal.nl/" class="external text" title="http://www.lordsofmetal.nl/" rel="nofollow">Lords of Metal</a>, trivial as well? According to you no doubt, but to people who actually enjoy listening to metal they are among the most important sources for news within the genre. True the article is written in a promotional tone, I can tell you why. I put up a much smaller more-to-the-point page for this band a few days ago and it got instantly deleted before I had a chance to even notice, the reasons given were that the band did not have any "notable" features. I was given a list of "criteria for musicians and ensembles" to be deemed notable, among this was releasing two "non-trivial" albums, and playing with nationally acclaimed bands. Therefore I put these in the article. Another criteria was being a "prominent representative of a notable style or of the local scene of a city." This band is <i>the</i> most prominent example of technical melo-black metal in Atlanta (again I wouldn't expect you to know this, unlike myself who happens to live in Atlanta). They are published through Deathgasm Records and sold through several national independent distros (such as Red Stream Inc.) as well as at least one international distro, <a href="http://vvpo.com/" class="external text" title="http://vvpo.com/" rel="nofollow">VVPO (Japan)</a>.</dd>

<dd>I'll readily agree they are no where near "big" or "important" compared to whatever type of music you listen to, but in a genre that is already underground their following is considerable. Mostly why this makes me mad is that I see many articles with much less importance and notability than this band up on Wikipedia, here is an example: Sad_Legend. If you are suggesting it for deletion becuase of the content itself then I will be more than happy to correct it and take out the fluff as long as some other gun-ho Wiki-editor doesn't come along the next day and delete it becuase I failed to spell out why some people feel this band is notable.

<li><b>Comment, leaning toward keep</b> -- As I see it, you've given two reasons for deletion.

The first is that the band fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_%28music%29_fb6c.html" title="WP:Notability (music)">WP:Notability (music)</a>. However, they have released 2 albums and are mentioned in 5 cited sources (of which <i>at least</i> 1, the "lords of metal" site, is non-trivial). From <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperion_8bda.html" title="User:Hyperion">User:Hyperion</a>'s comment above, this article and its first (deleted) version are not identical in content (at least this one didn't qualify for speedy deletion).

<dd>Why is the band financing their recordings a reason for deletion? Lots of bands in obscrue genres have to do this either becuase they can't find a big enough label or the label does not give them funds to pay for recording. Your claim that the sources are 'fan' reviews is completely incorrect and I fail to see the relevance. MetalReview.com is a hugely popular website that reviews thousands of metal albums, Lords of Metal is another popular website based in the Netherlands, "Da Lynx Org" is a popular Italian printed 'zine, the Metal Archives is a fan submitted review site so you were right on one case. Hyperion395 17:58, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The band self financing the albums is important because one of the criteria of establishing notability per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> (which you should read) is 'Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable).'

<dd>What does the fact that someone in the band originally creating the Metal Archives entry, over two years ago, have to do with the validity of this band at all? Honestly it seems like you guys hardly even think about what you're saying before you say it. First off, the reviews on the Metal Archives page were not submited by anyone in the band, and the band profile has been updated many times since it was submitted, again by people not in the band. The last time it was updated was the day before yesterday (by someone in Belgium no less), how does this suggest they merit deletion? Hyperion395 17:58, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>I will take the promotional tone and the extra fluff out of this article. If anyone is actually interested in honestly judging this band just search their name on Google and look through the 3,000 results. Rofl, I see the Sad Legend page no longer exists... that was fast.</p>
<p>I was reading the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melodic_black_metal.html" title="Melodic black metal">melodic black metal</a> a week ago, saw a band I like (Morionor) listed as an example of the genre, clicked on the link and saw they had no page. Upon reading that I could "help Wikipedia by creating an article", I did so and consequently encurred all this drama. What gives? Maybe think about changing the default message.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> This article is a complete waste of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the first thing we have to ask ourselves is whether Wikipedia is merely an indescriminate collection of information. I have no idea how "true" this information is, especially given the dubious sources (getting to that in a bit), but frankly what purpose does this information serve? It informs us that there are latino-muslims.</p>
<p>And that's it.</p>
<p>Huzzah! They exist! Couldn't we simply say that in one line in the latino thread when discussing demographics? "there are also a growing number of latino-muslims." Why is this any more "separate-entry worthy" than say, latino-sikhs? What information is being presented to us that makes latin-muslims noteworthy? Do they have a noticeably different culture, something syncretic perhaps? Have they accomplished anything recently? Have they faced some form of persecution perhaps?</p>
<p>Clearly from the information in this article the answers are no, no, no and no - Which at first I thought might mean there is just a development issue with this thread. But then I looked up latino-muslims online and found only the following: articles acknowledging their existance and lots of articles by muslim missionary groups arguing "You can be a latino and a muslim too!" and that's pretty much it.</p>
<p>The article really is utilizing the most information available, it's simply not anything worth noting! At least in this level of detail.</p>
<p>But let's take a look at the details. The glorious cultural contributions of latino muslims are... LADO, a defunct islamic missionary group, and "Alianza Islámica" which actually IS worth noting because of its civil rights impact in america (or so the article claims)!</p>
<p>Unfortunately Alianza Islámica is completely original research with ZERO sources and furthermore it is plaguerized directly from "<a href="http://www.hispanicmuslims.com/articles/ranksincreasing.html" class="external free" title="http://www.hispanicmuslims.com/articles/ranksincreasing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hispanicmuslims.com/articles/ranksincreasing.html</a>" which is yet another islamic missionary organization directly targeting latinos.</p>
<p>And there's the rub, this is all religious advocacy... all of the information in here is from islamic missionary organizations, utilized to push their latino agenda forward.</p>
<p>This links to nothing but unsourced plageurized articles, and the latino navbar, the information could easily be reported (without advertising islamic missionary groups) simply by adding a line about a growing number of muslims to the relevant demographics section of the latino thread. Consequently this article is not worthy of a separate thread, breaks the soapbox rule, and we lose nothing by axing it. --Skyhawk4584 14:17, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>- Metropolitan, if you will notice there are actual cultural contributions to the latino identity that are associated with the jewish latino and catholic latino articles. The most obvious example being the influence of the Catholic Church in the latino identity. What impact have muslim latinos had on the latino identity? Anything more noteworthy than sikh-latinos? Why not articles for these insignificant sub identities as well? They offer nothing to the main article describing the latino ethnicity, just like this muslim-latino article, yet they do not have their own individual pages. Also, how can one ignore the obvious influence of islamic missionary groups, they are directly quoted and even advertised in the thread. Who cares if there are "dawah organizations," that's not information worth reporting.</p>
<p>On what basis do you say there is potential for a quality article here? It's simply reporting the existance of a subdemongraphic that have made absolutely no impact on the latino identity. They are a part of the identity, shearly because they exist - in which case they belong as a single line descriptor in the main article.</p>
<p>- Patchouli, Your vote shouldn't be controlled by whether you "like" such developments or what is fueling them clearly there are latino muslims this fact is not disputed nor do I believe it should go away, but you should be asking if this worth a full page thread, whether this is merely advertising islamic proselytism (numerous citations of islamic "dawa" organizations suggests this is so), and whether the information here presented is more appropriately described in a simple line or two on the main page.--67.163.191.97 22:28, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> The notability of Latino Muslims is dependent on the term Latino. The term is often misunderstood to mean Latin American and thus exclude people from Spain. I can elaborate upon request. This article can easily be expanded to become a good article. Someone asked on this AfD: "What impact have muslim latinos had on the latino identity?" This question should be answered in the article. Latino Muslims have impacted Latino architecture in a profound way. Please see <a href="../../../a/l/h/Alhambra.html" title="Alhambra">Alhambra</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/z/Mezquita.html" title="Mezquita">Mezquita</a>. Moreover, Islam has had an impact on Latino culture. An example of this is the impact it has had on the Spanish language. For example, the word Ojalá is derived from Arabic. To quote the BBC, "The etymology is quite interesting as it comes from the Arabic law šá lláh, meaning 'If Allah wishes'." Please see <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/spanish/cool/interjections.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/spanish/cool/interjections.shtml" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>. It is also important to recognize the impact of Islam in Spain, after all "Islam is the second largest religion in Spain". <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 00:26, 11 February 2007 (UTC)Agha Nader</p>

<li>Your answer directly contradicts the term "Latino" which as defined by the article and minority groups is: "Latino (and the form Latina for females), as used in American English, refers to a United States national of Latin American origin. [1] It is borrowed from Spanish latino, shortened from latinoamericano. [2]" That is verbatim from the article. If you don't like this term, take it up with the main article, this is not the place to introduce your reformulation of the word.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is a US term for people from Latin America. Furthermore latino identity is not exclusive to any "home country" especially not Spain, for which the original term "hispanic" was thrown out because it was exclusive of south american countries that had no connection to Spain (ie Brazil, which was a portuguese colony).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Alhambra, the Mezquita et cetera are valuable pieces of <b>Spanish</b> culture, to which Islam has contributed. Naturally this extension through the colony homeland (Spain) played an impact on the latino identity; however, that is already communicated by the fact the latino article acknowledges Spanish culture has played a heavy role in the latino identity - links from the spanish culture designations describe Islamic influence.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ergo there is no need to reiterate the obvious indirect impact, especially since it is "once removed." This thread is about "Latinos," which are a unique new-world specific syncretic culture in the Americas, incorporating Spanish, Portuguese, African, Carribean and native American culture to form this separate ethnicity. The question is, where have these muslim latinos (who as you and your articles acknowledge are new to Islam) made any contribution to the latino identity which is worth noting? We're not talking about inherited second hand influences from Old World Spain, but actual identifiable contributions of latino (per the definition)-muslims, here in the New World.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There are ZERO. This article demonstrates absolutely no reason for why this subset of people is worth identifying as a separate article when we can just as easily incorporate the useful sources (if there are any) into a one line demographic report "there are a growing number of latino muslims." Rather than creating this elaborate article dedicated to informing us of all the recent trends in Islamic missionary groups.</li>

<p>As you can see, Spaniards are, indeed, Hispanic. I can see why you would be confused. After researching the term Latino, I found out there are many misconceptions about the term. Thus, I propose adding a few sentences clarifying the term Latino. The article already states that Latino Muslims are also known as Hispanic Muslims.

<ul>
<li>Stop trying to pull Europeans into the picture, if you are European (as in Spanish), especially European 800 years before the New World was even discovered you are not latino. As the article clearly says the term "latino" is short for "latinoamericana," it is a new world designation, and an ethnicity according to the US census. If you come from Spain you are European, different ethnic designation - for good reason, as mentioned before Latino culture is unique to the New World, it is a new syncretic ethnicity, not an old world monolithic culture like Spanish culture. Hispanic and Spanish are mutually exclusive terms, to quote the wikipedia Hispanic entry "The term "Spanish" to denote a person from or of descent from a Latin American country is incorrect, as "Spanish" means a person who is from Spain."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We already have an article detailing the accomplishments of the people who build Al Hambra and the Cathedral of Cordoba, and you can see that article by typing "Moor" into the search button to your left. They existed about 1300 to 600 years ago, in Europe, and never saw the New World. The present article we are discussing is an irrelevant subset of people within the much larger and far more significant syncretic New World Latino ethnicity. The people this article discusses have accomplished nothing more than merely existing which is not worth reporting - certainly not worth reporting as a full separate article. Wikipedia is simply not a listing of everything that exists in the world.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You, everyone else and google have not produced any serious contribution to the Latino identity that latino-muslims have brought to the picture (and by serious contributions I do not mean "they set up organizations to proselytize Islam to muslims"). This article serves no other purpose than to further the agenda of "wikidawah." There is no information here, as metropolitan correctly noted out it says the same sentence four times - I suggest we just say it once, as a small insignificant rider to a demographics section "there are a growing number of latino muslims."</li>
</ul>

And each time everybody just goes along with in and one week later all we have added one more line reiterating that there are muslim latinos.

<blockquote>
<p>Latino (and the form Latina for females), as used in American English, refers to a United States national of <b>Latin American origin</b>. It is borrowed from Spanish latino, shortened from <i>latinoamericano</i>. The term "Latino" refers to any person <i>having Latin <b>American</b> background</i> and is often <i>taken</i> to be a synonym with "Hispanic". However, while official use of the term Hispanic has its origins in the Census Bureau in the 1970s, activist groups such as MEChA, Crusade for Justice, Brown Berets, Black Berets, and the Young Lords often preferred the term Latino because they felt it is more inclusive of the broad range of peoples in Latin America. The term "Latino" is typically understood by some to mean immigrants from Hispanophone countries in North, Central and South America and their U.S.-born descendants. <b>It refers specifically to persons of Latin American origin</b>. '<i>People from Spain self-categorize as latinos in the Spanish language,</i> but in that case it means "Latin," rather than 'Latin American <b>or 'US citizen or resident of Latin American origin' (a 'Latin American American', in other words), as the Spanish are one of the Latin peoples of Europe.</b></p>
</blockquote>
-from the wikipedia entry <b>Latino</b>
<p>Clearly for your argument to be valid the entire definition of Latino in wikipedia needs to be changed. You're arguing something that is not being discussed here, the definition of "latino" used in this article is the group of people in the latino entry - which is exclusively New World. The Moors were not latinos.</p>
<p>Latinos origins are in "Latin America" - a place that did not exist at the time of the Moors. Ergo it is impossible to call Moors "Latinos."</p>
<p>Look at this map, it's the relevant one:</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Just answer the question, what cultural significance are "latino muslims," what makes them worthy of their own separate entry aside from latino sikhs, latino-scientologists or latino-over the top football fans? Nothing. Furthermore what is the relevance of noting the existence "Latino Dawah Organizations?" This is just furthering the "wikidawah project." --- Skyhawk 19:52, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The map user Skyhawk (a new user whose only experience is this AfD), has provided is of Latin America, and is thus irrelevant to our discussion. In contrast, the Hispanic American map is the one of issue. This is because the article states "Latino Muslims are also known as Hispanic Muslims." In fact, the article never uses the term Latin American Muslim. <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 02:59, 13 February 2007 (UTC)Agha Nader</dd>

"a new user whose only experience is this AfD" that's called an ad hom attack - it's a logical fallacy because it avoids the issue, something you've excelled at thusfar, and instead attacks the credibility of the person. The article doesn't say "latin american muslim" because it would be redundant, Latino = americans of latin american descent, not spaniards we have a fabulous word for people from spain "Spanish." You clearly have a problem with the wikipedia definition of latino, you said so in your first objection about how this is all just a small misunderstanding. Why don't you push your definition of latino in that thread? For the sake of consistency we must all accept the wikipedia definition of latino and debate the issue at hand - whether there is any point in identifying the existence of latino muslims.</p>
<p>Once again my question to you is what have latino muslims done of any consequence that requires a full dedicated thread?</p>
<p>User Bakasuprman, I agree it has an encyclopedic value - the question is this much? Is there any reason we can't include all the useful information in this thread (and advertising Muslim missionary groups is not "useful") in a one line acknowledgement that "there are a growing number of latino muslims" in a demographics section of the main latino article, describing the scope and bounds of the latino identity? As it stands the article says just that - four times. Several users have promised to upgrade the article every time its utility is challenged, and all have never followed up. There simply is nothing more to say than "they exist" and you don't need a full article for that.</p>
<p>I mean at least with the latinos and Christianity thread you can talk about the cultural significance of the Catholic Church in the latino identity, its impact on distinctly latin american cultural endeavors like santos in art, which synthesize native american idols and Catholic icon veneration - or any number of syncretic religions in Brazil that have popped up like condomble. That one makes obvious sense. And they are the achievements of Catholic latinos - not spanish latinos, or even more ludicrous moorish achievements, but rather the work of this distinctly new world group.</p>
<p>But latino muslims? What have they done that is worth noting other than forming a couple missionary orgs (LADO is defunct incidentally), and possibly formed an organization that had something to do with civil rights - except for the fact that tidbit of information is completely unsourced, the page it links to has zero sources at all and if you google it you find out it is plaguerized from the organization itself.</p>
<p>How many shades of shady would you say that is?</p>
<p>Supporters of this article have yet to show one iota of accomplishment or contribution to the latino identity, from latino-muslims and that is the crux of the issue - the difference between a one liner acknowledging they exist in the main article, or an entry with an indepth discussion on what their unique achievements are and why they are worth acknowledging. --- Skyhawk 03:31, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Not to sound redundant but nobody is suggesting the demographic information disappear - rather it will be added to the main article as a one or two line statement instead of a full entry as a separate article. There is nothing artical worthy here, it doesn't meet the wikipedia requirements for notability and the discussion on muslim missionary groups is clear advocacy. Take these things away and you are confronted with the reality there is nothing being reported here except a link to an unsourced (yet still plaguerized) article and the same sentence restated four times. As already mentioned this doesn't meet the notability requirements ergo there is nothing else that can be said in this article - it is simply a waste of space at this time.--- Skyhawk 02:25, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Plus I'm sure there are many others, am not bothering now when it is so late at night to go through the rest of them. Anyway, the point is clear.

<p>Saftey Nazi is an attack page. It is about who is, or is perceived to be, a "Safety Nazi"; and so is a forum for the denigration of said "Nazis" disguised as information about the epithet. At best, the subject merits an entry in wiktionary, for it is merely a definition with examples; the scope of the subject does not extend beyond this. All valid information would come under the scope of other articles, like <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile_safety.html" title="Automobile safety">Automobile safety</a>. <a href="../../../r/i/n/User%7ERintrah_b987.html" title="User:Rintrah">Rintrah</a> 17:11, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>What about creating an article on rules similar to Parietals? i.e. College visiting hours or some such.

The extremely Notre-Dame-specific details should be summarized and merged into the page for the university, but I think there should also be an article on the concept of college visiting hours, with a mention of Notre Dame as a large university with a strict policy.

<dd>Working with the real scattered and mostly pre-web sources is OR. What is needed is previous articles or books discussing this, and I think the way to find them is to <b>stubbify the general part</b> and have WPdians edit it in the usual way. We don't really sign up for articles, but they get written. Discussion of sources can go on the talk page, just as usual.

<li><b>Merge</b> or <b>Delete</b>. These articles get set up prior to elections then basically gather dust afterwards. I suggest that we should have a better way of dealing with them.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Andrew Hurst is active in the DC and national legal community, in the 2008 presidential election, and in state and local politics. It is these important contributions that made his campaign as successful as it was. In other words, it is not the campaign that made him notable, it was his notability that made his campaign. <small><a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAcham_cbb0.html" title="User:Acham">Acham</a> 03:35, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><small>But being the Young Lawyer Section representative to the Bar Association of the District of Columbia does not make one notable enough to have one's own page on Wikipedia. Neither does being awarded the BADC's 2005 Young Lawyer of the Year award... <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELincolnite_dc5e.html" title="User:Lincolnite">Lincolnite</a> 09:22, 13 February 2007 (UTC).</small>
<ul>
<li><small>You seem to be caught up in cherry picking single accomplishments. First, the Young Lawyer award is unique: it's a hotly competitive award in a town where 1 in 12 people is a lawyer <a href="http://www.nashvilleareainfo.com/Docs/How%20the%20States%20Stack%20Up%20in%20Attorney%20Counts,%20Economic%20Growth%20and%20Malpractice%20Measures.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.nashvilleareainfo.com/Docs/How%20the%20States%20Stack%20Up%20in%20Attorney%20Counts,%20Economic%20Growth%20and%20Malpractice%20Measures.pdf" rel="nofollow">(PDF),</a> where lawyers come from around the world to study and practice, and where most of the lawyers have national ambitions. It's like being Paris's best young fashion designer or New York's best young financial planner. If you Google DC Young Lawyer for past winners you get partners in the world's biggest firms and executive directors of major charities and corporations, and the current mayor, the youngest in DC history. Moving on to Hurst's entire body of legal work, it includes cases of international interest, significant pro bono work, and novel legal theory. He has led statewide aspects of national political campaigns. He is active in his community and sought to run again. He exhausted the incumbent’s $3 million war chest that Davis was saving for a Senate bid in 2008, and Hurst received more votes than any challenger in the State in 2006. This is no long shot Green Party candidate.<a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAcham_cbb0.html" title="User:Acham">Acham</a> 22:01, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> for now. The organisation has not yet been given prominence in the storyline. If it does, this page can always be recreated.

<ul>
<li>I would not recommend merging, as there are not <i>yet</i> any verifiable facts about Mittelos's relationship to Hanso and DHARMA. Those Lost writers are very clever and evasive, and have not said anything for certain about it yet. 81.178.238.47 01:18, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, the fact that you don't know the event nor the riders participating in it does not mean the event is not notable. Merging would be possible, but wouldn't make sense in my opinion according to the winners who are already mentioned in the main article, while more details can be found in the year by year reports, just like it's done in most other articles on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESportsAddicted_c1a4.html" title="User:SportsAddicted"><b>SportsAddicted</b></a> | <small><a href="../../../s/p/o/User_talk%7ESportsAddicted_7258.html" title="User talk:SportsAddicted"><font color="dimgray">discuss</font></a></small> 08:50, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Both articles are short, so they could be merged it would seem to me. Certainly would be no problem to split them out again if the main article gets bigger.

<p>Contested prod. Original reason for prod (by me): <i>This is an article about a word, not what the word denotes, and as such, it is a <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICDEF_eedd.html" title="WP:DICDEF">dictionary definition</a>.</i> The prod notice was removed by Openartist who left the following comment on the talk page: <i>As the article contains references, historical information, and also uses of the word in other contexts such as a book of fiction. This transcends the typical content stored in a dictionary as is. And as one could argue that Logology, while a more or less unknown field of study, is a field of study none-the-less. And as a field of study deserves a place in an encylopedia as do other "-ologies."</i> I still say delete.

<li><b>Keep</b> but cleanup. Logology is a notable neologism judging by Google Books &amp; Google Scholar results and a near-half-century of academic use, although it has an informal usage and two formal, separate uses (the works of Borgmann and of <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Burke_61de.html" title="Kenneth Burke">Kenneth Burke</a>). I don't think treating it as a "field of study" is accurate except in the hobbyist sense; it is more about a domain of knowledge. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 19:10, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not calling the article fancruft, I'm calling the /movie/ fancruft. I bet you haven't even seen it. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENardman1_ed82.html" title="User:Nardman1">Nardman1</a> 19:43, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I have seen the movie making-of, interviews of director and actors, trailer and large abstracts in a documentary on French national television. Can you say that about <i><a href="../../../r/e/v/Star_Wars%7E_Revelations_acd5.html" title="Star Wars: Revelations">Star Wars: Revelations</a></i> which seems to be legitimate&#160;? Has it been seen on HBO&#160;? <a href="../../../h/e/k/User%7EHektor_6d63.html" title="User:Hektor">Hektor</a> 19:46, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That movie is notable because /it's actually been released/ and it has a large fan-base. The same cannot be said of your French film, which of course we aren't discriminating against, as you claim. Who would dislike the French? Also your argument fails <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a> <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENardman1_ed82.html" title="User:Nardman1">Nardman1</a> 19:50, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>Revelations</i> has been released and is available to the public, and has many, *many* legitimate independent third-party references available to its validity and notability. <i>L'Ordre Sith</i> does not, yet. That may change in the future, of course, but *right now*, it does not. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeWazowski_3925.html" title="User:MikeWazowski">MikeWazowski</a> 19:51, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Large abstracts of the movie have been shown on French television, therefore it has been seen by millions of French people, which are not all Star Wars fans. This is comparable for me to a distribution to a limited fan base via the net. Canal + has 5 million subscribers; If one third of them has seen the <a href="http://www.canalplus.fr/cid34570-pid4-tpl31.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.canalplus.fr/cid34570-pid4-tpl31.htm" rel="nofollow">documentary</a>, which was broadcast as an introduction to the network premiere of <i><a href="../../../r/e/v/Revenge_of_the_Sith_bd67.html" title="Revenge of the Sith">Revenge of the Sith</a></i> on January 1st 2007, that means that 1.5 million people in France know about the movie. <a href="../../../h/e/k/User%7EHektor_6d63.html" title="User:Hektor">Hektor</a> 20:01, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In other words, you don't know the ratings, so you're making up numbers now to shore up your argument. <i>Revelations</i> had been downloaded <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4100284.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4100284.stm" rel="nofollow">more than three million times</a> within three months of its release, and that was close to two years ago. That's actual numbers of people who *watched* the film, not just people *aware* of it. I haven't seen any current download figures, but regardless, it shows that there's no comparison between the two - especially when, and this is the important point, <i>L'Ordre Sith</i> has not been released. Some people may have heard about it on TV - but there's apparently been very little other press, and no one's seen a completed film. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeWazowski_3925.html" title="User:MikeWazowski">MikeWazowski</a> 20:28, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> The article itself isn't of the proper tone, but the subject itself isn't a problem. The opening and closing credits of a major television show can be significant (besides Sesame Street, I'd include the Simpsons, Tiny Toons, Pinky and the Brain in the list of shows where the credits matter.), and in this case, there's enough information that it probably can't be adequately covered in the main article on Sesame Street. Still, I wouldn't object to a merge. I do however, object to a AfD that is made with the complaint of fancruft. I find that offensive and uncivil. Please try to make your nominations in more neutral language. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:27, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Sesame Street is as much of a cultural phenomena as the Simpson's, so I accept that a description of the credits is appropriate.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>How can I, as a random Wikipedia reader, check that this article's description of, say, the closing credits in 1970–1971, or of episode #131, is accurate? This question is brought to you by the letters <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">NOR</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:03, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Ultimately, only by watching the episode in question.

<li><b>Delete</b>. While the journalist is notable, and the prime minister is notable, the set of 40 questions is not notable. They are not properly referenced to any document we can access. In fact, there is no mention of the journalist in WP's article on <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thai_Rak_Thai_7f14.html" title="Thai Rak Thai">Thai Rak Thai</a>. I would suggest Speedy Deletion if the article were not so confusing. I guess if notability is the criterion then AfD is necessary.

<li><b>Keep</b> Ms. Handler is notable, and perhaps would be if she were a self promoter. Her legal work as mentioned in the book, COMIC WARS, allowed Perlmutter and Arad to win the prized rights to X-Men and Spiderman after <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Icahn_42fb.html" title="Carl Icahn">Carl Icahn</a>, a brilliant financier, and <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Perelman_a948.html" title="Ron Perelman">Ron Perelman</a> a tough fighter, both took a stab at cutting up Marvel as they have done with countless others. The fact that neither were successful as a result of a flaw in both of their legal team's work, and that this IP attorney uncovered it, sounds like something worthwhile. The fact that she never went public with her own info and sought a story should not exclude her. The role was written up the the New York Law Journal, but to access the article requires access I just don't have. Additionally, and unfortunately, the Spiderman court records were sealed at the time of the litigation and were only unsealed in 2003, many years after the victory, leaving only references as you see them to be made, and not a full fledged story (<a href="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-100420986.html" class="external text" title="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-100420986.html" rel="nofollow">Business Wire; Apr 21, 2003</a>)<a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudae1_994a.html" title="User:Judae1">Juda S.

<dd>Not sure what you mean by self published as far as this piece goes, there are many articles offered as references and none are self published, shy of the Comic Wars book website, but that book too is, in-fact, referenced in a trade journal called Managing Intellectual Property, which is present in the citations as well. I am afraid that I am not convinced at all by your argument that Handler has not done what the article suggests and the accompanying references cite. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudae1_994a.html" title="User:Judae1">Juda S.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I have a hard time understanding <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a>'s and <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a>'s interpretation of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. According to the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> guidelines, the notability of a service or product has to be the subject of multiple <b>independent</b> non-trivial published works. Well, in the subject of semiconductors for communications it does not get more <b>non trivial</b> than to be published at <a href="../../../i/s/s/ISSCC_4b21.html" title="ISSCC">ISSCC</a> (organized by the <a href="../../../i/e/e/IEEE_472a.html" title="IEEE">IEEE</a>). The two inline refererences in the article are pdf links to these <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer reviewed</a> articles on semiconductor technology and not simply self promoting press releases. Finally, regarding the relevance of the technology in question (<a href="../../../1/0/g/10GE_3958.html" title="10GE">10GE</a>, transceivers) to ordinary people, it would suffice to say that with very high probability the bits that comprise what you are reading right now have been brought to you through a 10GE <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transceiver.html" title="Transceiver">transceiver</a> somewhere along their path in the network core or the <a href="../../../s/a/n/SAN_62a0.html" title="SAN">SAN</a>'s that hosts wikipedia. Incidentally, the fastest networks today and hopefully the ones that will be accesible to end users in a few years use that technology (see <a href="http://ultralight.caltech.edu/lsr_06252004/" class="external free" title="http://ultralight.caltech.edu/lsr_06252004/" rel="nofollow">http://ultralight.caltech.edu/lsr_06252004/</a> or <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/3403161" class="external free" title="http://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/3403161" rel="nofollow">http://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/3403161</a> for example).

<dd><b>Comment</b> those links were added after the article was nominated and link to pages on the Aeluros wegsite so are not <b>independent</b>. If you can link to them on the <a href="../../../i/s/s/ISSCC_4b21.html" title="ISSCC">ISSCC</a> site that would change. However, you still have the problem that Aeluros is not the subject of those papers but the technology. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 11:47, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: I am sorry about the late addition. Initially it was part of the External links section but the nominator mentioned that he could not see it. As far as the independence of the actual URL of the links: I can understand why an algorithm would be confused about that, but not a human. Besides, I would have linked them to the ISSCC web site but unfortunately they are not available on their complete form (the IEEE wants to charge for the complete articles, and only the authoring organization has the right to distribute them free of charge on the web). Please look here for proof that these are not forgeries: <a href="http://www.isscc.org/isscc/2004/ap/ISSCC2004_AdvanceProgram.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.isscc.org/isscc/2004/ap/ISSCC2004_AdvanceProgram.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.isscc.org/isscc/2004/ap/ISSCC2004_AdvanceProgram.pdf</a> (similar link for the other one). As for the second "problem" <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> mentions that the criteria apply to an organization product or service. Technology companies are most of the time indistinguishable from the product or service they supply. If I were to adhere to the letter of your suggestion I would rename the article to 'Aeluros' 10GE technology' which would look much more like an advertisement. Hope that makes sense.

<li><b>keep</b> there are different ways a corporation can be notable, and sales rank is not the only one.

<p>I can't find any asertion of notability here. One third place prize, that's it. No chart successes, either for albums or songs. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman"><b>Blood Red Sandman</b></a> <a href="../../../b/l/o/User_talk%7EBlood_red_sandman_ee7c.html" title="User talk:Blood red sandman"><font color="black">Open Up Your Heart</font></a> <font color="blue">-</font> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blood_red_sandman_8494.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blood red sandman"><font color="red">Receive My EviLove</font></a> 21:29, 10 February 2007 (UTC)<br />
I don't agree, of course, since I created the page. About this third prize&#160;:at present I am looking for public and official proofs about it. I contacted the band, who said they had a diploma of course (but how can be a paper be a proof on Wiki?), and would see to give me relevant links. So I am waiting for that. But otherwise: it is a third prize <i>in the most important metal festival in the world</i>... well... that means playing with groups like Lordi, Lacuna Coil,Immortal, Dimmu Borgir etc.. etc... But anyway, is notability really only dependent on commercial success? it is what I feel you are saying here. I believe that if this page is deleted, a great number of other pages on black metal bands should be as well, and that might mean notability criteria are really quite different in this area of musical creation, don't you think? I would very much like to get other opinions, thank you.--<a href="../../../o/r/d/User%7EOrdocello_3964.html" title="User:Ordocello">Ordocello</a> 09:38, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. To begin with, I want to remind everyone that there is not policy of notability on schools. The requirement of stating some assertion of notability is mainly created on the fact that millions of articles that are <i>commercially based</i> or focused <i>individual</i> self-promotion would be littered all over wikipedia. I believe that if any article that is not advertising in this said manner is viable. In addition, as an additional requirement, I believe that articles should have some substance and according to policy, they should have some referenced material or at least list some legitimate sources. This article appears to have some information, and I am sure that in the future, individuals could work on and improve the article based on these sources. As always, we should not be excluded articles on wikipedia on just notability alone; self-promotion and commercial characteristics of articles with illegitimate sources should be the targets of deletion. This article appears to have some possibility for growth, and I believe that if until some templates for clean up and additional sources are added, and <i>then</i> if no progress is made on the article within a few months, then the article can be properly assessed. --Thank You. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh17_09da.html" title="User:Sukh17">Sukh17</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><sup><a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh17_5dc2.html" title="User talk:Sukh17">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sukh17_a7a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sukh17">Contribs</a></sup></span> 19:42, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This appears to be a neologism; a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=%22bosniak+canadian%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=%22bosniak+canadian%22" rel="nofollow">Google search for "Bosniak Canadian"</a> results in only two unique examples (four unique pages, three of which contain the same sentence). The article was <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PRODed</a> and as a result several "external links" were added ostensibly as sources, but only one of the websites actually contains the term "Bosniak Canadian", and then only on a single unique page (<a href="http://www.bosniak.org/06/goals.php" class="external text" title="http://www.bosniak.org/06/goals.php" rel="nofollow">CNAB goals</a>).</p>
<p>I hasten to say that I do not dispute that there are indeed Bosniaks in Canada. However, it seems clear that the group is not notable enough to have any sources outside a single mention on the CNAB website, and even that website says nothing about Bosniak Canadians in particular except for the fact that they exist. There just doesn't seem to be enough published information out there to satisfy the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> guidelines for a Wikipedia article. On the other hand, there does seem to be a lot of information on Bosnian Canadians, which is a superset of Bosniak Canadians. I would hazard to guess that almost anything encyclopedic about Bosnian Canadians would also apply to Bosniak Canadians. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 21:53, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>do not wish to be offended by this but i feel i must defend myself. Nitelink Rovers is a football team affiliated with a youth club in Dublin Ireland. I am responsible for this youth club and run it along with other adults. The mentioned "coach" is another leader in the youth club who has qualifications from the FAI(football association of Ireland). We are an amateur youth club and the international youth club cup is what the group of teams refer to the tournament as. Our youth club is affiliated with the E.C.Y.D. and regnum Christi (see legionaires of Christ) who have a boarding school in Wicklow, Ireland known as Dublin Oak. The other teams are all teams of E.C.Y.D. Members from clubs in the country. The children in the youth club all use Wikipedia as a resource for their school work and asked that they could have themselves on the site. This article may not be of significant use to other members of the site but the children really enjoy being able to see themselves on the internet. As a user of Wikipedia for many years I am upset that other users are saying that i should be blocked as i have put nothing untruthful in any of the articles I have written. The only part of any article that could be deemed untrue is the inclusion of Eugene O'Connor and "Zippo" Nolan. These are two fathers who have done alot of work installing toilets and doing building work on the club and as a gesture of goodwill the children asked them to be included.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I would like to hear from people regarding this issue as i feel it is highly unfair what is being said of myself and these articles.</dd>

<dd>Then it isn't in the least bit notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia. It's a youth club team. There are thousands of these throughout Ireland and the United Kingdom. I can think of ten in my own home town, which has a much smaller population than Dublin. Your youth club's football team is not notable. I'm sorry to break it to you, but it isn't.

There are also separate guidelines on what kinds of football teams are notable enough for inclusion on Wikipedia, but I forget where those are.

I think Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information also applies. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian">Merovingian</a> ※ <a href="../../../m/e/r/User_talk%7EMerovingian_28b5.html" title="User talk:Merovingian">Talk</a> 22:10, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Delete</b>. I would not necessarily delete an article for a lack of notability in the case of schools and other institutions if the articles contain some substance. I believe that the assertion of notability is far more important in articles on individuals or say, commercial institutions. My delete vote here is inherently based on the fact that this article has very little useful information, has no references, and provides no external links or evidence that it could be formed into a functioning article. This school appears that it is going to be completely non-existent. However if there is some history and information based on credible sources that can be added, and if one of the previous editors could provide such credible source of information, regardless of any notability, I could consider keeping the article.</s> <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh17_09da.html" title="User:Sukh17">Sukh17</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><sup><a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh17_5dc2.html" title="User talk:Sukh17">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sukh17_a7a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sukh17">Contribs</a></sup></span> 19:20, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> If you look through the history, you'll see that I considered putting up an AfD for this article (after shooting down an attempt at having it speedily deleted under A7), but reconsidered. My rationale (then and now) is that such a long-running radio show, with a compilation album and being broadcast on three different networks, is most certainly notable. Is there a COI? I don't care, because it doesn't matter. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> <span style="color: #999;">// <a href="../../../e/v/u/User_talk%7EEVula_6eaa.html" title="User talk:EVula">talk</a> // <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_admin_63be.html" title="User:EVula/admin"><span style="color: #366;">☯</span></a> //</span> 16:40, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I agree with the removal of speedy deletion, but it matters a lot that it's COI. Wikipedia is not an advertisement site. Gene Poole should no longer edit anything related to his primary activities' economical interests, I think now it's really too much. Nothing personal, but I realize that he destroyed several contributors along the years, and possibly, before he harrassed them, many of them were good contributors. <a href="../../../d/o/k/User%7EDoktor_Who_a947.html" title="User:Doktor Who">Dr. Who</a> 16:45, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In regards to the notability of the subject, <i>which is the <b>only</b> relevant concept to discuss in this AfD</i>, no, a COI does <i>not</i> matter.
