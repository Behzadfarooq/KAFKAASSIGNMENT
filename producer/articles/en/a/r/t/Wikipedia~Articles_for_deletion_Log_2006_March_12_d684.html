<li><b>Keep</b> This level of detail can be expected for more and more teams. In the long run merging won't be viable.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Disagree</b>. The information belongs on Wikipedia, but there's too much to be on the main page. The goal is to have a brief summary on the main Redskins page and then a link to the in-depth article, similar to the manner in which <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_United_States_a072.html" title="History of the United States">History of the United States</a> is handled on the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> page. -<a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordanhurley_5b45.html" title="User:Jordanhurley">J Train</a> 03:29, 12 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But a article on every season is not the way to go though, at the most it some of the info should be in a <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Washington_Redskins_08c0.html" title="History of the Washington Redskins">History of the Washington Redskins</a> article, we can't have articles on every season of every team better of to merge there --<a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJaranda_ee94.html" title="User:Jaranda">Jaranda</a> <a href="../../../j/a/r/User_talk%7EJaranda_87d5.html" title="User talk:Jaranda"><sup>wat's sup</sup></a> 03:37, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> It isn't "random" as it is last season and for a major team. I expect many such articles will be created as Wikipedia expands. f it is merged it will need to be demerged. The flexibility given by breakout articles is one of Wikipedia's greatest strengths. <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawkestone_e60a.html" title="User:Hawkestone">Hawkestone</a> 02:36, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I trust you are comparing the numbers of items listed across the entire "Craigslist" network to the entire "Bechna" network, rather than just the Indian sub-pages? The latter comparison would be mistaken and irrelevant, as the <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craigslist.html" title="Craigslist">Craigslist</a> article refers to a large multi-country network of communities. If you are making a valid comparison, I would be very interested to see such a claim proved. Indeed, you talk about "evidence" (site was inaccessible at 15.40 UTC, but it's not important). There is no evidence that this topic is notable. If you have some you might want to put it on / link it to the article. A major English language media source featuring the service, for example. Bear in mind that a site displaying free classifieds such as <a href="http://www.bechna.com/view_services_details.php?id=1059" class="external text" title="http://www.bechna.com/view_services_details.php?id=1059" rel="nofollow">"You need female escort in india call me"</a> and <a href="http://www.bechna.com/view_sale_details.php?id=911" class="external text" title="http://www.bechna.com/view_sale_details.php?id=911" rel="nofollow">"The free sports book"</a> to web surfers in India might not be a topic suitable for the English Wikipedia, and you might have to deal with that. Please resist comparisons between sites as each AfD is considered on its own merits. I hope you would also agree that any page which serves only to publicize a website whose notability cannot be established should be deleted. And, editor-to-editor, I'd say this: You've already tested <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> once, make sure you understand <b>exactly</b> what the determining criteria for inclusion on Wikipedia are before you push it any further. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><b><font style="verdana" color="#990000">D</font><font color="#669900">e</font><font color="#990000">izio</font></b></a> 01:56, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Please tone it down. I apologized for my earlier <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>.

<li><b>Extremely strong keep</b> Anyone who's been watching this project will see that they've put up a great deal of work into this project. They've won the unreleased mod of the year award from ModDB and <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valve.html" title="Valve">Valve</a> themselves have even commented positively on the project. It may have shown up on Steam updates at some point, I'm not sure. It's gotten enough attention from Valve for Valve to request them to remove the "Source" from their name. It's a high profile modification for Half-Life 2. Any fan of HL2 would know that. I think this is one of the most notable mods - even before release - of HL2 there is (other than Dystopia and Garrysmod), and a great number of people anticipate it eagerly. The reason its not released yet is because this mod is taking a HUGE amount of work, they're basically re-making a game. They've posted a lot of their work and it's really fine work. I would also like to quote another user's comments on the previous debate for deletion: "Delete mainly because the link to the site doesn't work correctly. But I should point out that there are other mods (a Apocolypse Mod for BattleField 2 for example) that are on Wiki, but not slated for deletion. If there was evidence that this mod was further along, perhaps in some sort of beta release, I would be against deletion. However, there is really no available evidence that it is anywhere.

<dd>I can't actually look at the mod site because their HTML version says 'down for maintenance' - not exactly a promising sign. All I can go on is the article, which says there's no public beta - so what 'work' have they posted? A bunch of screenshots and the such is not worthy of an article - there's a whole heap of 'promising' mods which end up producing absolutely nothing in the end. --<a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzzie_28e3.html" title="User:Fuzzie">Fuzzie</a> <small>(<a href="../../../f/u/z/User_talk%7EFuzzie_2e03.html" title="User talk:Fuzzie">talk</a>)</small> 19:20, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

Come back when there's proof (i.e., a product) that this is not vaporware. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 19:42, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>; mods like this often get a lot of press before their official release, and are influential despite being in prerelease. I agree, it's borderline, though; if it stays vaporware, kill it. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions">ProhibitOnions</a> 21:45, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, covered in PC Gamer, as well as a number of other media outlets. It's well above the level of a bunch of guys who got together and decided to say they're making a mod. Article needs to be rewritten to clarify notability and media coverage though. P.S. PROD should not be put back on an article after being taken off; it should go straight to afd. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> 05:59, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, as mod in question is indeed 'notable'. It has garnered significant on- and off-line media attention, including strong statements of support from Valve. The scope and ambition are of considerable quality, as is the work already produced. Finally, it has won several awards including Mod of the Year 2005. -- Ken (non-user), 19:45 12 March 2006 (GMT)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Iron Grip was only kept by default due to no consensus. If you read the AfD, you'd note that half of the people were asking for deletion and the other half for merging. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 12:12, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I rewrote that article to make it conform to a higher standard of quality, not to justify its content. The article was AfD for all the wrong reasons. I would have agreed to delete, had the AfD been for an insoluble excuse. - Kizzatp</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I don't know why it was deemed non-notable, when research shows that it's clearly had a fair share of media coverage. Also, It was remade mere days after it was deleted, which is a bit odd. The article itself is in need of attention, to show it's notability. - <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero1328_e3a0.html" title="User:Zero1328">Zero1328</a> 08:41, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> People, be cautious on keeping just because it has "media coverage". A lot of mods get "media coverage" even before publishing. (<a href="http://www.secondbrain.net/jaakari/" class="external text" title="http://www.secondbrain.net/jaakari/" rel="nofollow">this thingy</a>, an independently built game, got a whole article in <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pelit.html" title="Pelit">Pelit</a> and the last update to the web pages was in 2003!) Magazines print everything they find interesting and that they have space for. Granted, I have to say I'm a little bit more eager to keep this thing now that I've heard there's actual coverage, but I'm not changing the AfD motion just yet. I'm still saying this thing needs to be either deleted until the thing actually exists, or trimmed with chainsaw and put to some article about HL2 mods in general. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 15:45, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> BMS has also got Valve's attention. If BMS ends up not releasing anything after their target date with no excuse then I would vote to delete the article, but right now, at the present, it's in the spotlight. <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrIdiot_cdb1.html" title="User:DrIdiot">DrIdiot</a> 00:40, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Extremely strong keep</b> This is not just any "random mod", it has actually gotten a reasonable amount of media coverage from websites and gaming magazines (as far as mods go, it is actually quite a lot of coverage). It is still very much an active project, and won the Unreleased Mod Of The Year 2005 award from ModDB. There is also a separate page on Mods for Half-Life 2, which links to this page. This page is both important and notable, and should be kept. If the project were to be cancelled, however, I would be all for its deletion. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmaddamsetti_88b8.html" title="User:Pmaddamsetti">Pmaddamsetti</a> 18:13, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I was the one who originally revamped (and changed the title of) the article after it was deleted, because I feel that the project is a notable one and should have a mention here. As an aside, I just want to thank everyone who continued adding to this article, including the pictures. <a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGundam_Bass_20dc.html" title="User:Gundam Bass">Viewer</a> 23:40, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I would normally vote delete on things like this, because it is after all an article on an upcoming game mod and Wikipedia isn't a crystal ball. <i>However</i>, this is the most eminently notable upcoming mod, period. It's huge. And it has multiple verifiable media sources. <b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#0055AA">Cyde&#160;Weys</font></a></b> 23:45, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Extremely strong keep pending release date</b> - Name a more notable, unreleased mod for any game? Noone can. If this article is deleted, to avoid hypocracy, any other unreleased game or modification article should be deleted on sight. As for 'crystal-ballism' this article has been brought to the attention of the Black Mesa team and they have edited this article and its predecessor, thus, we can verify its content as true. If Black Mesa fails to meet its release date, I would support an AfD. There has been no evidence to support a possible failure of the Black Mesa project. - Kizzatp</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, because this game has been recieving a lot of positive press, and I agree with what <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmaddamsetti_88b8.html" title="User:Pmaddamsetti">Pmaddamsetti</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrIdiot_cdb1.html" title="User:DrIdiot">DrIdiot</a> say. -<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonicBH_369d.html" title="User:TonicBH">TonicBH</a> 13:44, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Request Sasperilla provide free copies of DVDs to all WP users who request them (to better the article, natch), and userfy Carmen Electra herself to my house if she's willing. As for the article, I had actually seen the product advertised on TV and/or maybe one of the late night hosts showed clips and commented on it.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The reason the article was "improperly" reprodded, rather than brought here, was because the notice was removed because the reasoning wasn't understood. I think it's fairly clear that the article as it is should be deleted, but if/when it is replaced by something decent (even a stub), there's no point even thinnking of deleting, which actually makes PROD a good place for it.

I think that we should avoid making a judgement about this article on the basis of Mr Raper's name and try and make it on the basis of his notability for an article. I suspect that someone who is CEO of a company with a 14 billion USD turnover is of sufficient standing within the business world to merit an article. In view of the scatalogical and sexual nature of many of the episodes of vandalism that appear on Wikipedia it is perhaps natural that we should assume that the article is a hoax, but in this case it appears not to be the case.

Mr Raper's name comes up top in a Google for "masterfoods ceo" but most results are old, I'd think the most likely answer is that he's former CEO. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 09:45, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - I have access to Bloomberg People Directory. Mr Raper is indeed the current CEO of Masterfoods, and has been for the last several years, and prior to that had a successful career. This page shows the problem of consensus being deemed more important than knowledge of the matter. Just because someone doesn't come up in Google, doesn't mean they are not notable. Raper is interviewed in national magazines on a near-monthly basis, it's just that they don't reproduce all their articles onto Google. CEO DR 14:47, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Uhh.. reproduce all thier articles onto Google? Google is a search engine. If Dick Raper's name was that important and he was featured monthly in articles, <del>he would probably get more than 1 google hit</del>. Besides, there isn't enough information on Dick Raper to produce more than there already is. The only external link we have on him is from 2001. I suggest recreating the page when you have more information on him. <a href="../../../m/o/e/User%7EMoe_Epsilon_7345.html" title="User:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#FF0000">M</font><font color="#EE0000">o</font><font color="#DD0000">e</font></a> <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#0000FF">ε</font></a> 15:42, 12 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>By "reproduce" I meant there being an online version of the paper edition, eg reproduced online. Whilst newspapers may archive everything online, the business magazines Raper is featured in are more exclusive, like IFR magazine which costs $100 a copy, so obviously they won't put content up for free online.

<li>Relooked and he has 64 total as shown in a link above.

<p>Previously AfDd <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_EAthena_f690.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/EAthena">here</a>, the consensus to redirect lasted nearly two weeks before someone subverted it by re-creating the article at a different location.

Contains unsupported assertions (whaere is the proof that it is "the most widely used Ragnarok Online server emulator known today"? And in what way is that proof of notability? Should I write an article for my work shoes on the basis that they are my most widely used pair of shoes?), but most of all I am just sick to death of the constant re-creation after deletion or redirect of articles on trivial subjects for which a 100% informative treatment can be found at the website which pops up at the top of the Google list. This is <i>supposed</i> to be an encyclopaedia, not a directory of every concept peripherally related to online gaming. However, the thing may have gronw since the last AfD and I don't want a revert war ove re-establishing the redirect, so I bring it back here. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 09:43, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

(AI is a real major music competition viz the 30+ million viewers who tune in to the program each week; no other competition comes close.) Is becoming a finalist the same as "won or placed" in a competition? I'd argue it is; the finalists, at least, have placed somewhere in the 1-12 area; some may turn out not to be notable, others likely will.

<li><b>Keep</b> He's a finalist on one of the most popular series in America (and unlike Survivor, there is a certain process where you go through semifinals, then the finals - the public votes for you to get to the finals), and many of the people who are finalists on this show go on to have a career in the entertainment industry, sometimes a very successful career, even if they don't win. I also don't think it's appropriate to propose this one article for deletion while not nominating any other American Idol season 5 finalists for deletion. If that means they are "notable", since they have not been nominated for deletion, then Yamin is just as notable. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesB3_3655.html" title="User:JamesB3">JamesB3</a> 07:39, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. From "Tsunami Aftermath: In Maldives, a Gap Widens", The Asian Wall Street Journal, 3 January 2005: "FATHIMATH SHAFEEGA was overseeing the Maldives' tiny stock exchange when she spotted an unusual dark swell rolling toward her office from the Indian Ocean. She halted trading and sent everybody home." There's another story or two about her at other dates. We can take it as confirmed, I think, that she's indeed in charge (and why not founder?) of the Maldive stock exchange. But its tiny.

<p><b>This entry is a crock</b>. The person who listed this article is 68.32.34.152 (26 edits) who said "Delete, the page is incoherent etc". The first <b>Delete</b> is from Wraith Daquell (19 edits). The second <b>Delete</b> is by -- you guessed it -- the same 68.32.34.152 who nominated the article for deletion. Note that in his first comments above, he said it seemed "to document a real play", but in his vote he said he didn't "think it is a real play". I was unaware of this article until seeing it on this list, so I read it. It is stubby and needs editing.

<dd>That is certainly a much more civil approach to get your point to be understood. This could have avoided a great deal of time, had you said that a week ago. Currently, I am working with the sources to get them released...I'm trying to expose something and avoid a lawsuit at the same time. I seriously question, however that you've attempted to research any part of the article, given your history of behavior with other users on this article and statements made on and about this article prior to the one you just made.</dd>
<dd>There is a book, Marco Rodin's "Aerodynamics" that can be cited, if I could just find it...I can find works "in Re" to it, but not the original work, other than the book I'm holding in my hand. Marco Rodin wasn't exactly a hack....he was a brilliant physicist...</dd>
<dd>Even that wouldn't account for the whole article, I do understand, sir, but I assure, I am working on it. If you could show some patience, as I requested, I can definately verify these sources. I just need time..surely you can understand the concept of delayed gratification.</dd>
<dd>If you can bear with us, we are working our tails off to get this completed...it's rather turning into a drain...as we're spending hours on the phone arguing with some of the members of this group to release interviews to certain medias.</dd>

<dd>I am sorry that I wasn't clear enough initially. However, I stand by my vote. I think we cannot afford to have <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> articles, and even when your contacts with certain people result in citable sources, I am not convinced at all of the notability of the concept. Also, please take note of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>: not all sources are good sources.</dd>
<dd>If you ask me, 'Gammamute' just is one of the zillion pseudoscientific concepts that struggle to get included in Wikipedia. But Wikipedia is just a <i>tertiary source</i> — it is not the place to publish original research and hence it is not the proper venue for the publication and documentation of fringe concepts like this. I think the most sensible thing to do is to delete the article as it stands now, if consensus says so. Of course, nothing holds you back from working on an improved, referenced version at home (or wherever you like to work) first. But as I said, I doubt if it will ever be worthy of inclusion on its own merits. You might want to try <code>wikinfo.org</code>, where the rules seem to be slightly less stringent. — <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 16:04, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will most definately continue researching this group at home, regardless of whether the article is deleted, however I will continue to find citable sources in the article.</p>
<p>I understand your point about original research. Perhaps I should go to the newspapers anonymously with what I have (much more than the article), and let them take it from there.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Right, I knew that, because you said it above, and I read it, and I was paying attention. The <b>soundtrack album</b> it seems, these days, doesn't always include every song used in the movie and does include some not. However it was <i>associated</i> with the movie, as you said and as I said. Sorry if my being unclear in phrasing was cause for any confusion, but no change in my opinion. The album sold well enough to justify part of the retention, the cover of a song by Etheridge provides more, the national tour provides a little more, the being signed by a major label provides a bit more too. All in all, sums to <i>barely</i> notable, I think. <font color="green">+</font>+<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 15:27, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Difference of opinion then. It looks to me like Island records got the rights to the soundtrack, had some empty space left over after putting in the actual movie sogs, and tossed in some of their own bands as filler. Doesn't add to their notability IMHO.

<p>A 'political party' with one member and, in 2004, a declared income of 10 whole English pounds. Polled 129 votes in the 2005 general election, 0.3% of the electorate in the constituency in question and too small a percentage nationally to even bother about.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am the original author. I think the entire article including the look at the top classifieds sites in India that were mentioned in the article should be kept. The 10 classifieds sites mentioned are the most popular in India. If you have any doubt please talk to anyone who lives in India or is knowledgeable about Indian websites. The reason why the Internet and Internet usage in India is very interesting is that currently internet usage in India is at approximately 3% of population. The number of users increased over 50% from last year and is continuing to grow with improved infrastructure plans. By comparison, the percentage of users in the United States relative to population was 68.8% in 2004 and dropped in 2005. I believe a look at the Indian and Chinese internet industry is important over the short term. Bluesargam 01:42, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> does this standard apply to all equally or is marriage to or descent from some royalty make one notable? See <a href="../../../l/i/n/Line_of_succession_to_the_British_Throne_8a29.html" title="Line of succession to the British Throne">Line of succession to the British Throne</a> which is basically a list of 870 people whose (in some cases, only) notability springs from their descent from <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophia_of_Hanover_bc15.html" title="Sophia of Hanover">Sophia of Hanover</a> -- yes, many of the links are red, but that's an invitation to create an article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> In my opinion, this standard should apply to everyone equally. Marriage and descent are not sufficient case for independent notability that could support a wikipedia article. To take your example, decendents of nobles should be merged into notable parent articles unless they are in the House of Lords (for British nobility), are in direct sucession of the throne (like William &amp; Henry) or are otherwise notable for something that they have done. The list itself is of some encyclopedic value (and I'm pretty ardently against lists) but having individual articles about every single person in that list is rather silly (i.e. <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl-Christian_Ferner_7f72.html" title="Carl-Christian Ferner">Carl-Christian Ferner</a> for example... could easily be merged to <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Astrid_of_Norway_10de.html" title="Princess Astrid of Norway">Princess Astrid of Norway</a>). If someone can't meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> they don't deserve a standalone article. This is sort of an off topic rant though.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:16, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> More people have heard about Legendary Frog than Andrew Dice, but he still gets an article. Joseph Blanchette has a forum with thousands of fan members. I think he's worthy of note, especially if someone wants to build the entry. It's not like we're asking the administrators to make it. There's nothing detrimental about this page. It's informative. If you can give Leeroy Jenkins, and All Your Base Are Belong to Us a page, then Legendary Frog is enough of an Internet success to include too. Yeah I know this is a second vote, but I had more to say, and I like to have the last laugh.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I think it's ridiculous to delete Legendary Frog's entry, he used to be really really big and his movies have been watched many many times and had a large impact on a large part of the flash community. I don't understand why EVERY SINGLE WEB COMIC EVER MADE, for example "pixel comics" with no creative value whatsoever and without much notibility can have an entry (I don't remember the names but they are indeed plentiful) when one of the most influentious flash animators can not? I don't think every flash artist should have an entry (I just voted "Delete" for Fredthemonkey.com) but the most famous should definately have a page. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 14:59, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>He is a flash animator but he's definately among the more famous ones. Why discriminate against flash animators but allow every single web comics, many probably seen by much much fewer people than LF's movies? Also, it's not about his homepage and where it may be hosted but about his movies, only posted on NG because he hasn't allowed them to be uploaded elsewhere. If he had, I bet they'd be over the entire web by now.<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 08:08, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Here's some evidence of his notability, except for the fact that he gets 50,000 hits on google, his original cartoon <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/70212" class="external text" title="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/70212" rel="nofollow">All Your Pie</a> has been viewed 600,000 times, another original, [<a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/135265" class="external text" title="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/135265" rel="nofollow">Kerri's big invention</a> almost 700,000 times.

This is probably more than some television shows. He's been active since at least 2002 (the date his most popular Final Fantasy spoof was released) so there's no novelty factor to his name, there's no "he's not big enough now but might be later" (IMO). <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 08:24, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I just realised his movies can be viewed at <a href="http://www.ugoplayer.com" class="external text" title="http://www.ugoplayer.com" rel="nofollow">UGOPlayer</a>] as well, where his movies have been watched a grand total of 7,104,423 times (at time of writing).

<li>Here's a list of all web comics with their own articles on Wikipedia: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_webcomics" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_webcomics" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>]. How many is that, a hundred?? I question that more than a handful of them are more known than Legendary Frog. If Legendary Frog had been half as known as he is and made comics with the same themes as his animations, then he would DEFINATELY be on that list. Can anybody explain why this is fair? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 08:40, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>That list is VERY fickle and changes a lot every single week (in favour of new submissions), and LegendaryFrog actually holds the record of most movies in the top 50 at one time (<a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/ngmag/devspot/spotlight/20" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newgrounds.com/ngmag/devspot/spotlight/20" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>(. That said, I'm not saying the list is the basis for the inclusion, not at all, it has literalyl NOTHING to do with him. I am not saying Legendary Frog should be included because of quality, but because of notability. Also, could somebody PLEASE explain why we keep all the webcomics but delete this?

<li><b>Keep</b> Very well known. He's a well respected flash artist and his name has been able to make many a flash movie noteworthy. To exclude him would cause a large upset among his fan base.

<li>I agree, but there's a big difference between Ted Smith from Boise, and Legendary Frog who has tons of fans. He's well known in the online community. If he has fans dedicated enough to make this page, then there is no reason this article should be deleated. I agree that not everything deserves a Wikipedia entry, but Legendary Frog is well known enough, and talented enough to earn one.</li>

<p>Well another flash artist, Legendary Frog, has his own page, and hes made much less of an impact. Knox not only invented the genre of Flash Claymation, but has made dozens of klaymations and other films and has even made a feature length movie that has sold over 3000 copies, and is working on 3 more full-length films. Legendary frog did not invent a new genre of Flash cartoon, he hasnt made nearly as many films as Knox has and has never made anything close to a full-length movie. I believe that Knox is worthy of his own article if Legendary Frog is. --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeBlowfromKokomo_79c0.html" title="User:JoeBlowfromKokomo">JoeBlowfromKokomo</a> 05:30, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think if you were to provide verifiable evidence that this person "invented the genre of Flash Claymation", and then also establish that that were a notable feat, you would improve the chances of this article surviving AfD. --<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticBacon_4090.html" title="User:CrypticBacon">CrypticBacon</a> 06:16, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Also Knox has been viewed nearly twice as much on UGOplayer than Legendary Frog has. LF's movies has been viewed a total of 7,063,311 times, and Knox's movies has been viewed a total of 14,309,407, as of 9:57, 3/11/06. --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeBlowfromKokomo_79c0.html" title="User:JoeBlowfromKokomo">JoeBlowfromKokomo</a> 05:58, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Userfy</b>.

<p>thats not my point. i think both legendary frog <b>and</b> knox are notable. they're probably the two most important flash animators of all time, or at least in the top 5. i dont think either of them should be deleted. I mean, c'mon, theyve been viewed together about a total of 21,000,000 times on UGOplayer alone, and UGO is far less popular than Newgrounds. --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeBlowfromKokomo_79c0.html" title="User:JoeBlowfromKokomo">JoeBlowfromKokomo</a> 06:11, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd also like to point out that the numbers above mean little. Knox has many, many more animations than Frog, so logically has more hits. We are all quite aware that quantity does not equate to quality. To me though, the article reads like a grade school essay, and the personnel bit is rather superfluous, but he <b>is</b> notable in his field, and I would have suggested to keep. -<a href="../../../d/a/w/User%7EDawson_517d.html" title="User:Dawson">Dawson</a> 06:31, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I would not be opposed to someone else relisting this for AfD. I withdrew it for the reason that "since it's on IMDB it's notable enough for me", figuring that if someone's on IMDB then they are notable enough for Wikipedia (is that generally true or not?). However since I've already withdrawn my nomination I don't feel right reinstating it so soon. But you're right, this guy doesn't really seem that important. --<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticBacon_4090.html" title="User:CrypticBacon">CrypticBacon</a> 06:36, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I would endorse a relist (or do so myself) based, if nothing else, on the fact that the previous (or shall I say, "latest") page about this subject (Knox (animator)) was deleted barely a month ago, and I doubt that his notability has skyrocketed in such a short time. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 06:47, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I still think that he is important enough for his own page. Regardless of how many films he has altogether, 14 million people is still 14 million people. Plus, let me point this out:<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis%2C_Duke_of_Joyeuse" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis%2C_Duke_of_Joyeuse" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis%2C_Duke_of_Joyeuse</a><br />
No one is ever going to search for this guy. Nonetheless, he still has his own page. Even if you think that one obscure duke is important for, say, a report on dukes from that time period, then why not combine <b>him</b> to one giant article about French Dukes? But I know that people will search for Knox because he is popular. --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeBlowfromKokomo_79c0.html" title="User:JoeBlowfromKokomo">JoeBlowfromKokomo</a> 06:53, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He is popular at the moment, if theres anything I've learned in my time online it's that popularity wanes fast, and internet fads are quickly forgotten. The Duke above was probably popular in his time too...but as I asserted above, he is an artist whose works will endure as much as any painter or sculptor. Btw, I have a listing on IMDB too, but no one has written an article here about me yet, and if someone did, I'm sure it'd be up on AfD just as fast.&#160;;) -<a href="../../../d/a/w/User%7EDawson_517d.html" title="User:Dawson">Dawson</a> 07:10, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Arbitrary list of arbitrary entertainment medium containing an arbitrary theme selected arbitrarily (three items a list? four?). Also not sufficiently uncommon as to be encyclopaedic: many of Gilbert and Sullivan's <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patter_song.html" title="Patter song">patter songs</a> (indeed many patter songs in general) <i>contain</i> lists. Some <i>are</i> lists (e.g. KoKo's "List Song" in The Mikado). Seems to be original research in that there is no cited source to support the idea that lists are an unusual subject, or indeed to suppoort the categorisation of individal songs as "list songs". An encyclopaedic article on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_song.html" title="List song">list songs</a> would be good, a partial list of some songs which somebody thinks are list songs is not. KoKo's <i>List song</i> is a list song; is the <i>Modern major General</i> a list song? How about the <i>Policeman's lot</i>? A list of very few items (felons, burglars, costers) but undoubtedly a <i>list of examples of why the policeman's lot is not happy</i>, which might or might not qualify. Is <i>Ironic</i> a list song?

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm the original creator of said list. I did not know the previous list existed (browser game searches tend to be futile at best on wiki). I did find the category of BBGs, but only after creating the list. I decided, after consultation with another wiki member to keep it up and keep it "healthy". I agree it needs cleanup, and would've liked to take out all "external-linking" now that I see what it has led to. I cannot see what the previous list looked like but this list clearly fits the criteria to be a "valid" list since it is not just a collaberation of names and links. Also, cleanup would have been a more appropriate tag since now without the external links, it defeats all previous arguements cited for deletion on the previous deletion poll (wiki is not, no lists of links, etc.). -<a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoocats_a59f.html" title="User:Moocats">Moocats</a> 17:36, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A list of (allegedly) all South African laws. <b>Delete</b> as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an indiscriminate collection of (soon-to-be-outdated) information; such data is available at the relevant <a href="http://www.info.gov.za/documents/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.info.gov.za/documents/index.htm" rel="nofollow">government website</a>. Was de-prodded for the reasons that (a) at least some of these laws must be notable, (b) not every South African citizen has Internet access. To (a), one might reply: let's see the articles about these notable laws first; as far as I know we don't allow red-link lists. The answer to (b) is left as an exercise to the reader, but keep in mind that there are unlikely to be many <i>printed</i> versions of Wikipedia in South African libraries. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 20:48, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Quite possibly. I think that the Bible is more complex as a scholarly entity than any of us (most of us) give it credit. In htis case I think there should be some real thought into how the information is organised, in general it seems there is scope for Bible chapter articles, which my be very short mainly pointing to passage commentaries, which would probably be sub-sections of articles in many cases. E.G. Genealogy of Jesus#Matthean lineage In that case verse articles would be redirects. But we also have to think about usability, from the POV of a user who is given a verse reference. The user should see at least one text and some simple explanation with as few "clicks" as possible, and have more detailed analysis <i>and context</i> available easily. What's the best way to achieve this? <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_talktome_c24b.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough/talktome">Farmbrough</a></i> 16:48 <a href="../../../2/0/_/20_March_0a8d.html" title="20 March">20 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC).</dd>

<dd>I think we should have articles on topics (such as Genealogy of Jesus) and articles on chapters/books. If you need to link to the text you can link to wikisource/books where one can have plenty of translations and annotation. to the nth degree (effectively 1 click away). The usability can only go so far though, what version of 1 Kings 5:1 do you make? If it is a link from an article it could just as easily link to wiki(source|books) and the appropriate one. Should we turn the verse articles into disambig pages instead? Have a links to where the content is discussed as well as links to the verses themselves in wiki(source|books). <span class="user-sig user-Kotepho"><i>—kotepho <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_20.html" title="March 20">03-20</a> 17:08Z</small></i></span></dd>

<li>I'm fine with <b>keep</b>ing this at the moment, although I think it might perhaps be reorganised into a larger chunk at some point. I just don't see why some people are so vehemently against minor biblical topics, when Wikipedia is full of articles on minor topics with far less historical importance or cultural influence (all the pokemonistics, sports data etc.). Please don't confuse a detailed coverage of religious topics with religious bias. Any sufficiently complete treatment of the Bible, incorporating contemporary historical-critical biblical scholarship, is far more likely to be distasteful to the <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastriches</a> of the world than to secular or at least non-fundamentalist people. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 17:34, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thank you for joining wikipedia six days ago and expressing your thoughts, but judging from those links he's not notable. Other than a few books available used and from independent sellers it is clear his books aren't anything "notable." Nor has his notablitity been established.

<p>Delete - The portions of this page that refere to the S8G reactor should be deleted, as the information is classified 'Confidential - Restricted Data' by the United States Navy in an effort to protect our Silent Forces Afloat. There is no quarrel with the remainder of the content, as it is a very fascinating application of the basic principles of Science. There is no nead to use the S8G reactor as a specific example, since there are OTHER specific examples already described. By removing the sentence relating to the S8G reactor, we can help protect our military AND remove any legal, moral, or ethical concerns/debates/flamewars from occuring.

<li>Change: <b>Merge</b> I think even a full and fascinating account of the club is not quite what one expects to find in an encyclopaedia (except one of cricket), nor needs to. If and when the section on Old hill in the page on Amateur Cricket Clubs in England (or whatever title is chosen) gets inconveniently long, _then_ it would be great and easy to split it off. I agree that the information, since it is linked to a person article in WP now, is sufficient that it should not be lost to posterity. Thinking of a future user, as <a href="../../../j/a/k/Jakob_Nielsen_ea70.html" title="Jakob Nielsen">Jakob Nielsen</a> of <a href="http://alertbox.com" class="external free" title="http://alertbox.com" rel="nofollow">http://alertbox.com</a> would urge us to, I find it more likely that someone would want to read a page, even a longish page, on the aggregate than search for particular pages on several clubs. From the POV of improvement, I think it is likely that someone from a club that plays them, looking up his own club, would know something worth adding, than that that person would search out each of his club's past opponents and add what he knew to them. (I may be fantasising there, or perhaps I'm enunciating something that should be an rfc and WP policy - I'm assuming there isn't a WP policy on this already...) <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 16:02, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> According to <a href="http://www.italyworldclub.com/italian_frazioni/frazioni_ron-ror.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.italyworldclub.com/italian_frazioni/frazioni_ron-ror.htm" rel="nofollow">this list</a> of hamlets in Italy, there are <i>two</i> places called Ronche in Pordenone province, one in the municipality of Fontanafredda, the other in Sacile. It is not clear to me which one the article is supposed to be about. David Sneek 09:46, 12 March 2006 (UTC) (Oops, I overlooked <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDani_7C3_7b1d.html" title="User:Dani 7C3">Dani 7C3</a>'s comment above. But it seems to be the Ronche in Sacile, because that is the one on the ss13 <a href="http://www.viaggiando-sus.it/turismo_manifestazioni_vis.cfm?ID=1866" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.viaggiando-sus.it/turismo_manifestazioni_vis.cfm?ID=1866" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>.)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I live about 3km from Ronche in Sacile and 10 km from the one in Fontanafredda, and I've been to both. Also the one in the Fontanafredda municipality is on the SS13 so it is impossible to determine to which the article refers: having a bar, being surrounded by fields and having a small American community are features common to both and to dozens of other hamlets near Aviano AB.--<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDani_7C3_7b1d.html" title="User:Dani 7C3">Dani 7C3</a> 14:19, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>When editing on really small places, I've found it useful to combine them (eg <a href="../../../f/e/n/Fenton_Barns%2C_East_Fenton_and_West_Fenton_9113.html" title="Fenton Barns, East Fenton and West Fenton">Fenton Barns, East Fenton and West Fenton</a>) but only if a really small place is next to a slightly bigger place. I would have no problem with these being merged with larger places nearby but don't want to see them deleted just because nobody merged them. There must be some distinguishing features of the town, the names of bars, churches etc?

<li><b>Very Weak Keep</b>. A place can be small and still be interesting, perhaps even more so. However, I believe articles should prove their worth by providing content, which this fails to do. I think the line <i>"The small dirt roads in the near by fields and the fields themselves are great for walking and cycling. One can often find rabbits and other assorted wildlife in the fields,"</i> should be removed (wikipedia is not a tourism brochure), which already destroys 25% of the article. --<a href="../../../c/y/m/User%7ECymsdale_3ed9.html" title="User:Cymsdale">Cymsdal</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a> 15:26, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Also if we would turn this in a disambiguation page, then would make sense to create an article for every hamlets named Ronche?

<li><b>Comment</b>. In my comment above it wasn't my idea to suggest this should become a disambiguation page that links to four different Ronche articles; I just think it would be better if all of them are simply mentioned in this article. Useful information on the different Ronches could then go into the articles on the municipalities, as is done in the Italian wikipedia. (See Dani's comment).

<dd>I agree with David idea, in this page could be mentioned the four villages, further informations would be on the relative municipalities pages, in this article could be explained the meaning of the <a href="../../../t/o/p/Toponym.html" title="Toponym">toponym</a> Ronche.--<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDani_7C3_7b1d.html" title="User:Dani 7C3">Dani 7C3</a> 13:57, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>IMO places should only be grouped together if they are really tiny and geographically adjacent, rather than identically named. I've created a disambig page at <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronche_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Ronche (disambiguation)">Ronche (disambiguation)</a>. The <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronche.html" title="Ronche">Ronche</a> article could be moved to <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronche_%28Sacile%29_22f7.html" title="Ronche (Sacile)">Ronche (Sacile)</a> and the disambig updated accordingly if it comes through AfD. There are very clear precedents that any distinct settlement, especially a named village with its own festivals and industry (as opposed to a sub-district of a city, for example) is entitled to an entry. If no-one has the requisite knowledge to create pages on the other "Ronche"s , they can remain uncreated. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><b><font style="verdana" color="#990000">D</font><font color="#669900">e</font><font color="#990000">izio</font></b></a> 14:33, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Subject is a minor folk hero, article makes no real claim to be actually true, insofar as a folk hero cannot really be verified. He's sort of like 'Pecos Bill' for Victoria. My father used to tell stories about Metcard when we were kids, he's definitely 'real'. I think its inclusion here and lack of google hits is more a reason why it should stay. There was a minor children's book about Metcard in the late 60s-early 70s, which I've never been able to find. Actually stumbled across this entry while looking for information on it. In summary, he's fictitious - but that's the point. Article should definitely stay. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> User:220.239.221.121</small></li>

<li>Cardcaptor Stacey I am the owner of So Into Koda. SIK is not a dead site. If you read the article which a member of my staff wrote, it has moved to a new server so I have to claim back the 500 members I once had. I rather you didn't mock my title either, it's based of a song by Kumi Koda called So Into You. I don't really like you editing my article since you haven't even been there. I don't want this article to be deleted. It's only been up a few days! It going to expand if you give it the chance.</li>

<p>Subject of article appears not to exist as a serious, viable company, but is speculative in nature and produces no known goods.

<li><b>Follow Up</b> I have told Stude62 that I would give him information to where he can find out more about the company. I feel that he is being one sided and not open to the idea that there is Studebaker Motor Company Inc Licensed with NHTSA/DOT. He has not asked me for any of that informaiton. But I would Still be more than happy to give it to him. And I checked out their site today and there has been updates, So I feel that Stude62 is missleading about that. I could not find any miss spelled words in any of there press releases. <a href="../../../s/e/t/User_talk%7ESettinghawk_796f.html" title="User talk:Settinghawk">User_talk:Settinghawk</a> 17:36, 12 March

<li>Settinghawk, I find it interesting that you have been able to find any press information on the company, especially a release that appears as the AfD is posted. There are also simularities between your writting style and the writing style on the web page for the entity and its press releases (case changes, sentence structures, etc.)- do you have a personal interest in this "entity". If you do, you should disclose it. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStude62_1ae3.html" title="User:Stude62">Stude62</a> 03:45, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Follow Up 3</b> From what I do understand it is a legitimate startup. And that there has been a ton of research done. My tiff is that while trying to build a constructive page about the facts that I have gotten. I am told in so many words that I am stupid. I am trying to build a page about the company and be open minded and not closed minded and pre judgmental. Because just maybe they are coming out with vehicles. Have you every done research in how long it takes to design and engineer a vehicle. Not to mention all the testing that needs to be done as well. All I ask is that you be open minded , if you don’t like the page that I am working on building then just ignore it. Would you like if I went into one of your topics and deleted everything or put it up for review to be deleted? No you wouldn’t and I am not going to do that. Now Stude62 and I have been at it from just about my first day here a Wikipedia. and I feel this may also be his own way of getting sweet poetic justice! Because he just may not like me posting anything at all. This may or may not be so but it is how I feel. I do not claim to know every thing or be an expert either, but anyone who does claim to be an expert is only limiting intellectual growth of learning and discovering new things.--<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESettinghawk_10a9.html" title="User:Settinghawk">Settinghawk</a> 06:29, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am not sure you've internalised what people are telling you yet. Wikipedia's mission is to document what is already known about <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> entities. Founding a company that bends metal certainly is hard. But until it actually produces products, or until it has notoriety in the external press, it's not notable. Please read the links given about notability and think about it. "Just maybe" means it isn't yet notable.</li>
<li>You say "from what I understand"... Cite your sources, in the article. Why is it legit? Who said it was? When? See <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Read it and think about what it says.</li>
<li>User pages are given much wider latitude than articlespace pages. You might want to consider writing the article in userspace, and when you're done, using move to bring it to articlespace.</li>
<li>Please, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> here with regard to the actions of your fellow editors. Again, follow the <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> link and think about what it says. No one is saying you're "stupid", just that you haven't internalised how things are here. We all were new once, if you go back 2600 edits in my history you'll find me saying some of the same things you are... This article is about what seems to be a non notable outfit. That doesn't mean we're saying you're a bad person, or that Stude62 is out to get you. He's presumably working for the good of the encyclopedia, as are we all.</li>

<li>Are you talking about here? No one has intentionally changed the wording of anything you said that I am aware of, although I have reformatted some of it to make it fit with the way things are done in this type of discussion.

If I've inadvertantly deleted anything I would apologise, and happily put it back.

Stude62 had completelly deleted it. he did three back to back edits, then i went in and added, Studebaker Motor Company is "the modern 21st company" An Old Name A New Company , can see at, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Studebaker_Motor_Company&amp;oldid=43442247" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Studebaker_Motor_Company&amp;oldid=43442247" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Studebaker_Motor_Company&amp;oldid=43442247</a> then i went back and did a small edit on the word companines to company.

<li>I looked over the edit history and didn't see anything out of line. Remember, you <i>do not own</i> your article. It would have been nice if Stude62 had communicated his intentions on the article's discussion page but neither did you. Content disputes should be discussed on the discussion page. If you happen to be affiliated with the company, or think for any reason that the article <i>must</i> contain certain language, then you should bery carefully read the terms of the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Wikipedia%7EText_of_the_GNU_Free_Documentation_License_702a.html" title="Wikipedia:Text of the GNU Free Documentation License">Wikipedia:Text of the GNU Free Documentation License</a> because articles here can be edited by anyone, you have no right to have certain content included, and that means negative information could be added and you or the company would have no say about it.

<li>Wikipedia is a source for <b>verifiable</b> information about notable things. I have not been able to verify that SMC exists, or that "mobotics" exists; The Lexis/Nexis database of corporate information doesn't recognize "Studebaker Motor Company" and there have not even been any press releases put out that I can find. (It would be useful to provide the state in which SMC is registered and its official business name, so someone could check it out.) The fact that SMC is listed with NHTSA means nothing as far as I am concerned; it might just mean they make motorcyle brake pads, or that they plan <i>someday</i> to make cars. There are thousands of businesses for which <i>someday</i> never comes. SMC could be nothing more than a pyramid investment scam. At the present time, I have just as much verifiable information about that as you do that SMC will revolutionize the auto industry with "mobotics." When the company has been profiled in the Wall Street Journal, or the concept car reviewed by Road &amp; Track, then there will be the basis for an article.<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:46, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

As far as I can tell this is a legitimate business in a state of growth.Dracornix 05:42, 13 March 2006 (UTC)Dracornix Monday March 13 2006 12:42AM <small>User's first edit to Wikipedia <font color="green">+</font>+<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 06:08, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I agree with Thatcher - we need to refocus on the issue of <u>verification</u>. What exactly does the NTSB have to do with this Studebaker Motor Company? Do we know what state this venture is incorporated so the articles of incorporation can be verified? Does this enterprise have a street address or telephone listing? Who are the Corporate Officers? Does it have a product or prototype that has been shown to the public? Until these questions can be verified, the article doesn't seem to meet the standards of verifiably that Wikipedia promotes. <a href="../../../o/n/c/User%7EOnceBitten_67fa.html" title="User:OnceBitten">OnceBitten</a> 18:03, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am flattered you are asking ME but I am just some random schlub that likes to talk, not an admin or anything. But here's my guesses... A quick nose count (taking into account that those editors that turned up here just to express opinions about this one article and never contributed anything before this probably would be discounted in judging consensus) shows that it's likely that consensus will be to delete this article. Remember, I am not an admin, much less the closing admin... things could still change but sometime around 17 Mar at the same time as the start (5 days later) an admin will turn up and make the call, and close out the discussion. If deletion is the consensus, the admin will delete it. If no consensus, or keep, the admin will tag the talk page of the article with the result. In either case this discussion gets archived, with tags around it to show it's closed... If enough people support userify, the admin will, instead of deleting, userify the article to your namespace, assuming you indicate that's what you want too. (for the record if you so requested, I'd support such a move). For more details, read here: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Articles_for_deletion</a> and some of the pages it links (especially <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Guide to deletion</a> which is quite good... but not all of them! you can go quite deep there... don't follow EVERY link). Hope that helps. Remember, you could always userify it yourself in advance if you wanted to. For an article like this that would probably not result in it getting deleted (but something quite objectionable or obnoxious or divisive would not be protected from it... userspace still belongs to the project, it's just that you get a bit more latitude there) One last thought, whatever happens... don't take it personally. Wikipedia is about knowledge, not personalities. <font color="green">+</font>+<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 03:49, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Now that we've been through all of the discussions and and have finally gotten beyond the issue of verifiability, I have no problem with the content being taken over to Settinghawk's user page. However, I do think that there seems to be consensus on the issue that if and when "Studebaker Motor Company" reemerges as a legitimate article on Wikipedia that it needs to be written in a factual manner and referenced in a manner that allows its content to be verified. On a separate issue, however, I do invite Settinghawk to discuss with me about his claims that my efforts to have the article removed were in some way "personality based", which was never part of an agenda of mine relative to this AfD. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStude62_1ae3.html" title="User:Stude62">Stude62</a> 13:10, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No Delete</b> You sick little kiddies are honestly worse than the blammers on newgrounds. I also adore how you dress up your needs to destroy things in fancy little words to make it look like you have some level of intelligence. The person who put this up for "Blamming" as I'm now going to call it, showed the communicational capabilities of a bad artifical intelligence. That's not an insult either, that's genuinely how he talked. Do you know how frustrating it is to talk to a machine?</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly, what is it with immature, brazen children(despite often being in their 20s) and power on the internet? People love to ban, to delete, to destroy. I'm quite tired of it.</p>
<p>I very much doubt there's a flood of webcomics to the site, and there were multiple reasons, which, of course, you destruction-happy crowd completely ignored.</p>
<p>You're sad, and you need a better hobby.</p>
<p>Note that it's not even my comic, just one I read and made a couple of guest comics for once, but that's nothing to do with it as many other people did, it is not "Vanity" though I'm sure you'd like to think so, I have my own webcomic I haven't added. The reason I added this comic is because a network of boards know as the Sonic Hacking Community practically revered this comic as it's style of humour. Taking a look at old posts(archives) on Sonic the Hedgehog Area51, Sonic Cult, Sonic Classic. Those are very major websites. Looking for the posts of "dust hill guy" "dust hill resident" or "QVY" will find you them faster. It's true it didn't have many hits even then, but the humour from it itself spread rapidly to forum posts and to other users.</p>
<p>The author is clearly stated as being "Patrick May", and my name is "Kittie Rose", a female name! What the fuck? HOW can you be vain for other people? This just proves that most people here haven't even READ the article.</p>
<p>I wouldn't have submitted it if it was not in some way notable, which I believe it is. I think the rules are too strict here and should take into account these kind of scenarios. I'm also fascinated as to how the links can be almost all from dmoz directories, due to the comics previous popularity and that fact that much of the URLs come from it being posted on forums, and I have myself checked the webstats after it being posted most times. In the couple of years it's been around, it's gotten 7 thousand hits actually, not a lot but the comic was reposted a lot on forums.</p>
<p>But I won't let actual reason get in the way of the perverse human need to destroy.</p>
<p>If I was to ever give you any advice, stay away from Wikipedia, and stay away from Newgrounds. I considerred Wikipedia a prestigous resource, but now that I see some of the algae behind it(here and on the "Obesity" article) I am forced to rethink.</p>

If someone can provide a valid reason why people are so obsessive about deleting and destroying, then by all means they should. Otherwise, you're hiding behind the rule and don't have an argument. If people had at least taken the liberty to read the article, maybe i'd be a little less angry. Also, I consider "vanity" to be a personal attack since it's not my comic, I only did a couple of guest issues and that has nothing to do with me submitting it! Stupid accusation, regardless.
<dl>
<dd>I think all people who have taken part in this discussion <b>have</b> read the article. You talk of a "perverse will to destroy", apparently only because the majority of people here want this article to be deleted. I don't think that's enough evidence of a "perverse will to destroy". Quite often, an accusation like this means the accuser's feelings are hurt by his/her own precious little article being nominated for deletion. I, myself, have written articles about my former company (60 people employed, still active) and a web forum I participate in (330 members, still active). Both were nominated for deletion. I voted "keep" on both, and both were deleted. I accept the fact that they are simply not notable enough. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 20:04, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That rule we are hiding behind is <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and I don't think it's fair to say we don't have an argument for it. These guidelines do not come out of thin air, they evolve through community consensus over time. You've made a case for the article not being vanity, so I'll remove that item from my recommendation. However, I still am going to recommend delete on the basis of non-notability. --<a href="../../../c/y/m/User%7ECymsdale_3ed9.html" title="User:Cymsdale">Cymsdal</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a> 20:20, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If people read the article, why do they think I wrote it? And rules change over time. Just because they're there doesn't make them right.

<p><b>Delete</b>. This page is utter rubbish. The only source he cites is a legitimate history text, but he has misrepresented the chapter title. It is in fact "The Impossible Dream of Universal Empire, A.D. 532 to 602." There are also numerous factoids that put the accuracy of the whole article into question. The Holy Roman Empire, of course, never came anywhere near ruling the vast territories that the Roman Empire ruled. Also, "Catholic" does not mean "orthodox, as he claims, but "universal" (I've just verified this at One Look). His claim that the Russian tsar "arguably" inherited the right to the Roman throne is at best questionable, as is his claim that Napoleon set out to conquer Rome's old territory (I'm pretty sure Napoleaon took much of Germany and Poland, and tried to conquer Russia, which with the exception of the odd outpost in Germany were never Roman). I cannot believe that there is any legitimate history behind this article given the obvious errors and the misleading source reference. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelisi_9a88.html" title="User:Kelisi">Kelisi</a> 04:52, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep! The page CLEARLY states this concept is a THEORY. There are many THEORIES which have articles on Wikipedia (string theory, Marxist theory, etc.). Nowhere does this article purport the theory as fact.</b></p>
<p><br />
<b>The article does explain how the theory is BASED ON CERTAIN FACTS. Those facts can be readily checked on Wikipedia.</b></p>
<p><b>For example, the bit about Russian Czars trying to claim a tie to the Roman Empire is well established. The following is pasted from the Wikipedia entry on "Czar:"</b></p>
<p>The last Russian ruler formally styled Tsar, Peter the Great, at the peace of Nystad (November 1721), assumed the Byzantine styles of imperator (of Latin origin, somewhat exotic for the Eastern Orthodox world) and Autocrat, intended to mark his imperial dignity as the equal of the Roman Catholic Habsburg Emperor, as the 'third Rome' (after Byzantium; the Holy Roman Empire succeeding the original Rome in the Western Roman Empire).</p>
<p><b>Perhaps the above users have axes to grind? Just because they either (1) do not agree with this theory or (2) have not themselves heard of it, does NOT mean the theory ITSELF doesn't exist. And that is all the article reports on: the existence of a theory.</b></p>
<p>At any rate, I edited the page to take away some of the ramblings and inaccuracies, which I agree were humorous. I for one have heard of this general CONCEPT; perhaps the users above disagre with it bearing this name? Is there another name for this theory?</p>

<p><font color="#DD0000"><b>UPDATE</b></font> <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 8885860044</a> does exist. I apologize for the misleading information above. However, it was published in 1987, and is only held by 3 libraries. It is in Italian, and the title is <i>Progettare un parco&#160;: alcune idee per un parco ricreativo-tematico "made in Italy"</i> . Its subject category is <i>Amusement parks -- Italy -- Designs and plans</i>. I don't know if this affects notability or verifiability. Curiously, the book's publisher has no other listings in Worldcat, Firstsearch or Books in Print. Lexis/Nexis has a single mention as a maker of LaserTag equipment in an article about a new LaserTag arena in Louisiana. Factiva finds that VEQTOR exhibited at the 2003 IAAPA trade show. ProQuest finds a 1996 article about a LaserTag installation in Iceland, and a 1998 press release about a LaserTag facility in New Delhi. (Those by the way are the <i>only</i> hits in Factiva and Proquest, not a selected subset.) Various other databases find nothing. I change my vote from delete to <b>No vote</b>.

<dd>You'll notice I didn't vote keep. One problem is that the online Global Books in Print obviously doesn't go back far enough in its out-of-print listings. Maybe other searches suffer similarly; if the company was bigger in the 80's and early 90's there might not be a lot in online sources. Certainly the lack of current information could mean they are no longer notable, and certainly hampers verifiability. Having made the mistake about the existence of the book, I wanted to be extra careful and make sure I didn't miss anything else, so I went farther in depth than I have before.<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 03:45, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Mike, what elements of the article would you like rewritten? Do you have any other known uses of VEQTOR as a definition of clarification? Most users of wikipeida understand that wikipedia is a compendium of facts and descriptions related to words and concepts, spanning millions of subjects, old new and even theoretical speculation - AND no matter how obscure! What FACTS within this article need to be changed, enhanced, clarified? What items contained within this article are 'SPAM'? Over time I guess that many people will seek to add accurate modifications to this article - interested parties describe there experiences and associations with the subjects this article contains. Mike not all subjects on wikipedia are of interest to you (nor to me) but that does not mean that they are not of interest to others. I hope all voters on this subject will present POSITIVE criticism like Bucketsofg has demonstrated - wikipedians must use an honorable approach suggesting positive actions, rather than unsupported bias. --VEQTOR 19:11, 15 March 2006 (UTC)----

<dd>So 'OscartheCat', I believe wikipedia is to contain facts not assumptions or suppositions. Both of your comments are just that - factless. I am the author of this article and you have given me no guide as to what you want to see added or deleted to improve this article. Without your positive input the goal of wikipedia is dead. YES, I have e-mailed a few collegues around the world and introduced them to wikipedia - some have take the time to try and learn to use wikipedia and I commend them. The fact is that most people of the world and casual internet users do NOT use, or even know about, wikipedia. The fact is I am not faking the vote.--VEQTOR 08:38, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Wes Brown is related to a number of semi-notable surfing documentary filmmakers, but is not himself notable. Article asserts only one movie and neither that movie, nor this person, are in IMDB.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> He is on IMDB. The site has errors on his entry though (many dupes). The multiple Wes Browns listed as working on films such as Endless Summer Revisited, Step Into Liquid, and Dust to Glory are the same Wes Brown as discussed here.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I created this because of his notability in continuing the Brown family legacy in making surf movies. Sure he only has the single movie but all filmmakers start with a single movie. I doubt it will be his last.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have not been given the opportunity to flesh out the article yet is why it is in such a rough state. I had added Wes To his father Dana's entry and it was promptly removed for redirecting to the wrong location (A football player). I created a rough entry for Wes Brown so that link would redirect to the proper person and not be deleted. Now this entry is marked for deletion before I even have a chance to clean it up. I don't take that personal but I do find it rather annoying time is not given to flesh something out before it is judged.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However go ahead and delete it cuz I no longer care and I'm not going to put up a fuss. I now feel I would be better off just merging the three Brown family entry's (Bruce Brown, Dana, Brown, and Wes Brown). --Generalleoff 07:46, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>keep</b>. I believe we consider schools notable (if this is a false statement, someone can strike my vote). We should apply the same approach to youth orchestras, whose principal mission is education of young musicians and not musical performance for audiences. Hence lack of CD's, etc., is to be expected.
