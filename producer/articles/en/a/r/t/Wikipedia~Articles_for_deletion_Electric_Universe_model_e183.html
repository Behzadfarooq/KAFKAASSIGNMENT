<p><b>New rationale for deletion</b>: As there seems to have been some confusion as to what valid criteria for deletion are, I think it only appropriate to lay out some legitimate reasons the article should be deleted that are not given in the initial nomination:</p>
<ol>
<li>While some of the article's contents deserve to be in Wikipedia, the attempted consolidation of a wide range of concepts from normal astrophysics to crank science is plainly <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>. There is no single "Electric universe model" that exists. Rather there are a lot of ideas about electricity in the universe that the article claims to be about.</li>
<li>There is a book called "The Electric Universe" that was published and arguably could have a page in Wikipedia. But this is not a page about this book.</li>
<li>Nor is this a page about <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">plasma cosmology</a> or the various Electric star ideas of <a href="../../../v/e/l/Velikovsky.html" title="Velikovsky">Velikovsky</a>. Instead it is a clearinghouse of these and other pretty much unrelated topics -- a disambiguation page that was made up.</li>
<li>The page is basically a <a href="../../../p/o/v/Wikipedia%7EPOV_fork_3de8.html" title="Wikipedia:POV fork">POV fork</a> that organizes information culled from the internet to push an agenda of attacking <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_consensus.html" title="Scientific consensus">mainstream science</a> while keeping a lot of uncontroversial material that is unrelated to the agenda (a type of <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignoratio_elenchi.html" title="Ignoratio elenchi">Ignoratio elenchi</a>)</li>
<li>There is precendent for deleting such original research articles. See, for example <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Creation_anthropology_c68b.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Creation anthropology">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Creation anthropology</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Arguments about whether the idea is <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>, whether this is the "cutting edge", or whether the present <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_paradigm.html" title="Scientific paradigm">paradigms</a> are wrong should have no bearing on whether any article is in an encyclopedia or not. We're here to describe ideas that exist, not to judge them. Individuals' feelings about a particular subject are irrelevent. That's the essence of <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> as I see it.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>As the author of the article, I feel I should respond to the New Rationale, corresponding to the numbered points above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>As far as I know, while I have included "normal" astrophysics, I have not included any crank science. Sure some consider Velikovsky a crank, but all the article mentions is that he believed electromagnetic forces were more significant in the universe, as did Birkeland, Juergens, and others.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Whether there is or isn't crank science included is beside the point. The problem is that the article is original research and a new conglomeration. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a></dd>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The point is that while there may be justification for the book to have a page, the "model", being something that doesn't exist except in the mind of the author, doesn't have any justification for a page. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 21:27, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The page is very much about plasma cosmology since it is the foundation of the Electric Universe model, in the same way that the Big Bang theory is "about" astronomy. Velikovsky never had an electric star theory, though Ralph Jeurgens did; it was based on the astrophysics of Hannes Alfv√©n, which makes it a directly related topic, as are all the others.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is not a correct argument as pointed out by Joke on the plasma cosmology page, serious advocates of plasma cosmology do not have any relationship or hold to the ideas of Velikobsky and electric star proponents. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 21:27, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The article does not attack mainstream science, in the same way that the Big Bang theory page does not "attack" religous, or non-standard cosmological points of view. Indeed, the article criiticises no-one, and no other theories.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The design of the article is to POV fork from legitimate scientific and pseudoscientific articles. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 21:27, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>However, if the article is considered to fall too closely into "orginal research" or "pet theories", then it goes. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIantresman_3a2c.html" title="User:Iantresman">Ian Tresman</a> 13 July 2005 19:00 (GMT)</li>

<p>A slightly hesitant nomination. The article admits it is a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protoscience.html" title="Protoscience">protoscience</a>, I am just asking for opions as to how far it ventures towards <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I am the author of this article. I have added the Controversial boilerplate to the Discussion page. I would suggest that although the article may be considered controversial, and you may not agree with its position, this does not necessarily make it pseudoscience. Please check the article for its interest, and whether it is well constructed, and presents a good case. Arguably, all new ideas can be considered pseudoscience until they are more fully evaluated and peer reviewed. Please don't throw the baby out with the bath-water, as we say in the UK. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIantresman_3a2c.html" title="User:Iantresman">Ian Tresman</a> 9 July 2005 07:18 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Yes of course this is going to be a controversial topic. Let it be marked as "disputed" if necessary. I see great value to readers in the article: the recent Deep Impact mission to Tempel 1, which received over <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/space/07/05/deep.impact.ap/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/space/07/05/deep.impact.ap/index.html" rel="nofollow">1 billion hits on the NASA web site</a>, proved the interest of people in science at the "edge" of discoveries. I think Wikipedia is doing a great job to provide people with both "established" knowledge and "emerging" knowledge. I have often learn't more about a topic by reading the lively discussion page than by reading the article itself, so even if the "debate" is moved to the discussion page, the readers can still benefit -- --<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBongani_809b.html" title="User:Bongani">Bongani</a> 9 July 2005 10:22 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Joshua it is only 12 days old! As for <i>"facts, ideas and internet web sites"</i> - well pretty much every Wikipedia article has those, and they aren't illegal. I do agree though with the gist of your comment that the article has a long way to go before it could be called "comprehensive" or "high quality", but if it gets deleted, it will never be given that chance.

<li>OK - I understand the reasoning.

And I am not a sock puppet.

I did notice that your edits were spread out, but just occasionally an account is compromised (or a user goes off the rails). Seeing as your vote is evidently in good-faith and the rest of the VfD does not seem to be overflowing with sock/meat puppets, I imagine (but don't promise ‚Äî that's for the closing admin and there is some funny stuff going on at the bottom of the page) that your vote will be counted along with the rest. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 18:29, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. So far I haven't seen a single argument why this article should be deleted?! There is no Wikipedia policy to limit articles to (mainstream) science.

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. Useless psuedoscience: <i>the Sun and stars are powered by an external electric current</i>... is nonsense. Also non-notable (try google): this is essentially someones pet theory they are pushing. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M.

<ul>
<li>I did try google, and I'm getting &gt;50k results for "electric universe". The question remains how many of those are related, "electric universe model" only gives 500 results, furthermore Google results aren't perfect for determining notability. (If someone has further insights regarding notability, I'd be very interested in them?if the guy turns out to be the only one interested in this I will change my vote.) Useless pseudoscience (not that I necessarily disagree!) is not a reason for VfD, unless the article is total nonsense/gibberish which it is not. It is someone pushing his pet theory, but that, too, isn't a reason for deletion as far as I am aware.--<a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoritz_f530.html" title="User:Moritz">Moritz</a> 9 July 2005 11:49 (UTC)

<li>Hi Moritz - if you do a search for <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22electric+universe%22+%2B+plasma" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22electric+universe%22+%2B+plasma" rel="nofollow"><i>"'electric universe' + plasma"</i></a> you get 6,240 results (not sure how to find out how many of those are unique - <i>anyone?</i>) What this means to me is not that the model is gospel truth, but just that it is relevant to be offering it as an article on Wikipedia from the perspective of reader interest. --<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBongani_809b.html" title="User:Bongani">Bongani</a> 19:51, 9 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

I've read this. This is a mishmash of unconnected observations and extrapolations from long-outdated hypotheses (Birkeland was dead by the time fusion was discovered, wasn't he?), leading to unwarranted conclusions and largely-<a href="../../../f/a/l/Falsifiability.html" title="Falsifiability">unfalsifiable</a> claims - and citing <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immanuel_Velikovsky_1537.html" title="Immanuel Velikovsky">Immanuel Velikovsky</a>, even if only as an inspiration, is <i>never</i> a good thing. Specifying that "(they) would not necessarily have endorsed the EUModel themselves" is a nice touch, though - plausible deniability. Science likes new ideas. Science <i>loves</i> new ideas. And finding a hidden connection between two observations which had previously been thought completely unrelated is always <i>really</i> cool. But here, there's.... nothing. Yes, electricity is important in the universe, but this isn't really <i>saying</i> anything. <b>Delete</b><a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 9 July 2005 14:03 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> A few centuries ago, most of the statements of today's science, as well as their authors' heads, would have been granted a Strong Delete, for the simple reason that they attempted to understand questions unanswered by the paradigm of those times. There are questions - many questions - which today's science cannot answer, and it is reasonable to assume that some of the reasons lie in the paradigms which underlie it. The concept of an electric universe, which I have looked into for quite a while, is a truly scientific theory in that it asks the kind of questions that other scientific views (those views which happen to dominate the trends of our century) are paradigmatically blind to. I see Wikipedia as the true Encyclopedia (Diderot's, that is) of our time; "mutatis mutandis", I do not think that it is Wikipedia's role in history to inflict on Ian Tresman what was inflicted on Galileo -- 83.94.159.146 9 July 2005 14:47 (UTC)

It's not that he said "the Earth goes around the Sun", it's that he said "the Earth goes around the Sun, and the Pope (who is paying for all this) is an idiot". Galileo's problem wasn't that he was right, it was that he was an asshole. Even more important, though, he <i>was</i> right. Modern science is always willing to accept a new idea <i>if there's a compelling reason to do so</i>. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 9 July 2005 16:33 (UTC)

<li>I take exception to that characterization. Some would say that Urban VIII was horribly thin-skinned to have taken Galileo's writings so personally, and that, in any case, subjecting a once-close friend to the Inquisition is inexcusable. And Galileo was correct in asserting that he was entitled, by prior decree, to teach whatever <i>hypotheticals</i> he wished. The 1994 apology from <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Paul_II_18b2.html" title="John Paul II">John Paul II</a> was not merely an admission of the scientific truth of Galileo's work, but also a recognition that his prosecution was unjust under <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_law.html" title="Canon law">canon law</a> of the time. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 06:31, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As an example, one can find more articles relating to Electric Universe topics in the journals of plasma physics, than in the journals of cosmoslogy or astrophysics, where one would assume they would be extremely relevant. I believe this is due to the fact that there are some very powerful scientists with a vested interest in protecting the theories which they themselves have contributed to building up. And these people are exactly those who typically form a peer review board. People like <a href="http://www.hydro.com/en/about/history/1900_1917/1910.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hydro.com/en/about/history/1900_1917/1910.html" rel="nofollow">Kristian Birkeland</a> and <a href="http://www.haltonarp.com" class="external text" title="http://www.haltonarp.com" rel="nofollow">Halton Arp</a> are often viewed as heretics by cosmologists that perhaps find electrical forces an unwelcome element in their elegant equations.</dd>

<dd>Scientists <i>will</i>, and <i>do</i>, admit that their entire theoretical framework has been based on a flawed premise <i><b>if you show them a good reason</b></i>. There's a story about an old scientist attending a conference, listening to a speaker, and then approaching the man afterwards and saying "Thank you! I have been wrong these past twenty years!" To quote Carl Sagan, "In science it often happens that scientists say, 'You know, that's a really good argument; my position is mistaken,' and then they actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again. They really do it. It doesn't happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful. But it happens every day. I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion." Give us a <b>good</b> reason to accept the Electric Universe model, and <i>then</i> we'll see. Also, "very powerful scientists"? What planet are you living on? And <i>"heretics"</i>? Do you think people are going to get burned at the stake for this?

Wegener perhaps hadn't been able to postulate a workable mechanism, but the experts of the time were more than happy, often through vehement ridicule of Wegner, to throw the baby (idea of continental drift) out with the bathwater (lack of a workable mechanism) instead of taking the time to consider the matter with any seriousness, delaying the paradigm shift until Vine and Matthews landmark 1963 paper unleashed the floodgates.</dd>

<dd>And you know what?

The mere fact that the maps fit together nicely <i>wasn't enough</i>. He later turned out to be correct, a mechanism was suggested for how it could happen, various other consequences were predicted which were tested and proven right, and once <i>those'</i> things were done, Wegner was vindicated. And remember - just because Wegner was mocked, and later turned out to be right, <i><b>that doesn't mean that other people who are mocked will turn out to be right also</b></i>. 17:47, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

(b) Wikipedia Articles are not peer reviewed submissions, they do not even present a case. They are merely an overview of the subject, including how viewpoints may have <i>rightly</i> or <i>wrongly</i> come about. (c) That people have considered an Electric Universe (in various forms) is clear from the historic references provided, from Birkeland onwards. Again it does not matter whether any of these people were right or wrong. What is important, is to provide an accurate record of the whos and whys. (d) The Electric Universe is distinct from Plasma Cosmology in that it (i) pre-dates it (ii) suggests more radical proposals, eg. electric stars, (iii) Has interdisciplinary connections with ancient history and other sciences. (e) I have yet to add any material explaining the more radical aspects of the Electric Universe; everything else is standard astrophysics. <b>To summarise</b>: you don't have to like the article, but surely that is not reason to suppress it.<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIantresman_3a2c.html" title="User:Iantresman">Ian Tresman</a> 11 July 2005 11:33 (GMT)</li>

<dd>The above comment says it all for the rationale as to why this article should be deleted. "That people have considered the Electric Universe" doesn't make sense as an argument. People "consider" a lot of things. and it isn't suprising that they consider electricity and the universe together. That does not mean that there is such a thing as the "Electric Universe model". See, for example, the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Creation_anthropology_c68b.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Creation anthropology">VfD on creation anthropology</a>. This article was deleted because the author developed it as an amalgamation project from a number of different people who "considered" creationism and anthropology. The same standard should be applied here. This is an article that was developed as a clearinghouse of a whole slew of ideas that relate "electricity" and the universe. Many are unrelated to each other. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 15:41, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Judging from comments here I should probably begin by saying I am a "total newcomer" - I'm also an undergraduate physics student, so my grasp of these fields is not large. However, I think that this artice should stay on Wikipedia for a number of reasons.
<ul>
<li>Firstly, even though this stuff does not have the necessary recognition to avoid the "original research" flag, I feel that both the age of the theory, and the considerable body of seemingly scientific research that relates to it, should preclude it from this rule. The "Electric Universe" model represents a collection of ideas being developed by a number of people from different backgrounds over many years. I feel that the spread of the work saves it from being original research in the sense that is intended by Wikipedia's reviewing policies.</li>
<li>Secondly, although the "model" may be pseudo-scientific in it's overall structure it seems to contain in it much that is scientific, and I would tend to agree that its "pseudo-" stems from its "proto-".</li>
<li>As to positive reasons to keep it:
<ul>
<li>The electric universe ideas represent a compelling counter voice in an area of science where the accepted theory stands largely alone. To add to this, the area of science is one which is significantly unfalsifiable. This combination is a very unhealthy position for a science to be in, and we should welcome opposing ideas simply for the sake of scientific integrity. In this vein, electric universe is a good candidate simply because it is so different from the accepted model - even if it turns out to be complete nonsense, it's nonsensical richness may inspire newer better theories. Someone should remember dissident voices such as these, and I think Wikipedia should be that someone.</li>
<li>The model is also compelling because it <b>does</b> exhibit worthwhile traits: it focuses on the problems of the accepted theories, and also seeks balance and revision - the Newtonian hegemony in cosmology should make us uncomfortable. A cosmos governed by mechanics alone does seem primitive; simplity is not always a good thing but may indicate that we have ignored to much detail.</li>
<li>Finally, there is a quiet revolution going on in physics which I feel may disturb the very foundations of many theories. As we come to understand non-equilibrium dynamics more and more, and we begin to acept that large effects can have small causes I think we may find that we have been looking at many problems in entirely the wrong way. Our current ideas have as their ancestors two body problems, analytical systems. But the universe is vast and contains innumerable components, to look only on the small scale and fail to appreciate the entirety of the system could be disastrous - what I like most about the electric model is it tries to engage the universe wholistically, rather than by reductionism, and is itself based in a non-equilibrium science (electric plasmas).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'm not saying keep it because I like it. I'm saying keep it because it represents <b>worthwhile</b> counter-voice to an entrenched and often conservative orthodoxy.-Hayimd 18:16, 11 July 2005 (UTC) &lt;-- user's first edit is this VfD.</li>

<dd><i>Firstly, even though this stuff does not have the necessary recognition to avoid the "original research" flag, I feel that both the age of the theory, and the considerable body of seemingly scientific research that relates to it, should preclude it from this rule.</i></dd>
<dd>The article makes it seem as though the theory is old simply because it refers to well-respected scientists who happened to do research in plasma physics. Birkeland, Spitzer and Langmuir did not advocate for an "electric universe" in the sense implied in the article, notwithstanding a quote where Birkeland muses about the possibility of electrical stars. The current theory of stellar fusion is more a part of their legacy.</dd>
<dd>I would vote to keep the article if it were to be an article about a historically interesting, discredited and disowned theory of Velikovsky. As it is, it is more of a catalog of electromagnetic phenomena in the universe, many of which are widely agreed on by mainstream physicists, and no description, except in the introduction, of how the electric universe "theory" differs from mainstream physics. I think that is because there is no theory, other than the primitive one advocated by Velikovsky and his acolytes. The rest is mainstream physics or <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">plasma cosmology</a> is at least a genuine alternative cosmology, albeit one that is not generally seen as coherent or well-supported. ‚Äì<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke137</a> 19:00, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> -- we should keep the parts of the article that are relevent to Velikovsky with the Velikovsky nonsense but "Electric Universe model" is an inappropriate title for a hodgepodge internet collection of a wide range of disparate ideas that represent, for the most part, <b>original research</b>. The "Electric Universe" is advocated by a large number of nonscientists and there are a number of scientists listed in the article itself which do not actually believe that Velikovsky is worth anything (see <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">plasma cosmology</a> for example). Where there is new information, it can be included in other articles. If I recall correctly there was a book entitled "The Electric Universe". We should make a page about that book but this page that is trying to be a clearinghouse needs to be deleted because, frankly, there is <b>no such thing</b> as an "electric universe model". It's a neologism invented by some very wacko and very fringe antiscientists. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 22:42, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As space probes give us more and more information, we are learning that the gravity only model can't explain all that we are seeing,and that electricity, magnetism and plasma play more of a role in space than we previously thought.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>: Assuming there is at least some scientific foundation, an article on a new theoretical model would be great. But I can't find anything original except a qualitative suggestion that the role of electro-magnetism has been underestimated (it certainly has <b>not</b> been ignored).

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> This seems to be a bunch of disorganized rambling about a fairly well researched field of study. Perhaps it can be cleaned up and turned into an article about the pseudoscience, but as it stands I tend to agree with the assertion that it's a "neologism invented by some very wacko and very fringe antiscientists".

<dd>I have dealt quite a bit with people who advocate various ends of plasma cosmology in my work with cosmology. There are a few in the fringes of this group who are so far out there that anything that sounds like plasma cosmology gets included in the Electric Universe including legitimate research and fanciful meanderings of Velikovsky. As I have said, the Electric Universe itself is a book and one that basically follows the same line as this page (that is to attack mainstream cosmology), but this is not an "Electric Universe model" by any strech of the imagination -- it's only a book. Nevertheless, there are those people who follow this line of pseudoscience rather closely and do have the deliberate intention of attacking physical cosmology for whatever reason (mostly because they hate the Big Bang model). The content of the article speaks to this motivation as it states very radical conclusions from some very mundane observations and some very strung-out descriptors of Velikovsky, etc. to tie the whole thing together. The article is written from the perspective of a person from this internet community of "Big Bang skeptics" who likes to think that if they can attack from as many "points of view" as possible, it will lend credence to their ideas. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 21:12, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
