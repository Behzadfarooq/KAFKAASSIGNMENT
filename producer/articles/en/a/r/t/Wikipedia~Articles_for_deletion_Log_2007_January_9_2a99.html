<li><b>Reanme not delete</b> I'm the orignal author of this. First I would like it renamed to 'ChessDB - a free open-source chess database'. Of the 500+ Google entries, few have anything to do with this open-source project. There is a domain chessdb.com, which is not related to this at all. The comment about 'advertising a project' is a bit inaccurate, as this is totally free and open-source. As for it being just another chess program, there are very few open-source chess databases. This is a fork from Scid, on which development stops years ago. Yes there are thosands of chess programs, but this is not typical at all. It is not designed to play chess with for a start. As for it not being verifiable, the source code can be downloaded free or a windows installer can be downloaded free. I thought the external links were useful, but take the point particlaurly about the mailing list one. Could it be renamed as I request and give me a few days to get it into shape before revisiting this deleltion process?

<li><b>Comment</b> Please see the deletion <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#You_may_edit_the_article_during_the_discussion" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">guide</a> for guidelines on renaming and editing while this runs. Basically, feel free to get it into shape, don't rename without reading the guide. This will probably run for 5 days (unless the result is clear earlier). Improving the article may have an impact here, but your modifications may be deleted if the result is negative. As a scid user, I am aware of ChessDB. I don't know if it meets <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> - is ChessDB (not scid) included in major distributions such as Debian, Fedora, or NetBSD? Are there non-trivial reviews, guides, etc in publications written by independent parties (chess magazines, etc)? It is essential that <i>independent</i> sources write about the program. The fork is really quite recent, so it is possible that it has not yet achieved sufficient notability.

<li>A random comment: "ChessDB - a free open-source chess database" is an inappropriate article title; we don't put content-based specifiers in the title unless they're necessary for disambiguation (see <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Naming conventions</a>).

<li><b>You might as well delete it now</b> Clearly this is not going to be in a Debian release yet, which a couple seems to think sets some level of acceptance, since it under a month old. It might as well be deleted now. I'm sure it will make it into Debian at some point, as one of my other projects <a href="http://atlc.sourceforge.net/" class="external text" title="http://atlc.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">atlc</a> has made it into both Debian and NetBSD dostros without any input from me. That package is far more specialist and technical in nature, but have been around a long time. ChessDB has had over 800 downloads in under a month, so I believe it proabably will get there. But given the criteria, it might as well be deleted now to save wear on anyones keyboards. Drkirkby 18:32, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think I agree with you regarding the Lulu.com bookstore; It's certainly the strongest lead to notability here. However, the third-party citations you added to the article aren't really that strong. The Comixpedia reference was based off of the Wikipedia article and the Web Comics List is more of an entry in a directory than anything else. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradBeattie_1142.html" title="User:BradBeattie">Brad Beattie</a> <small><a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBradBeattie_69e6.html" title="User talk:BradBeattie">(talk)</a></small> 01:29, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>None of these can be considered <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Comixpedia is a Wikipedia mirror.

<li><b>Delete</b> Lulu.com is essentially a print on demand website, meaning that books produced by it cannot be included as a third party distributor. Comixpedia is a wiki and therefor unusable as a reference and The Webcomic List is free to join and not necessarily third party.

<li><s><b>Keep</b> on the basis that many other webcomics with articles are less notable than Misfile, and these are not listed as AfD. It seems as though Misfile has been singled out for no apparent reason.86.3.139.101 14:08, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</s><b>Comment</b> Fair points made. I think maybe the notability definitions for webcomics should be carefully reconsidered (although this is not the place to discuss that) - due to the media of webcomics, book sales are often low and thus do not attract publishers except in the case of very popular webcomics, and there are far fewer awards and notable reviewer/commentators of webcomics as compared with print comics. Perhaps the total readership of comic, or the professional status of the artist/writer should also be considered? 86.3.139.101 15:26, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. This argument has been used before in other AFDs. How would we sort all the comics by notability to ensure that we nominate the <i>least</i> notable first? Considering that such a task would be impossible, it's best to just look at what we have and see what meets our criteria and what doesn't. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradBeattie_1142.html" title="User:BradBeattie">Brad Beattie</a> <small><a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBradBeattie_69e6.html" title="User talk:BradBeattie">(talk)</a></small> 16:31, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Yours is a common objection -- "that's in here, why not this?" The answer is that Wikipedia is big, and the AFD attention window is small, and something like a spotlight. <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">Inclusion is not notability</a>, because another article you find may also in fact violate guidelines. Since policies and guidelines have gotten stricter over time (and because "no consensus" defaults to "keep"), it is also possible that an article previously "passed" AFD but would not pass today. Ultimately, webcomics are all struggling uphill against <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and really should be exceptionally notable in the webcomic world to have an article. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 18:25, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>: regarding the first <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criterion, verifying this comic's notability seems hard. The only claim to fame mutually exclusive of the other two criteria is a certain controversy that arose from the satire of the Jewish use of "G-d". Apparently "a member of the community wrote a complaining letter to the editorial staff of the Brown Daily Herald", and I would not consider a letter from a member of the community a non-trivial published work. This web comic has not won any notable awards, and finally, the medium through which this content has been distributed (the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown_Daily_Herald_6522.html" title="Brown Daily Herald">Brown Daily Herald</a>) is not exactly "well known." <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracenotes_686d.html" title="User:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">Grace</font><font color="#000">notes</font></a><sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGracenotes_98ea.html" title="User talk:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">T</font></a></sup> § 00:57, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> We'd be the only <i>encyclopaedic</i> source that went into this level of detail. I would expect some (limited) material on testing results to appear in the season articles in the period before the season starts, I would also expect that to be edited down leaving only the most significant points as the season progresses, as most of it will prove to be irrelevant. By the end of the season you might see only a comment that 'Despite topping pre-season testing, the Banger Racing Team finished last in every race'. <a href="../../../4/u/1/User%7E4u1e.html" title="User:4u1e">4u1e</a> 08:25, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>So what if we're the "only <i>encyclopaedic</i> source that went into this level of detail"? We can outdo our rivals can't we? --<a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadnessinshorts_0c7d.html" title="User:Madnessinshorts">Madnessinshorts</a> 21:44, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, but we can't include everything. My comment was meant more as a guide to where we stop, not an indication that we shouldn't be better - of course we should!&#160;;) I suppose 'notability' is really the point, but a good first indicator on notability might be what other encyclopaedic motorsport sources include. Motorsport articles on Wikipedia already go into as much/more detail than specialist racing sources on some topics. 'Normal' encyclopedias wouldn't even include many of them, or only in much, much briefer form. Of course any relevant points from testing should appear in the appropriate season article, but it's not likely to need to take up much space. <a href="../../../4/u/1/User%7E4u1e.html" title="User:4u1e">4u1e</a> 16:09, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Without starships, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> would just be people emoting at each other. But after forty years of TV and cartoon TV and movies and hundreds of books and fan magazines and conventions, there's only one starship from that series that is notable enough to be recognized by the general public: the <i>USS Enterprise</i>. I know the Gundam stuff is relatively big-name compared to most anime, but it's no Star Trek or Pokemon, is it? Why should non-fans be convinced that any Gundam fighting suit, let alone every one, is notable enough to pass general WP standards, just because the series is? <b>Merge</b> into one list per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>.

<ul>
<li>We seem to "have different standards for different fandoms" because of the general standard that more widely noted topics, those with more cultural influence, should be covered in more detail. I don't think every one of the ships in that category merits its own article in WP, but some do, simply because they've been featured in multiple third-party independent verifiable sources, not just fan-fiction, fan-obsessive-detail-suit-specs, and corporate promotional tie-ins with other products. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 05:19, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> I think that it would be useful as a list of all the minor Gundams, people often come to Wikipedia to find such things that they couldn't otherwise find all together in one place, and "cruft" or not, since there's at least the source of the TV show, I don't see why it would hurt to have one list of these. <a href="../../../j/0/l/User%7EJ0lt_C0la_0b17.html" title="User:J0lt C0la">J0lt C0la</a> 12:58, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I came here from the relevant AfD for the figurehead RX-78 page - this particular AfD is made under even worse accusations than the former was. This is almost as mind-numbing as the deletion of hundreds of Soviet-era images used under the fair use rationale because a Russian court made a retroactive decision. Infact, I would go so far as to say that this is worse, because in that instance there was at least a tiny chance of Wikipedia being in violation of fair use laws and observances - this here is downright article barbarism. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalikCarr_1188.html" title="User:MalikCarr">MalikCarr</a> 11:28, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Just because it's fictional and you're not a fan doesn't make it non-notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> to the last few strong keepers. <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> makes it clear that minor characters, places, and concepts should be merged into a list.

If you can show me that some other mobile suits are significant within the series, I'd consider keeping them. But you can't have 100 articles about 100 mobile suits and tell me that every single one is critical to the series. Someone who actually knows about Gundam needs to explain which ones are major, and which ones are minor. The best place to explain that is in the articles themselves.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Second, all this article is right now is four lines of text and a list of specs, all unsourced. (Those detailed specs aren't necessary for every single mobile suit, btw.). How often does this mobile suit appear in Gundam? Where is it established that it was "built by Neo Zeon during the First Neo Zeon war."? How do you know it has "a set of shields that could be flipped"? If you can answer some of these questions, feel free to edit the article and improve it. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 10:21, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: To be honest, I agree with some of your points above. However, just as your argument becomes more valid, you shoot it down in the second paragraph. How do we know these things you mention? That's not specifically difficult. (1) Watch the animation and/or read the comics in which they feature. If we need to source everything, I suppose I could start collecting screen captures or image scans, in line with Wikipedia's fair use policy, on your "how do we know this" points. (2) Purchase or otherwise be in posession of any of the myraid plastic model kits of these various mecha issued by Bandai, the copyright holder. In addition to being a physical representation, in scale, of that particular mecha, the manuals are usually full of the "unsourced" technical lists that were so heavily decried earlier. If you travel to this website: <a href="http://www.1999.co.jp/" class="external free" title="http://www.1999.co.jp/" rel="nofollow">http://www.1999.co.jp/</a> (it has an English option) and visit the appropriate Gundam section, they retail the vast majority of Bandai-issued model kits, and include, for your reference, fully scanned manuals that include the technical section.</li>

<dd>Whether or not these entries belong here as encyclopedic content (and isn't that a popular buzzword these days...) is a point-of-view issue, but I would like to lay to rest this "unsourced" hogwash ad infinitum. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalikCarr_1188.html" title="User:MalikCarr">MalikCarr</a> 23:56, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Heh, I think you just finished off my own argument for me - cheers&#160;:-p. Seriously, by definition, if an article doesn't list any sources, it's unsourced. I don't think we need a screenshot to prove every single claim, but the article does need to say where it's getting its content from (episode name, comic book issue, tech manual, whatever) - no-one should have to ask. Of course, once some sources are listed, the other debates about reliable sources and encyclopedic content will probably start again, but some sources would still be better than none. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 16:09, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Copy Pasta</b> Why is fictional technology non-notable? It's from Gundam. I'm not a big Gundam fan, but I know how huge of an influence Gundam has on mecha, anime, and Japan in general. To say that major parts of the series (THE MOBILE SUITS) aren't notable is ignorant. It's like these people just don't like Gundam and are doing it out of spite. Some people are suggesting merging... do you know how huge that page would be if ALL of that was merged? Should pages for all fictional things be taken down? Take down every page of Marvel characters? Or merge it, ya know, they're all in the same universe, just give them one page? James Bond villains? Fictional characters, take it down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Definitely some suits are not AS notable as others, and perhaps should be merged into a page that covers which series of Gundam the suits come from. But it is ridiculous to suggest that none of them deserve their own page.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is not meant to be a direct criticism of Bigtop, but it seems to me that people are <i>awfully</i> quick to make accusations of bad faith when people nominate articles of this type for deletion - lists of fictional star trek weapons, articles about each and every character ever mentioned in a particular comic book, etc. Is it really difficult to understand that some editors honestly don't believe this stuff to be encyclopedic?--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 03:21, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Semi-Delete</b> - This information is presented not only on the Avatar: The Last Airbender main page but it's also presented at the bottom of every Avatar page that carries Template:Avatar. All information not listed on the main page each has it's own main page, also listed on Template:Avatar. All these names are linked to multiple times within the episode articles as well. It's just a list with links to no more than 10 different pages. The bottom half links ALL links to Minor Secondary Characters but then goes to that same character. That page itself has a key that is identicle to the bottom half of this page. The only reason I put semi-delete is because if a person wants to look up, say, Aunt Wu, this page tells them that she is in the Minor article. But then again, had they clicked the Major characters page first, not found her, the next logical thing is to go to minor. In this situation though, it still required exactly two pages before she is found. It either needs to be deleted or worked into a way where there is actually a use for it's existance. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../h/e/i/User_talk%7EHeirToPendragon_c05a.html" title="User talk:HeirToPendragon">Yell at me</a> for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HeirToPendragon_68aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/HeirToPendragon">what I've done</a>)</sup> 10:02, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>They aren't referred to every time, but they are helpful to refer to, as they are useful ways to express arguments without going into excessive details, and to help show people what other people feel. I'm not sure why you're offended by referring to them, especially not in an AfD discussion which relies heavily on policy, but you should note that not every comment I've made has referred to any policy. You should perhaps avoid such gross exaggerations. They are not indicative of proper reasoning, but are instead merely hyperbole. The same with your claims that you'll go off in a huff if people cite policies to you. It's one thing to be concerned about insults and uncivil behavior, but when people choose to cite policy when you've engaged in behavior that violates it is something that should lead you to reflect upon your conduct. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:00, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep it</b> - I vote this page stay as it is just as beneficial here as it is on the main avatar page, it contributes by having a separate article for characters on its own. Featuring a brief introduction, is another good feature it has as well. Keep the character profiles the way they are, relationships is interesting and adds more interesting content which is the opposite of redundant. Minor characters and secondary characters should remain as they are a good edition. For avatar fans, they are just as necessary as main characters and were displayed as they should have been. The character page deserved to have its own separate section and it was well made and nicely done. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Lastairbender (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lastairbender_62dc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lastairbender">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>No, it wasn't, as nobody ever proposed deleting the section. So you can say there was no consensus to delete if you want, but that's still missing the point, as nobody was actually advocating it. I still don't don't know why you believe it was the case, but really, if that's what you were worried about, that wasn't the idea at all.

<li>Add all of them to Category:Avatar: The Last Airbender characters. It looks like they may already be in the category though, which means I'm conflicted.

<li><b>Delete</b>, no sign of notability, no verifiable info from third-party relaible sources, etc. To address the above, no, it is not an assumption of bad faith to delete an article by any means. Simply deleting an article is not a judgment that the article's editors are trying to harm the encyclopedia. It is usually , as in this, a judgment that the article does not meet our content guidlines and policies.

I looked this up too in <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> and this story was about medical insurance fraud, not organ transplants. It was also a news investigation which was focussed on Los Angeles (no mention of being in LA in Peters' station bio, and only work for ABC mentioned was in Illinois. It's still possible (but unverified) that she somehow worked on this story's team or that she worked for a winning team which gave its organ transplant story a completely non-medical sounding title. However, we would still need to know what role she played - was she the lead reporter? the junior reporter? the assistant junior reporter? The junior researcher? etc etc</li>

I'm skeptical that a regional Emmy award is sufficient indication of encycloppedic notability, and have been unable to verify her winning these awards either. Wikipedia really needs a guideline for assessing awards/prizes/fellowships/contest wins etc though - most of them out there are not encyclopedically notable. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 06:46, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> or maybe <b>Merge</b>. The data is verifyable, tells about the compound, so I don't see why this would not be encyclopedic (and that goes for other datapages as well).

<li><b>Merge</b> or maybe <b>Keep</b>. The information is useful, but there is very little in the data page that is not in the main article already, so it could be merged. I think it is unlikely that we will ever have enough data on this molecule so that it really deserves a data page to avoid distracting from the main article, which makes me lean towards merge rather than keep. I disagree that Wikipedia doesn't deserve this level of detail because it is a "general encyclopedia". Here I guide myself on the principle that Wikipedia is not paper. <a href="../../../i/t/u/User%7EItub_c2f2.html" title="User:Itub">Itub</a> 23:39, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

If I am interested in Bentiromide's properties and my career (or life?) depends on it, I will go to Bentiromide (after searcing for "Bentiromide" not "Bentiromide (data)", so a merge is irrelevant) and from there to the external source. This is an encyclopaedia that summarises chemicals and their use. It is not a duplicate of better maintained, exclusive repositories of chemical data. --<a href="../../../s/l/f/User%7ESlf67_d959.html" title="User:Slf67">Steve <sub>(Slf67)</sub></a> <a href="../../../s/l/f/User_talk%7ESlf67_bed3.html" title="User talk:Slf67"><sup>talk</sup></a> 00:16, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b>: useful information already well covered in Bentiromide page.

<dd>Thank you all for your feedback. We have reviewed all of the wikilinks listed, and based on our understanding,could not find any of the suggested guidelines which would indicate to us that we are in violation. The very <b>ancestral &amp; religious</b> nature of the <i>Mami Wata Healers Society of North America Inc.,</i> precludes it from being a forum for <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESpam_8b43.html#Advertisements" title="WP:Spam">WP:Spam#Advertisements</a>,proselytizing or recruitment. It simply is not possible. Additionally in reading the <i>suggested guidelines</i> on the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Wikipedia:Conflict of interest</a> page, we have avoided linking any Wikipedia article to our religious corporation. Wat was also clear in reading each article was that all were simply <i>general guidelines</i> as oppose to <i>official policy</i>, the article further stating that the most severest penalty which may be imposed in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Wikipedia:Conflict of interest</a> is that it "<i>may put the editor at serious risk of embarrassing himself or his client</i>." Nonetheless, in consideration for your concerns, what we have done is to re-read the MWHS article, and can always agree that the article can be improved so as not to offer the appearance that our intention is to recruit. In that regard, we are open to anyone rewriting the article or submitting a link to an example of how a Religious organization is presented in encyclopedic form.Thank you again for your comments and feedback.--<a href="../../../m/w/h/User%7EMwhs_5c19.html" title="User:Mwhs">MWHS</a> 19:09, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Look, Viv, that only proves that your organization <b>exists</b>, it doesn't mean you're notable enough that we need an article about you.

So far the consensus seems to be that your organization is hardly any more notable than the bowling alley across the street, and the "<b>ancestral &amp; religious</b> nature" of your organization has nothing to do with it. It's just that there are a lot of bowling alleys in the world, and we simply don't need an article about each individual one.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I don't think comparing a religious organization to a bowling alley is helpful to anyone. (A little more <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, please!) The <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mami_Wata_3afa.html" title="Mami Wata">Mami Wata</a> article indicates the general subject of Mami Wata has significant notability in Africa. The difficulty is in coming up with evidence that this North American organization has attracted attention in its own right. It is perhaps unfair that non-Western religious movements, whether new or traditional, are somewhat handicapped in this respect. For what it's worth, the organization claims to constitute a denomination rather than a <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28local_churches_and_other_religious_congregations%29_07e8.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (local churches and other religious congregations)">local church or congregation</a>, so it's not clear that the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28local_churches_and_other_religious_congregations%29_07e8.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (local churches and other religious congregations)">Wikipedia:Notability (local churches and other religious congregations)</a> policy, which may require special evidence of local notability over and above that of the denomination, applies. Although it can be debated which policy is applicable, evidence of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> from one or more independent <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a> appears, fairly or not, to be an element underlying essentially all the variants of the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> policy.

<dd>Thank you Shirahadasha. You are correct MWHS does not proclaim to be a separate entity from its ancestral roots of the Mami Wata traditions in West Africa. Our society was aided in its very establishment by elders of Mami Wata from Togo, West Africa. Within our own religio-cultural milieu, we are very much notable for having established the tradition in North America since the suppression of African religions in America during <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slavery</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconstruction.html" title="Reconstruction">Reconstruction</a>. Additionally, within our organization we display <a href="http://www.mamiwata.com/MWHS.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mamiwata.com/MWHS.html" rel="nofollow">the photo and credentials from Togo</a> of our founder and other legal documents that are required by both our tradition and the state and local county. The bigoted and disparaging manner in which our African Ancestral Religious Society and its members are treated here is indicative of its long history of racism, suppression and discrimination in the USA. However, we are not deterred. We understand this history and the motivation behind it, and will continue to contribute and challenge what some of these editors and admin have made self-evident.Apokassii--<a href="../../../m/w/h/User%7EMwhs_5c19.html" title="User:Mwhs">MWHS</a> 15:13, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I can't find it right this second, but WP policy says sports events should be +1, meaning only the next event should be covered. So an article on the 2008 game is arlight (and 2009 I think), 2010 is not. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 06:55, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Sounds right. Hence why I'm keeping 2008 and 2009 up.

There is nothing of value in the article that can't be recreated instantly when the time comes.

Perhaps change this into a redirect to that article. I have listed this at <a href="../../../c/f/b/WP%7ECFB_6e26.html" title="WP:CFB">WikiProject College football</a> for more input on the matter. The 2009 article could probably be deleted/redirected as well until the same premise that we could redo it to the same state easily and nothing will be lost. The 2008 article should definitely be kept, though it might not see expansion beyond what it is until August-November. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecu_ba9a.html" title="User:Mecu"><font color="#CEBE70"><b>MECU</b></font></a>≈<small><a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecu_1c42.html" title="User talk:Mecu">talk</a></small> 20:41, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Encyclopaedias are about notable subjects; <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> defines what Wikipedia considers notable is in the case of musicians etc. The article as it stands does not assert any of the points in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Further suggestions are the editing history and the lack of independent, verifiable sources. I understand how hard it is to work up a good bio, which your article is a good start towards. But the subject of the article doesn't seem to be notable. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosh_Parris_7b8b.html" title="User talk:Josh Parris">Josh Parris</a><span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de%2F~kate%2Fcgi-bin%2Fcount_edits%3Fuser%3DJosh%2BParris%26dbname%3Denwiki" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de%2F~kate%2Fcgi-bin%2Fcount_edits%3Fuser%3DJosh%2BParris%26dbname%3Denwiki" rel="nofollow">#</a><a href="http://parris.josh.com.au/resume/index.shtml" class="external text" title="http://parris.josh.com.au/resume/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">:</a></span> 06:13, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your point, "The article as it stands does not assert any of the points in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>" is well taken. However, this is easily remedied (chalk it up to ignorance of a novice). I will merely modify the article so that <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prima_facie.html" title="Prima facie">prima facie</a> and on its face asserts the relevant points in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>; specifically, points 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 in the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html#Criteria_for_musicians_and_ensembles" title="WP:MUSIC">criteria for musicians and ensembles</a> and point 1 in the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html#Criteria_for_composers_and_lyricists" title="WP:MUSIC">criteria for composers and lyricists</a>. Quite frankly, I'm exhausted at the moment (just got back from class where the subject was ironically "<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burden_of_proof.html" title="Burden of proof">burden of proof</a>" after a full day of work). As you can imagine, I'm not up to digging up the research at the moment; however, I will update this information over the weekend. In addition, my next article, the Independent Movement, highly relevant to the achievements of this notable independant artist, as well as other notable <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indie_%28music%29.html" title="Indie (music)">indies</a>, such as <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devandra_Banhart_9f1a.html" title="Devandra Banhart">Devandrah Bernhart</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willy_Mason_12a2.html" title="Willy Mason">Willy Mason</a>, et all, will be highlighted. Apparently, I will need to prematurely post that article to further substantiate my work! <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWindwall_2f1b.html" title="User:Windwall">Windwall</a> 22:40, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I commented earlier that I would make the revisions to my article this weekend. I'm a huge stickler to my word so just in case anyone is remotely concerned, I'm posting a comment here to let whoever cares or may have an interest that I'm still working on my research. I didn't get done as quickly as I thought I would. Perhaps this exercise is creating a better writer in me. In any case, I hope to have the substantiations requested by midnight tonight so I can keep my word. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWindwall_2f1b.html" title="User:Windwall">Windwall</a> 20:31, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Not quite midnight; however, I'm close. I have rewritten the article. Quite frankly, I'm uncertain what to do next as I don't want to violate any more rules (it's not fun being rejected). I researched Wikipedia's rules and here's what I gleamed as to what I need to do next: apparently, I need to add <i>cleanup</i> to my article, then I am free to make the edits to my article to address the points raised, then sit and wait. Correct? Again, your guidance is appreciated. I must say, writing articles for Wikipedia is much more complicated than I ever contemplated. It takes much more time and energy than I think I have at this time in my life. But I'll give it my best shot. Please take my ignorance into consideration from this point forward. Thank you for your patience. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWindwall_2f1b.html" title="User:Windwall">Windwall</a> 01:35, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're making good headway in the structure of the article. I've been looking through it and I still can't see text supporting points 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 in the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html#Criteria_for_musicians_and_ensembles" title="WP:MUSIC">criteria for musicians and ensembles</a> - perhaps I've missed it? Is it in footnotes? The article itself ought to read like "Tom McExample is most famous for setting fire to pants while still being worn by the President of Lithuania; the resulting burns led to the Lithuania-Madagascar war of 1698." so the reader is immediately told why they ought to be interested in Tom. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosh_Parris_7b8b.html" title="User talk:Josh Parris">Josh Parris</a> 23:54, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, the references to substantiate points 5, 8, 9, and 10 in the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html#Criteria_for_musicians_and_ensembles" title="WP:MUSIC">criteria for musicians and ensembles</a> are in the footnotes, as outlined here:</dd>
<dd><i>Point 5: Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable.</i> Please see <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Madden_89a4.html#Contributing_Musicians" title="Bill Madden">Contributing Members</a>, each of these individuals has made a significant contribution.</dd>
<dd><i>Point 8: Has won or placed in a major music competition.</i> Please see footnotes identified as nos. <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Madden_89a4.html#_note-9" title="Bill Madden">10</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Madden_89a4.html#_note-14" title="Bill Madden">15</a>, and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Madden_89a4.html#_note-24" title="Bill Madden">25</a>.</dd>
<dd><i>Point 9: Has performed music for a work of media that is notable, e.g. a theme for a network television show.</i> Please see footnotes identified as nos. <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Madden_89a4.html#_note-5" title="Bill Madden">6</a> (MTVU Main Playlist), <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Madden_89a4.html#_note-6" title="Bill Madden">7</a> (MuchMusic), <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Madden_89a4.html#_note-15" title="Bill Madden">16</a> (MTV The Real World Boston), and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Madden_89a4.html#_note-16" title="Bill Madden">17</a> (MTV The Real World Boston).</dd>
<dd><i>Point 10: Has been placed in rotation nationally by any major radio network.</i> Please see footnote identified as no. <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Madden_89a4.html#_note-36" title="Bill Madden">37</a>.</dd>
<dd><i>Point 7: Has won a major music award, such as a Grammy, Juno or Mercury Music Award.</i> As for this point, I do not know if this qualifies as major but it is noted here for you nevertheless, please see footnote identified as no. <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Madden_89a4.html#_note-24" title="Bill Madden">25</a>.</dd>
<dd>Regarding your recommendation as to how the article itself should read, I will revise accordingly. However, I have to work all week and I have classes every night. Due to my schedule and workload in school, I won't have the opportunity to make these revisions until the weekend. Thank you for your continued patience and guidance.</dd>
<dd>On another note that is relevant, I see the deletes and feel highly discouraged. With all due respect, Madden is more notable than some of his contemporaries who are listed in Wikipedia. I have done significant research these past two days and I have noted artists that don't have as much information substantiated as the work I've had to dig up. I don't want to single any of those artists out on this board because that, in my opinion, is disrespectful of the significance of art and prefer not to provide this information. It just does't seem fair or just. The fact that there is no intelligent discussion I feel gives Wikipedians a negative light. It is disappointing that people do not join in our discussion and simply hide behind <i>per nom</i> without elucidating why my article should be deleted. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWindwall_2f1b.html" title="User:Windwall">Windwall</a> 23:02, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Ecclesall Road is one of the first roads people (students maybe) know when arriving in Sheffield to live, and it is a well-known shopping area. My girlfriend will often go there to shop, and many friend will head there for it's shops or the pool lounge. Saying "Ecclesall Road shops" would be like talking of the "<a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Road_4942.html" title="London Road">London Road restaurants</a>" or "<a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Peaks_1677.html" title="Crystal Peaks">Crystal Peaks Shopping Centre</a>".

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Lack of verifiability is not sufficient reason to delete this article—it is a road, its existence can be verified quite simply by looking at a map. The article is currently uncited, but that is only reason to request a cleanup, not reason for deletion. I'm fairly sure that I could find sources for most of the facts in the article. This road is a major arterial road in one of Britain's larger cities—whether that alone makes it notable enough for its own article is a matter of opinion; I would tend to think not, but then there are plenty of articles on Wikipedia about things that I would regard as much less notable, so my bar of notability may be too high. Merging with <a href="../../../a/6/2/A625_road.html" title="A625 road">A625 road</a> seems like a good option that should be considered. —<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremyA_6669.html" title="User:JeremyA">JeremyA</a> 01:23, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I have to disagree with the start of your opinion: lack of verifiability is the main reason why articles should get deleted, and if nothing beyond it's existence and trivial mentions can be sourced, then we have to delete it. However, if the problem for the notable parts (whichever they may be, having shops is not really one of them) is not lack of verifiability but lack of verification, then the situation may change. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptain_scarlet_567e.html" title="User talk:Captain scarlet">User talk:Captain scarlet</a> seems to think that sourcing should be easy, so I suppose that can be done before the end of this AfD. Otherwise, it are only claims that it can be done, and then the article can better be recreated once anyone actually has those sources... <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 06:10, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply</b>. Please re-read what I said above. I know that lack of verifiability is a reason for article deletion.

<li>I have reviewed your dicussion, and exactly what more proof do you need? Prior to establishing the domainsite, my web existence was through an internet provider iSTAR in Toronto, Canada. ex. "istar.ca/~tbdeinc". Surely, "Non-notable comic," is not a strong point for deletion. I have kept my activity on marketing my comics to the minimum. But they ARE out there. In fact, my current run has been designed to help and spark education for brain injury children. Varify this by going to biaph.com. Phone/fax/email them for confirmation. Granted my comicbook doesn't have a large distribution, but I have produced techniques that were ground breaking for comics. The first issue had 3 press runs alone! Diamond Comic Distributors provided quotes of my book at the time. CSN ran an article on my first issue. The current issues are distributed to doctors, caregivers, lawyers and hosptals.

<li>Additional re: techniques; comparing the artwork in The Black Diamond Effect, (line, resolution and style) against Batman Digital Justice and Shatter that came out around the same time and before, you will see a clear distance in the quality and techniques or lack of in the other books. Before and after all the digitally produced comics were noticably BITMAP'd and had not achieved the level of artwork manipulation which combined vector and bitmap artwork from page to page.

<li>GPG is my abbreviation of George Peter Gatsis (tbdeinc2). As for the reviewers, I am trying to track them down, why I haven't given out their names, is because they have reviewed my books over 15 years ago. The hard copies are somewhere with all my boxed books, stashed away or quite possibly thrown in the garbage, not sure yet. Until I actually track down the people to their new employement positions (alot happens in over 15 years) I won't be able to link or provide proof. As it is one of the newspapers Toronto Computes, that reviewed my book -the first review too- has merged with another publication or was bought out, don't know. But I've made the calls and sent out emails, to everyone. So to review: I have a 17 year old federal trademark, i have ISSN publication number, I am listed in the Library of Congress as well as the Library and Archives Canada, and pretty soon will have contacted the reviewers of my book. Anything else in terms of proof? <b>George Peter Gatsis 9:04 est, january 9, 2007</b></li>

<li>I think there may be a misunderstanding, I have zero doubt that this comic is real no proof is required, I do doubt it is notable and a couple of 15 year old book reviews from Canadian computer newspapers will do little to change my feelings on this. A list of reviews might help users determine whether or not this article is notable, if it is not possible to link to them it is still worth giving out the information. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<dd>Obviously you did not read anything at all.

<dd>Actually I did read the references - being one part in a video game which is about anime robots anyway, being a "cameo" in another cartoon, and being part of a Pepsi promo campaign involving gundam toys are not I would call "cultural influence".

<dd>Then what is this "cultural influence" references you are seeking for, you name it, I will show it to you. I am tired of me showing a bunch of references and deletionist keep saying those are not cultural references. BTW, the Sgt. Frog appearance is not just cameo, the main character in that series built a model of RX-78 and even got a suit that is exactly like RX-78(only the head is removed so that Keroro himself could be place there instead). This is enough to show "cultural influence" of this specified mecha as an cultural icon in anime for me. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 16:10, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

Promotional toys, video games that are directly about anime robots and a minor appearance in a cartoon ("cameo" was a term used by whoever wrote that part of the article, not just me) are things which belong in a other appearances in pop culture trivia section, and are not evidence that this robot has influenced other cultural activities in a substantial, meaningful way. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 19:12, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The X-Wings and the Millennium Falcon are very major spaceships and plot points in <i>Star Wars</i>. Even non-fans who have only seen the movies once over a decade ago know what they are, if not the specific technical details. On the other hand, non-fans of Gundam have never heard of this RX-78 Gundam thingy or the other thingamajigs mentioned in the template, and even after reading the article, it is hard to see what makes one of these robots more notable than another. <i>Star Wars</i> <b>does</b> include a number of vehicles and characters that are by far not notable enough for Wikipedia - you only have to read one of the "Ultimate Guide" books to see them. But saying "if you delete Golden Era Mecha Mobile Suit EVA XYZ-123(R) Mark II+ prototype (which was only ever seen once in one episode) then you should delete the Enterprise-E too" is simply a knee-jerk response from the Gundam fandom. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 11:24, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Then its a case of clean up, not deletion. The RX-78 Gundam is the primary mecha in the First Gundam series. It is as notable as the examples I've given, without the Gundams, there is no show.

It will be a hell of a lot easier that way, and nothing will actually be lost. I can see the argument for the RX-78 having an article here, but then a lot of the article's content needs to be cut and trimmed. If we can propose a convincing plan of transwiki / mass-cruft cleanup, then I'm sure we'll be given more time before any final deletion decision.

This is wikipedia, we should not just go around and point at articles saying it is not worth while in it, instead, we should improve the articles in order to make it worth while. Yes, if somebody created a page of totally self generated original thought, we nominate it for deletion, that is what this process is for. However, nominating a cultural icon of some other country is simply just ignorant and arrogant. Face it, Anime has became a major cultural impact in a lot of countries, Gundam is always on the top of the list within Japan, whether you like it or not. RX-78 carries equal cultural impact if not more than <a href="../../../x/-/w/X-Wing_3d05.html" title="X-Wing">X-Wing</a> of Star Wars, it deserves to have its own page and <b>having a badly written page is never an excuse and reason for deletion</b>. To those who think that the WP:Gundam people are responsible for this, <b>it is not</b>. The project was not even called Gundam a few months ago. I agree that some of those articles in the list of Mecha should not stay, but going through hundreds of articles takes time and WP:Gundam people <b>are not professional wiki editors</b>, <b>We have a life to live</b>.

<dd>You're own obvious bias comes out pretty strong.

<dd>Next. <i>but going through hundreds of articles takes time and WP:Gundam people <b>are not professional wiki editors</b>, <b>We have a life to live</b>.</i>- true. But if these articles are never going to get fixed from the craptastic situation they are in now, why keep them?<br /></dd>

<dd><i>"Wow. It's big in Japan.

<dd><i>"And your statement is stupid, I'm sorry. Quick google check for RX-78: 719,000 hits.

In this case, the <a href="../../../a/r/g/Wikipedia%7EArguments_to_avoid_in_deletion_discussions_1a86.html#Google_test" title="Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions">Google test</a> is unlikely to yield results that are anywhere close to being accurate.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Newtype is a reliable source for anime; it's one of the most important magazines covering the topic. Being in Japanese does not make it unreliable. (There's an English edition, actually, though I haven't checked whether it has the same articles -- I doubt it, since the releases aren't the same.) A cover feature story in Newtype is to anime what a cover story in Entertainment Weekly is to Hollywood. As for not showing cultural influence, I can only presume you are unaware of the extent to which anime and manga permeate Japanese popular culture. Something on the lines of 80% of published material in Japan is manga, and they're not aimed solely at children. Personally, I despise most of Gundam and its knockoffs, but there's no question that it's been among the most influential anime series ever produced. The article the two of you are discussing makes that clear: It's a retrospective which includes a series of drawings by an apparently-famous artist (whose name, I'm afraid, I can't read; I'm rather weak on the name kanji). There's also a section dealing with <i>Z Gundam</i>, which presumably is (or was when this hit the stands) the current show in the series. And one dealing with the theme song of that show, which seems to have catapulted the group singing it to some degree of stardom. Definite impact -- but then, I'd think the fact that "the series [is] still being produced in one form or another" after 30 years would make that clear. And this particular mecha is more or less the symbol of the metaseries. It's as notable within its series as the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starship_Enterprise_3c8f.html" title="Starship Enterprise">Starship Enterprise</a> or the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millennium_Falcon_baaa.html" title="Millennium Falcon">Millennium Falcon</a> are within theirs -- in fact, it's more so (the Enterprise and the Falcon didn't spawn huge arrays of spin-offs). The difference is that many editors are not familiar with Gundam as they are with Star Trek or Star Wars -- cultural bias, essentially. Not, mind you, a bad-faith bias against the article itself, but a lack of perception of just how important in Japanese popular culture this series and this specific mobile suit are. I don't even <i>like</i> most of Gundam, and I naturally lean deletionist, but there's not a question in my mind that the delete&#160;!voters in this case are mistaken. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 20:37, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> It's not so much the cultural impact (or lack thereof) that keeps bugging me, it's the obsession about the detailed tech specs. The fact that the RX-78 Gundam is a central item or character in an anime series that enjoys huge popularity in Japan is encyclopedic. A list of episodes it appears in is encyclopedic. A brief description of how a pilot would use it in battle is encyclopedic. But half a page full of numbers about how much the fictional metal armour weighs, how many horsepowers the fictional engine has, how long its fictional fingers are, a list of fictional model ID numbers of the fictional bullets it uses as ammunition is not encyclopedic. Such things are of interest only in a Gundam-specific wiki, where people can look them up from an in-universe POV, not from an out-of-universe POV that we have here in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 16:32, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply to Comment</b> If you look at the "improved" article, you'll see the specs have been removed. Even prior to this, fantasy specs are just as valid to those interested in the war-machine as they would be to say, someone looking up the <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-15.html" title="F-15">F-15</a>. Do we really need to include the number, type and output of them? No. But I've yet to see a reason why not that doesn't simply boil down to "I don't like it". Its more encyclopedic to include stats for warships, even fictional ones, than it is not. These are weapons and not describing their capabilities in combat makes the articles incomplete. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 16:53, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Reply. The problem is, if a part of the article should be deleted, it does not belong to an AfD, instead, it should be brought upon in the article's talk page or the project talk page(since all of these mecha have these data). Also, I see no reason for not tagging in some of the information since those things never have the notablity to have their own articles, and they surely have some impact related to the series itself(For example, the output power is generally increasing throughout the whole Universal Century timeline). The specs are even written by a third party to begin with (Gundam Century itself was written by fans, published by Midori Kobou instead of Bandai or Sunrise) but just later adopted by official publisher. Meaning it is good encyclopedic sources of impact. Maybe more of these should be added in, but it will lengthen the spec part into what the original specs are and who they got changed thoughout the years, and I cannot add in any OR meaning not much could be written. The specs are there so that people have at least the slightest idea of how these fictional things perform. I personally don't care if these are kept or not because I know more places for these things, but obviously quite a large number of fans enjoyed it being here. These should be discussed in the project page instead. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 16:57, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is the defining mecha for more than three different TV series, several more mini-series, movies and books spanning more than 25 years of continuous history.

As for real-world significance, how about presence the dozens of model kits (of this particular one)? In fact, the gundam modeling community significantly different from the military scale modeling community, especially where I live. And as has been said, the RX-78 and the gundam series as a whole is a Japanese cultural icon. I won't go into details but essentially, the mecha itself and the series changed the direction of Japanese animation significantly. While it can be argued that not all mobile suit models deserve their own page (I agree with this), this one (RX-78) definitely does. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 21:16, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> How, specifically, does one prove that a movie or series is a "cultural icon"? How does one establish that <b>Star Trek</b> is a cultural icon? If you say by citing the amount of merchandizing, spin-offs, satirizing, documented influences, longevity, and etc., then Gundam is a shoe in. And since the RX-78 Gundam is a major element of the Gundam series, it actually passes <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> for inclusion. Buy why is substantiate if it is cultural icon necessary for inclusion to begin with? Granted that the article could use more sources, but as it stands at the moment, it is better sourced the most other articles on facial elements and characters. And with the recent cleanup, it's is a lot better off in regards to the "in-universe" perspective then similar articles of franchises that are more familiar to English editors. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">Farix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 21:39, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> <i>And cleanup</i>. This particular 'Gundam', 'Mech', or 'Armored suit', is the central robot of a number of franchised series. I think that template needs more pruning than my garden, and I think that most of the other suits should be merged and trimmed with extreme editorial prejudice for citation and bare-bones notation, perhaps 'Mechs of Gundam Series(es)'. That said, I think that any number of editors would try to re-write or recreate it if removed, and salting on this topic would be to show significant wiki-bias against anime.

<li>Notability is <b>NOT</b> how the nominator dislike the article. RX-78 Gundam got equal screen time than some of the major characters in the show(Hey, BTW, the show is called <b>Gundam</b>) It can well be thought as a character, a major one. <i>Promotional toys, video games that are directly about anime robots and a minor appearance in a cartoon ("cameo" was a term used by whoever wrote that part of the article, not just me) are things which belong in a other appearances in pop culture trivia section, and are not evidence that this robot has influenced other cultural activities in a substantial, meaningful way.</i> Sorry, Bwithh, this is not the case. If an anime robot appeared in another anime, and that anime was made over 20 years later(1979~2003), it is not just a pop culture trivia event. BTW, pop culture is culture, influencing pop culture meaning it got the cultural significance that people can recognise the icon 20 years later. And anime robots appears in so many shows, there are thousands of them, why RX-78 Gundam? why not any other robot in any other show, say convoy, or X-Wing? why this old, plain looking piece? Or, why is this particular robot along with MS-06 Zaku appeared over and over again in so many different stories, including non-Gundam stories? How did it got its own Credit card like Yoda?

Deletionist not having read the book is not an excuse of the article is not referenced.

The others are published by various magazine publishers and reviewers, which are all not paid by the Gundam copyright holder company Bandai, or paid for any information from the company. These are called <i>independent sources</i>. I know some deletionist do not hold credit for fan written articles as sources, but a well established publisher publishing books having editors edit the articles is a good secondary source we can use in wiki. It does not matter if the writer is a fan or not, or the editors are fans or not, the fact is that they are independent workers and some third party company paid the publishing fee wishing to earn some money. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 09:39, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Here, of course I may have something that I <s>do not</s> know, I may share it. I believe that sharing is one of the most important feature in wikipedia, right? It is sharing that makes our wikipedia different from other encyclopedia. I admit that sharing is a double-edged sword. Some may talk about something which other may have no interest of them, some may talk about rubbish idea, and so on. As consequences, there also special interest groups who work and talk about that group, as Gundam Fan. Seeing gundam aired in America, at least there are prospects which make Bandai want to sell them there. Of course there are materials not available to non-japanese speaking "viewer". If they want to know more, I think Wikipedia is one of the good place to start for. They may realizes "oh there are these" and "there are those". That is why I insist to include many things seems not important for ignorant people, also per my global view as inclusionists. Well, <a href="../../../r/o/c/Roche_limit.html" title="Roche limit">Roche limit</a> may not important for common people but for astronomers, it is different.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Despite my love for anime, I hate Gundam with a passion. Even with this in mind, this particular Gundam is the Gundam equivalent of Pikachu, and the Gundam series itself is the Pokemon of mecha anime. It's the cornerstone of a popular series, and meets the WP:FICT guideline for inclusion per major characters (and places, concepts, etc.), "If an encyclopedic treatment of such a character causes the article on the work itself to become long, then that character can be given a separate article." Disregarding that, the real-life appearances in Japan, including being on a stamp, argue for notability in themselves. <a href="../../../j/0/l/User%7EJ0lt_C0la_0b17.html" title="User:J0lt C0la">J0lt C0la</a> 23:42, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Essentially, what we see now on the article's page is the only contribution made by its original author. So, if we can find anything worthwhile, can we edit the article during the AfD to give it a direction?

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Assuming I've figured out what this article "should" be about IMO. Can we rename the article "Karl Rothammel" during the AfD or must that happen later?

<li><b>Delete</b> unless someone familiar with the book is available to write about it. There's no article about the man in the German WP. However Karl Rothammel's Antennenbuch is in the reference list of <a href="../../../../de/a/n/t/Antennendiagramm.html" class="extiw" title="de:Antennendiagramm">de:Antennendiagramm</a>. The German article is said to have an English equivalent at <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiation_pattern.html" title="Radiation pattern">Radiation pattern</a>. However the latter does not cite Rothammel's book. I'm not sure we would just add Rothammel's book as a reference on the English article without knowing more about its content. So, just Delete, without prejudice against re-creation in case someone familiar with it can write it up. Since there's no English translation available, it's not certain that this book is notable enough for the English WP. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 05:53, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yeah, I had most of those thoughts too - when I voted for <i>Strong Keep</i>, it was hoping that people/portals who care about the article would come forth and make it worth keeping since my findings were that in its field, it is worth keeping and is notable and verifiable (if the article is renamed to Karl Rothammel). The people who best know about this material don't seem to have appeared yet. So, I can also be a <i>neutral</i> on this one. AfD's are not the time for article improvement drives if proponents aren't even present (IMO)! <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> 11:17, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Recommend caution over sources; Neutral for now</b> The article's main claims to encyclopedic notability - that DJ Disco Wiz was the first Latino hiphop DJ and that he was the first DJ to create a "mixed plate" - these both rely on references to the book <i>Yes Yes Y'All: The Experience Music Project Oral History of Hip Hop's First Decade</i>. While this book in itself appears to be a legit academic work, it is primarily <i>an oral history</i>. So the claim that DJ Disco Wiz was the first Latino hiphop DJ of any significance comes from an interview with <i>DJ Disco Wiz where he himself makes the claim</i>(<a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN030681224X&amp;id=gU8KbbFxn7YC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;ots=p3kD4m4AZo&amp;dq=%22dj+disco+wiz%22&amp;sig=6Blkj5CgLqOogw5aV39L-cazFhk#PPA128,M1" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN030681224X&amp;id=gU8KbbFxn7YC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;ots=p3kD4m4AZo&amp;dq=%22dj+disco+wiz%22&amp;sig=6Blkj5CgLqOogw5aV39L-cazFhk#PPA128,M1" rel="nofollow">see p128 of the book</a>). The same goes for the claims about being the first the mixed plate (p129). We do not know if the authors were able to verify (or even made the attempt to) these oral history claims by Wiz himself. I would note that on the DJ summary list at the front of the book (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN030681224X&amp;id=gU8KbbFxn7YC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;ots=p3kD4m4AZo&amp;dq=%22dj+disco+wiz%22&amp;sig=6Blkj5CgLqOogw5aV39L-cazFhk#PPA4,M1" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN030681224X&amp;id=gU8KbbFxn7YC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;ots=p3kD4m4AZo&amp;dq=%22dj+disco+wiz%22&amp;sig=6Blkj5CgLqOogw5aV39L-cazFhk#PPA4,M1" rel="nofollow">page 4</a>), another chap named "Charlie Chase" is called the "one of the first Latino hiphop DJs" while Disco Wiz is merely described as a "Latino DJ" (no "first" or "early" etc). <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 08:31, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In the solar system, the sun exert SRF while planets exerts Gravitation. The sun repells planet-satellites while they attracts the sun. So planets-satellites neither fall upon the sun by gravitation nor flungaway by Repulsion. At orbital distances both reverse forces counterbalances each other. So planets and satellites remain at mean distance in their orbits.</dd>

<dd>Interaction of SRF with gravitation resulted into retraction force (RTF). RTF keep bodies at mean distance in orbits and keep them in spherical motion. RTF acts on planets at ratio -inversely proportional to square-root of distance from the sun. So planets revolve at this velocity around the sun. The mass of the sun is 99.85% of the solar system, If the sun also exerted gravitation, then, all planets-satellites should have collapsed into the sun and that would be the end of solar system. centrifugal is fiction. The sun repels planets - it does not attracts.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> "What actual harm" would it be to have an article for each of the mailboxes in my town (address, color, height, date installed, pickup times)? It would debase and devalue the Wikipedia project.

<li><b>comment</b> the logical problem with the "what harm" argument is that large amounts of articles on non-notable and non-encyclopedic material all take up space in the wikipedia database, and search complexity (and therefore server load and CPU demands) rise exponentially with a linear increase in the number of articles. Large numbers (how many have been deleted so far? 50? 100 in towers alone?) of articles on things such as unremarkable towers of the kind that dot every city in the world do nothing useful to justify the space they use. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 20:20, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Please tell me what 'bogus' argument I've used. Actually, I don't like this article, it sucks. But the ownus isn't on the keep voters - keep is the default. So far I've seen no compelling argument for deletion. I've seen irrelevancies about the servers, and now an argument that says since you deleted the last lot (which I voted to keep), I'm not supposed to object to the deletion of this lot. You say lots of this has been deleted? Indeed, who is counting? --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 02:12, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>note</b>: I know that server use isn't a valid reason for deletion, but it is a counterargument to "it does no harm" because tons of mostly useless articles do indeed have a hidden harm in terms of the usability of the encyclopedia. Besides, we have WP:N and WP:NOT criterion for a reason. To the above, the onus is not on delete votes to prove there is some harm caused, only that some aspect of policy or guideline is violated. In these cases, as they fail WP:N the towers pretty much would require an outstanding exception to keep, one I don't think is waranted under these situations (but I reserve the right to state that other articles may deserve that on the basis of other policy at some later time). <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 03:25, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>But the history section is fine, (as according to your own nomination even). It's not a stub. Even if it was just a sourced stub, that's not grounds for deletion. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 09:09, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> History section is sufficient to take it beyond a stub. Article needs more comprehensive referencing and long-existing unsourced statements can be removed, certainly, but the basic subject matter itself surely isn't being contested? <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 09:06, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - (edit conflict) This is certainly a subject that merits an article, even if the article needs improvement. Most of the material that you say is "original research" is not - it is just unreferenced at the moment. If anyone gets to their copy of <i>Mountaineering:Freedom of the Hills</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0898864275</a>) before I do, they could fix that pretty fast. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> 09:07, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> you already claim that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> information exists in other parts of the article. Remove the original research yourself or add {{fact}} tags, don't bring the article to AfD.--<a href="../../../r/w/r/User%7ERWR8189_3944.html" title="User:RWR8189">RWR8189</a> 09:12, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Only in the most extreme cases is deletion a solution for problems with an article on such a notable topic. The verifiability pendulum will have swung too far if we equate lack of sources with unverifiability and start deleting valid and verifiable articles just because sources have not yet been added. We should not start using AFD as a cleanup tool instead of a deletion tool. Some basic research with Google to check if this is truly unverifiable is virtually mandatory before declaring something "unverifiable". <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 09:34, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Sections need sources, yes, but the history section has them and the clubs link to articles that I think largely have them. AfD is not the answer, particularly for a key 'portal' like article linking to other articles on aspects of climbing. It is not OR as any climber would know. It just needs sources.

<li><b>Delete</b> There is hardly no information regarding Big Brother 8 yet. 2 Lines for an article is not worth a page right now. Maybe in 4-6 weeks but not right now. In January 2006 MORE information about BB7 was released than it is now for BB8. All we know is Big Brother 8 will be very different, it is the last year at the current locations and the Audition Dates. Doesn't seem alot, and doesn't seem worth it. Until a larger portion of information is accurate I suggest just placing this information to the main BBUK article. — Coreix <small>(<a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoreix_2d13.html" title="User talk:Coreix">talk</a>)</small> 17:19, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

It was closed as "<i>no consensus whether to delete or merge</i>", but very much not a 'keep'. Not a single jot of this has been merged. Three months is enough time, and so I am re-nominating it for deletion. As the prior nomination stated, this article/game guide is entirely <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> and violates Wikipedia policies, specifically <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, which explicitly states that Wikipedia is not a venue for game guide information.

<li><b>Keep</b> I regret not being able to discuss this article the first time it came around for AFD because many of the "votes" made there were not supported by any arguements and didn't add anything constructive to the conversation.

The parts I would concede to removing would be things like, "Ground-type Pokémon are tough Pokémon affiliated with the soil." This amounts to something that has to be <i>analyzed</i> from reading a wealth of Pokedex information and <i>does</i> constitute OR. However, listing examples is purely descriptive and easily verifiable. As for the non-list info:

<dd>Please re-read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> <i>carefully</i> and realize that wikipedia is not a place for <i>instruction</i>. Where in the article is anyone being told "how to-do" anything? This article exists seperately because the information is too exetensive to appropritely contain within another article (i.e. too big and therefore distracting). IMO, there seems to exist a double-standard, have you ever looked at <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly.html" title="Monopoly">Monopoly</a>? Or how about the vast variety of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Category%7EChess_openings_db30.html" title="Category:Chess openings">Category:Chess openings</a>?

The point is that it's <i>fine</i> to discuss the details of a game as long as someone has done it before. Editors are just not allowed to give advice, instruction, or thier own opinions (OR).</dd>

But there undoubtedly remains some reservations about my sources and whether they follow <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Firstly, to Edison, primary sources are <i>perfectly suitable</i> for describing, which is almost all this article does, so complaining of a lack of them is irrelevant, especially when it's about a game. Secondly, one may notice my use of <a href="http://www.serebii.net" class="external text" title="http://www.serebii.net" rel="nofollow">serebii</a> as a RS. While fansites are generally <i>discouraged</i> I have yet to find a policy that <i>forbids</i> them.

<li><b>Comment</b> If we were debating the keeping of a book, a church, a professor, a choral group, an artist, or a shopping mall, the citing of fan websites would not count for much with respect to reliable independent sources, and the citing of game guides from the company or the instruction manual for a game would not count much for independent sources or for notability. Observations from looking or playing the game are clearly original research. People are always saying "If we have all those Pokemon articles, why can't we keep this article" with respect to articles with way better sources than these. Why should computer game or video game characters/weapons/equipment/tactics get a pass from notability, verifiability, and reliable sources on the basis of ILIKEIT? <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:20, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reason that fansites don't tend to count for much is because they are not stable, are not not subject to independent fact-checking, do not declare their source of information, are error-prone, and often-times uncorroborated. However, <i>none</i> of these apply to serebii.net. They are a reputable site within the pokemon community and considered reliable in their source information. Nintendo, by nature, does not tend to divulge information or talk about it's products in more than commercializing manners. And what does the source have to do with notability? You lost me on that one. Observations do <i>not</i> qualify as original research. From <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>:</li>

<dd>I would say that the physical/special attacks of Pokemon (probably in the individual articles too), list of types in relation to Phys/Special, the types and damage multiplier is solely of use to those who are playing the game (and it's in their manuals anyway) is very much game guide information. The imbalance in early gameplay? That sounds like original research based on assumptions from playing the game (please correct me if I am wrong). And the differences between the anime and the game is information already covered in sufficient depth at the parent article, <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 19:23, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>ok, so what use are things like Chess openings, and the cost of the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly.html" title="Monopoly">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> to people who will never play the game? What use is knowing exactly how many floors the Empire State Building has if I'm never going to go there? Isn't it enough to say it's really tall? Or what use is reading about <a href="../../../p/o/k/Poker_strategy.html" title="Poker strategy">Poker strategy</a> if i'm never going to play? Jimmy said we can have that... but not a simple breakdown of Pokemon types? It's been written about, so it can be included. And FYI, phys/special breakdown and damage multipliers are not included in the game manuals. That's why they needed to be referenced. Again, WP:NOT isn't about who the article will ultimately appeal to (many of the advanced mathematics categories are much to technical for the "general audience"), game-guide is about <i>instruction</i> and <i>advice</i>. If i was to write that players should use <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donphan.html" title="Donphan">Donphan</a> against a <a href="../../../r/a/i/Raichu.html" title="Raichu">Raichu</a> because it's immune to electrical attacks, <i>that</i> would be game guide. You say that the differences between the anime and games is covered in the main article. Where? There is nothing that deals with the specific point that the anime treats types much more loosely, often even ignoring some of the basic principles. Nor is there the discussion of physical.special breakdown, and how it has changed since Diamond/Pearl. This small bit of info <i>is</i> discussed at Game mechanics, but as argued before, to include the amount of info deserving of the topic would grossly imbalance the article and distract, like Kyaa has humurously pointed out. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">ΖαππερΝαππερ</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappernapper_cf32.html" title="User talk:Zappernapper">Babel</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zappernapper_a171.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zappernapper">Alexandria</a></sub> 20:40, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> As has been said, this is clearly to extend the Pokemon Game Dynamics. It shouldn't be deleted on purposes of OR because this is how the game type system works. It is useful information, but content on the page that are opinions should be deleted. Otherwise, it stands to be a valid article of information of how the Pokemon types interact with each other - not a game guide (there are parts that read like a game guide and should be deleted). Why don't we go around and nominate ALL the subsections in Pokemon Game Dynamics then as they are the same kind of article as this one? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.7.120.157_92d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.7.120.157">24.7.120.157</a> (talk) 07:48, 10 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The time it opened shouldn't dictate <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>. There are links in the article to several professional reviews, which I would say is an indication of notability.

<li><b>Keep</b> An innovative work of drama that combines cutting edge music and theatre by two of America's most innovative cultural groups. A successful notable experiment according to the reviews. Can not be merged into either group's article, as it's a collaboration. The article could use more work. There are several articles in the media that notes much struggle between Palamer and the rest of the playwrights in the script's creation - a paragraph should be added on this with citations. <a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELentower_3d21.html" title="User:Lentower">Lentower</a> 04:14, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I asked for an explanation of the policy whereby "opening time" is a criterion for deletion of an article about a play. I was given none. This is not a reason for deletion, it's simply a POV assertion. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 02:28, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As one of the contributors, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to vote, but I think this meets the three criteria for Wikipedia articles: neutral point of view, verifiability and not original research. In fact, with the 2nd, it is more than "verifiable"; it's actually "verified". The article makes refernces to "multiple, independent" sources and is about a performance of a band with a non-trivial importance at a university also of non-trivial importance. This, I think, gives it notability, although notability does not even have the same status as an obligatory criterion that the other three aspects I mentioned do have. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Interlingua_69c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Interlingua">email</a></sup> 03:33, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Not notable enough to have a page. There are thousands of thousands books. A book must be very very notable to have a page(e.g. Bible, Quran, Dante's divine comedy etc etc).

<dd>This is an idea worth considering as most Encyclopedias would limit articles on books to the classics and a few additional works of historical significance. Few books written after <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> would fit that. However traditionally that's not been how Wikipedia does things. For example <a href="../../../2/0/0/Category%7E2005_books.html" title="Category:2005 books">Category:2005 books</a>, the year this book came out, includes things like <a href="../../../d/a/r/The_Science_of_Discworld_III%7E_Darwin%27s_Watch_f08d.html" title="The Science of Discworld III: Darwin's Watch">The Science of Discworld III: Darwin's Watch</a> or <a href="../../../a/d/v/Dead_Men_Don%27t_Leave_Tips%7E_Adventures_X_Africa_a155.html" title="Dead Men Don't Leave Tips: Adventures X Africa">Dead Men Don't Leave Tips: Adventures X Africa</a>.

<dd>I don't quite agree with this (Aminz's) view.

<li><b>Comment</b>: can people here actually discuss the issue of <i>notability</i> of this book instead of throwing around epithets like "anti-Islam" and "Islamophobic"? This is an Afd on a <i>book</i>, not a discussion of Spencer's website or his scholarly standing. If the nominator's reasoning is applied consistently, 90% of Wikipedia's articles on non-fiction books must be deleted. This is not necessarily a position I would disagree with, but we must tighten the existing policies to do so. Otherwise, the basis for the nomination seems to be at odds with the current Wikipedia practice. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 15:19, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Has anyone looked at the edit history of this article? There has been so much flack over <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> doing a broadside of AfDs of articles on books by this one controversial author that the fundimental issue has been ignored ... this artice had {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} because it lacked any <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> citations ... that's what the tag said, "This article or section does not cite its <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">references or sources</a>." That was because the only claim of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> derived from <i>simply having been written</i> by a "notable" author to satisfy <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a> ... several editors had independently put various tags on these stub articles, and other editors removed them ... those reverts escalted to this AfD and others, but it does not alter the fact that without <i><a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citations</a></i>, anything in this article (and the others) is just <i><a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a></i>, and discussions of <b>what</b> the article is about, or any editor's opinions about the subject, have no place in this forum ... the real issue is, "Will we allow articles about books with no references to any reviews of the book simply because the author has an article in Wikipedia?" What happens when <i>their</i> claim of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is based on how many articles already exist in Wikipedia about books they have written, and all of <i>those</i> articles were created by the same editor and/or their sockpuppets? I think that these AfDs simply represent a symptom of a systemic problem in Wikipedia, an alarming trend of bootstrapped notability without any <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> independent non-trivial <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a>. —72.75.85.159 (<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.75.85.159.html" title="User talk:72.75.85.159">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.75.85.159_b3d5.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.75.85.159">contribs</a>) 06:45, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Lack of sources is reason for a {{<a href="../../../s/o/u/Template%7ESources_a60f.html" title="Template:Sources">sources</a>}} tag; if there is doubt that sources can be found, an Afd is appropriate. The article does not present any facts except that it is a book, who its author is, a quote from the author, and the ISBN.

<p>Not notable enough to have a page. There are thousands of thousands books. A book must be very very notable to have a page(e.g. Bible, Quran, Dante's divine comedy etc etc). I don't expect to find this book while searching in Encyclopedia Britannica for example.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> The reviews cited in the article lack full info as to what publication they appeared in, so they smack of courtesy back cover blurbs authors give one another.

But I wish editors would stop telling us to delete it because they do not like the author's ideology. This is not "ILIKEITpedia."

<p>Not notable enough to have a page. There are thousands of thousands books. A book must be very very notable to have a page(e.g. Bible, Quran, Dante's divine comedy etc etc). I don't expect to find this book while searching in Encyclopedia Britannica for example. Aside from this, the scholarship of the author is also believed to be fundamentally flawed by university professors like <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Ernst_52f3.html" title="Carl Ernst">Carl Ernst</a>, please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Spencer#Views_on_Spencer_and_his_works" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Spencer#Views_on_Spencer_and_his_works" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>.Furthermore, if there is any controversy, it should be addressed in "Criticism of X" articles.--<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 12:55, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Spencer's views are controversial and not taken seriously by scholars to the best of my knowledge; he also runs a website that contains material that's arguably Islamophobic, as well as legitimate material.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> No, McGurk, the author being notable absolutely does not make all his books notable, per our policy on notability. The reviews cited in the article lack full info as to what publication they appeared in, so they smack of courtesy back cover blurbs authors give one another. They need to be cited to reliable independent verifiable publications to count towards notability. The Amazon sales rank of about #35,000 is not very compelling. But I wish editors would stop telling us to delete it because they do not like the author's ideology. This is not "ILIKEITpedia." And the nominator should realize that Wikipedia is not Britannica, and we let in books thousands of times less notable than the few he cites as acceptable, as does Britannica. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:03, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

The argument by analogy with Britannica is also outside of policy, as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia</a>. The argument against the author's "scholarship" is a content dispute and does not belong at AFD.

<li><b>comment</b> There are probably over ten thousand articles about books in WP. The guidelines do not say that only the most exceeding universally known go in. They just say notable. Furthermore, the comment that this book is controversial is not a reason to keep it out, it is a reason to keep it in. If there is such criticism, it would demonstrate notability.

<dd>When "policy" is imagined to trump the observation that I had heard of this term well before seeing a Wikipedia article on the subject (and therefore, this isn't some newly made neologism, but a label with some currency), this seems to me to lead to the conclusion, not that this AfD has even slight merit, but that reams and reams of "policy" ought to be on <a href="../../../m/f/d/WP%7EMfD_481c.html" title="WP:MfD">WP:MfD</a>. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 22:14, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Hardly a neologism and definitely not something which someone made up in school the other day. A google search for "intelligent dance music" produces 120,000 entries and the more frequently used term idm+ambient (for example) comes up with 1.3 million entries. A quick search on ebay for idm came up with 85 music listings. <a href="../../../y/o/r/User%7EYorkshiresky_ee54.html" title="User:Yorkshiresky">Yorkshiresky</a> 15:50, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> and massively cleanup. I don't think <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> applies here as if this is a term made up by the music media (as are most genre designations) and then written about. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> Does apply to some of the content of this article and it certainly needs some editing to take out content that doesn't meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, but on the whole I don't think the very concept or existance of the term is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and I don't think <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> necessarily applies here. Inherent POV of the term is also not an issue in my opinion, any moreso than it would be with <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trash_rock.html" title="Trash rock">Trash rock</a> or <a href="../../../e/m/o/Emo_%28music%29.html" title="Emo (music)">Emo</a>. It is a name, nothing more or less. With all due respect to Richard David James, I don't think his opinion of what his music should be categorized as is in any way relevent here. What matters is what the music media categorizes him as and if he doesn't like it he can start up a support group of "mislabeled artists" along with the multitudes of musicians who have been lumped into the catch-all of Emo... All that said, <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a> has a very good point about the reliability of the sources. Other than Allmusic, there is an audiogalaxy editorial, Usenet posts, and a couple of interviews that don't even reference the term. This is something that needs to be corrected. The fact however that in an interview with James the interviewer references the fact that his music has been called IDM and that would seem to indicate the fact that this is a known term and the way he answers the question would indicate he is familiar with the term and it is one that is common enough that it would be understood by someone who follows techno music. Of course "seem to indicate" isn't what we base articles on. I guess what I'm getting at here is that at this time I think a keep and cleanup (and if that means busting it back to a stub on the term ref'd just to the Allmusic article, so be it) is the correct course of action with no predjudice against another AfD if real <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> are not added to this article in the next month or so.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:11, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article needs work for sure, but it is a definite keeper on the basis that it is a fairly commonly used genre label. The description of the music being "intelligent" may not even accurately describe the music, but there are other music genres that arguably suffer from inaccurate labelling as well. Regardless of that, people commonly use the word and I see it often on different websites including AllMusic, and even MySpace has it as an option for artists to describe themselves as. Overall, it just needs editting and sources, and I think it can be on its way. -- <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowolf_ffd9.html" title="User:Shadowolf">Shadowolf</a> 23:34, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and stubify or restore some older not-so-much-vandalized and more NPOV version - there are such versions in the history of the article, I think. Miracles in holy books (Bible, Quran etc.) are notable field of work for both theologians (from the perspective of their faith) and social scientists who research religions from the outside point of view. We should have an article like e.g. <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miracles_attributed_to_Jesus_9e3c.html" title="Miracles attributed to Jesus">Miracles attributed to Jesus</a> also in this case.

<dd>Well if there are no scholarly sources attributing miracles to the quran, it doesn't make sense to have an article about them. And if the article exists for propaganda purposes, it is unencyclopeidac to have such an article. I think what you are talking about is already stated in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_view_of_miracles.html" title="Islamic view of miracles">Islamic view of miracles</a>. I did not nominate that article for deletion, because although it is poorly written, it has a much greater potential to become scholarly and encyclopediac.--<a href="../../../s/e/f/User%7ESefringle_0106.html" title="User:Sefringle">Sefringle</a> 02:25, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think that your premise "there are no scholarly sources attributing miracles to the quran" is wrong: The Quran itself stresses the miraculous revelation given by Allah (God) to Muhammad (e.g. Sura 41:6), and this important claim is then analyzed in the scholarly literature - for example I have at hand a copy of <i>Spurensuche - Die Weltreligionen auf dem Weg</i> by <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_K%C3%BCng_33a2.html" title="Hans Küng">Hans Küng</a> in Czech translation, where this is described on page 269. Therefore the aricle can and should be rewritten in encyclopedic manner, in my opinion.--<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 07:31, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Title does not imply that there are any miracles in the Qur'an, only that the article is about those two subjects, thus is the title perfectly NPOV. Miracles in the Qur'an would be Muslim POV. Whose point of view does "Qur'an and miracles" propagate? Even an atheist could write an article with that name, only to proceed with denying every single claimed miracle.</li>
<li>I reverted to an older version were everything is formulated as claim and nothing is takes as factual, thus, there is no NPOV problems</li>
<li>There is no Verifiability problems, anyone can check even the internet to see a plethora of Muslim websites claim miracles in the Qur'an, in fact, those claims are to be found in <i>all</i> major websites and you can even find some websites <i>dedicated</i> to explore claims of miracles.</li>
<li>You don't need a scholarly source for a topic like this, i can't find any scholarly source for Pokemon, just a lot of people that enjoy them, if you get my point. Just how many scholarly sources to you find regarding <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Trek_planets_d547.html" title="List of Star Trek planets">List of Star Trek planets</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candy_bar.html" title="Candy bar">Candy bar</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Headington_Shark_bebb.html" title="The Headington Shark">The Headington Shark</a>&#160;? And even if it were necessary, which it is not, there are lots of Muslim scholars that have written about this topic, for example Zakir Nike, just from the tip of my head.</li>
<li>Needs better sources? Sure. So fix it. But don't claim that there IS no prominent and notable Muslim sources that claim so, for the Qur'an itself makes such a claim.</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> As a Junior at the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU, we are given insight into young artists , some younger than ourselves, from all over the world who are creating notable works. Maxwell Rockman is someone whose work we have looked at. In fact he visited NYU this November and shared some of his ideas on capturing what he calls ' moments of reality' with a camera. His work is very intriguing and is certainly worthy of merit. As for the books, they are exclusive art books that were only available to art institutions. We have the books here at Tisch and from what I heard from some of my professors, the books were only printed for a short time. The gallery Roy was a small gallery that featured young and old artists alike. It closed two years ago because the owner died. From what I remember( I visited it 3 years ago) the owner, who was very old and had a ton of money( again, this is what one of my professors told me), displayed all many different pieces from different artists that he thought were outstanding. He had no website and the gallery was only open for a two years. I do remember a small article in the Times about it which prompted me to see it for myself. I believe I know who this bobthefatass character is. He may, in fact, be one of our professors who proclaimed, after Maxwell left, that someone like him should have a wikipedia page. I cannot tell you why there were two cases of vandalism, but I do know that our professors are not too fond of Wikipedia and one, I'm not going to name names, showed us a page he "reworked," which was quickly changed back to its original state. From what I have read, this article is fairly accurate, and I see no reason to remove it. [[User: photogdelriowiki] 4:22, 10 Jan. 2007

<li>This is, indeed, my first "edit" for I came across this discussion when looking up Rockman just for fun on Wikipedia( after remembering what my professor said). I thought I might throw in my two cents, because this article is true( and humorous...I recieved the same award as did everyone else!). In small art circles, mainly fine arts colleges and photogrpahy groups, Mr. Rockman is considered one of the new age photogrpahers who is creating great art. Having his name, as well as a small bio, in such a public database, is an excellent way for him to become 'known.' As said before, he is recognized, but not by everyday 'casual' photogrpahers who would certainly get a kick out of his work. User:Photogdelriowiki 8:27, 10 Jan. 2007
<ul>
<li>This is exactly the point -- <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#SOAP" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a> or forum for becoming known, Wiki is an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> or repository of knowledge. If you believe so strongly in Mr. Rockman, then wait for him to become notable and we will all happily help you create a fine article on his work. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMindsEye_e83c.html" title="User:TheMindsEye">TheMindsEye</a> 02:15, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I believe you miss the point that the creator is trying to make. This is an article about an artist, that at least is known by professionals. If Wikipedia monitors, like yourselves, choose to delete it, then why not delete articles relating to things like certain bacteria that only a few scientists care about. He is a reference, just like bacteria. What I meant about becoming known is that he can be accessed by other individuals without knowledge of him to gain insight into new artists. User: Photogdelriowiki 10:45, 10 jan 2007
<ul>
<li>I'm not accustomed to the comparison of photographers and bacteria, but the novelty has a certain charm. Two things are involved here: (i) the verifiability of the facts claimed for the photographer/bacterium, and (ii) the meeting of notability criteria for photographers/bacteria. That a bacterium is unknown to anyone outside a group of scientists is beside the point. As for photographers, <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Rossier_1b23.html" title="Pierre Rossier">Pierre Rossier</a> is probably very little known, but he gets an article because the claims made for him within it are verifiable and because of his roles both of pioneer and of teacher of photographers as notable as <a href="../../../u/e/n/Ueno_Hikoma_8f36.html" title="Ueno Hikoma">Ueno Hikoma</a>. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 04:16, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I say that you may, not nescesarily have to, but possibly delete the "Soil" page, but if so, add the information on it to the top of the System of a Down page, as it being "Pre-System of a Down". I don't however think you should delete the two artists pages, due to the fact that they were technically part of one of the greatest alternative metal bands in history. Just think of them as "former members" and leave their pages as they are.</li>

<p><b>del</b> . 100% foreign dicdef (the 100% adequate tranlsation is "Orthodox church") with some incoherent rambling that churches can be big and small and in some languages orhtodox and catholic churches may be called by diffrent words. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 17:17, 9 January 2007 (UTC) <i><b>NOTE</b></i> This deletion nomination was changed (around 06:03, 11 January 2007 ) after it was started and after quite a bit of debate. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 14:39, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

(If there were a specific article abou the architecture of Orthodox churches, I'd say redirect it there, but no such article seems to exist.) Redirects are cheap and there seem to be a decent number of English hits for the term on Google books (~800 total hits, of which about 1 in 20 are English). <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 23:02, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It's rather obscure, but photographs of cerkiew have a strong following in the high end art photography world--this is something not necessary going to show up on the internet. It's obscure, but has a following in the modern context, and could use with a better article, maybe a translation from Pl.wiki. I do know some Old Church Slavonic linguists, so this may also be why I'm familiar with the term, but I think it comes from dealing with gallery owners, and the art world's fascination with images of the Central and Eastern European wooden cerkiew. The word is also used in Russian, and it generally refers to the wooden cerkiew, not the brick ones, when Americans speak about it in photographs. It's the sort of knowledge of a remote topic that people may look up, but other internet sites won't be offering articles about it. I can't actually follow the criteria for deletion that Mikka is offering, but they appear to be criteria for <i><a href="../../../c/l/e/WP%7ECLEAN_1f3d.html" title="WP:CLEAN">WP:CLEAN</a></i> not for <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a>. Again, <i><b>crappy</b></i> is reason for tagging for clean-up and wikifying, not for deleting. Possibly some photographs, gallery owners, and art collectors on Wikipedia can give more information--I wanted to buy a print once, but it was way out of my league. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 00:06, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Uncontrolled borrowing is not an argument for arbitrariy enriching English language. I am repeating (and try to prove me that I am wrong): <b>the notion 100% corresponds to "Orthodox church"</b>. It is not simply "crappy" I dont suggesting a redirect simpy because this article does not have any content at all beyond polish-english translation. "they are small, but some are big" - very encyclopedic. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 01:24, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agree that the term corresponds 100% to Orthodox church (with a small "c", so this shouldn't redirect to <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Church_6706.html" title="Orthodox Church">Orthodox Church</a>). But that's pretty much the point of a redirect; replacing an article/search term which isn't a good title or has no useful content, to point somewhere that actually does have content and is a good title. This is a fairly well-established practise; see {{<a href="../../../r/_/f/Template%7ER_from_alternative_language_3b93.html" title="Template:R from alternative language">R from alternative language</a>}}. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 01:35, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>this practice makes sense when a word has a notable currency in English. In your lack of knowledge you even don't see an ironical mockery over the common sense: usage of a <b>polish</b> word to describe an <b><a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodox_f7f5.html" title="Eastern Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a></b> thing. Hint: poles are <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholics</a>. As for "R from.." are you going to make a redirect from zerkiew, sterkov, cerkow, zerkov and a dozen of other languages and transliteraitons as well? Hint: poles are <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholics</a>. While we are here, why don't we also make arkhitektura to point to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_architecture.html" title="Russian architecture">Russian architecture</a>?</li>
<li>Concluding, if you don't know a topic you are discussing, you may happily apply rules to screw up any common sense. Ever tried to translate a poem into <a href="../../../t/u/v/Tuvan_language.html" title="Tuvan language">Tuvan language</a> using a dictionary? `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 03:19, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Try observing <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, which you seem to have a problem with when you come on AfD lately. The word has been seen in English-language books, which is good enough reason to make it a redirect. And since you were the one who kept repeating "the word corresponds 100% to Orthodox church", I was <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming you actually meant what you said</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 03:50, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>"the word corresponds 100% to Orthodox church" <b>as translated from Polish language</b>. The word does not have presence in English but for <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polonization.html" title="Polonization">Polonized</a> names of some Ukrainian churches. The word is even not Ukrainian, man! (which would be <i>tserkva</i>, церква). That's why I am saying, if you don't know things, you beter <b>ask</b> people who know. Google may screw you up for good, if you don't know what you are looking at. You see the word popping up, but you fail to judge the context properly. And this, like my previous remarks, is not a personal offense, but a word of caution. But if you prefer to feel offended, suit yourself. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 07:18, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> If merge, to <i><a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_%28building%29.html" title="Church (building)">Church (building)</a></i>, not to <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">Church</a>, as it is about the building, not the church, so it corresponds to part of the definition. That's the issue about borrowing words, they don't always borrow exactly--and this one as I have heard it used by Americans did not get borrowed into English to mean what it means in Polish. The English word for "Orthodox church" is "Orthodox church" or "Orthodox Church," it's not "cerkiew". "Cerkiew" as it is used in American-English, as far as I have heard, <i>only</i> refers to wooden Orthodox church buildings in Poland and Lithuania, not to all Orthodox church buildings, not to the ones in America, for example. If we are speaking Polish it means something different. It's like the offensive slang term "Polak" in American English, it is not an offensive term for a person of Polish descent in Polish, it means Polish man in Polish. So, we're speaking English, not Polish. What "cerkiew" means in Polish is not what is at stake for the article. What is, is what it means in English as a borrow word. I still think it is better to consult with someone in the know about the use of the term in American English.<a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 02:30, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> But these aren't the reasons you gave for the nomination. And that's an even more basic rule of the game: nobody has to read your mind. You said to delete because it's "100% dicdef." <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 03:47, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK My bad. Sloppy nominaion indeed. Updated a bit.`'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 06:03, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>However, the discussion above was based upon your <i>original</i> nomination, you can't just change it now as if that was what was up for discussion the entire time--you should strike out your original reason and redate the nomination--I have added a note right below the nomination to alert others that what was discussed until this post, wasn't what is currently listed for nomination. Still, you've now changed it to something that isn't so, <i><b>it isn't a foreign dictionary definition, it's in English.</b></i> And, again, you haven't nominated it for deletion for <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> or <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, but for "100% foreign dicdef." Meanwhile <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> has provided a reasonable alternative, however, which deals with your reason for deletion, that it's a dictionary definition, and with concerns related to lack of sources and verifiability. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 14:39, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is not a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court_of_law.html" title="Court of law">court of law</a> where you may motion to dismiss on a technicality. The article must be discussed here, not the form of my nomination; the goal here in <b>not</b> to prove that my nomination is without merit, but to prove that the <b>article</b> has sufficient merits. A discussion may reveal both merits and new drawbacks. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 02:13, 13 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So, exactly WHICH nomination of yours are we discussing? The discussion above was about your first nomination, which you've now changed. Are you saying that you want to attribute all prior discussion to your first nomination? You haven't raised any criteria from the guidelines for AfD and you're the one who demanded that others play by the rules of the game. So, others play by the rules of the game and you change the rules when and where you want? Is that it now? If you're going to raise rules of the game for others, then it should be expected that other editors will challenge you to play by them also. You changed your nomination and made it look like it was some other nomination that editors were discussing. You could have simply renominated, or you could have added a line and comment. You chose neither. The issue of whether or not the article has merits is hinged solely upon the following arguments you now offer (not the same ones discussed): "100% foreign dicdef (the 100% adequate tranlsation is "Orthodox church") with some incoherent rambling that churches can be big and small and in some languages orhtodox and catholic churches may be called by diffrent words." However, your argument that it is a foreign dictionary definition is incorrect. This is en.Wikipedia and the article is in English. You decided what merits should be discussed, and the primary one you raise does not exist. Are you now suggesting the article doesn't need to be in Wikipedia for some other reason that you haven't revealed, that's it is without merit for some additional reason? Another user offered a perfectly acceptable solution that others agreed with, but you don't. So, how and why is this article without merit, and why should other editors' contributions and solutions be ignored? Is this about improving Wikipedia? <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 16:40, 13 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, and again, <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> provided a reasonable and useful solution to the issue of what to do.

<li><b>Comment</b> - and as stated in the nomination, these examples are an arbitrary selection, for which each example would more properly placed in the article about the individual.

<li>It illustrates the power of words that people in the spotlight can have, and is certainly allowed to use examples to illustrate the problems that offensive remarks can have.

<dd>A quote taken out of context and written by a sociologist who sees only a piece of an elephant (who does't know this palabre about five blinds who tried to describe an animal?) and too smart for his own good.

<dd>OK I wil not argue. I may well be wrong as anyone else. Therefore we have voting for deletion here, not just a set of "chief editors" who can just delete pages. Still, the article has no authority with the exception of the part about statistich of housing. "Human territory" here is an unreferenced speculation and overgeneralization. "<a href="../../../d/w/e/Dwelling.html" title="Dwelling">Dwelling</a>" is a term in its own, treated separately from "<a href="../../../t/e/r/Territory.html" title="Territory">territory</a>." `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 17:16, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Small promotion, that got very little notable google hits. Wikipedia isn't a guide to every promotion ever.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Southern Cameroon is not a nation. Cameroon is, and plays good soccer, I'm told. Also, the south of Cameroon does not have many english speakers because that area was French under the League of Nations mandate after 1919. The northern part was British.

<ul>
<li>This doesn't need to be AfD'd; if the article above is deleted, the redirect will be speedied under criterion 1 for redirects.

<li>I'm confused... the redirect goes to <a href="../../../b/o/_/Bo_Buchanan_55e7.html" title="Bo Buchanan">Bo Buchanan</a>, which doesn't seem to be up for AfD or speedy. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheQuandry_2564.html" title="User:TheQuandry">TheQuandry</a> 16:11, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Originally, the redirect was to <a href="../../../b/o/_/Bo_and_Nora_Buchanan_7bed.html" title="Bo and Nora Buchanan">Bo and Nora Buchanan</a>, which is up for AfD. Apparently it was changed to redirect to <a href="../../../b/o/_/Bo_Buchanan_55e7.html" title="Bo Buchanan">Bo Buchanan</a> before this AfD began, which I did not notice when I wrote my comment. At any rate, if TAnthony or any other user wants to have this redirect deleted, <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFD_9e02.html" title="WP:RFD">WP:RFD</a> is the right place for that, so this AfD still isn't really valid. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeimstern_8a02.html" title="User:Heimstern">Heimstern Läufer</a> 02:38, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - they have not been treated in multiple non-trivial independent works (the book is penned by one of the crew's members, so only the BBC doc qualifies).

<li><b>Keep</b> - I believe the subject does meet the notability criteria, as per Oldelpaso's arguments. While I understand up to a certain point Qwghlm's objection that the book does not count, as it was penned by one of the members, I would argue that <i>reviews</i> of that book (taking it seriously as a documentary source about a notable phenomenon). Just after a very brief search, two different reviews here, a more academic one and a webzine one: <a href="http://www.pierretristam.com/pdfs/wc1.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pierretristam.com/pdfs/wc1.pdf" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> <a href="http://www.uppers.org/showArticle.asp?article=706" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uppers.org/showArticle.asp?article=706" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>, as well as listings from mainstream retailers such as HMV.

<li><b>Delete</b> Naruto is a popular franchise, but to go to this much detail is to provide too much information. The series is notable, but that does not make every microscopic detail of anything mentioned in it notable enough to have a Wikipedia article. Not unless for each of these Jutsu's the article's creators can furnish multiple independent sources where it is the subject. The fact that it is seen in an episode or gets a passing reference in a game guide does not show it is notable. By that token, after almost 120 years of dedicated fancruft, Sherlock Holmes' nemesis Prof. Moriarty deserves an article, but Holmes' pipe and his syringe do not. Startrek has had a huge fan base for 40 years, but we do not need an article telling what kind of imaginary batteries to put in the phasor or other details in the fictional tech manual.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 22:53, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

This list will either stay or be removed <i>regardless</i> of the current state of the Naruto television show.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I'm not singling out attacks from the anime "filler" episodes, I'm saying a large number of attacks / jutsu in general aren't notable, including those in the comic / manga. As for the "lots of work" argument, I belive that doesn't really count here (I'm not an expert), but as I've said above, if there's another place that'll take the list (is there a Naruto wiki?) then there's nothing to stop it being moved. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredOrAlive_8809.html" title="User:FredOrAlive">FredOrAlive</a> 15:53, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

And do not make such judgments as "<i>seems</i> like Naruto-cruft" or "<i>seem</i> to be explained" if you didn't actually look at the articles. This is important information. Naruto ninjutsu is a complicated matter, therefore it's reasonably necessary to keep the articles with the aim of explaining the issue.

<li><b>Keep it!</b> I know it's "fluff", but it's meaningful fluff! It adds a lot of supplementary information to the "Naruto" universe. I really think it should be kept on, as-is.64.251.48.178 19:09, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>- All of these abilities apply to all of the characters and their development. (filler and all) why throw away all of this work? <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVerde830_8d5a.html" title="User:Verde830">Verde830</a> 20:37, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>- The pages is good for new Naruto fans who wants to se how the technique has been used and who can use it and what kind of magic the Naruto characters can use. Jacce 21:42, 10 January 2007</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I hate to turn into a raving inclusionist on this one, but the article is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> - the specific anime and manga (on the other hand, those are primary sources). The overall subject (Naruto) is clearly notable, so we're really dealing with a question of how much specificity should the Naruto <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_series_3a8d.html" title="Wikipedia:Article series">article series</a> contain. The closest thing to a relevant guideline, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html#Fiction_in_Wikipedia" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Notability (fiction)</a> states <i>Minor characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be merged with short descriptions into a "List of characters." This list should reside in the article relating to the work itself, unless either becomes long, in which case a separate article for the list is good practice.</i> This article is well written given the subject matter, meets the core policies, and seems to be dead on with the relevant section of Notability (fiction). Ultimately, I say keep. With respect, other than the argument that it's primary sourced, which is not grounds for deletion, the main deletion argument looks a lot like some flavor of IDONTLIKEIT to me. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 21:09, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Squil, you are right that it doesn't meet the "out of universe" style guideline - I only meant that it was, IMHO, well written in a more colloquial sense. I do encourage the Naruto editors to start a project to bring their pages more in line with the style guides, but of course, that's not grounds for deletion. The relevant section of Notability (fiction), IMHO, is the section I put in italics above. IMHO, this is "Minor concepts . . . merged with short descriptions" and placed in a separate article because the wouldn't fit in the main article. According to the Notability (fiction) notes, the guideline was based in large parts over debates about Lord of the Rings -- compare <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Middle-earth_weapons_b5c4.html" title="List of Middle-earth weapons">List of Middle-earth weapons</a> for a similar level of fictioncruft and/or encyclopedic detail.

<li><b>Keep</b> Please don't let this articles being delate. I know alot of people who use this articles in their Naruto fanfiction story for the info that it gave on all the ninjutsu. I being one of them and it would be alot harded to write the way the ninjutsu work without this articles and the other type of jutsu to. Plus this articles give the fan of Naruto the ninjutsu of the show that haven't been air yet in the USA and the manga one to. Miyuki97 02:43, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Usefulness is not a criterion for inclusion. Please cite other reasons besides the usefulness amongst Naruto fans. There are many things that are both true and useful that can't be included in the encyclopedia, because <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INDISCRIMINATE" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. <font color="#0099CC"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 02:51, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> per everyone else. A merge wouldn't work, the article it got merged with would be too long, so it is all or nothing. Naruto was previsly #13 (or something) on the most recently visted articles list meaning that many IP's and registered members look at Naruto and Naruto related articles. This action would piss off the IP's and cause trouble for those who edit these pages constantly (myself included) and there you would be sitting pretty with not a care in the world while we sit here answering IP after IP on why we have no ninjutsu article then we would complain to you and you would be tired then everyone would get uncivil and an edit war would start and the article would come back. Ha, reminds me of the post World War 1 era up into WW2.<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_ov_the_blue_sand_359d.html" title="User:Sam ov the blue sand">Sam ov the blue sand</a> 02:57, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is not francruft, and despite its length, is an important part of the Naruto universe. By the logic of this discussion, as well, deleting this section would imply the deletion of every other list of jutsu. Especially with the more complex ones, see <a href="../../../k/e/k/Kekkei_genkai.html" title="Kekkei genkai">Kekkei genkai</a>, it is highly difficult for a reader of any of these articles to make any sort of sense of them when any of the above are mentioned. Ninjutsu, by happenstance, simply happens to be the largest article. Size can be corrected. The original intent of the article is entirely fine. <a href="../../../s/e/p/User%7ESephiroth_BCR_dc57.html" title="User:Sephiroth BCR">Sephiroth BCR</a> 02:59, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, a necessary part of comprehensive coverage of the series. In fact, a necessary part of comprehensible coverage of the series. Far from being fancruft, this glossary page is necessary to keep the rest of the pages from becoming fancruft, in that without it they would be impossible for the non-fan to understand. They do suffer from some serious <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> concerns due to their listing of jutsu by editor-invented English translations rather than the romaji forms, but that can be solved without deleting them. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 06:55, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'd like to comment from a neutral point of view here. There are some very good cases on the deletion side while discussions coming from the keep side are baseless. Yes a lot of people have contributed to this article, does that help it surviving an Afd? No.
<dl>
<dd>Yes Naruto is popular and this collection of lists is helpful to fans - doesn't help saving it from deletion.</dd>
<dd>The articles aren't well written, they're too in-universe. Does that mean they should be deleted? No.</dd>
<dd>Do they violate any Wikipedia policies? Yes, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information (#7)</a>
<dl>
<dd><i>Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain <b>real-world context</b> and <b>sourced analysis</b>, offering detail on a work's achievements, <b>impact or historical significance</b>, not solely a summary of that work's plot.

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I think that the problem with this afd is that people voting on the keep side should vote with their contributions to fixing the article up. The articles need to be rewritten as per <a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a>, and in an out-universe manner with in-line references to have the indiscriminate collection of information issues resolved.</dd>

<li>Yeah, something similar. That particular article sounds strongly like a merge/trim candidate - there's dozens of small forks of major distributions where the primary difference is the apps that get installed by default. (I'm not objecting to forks in general, however; Ubuntu itself is a fork of Debian, but they've done considerably more work than just tweaking the default install, namely, developed new software, new release processes, and have developer commitment of major scale.)

<p>Previous <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_EXpressDSP_de7c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/EXpressDSP">AfD</a> was in May 2006. The decision was no concensus, and the article has not been updated since. This article is orphaned and its notability is, in my opinion, very low.

<dd>Getting back to the subject at hand, since these things are hallmarks of the series, I can't understand deleting them. These things are often intrinsic to the plot of the episode they are in, not just minor things like gas stations. It's clear to me that if you're writing an article about the episode these things are in, you'd include them, so I have no problem with it being presented in this other format. So, I have to ask, are you familiar with this show? Because it seems to me that deleting this would be akin to deleting an article listing aliens in Star Trek, or places Sam Beckett jumped to in Quantum Leap. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 06:10, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I very well might vote to delete such articles depending on how I felt after reviewing them. I would <i>definitely</i> vote to delete an indiscriminate list of one-off ST aliens and pets and I'd vote to delete a list of, say, one-off outfits, cars and siblings-of-leaped-into people from QL. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 14:10, 10 January 2007 (UTC
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't, because AFD is not a vote. I also wouldn't argue such, as that kind of list would be highly informative about the show. Personally, I wish <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Quantum_Leap_characters_5a68.html" title="List of Quantum Leap characters">List of Quantum Leap characters</a> had a description of the leapees instead of just names. I'm glad <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Trek_races_8de7.html" title="List of Star Trek races">List of Star Trek races</a> does. And perhaps you should review them, and consider this list in that context. Now I don't think every car in QL should get an article. I can't think of any car that would even warrant a description. In KND the vehicles do matter though, a lot. Again, are you familiar with this show? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 16:51, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Oh dear god, are you really going to get all Peter Pedantic because I said "vote"? I <i>know</i> AfD isn't a vote and you know as well as I do that any number of people refer to the process casually as voting. And as I've been trying to explain, my objection to this list is that it is <b>indiscriminate</b>. It lists villains AND inventions AND pets indiscriminately, and it lists items which appear in a single episode and are otherwise completely lacking in notability either within or outside the series. I would not object to a list of Star Trek aliens. I would object to an indisctiminate list of ST aliens AND pets AND whatever, and I would object to an indiscriminate list of QT outfits AND cars AND siblings. If the individual villains are notable, make a list of villains. If the individual pets are notable, make a list of pets. If the individual members of this list aren't notable then slapping them all together on a list doesn't make them notable. Note them in articles for the episodes if they exist or get rid of them. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 18:29, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, but did I offend you by noting that an AFD is not a vote? I didn't mean to do so. I've had people chide me for the same mistake. I realize that it is one, but I try to resist being irritated by having my mistakes pointed out. It is hard though, so I understand if you were offended. My bad. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:17, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Back to the article, this isn't an indiscriminate list, not in general, as the episodes of Codename: Kids Next Door are about these very things. I think the problem is, you're confused by the list title, which I can see is misleading. That may be part of the problem. I should have realized this sooner, my bad. What this is, is a list of the things used by the bad guys in the show. I'm not sure of a better title, but I do agree it needs one. However, given the nature of the show, I can understand why a list might be important. But it is not as much like the example you gave of ST lists and QL lists. There's actually a pretty solid connection there, but if you aren't familiar with the show, you might not recognize it.</dd>
<dd>Which leads to me repating my question though, are you familiar with this show? I've asked several times, but I can't find a response by you on it. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:17, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The criteria for notability is universal, not relative to the issue it pertains to. For instance, just because 1. Quantum leap is notable and 2. The description of leapees in Quantum leap is important to the show Quantum leap, does not mean that a description of leapees in Quantum leap is notable. Same goes with local issues- if an issue is only notable to a particular subset of people, it doesn't meet the notability criteria. Although "Codename: Kids Next Door" may be a notable television show, that doesn't imply that every aspect of the show is notable. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnpseudo_5ea4.html" title="User:Johnpseudo"><b>johnpseudo</b></a> 19:47, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>While <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> also recommends that information on a company's products should be incorporated in the article on the company itself - in this case, Linksys, as Zunaid suggested. However, WP:CORP also says that "major" products should have their own articles. "The distinction between a 'minor' and a 'major' product is somewhat arbitrary. The main point is that if a lot of information is available on a product, it should be split out, and if little is available, it should be merged into a list." While the Linksys iPhone is undoubtedly not "major" in the overall consumer electronics industry, there is certainly a lot of information available on the product and thus meets the criteria for a separate article. <b><a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchi_5602.html" title="User:Schi">schi</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchi_51f0.html" title="User talk:Schi"><font color="orange">talk</font></a></sup> 19:44, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It has been over five months since the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Bose_Headphone_Family_f44a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bose Headphone Family">original AFD</a>. Despite the promises by a number of editors to clean up the advertising language in the article and provide sources, the article today still reads like an advertisement. With the exception of a single product review in a newspaper, all of the sources cited by the article are either published by Bose or by business partners of Bose.</p>
<p>The encyclopedic information here boils down to two sentences: "The Bose corporation produces a line of audio headphones. They are known for their use of active noise cancellation." These statements are already included in the article <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bose_Corporation_7635.html" title="Bose Corporation">Bose Corporation</a>.</p>

<dd>Please <b>stop</b> reposting text that is easily accessed in the previous discussion. Please do not <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">disrupt Wikipedia to make a point</a>. It is important that you resist the urge to flood this page with comments. Ensure that you are adding something substantial to the discussion before saving your changes. (Hint: if you feel that you are repeating yourself, it is probably not something substantial.)</dd>
<dd>As I noted before, a stale dump of external links in an AFD does not fix the problems in the article. I enumerated clearly the fundamental deficiencies in the article. It lacks independent non-trivial sources. It reads like a shopping catalog, eschewing discussion of the history and impact of the product in favor of an unencyclopedic litany of product features and specifications. It brazenly includes external links to product pages at the Best Buy web site.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. The lists of unremarkable information (for example, "magnetically shielded ear cup", "3.5mm stereo plug", MSRP's in three different currencies, minute variations in the rotational angles of product parts) are exactly what is meant by "indiscriminate collection of information" and should be removed. The unfalsifiable and subjective assertions (for example, "better treble performance", "much more effective at attenuating noise") scattered throughout the article serve no purpose except to promote the products of a company. Wikipedia is not a platform for free marketing.</dd>
<dd>I've already indicated that, as far as I can tell, there are two kernels of encyclopedic information in this page. Bose sells a range of headphones. They are noted for their use of active noise cancellation. The rest is cruft that could not possibly interest anyone unless he's shopping for electronics.</dd>
<dd>Lastly, there was no consensus to keep the article. The previous AFD, as you'll note, was closed with a decision of <b>no consensus</b>, with a recommendation that the page needed substantial cleanup. The only viable cleanup strategy I can conceive of for this page is #REDIRECT [[Bose Corporation]], so please excuse my reluctance to be instantly reverted rather than bring it here for discussion first. <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 06:46, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The only reason the price was mentioned is in an effort to be thorough. It was not plastered all over the place it doesn't seem to be that unusual inside of wikipedia.

And you will notice that the specs of these products are clearly listed also. These are standards for an encyclopedia to list facts and these are facts. Now saying "better treble performance" is listed as items that Bose claims to have improved from the previous version and should be cited as such. But such things as "magnetically shielded" is something that is listed as one of its features...

<dd>Yes, I am sure there is other junk in the encyclopedia, and it does not surprise me that it has appeared in Apple and Nintendo articles. That is not relevant here, because it is not those articles under discussion.</dd>
<dd>My point with "magnetically shielded", "3.5mm stereo plug" and so forth is that those bits of information don't even add anything to <i>shopping</i> research on the product. We've already said they're consumer headphones; it follows quite obviously that they will be magnetically shielded and have the standard plug. As Zunald notes below, if we remove the advert material we're left with little more than the first few sentences. Those bits are easily merged into <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bose_Corporation_7635.html" title="Bose Corporation">Bose Corporation</a>. <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 14:31, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My point with showing you all of these Apple pages with prices was the fact that I showed you only one company and they all had the cost listed. If you were to search through wikipedia you will find that almost every single one out there lists the MSRP. Like it or not it is the standard. Heck I showed you this last time and you had the same answer that its their problem. Well as you see 5 months later it was conclusive that the price should stay and not only that we should list the prices for the entire wold for some systems.... I don't see any nominations that the iPod page is an Ad I don't see the XBox 360 listed similarly...</dd>
<dd>Also if you are talking about headphones it is important to list how it connects since there are two main types out there 1/8th inch (aka 3.5mm) and 1/4 inch stereo connections. It is like saying how the Wii connects to the TV using composite, s-video or component. When one talks about technology you need specifics when connecting to another technology. The magnetically shielded is specifically listed because it is a difference between a previous model and a reason why some accessories (for the cell phone) will not work with the previous model. Actually if you remove the "adverts" as you claim you are left with simple facts including citations, R&amp;D (cited thanks to Dpbsmith), the timeline, A long list of facts for the quiet comforts that will take up a page, Simple facts about the non noise canceling headphones (i.e. triports) that will take up another page, The Aviation headphones that fact wise is very complete and again takes up a lot of space, Blurbs about the Combat Vehicle Crewman Headset, the entire American Airlines section, and the Criticisms section that I personally think needs some expansion. This would still be a separate article since there is so much plain and simple facts about the products out there. -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 02:49, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>, add maintenance tags and improve. As far as I can see, this is an abuse of Afd, as an article for this topic is clearly warranted, and the current article goes a long way to filling that need. The previous outcome stated "Those issues can and should be addressed by editing." I'm not a fan of direct links to BestBuy, and I'm sure I can find other faults, but those can be fixed by editing.

<ul>
<li>I resent this kind of criticism, as I have tried to help. The section headed "research" is essentially my work and is one of the few portions of the article not sourced to Bose. I have tried to trim the worst excesses in terms of promotional language. I have pushed and helped to find pictures that simply show the headphones, rather than earlier attractive young women dancing with headphones or handsome middle-aged men in expensive suits registering dignified satisfaction while wearing headphones. In the time since I've last worked on the article, fresh advertising-copy-like material has been added on more Bose headphones. There is absolutely no indication that anyone is seriously working on an encyclopedia article about Bose headphones or that the article is improving over time. Since the last AfD, it has gotten worse in every respect criticized in the previous AfD. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 11:07, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>How has it gotten worse? Those images are no longer there, much of the offending informations specifically stated was removed and as you said you went through the article and did a great job in helping... btw you were one of the few to stick around and help so thanks... Nothing so blatant as has <i>advertising-copy-like material</i> has been added the article since the last AfD. The only drastic change was inclusions of the On-ears and In-ears and they are very terse sections stating that they exist. They were added when they premiered and not much has been changed in those sections. I would have done more editing but I had a long wikibreak after the last AfD and personal life got in the way.

<li>I am not whining that specific people have not fixed the article. I am asserting that in five months, even the most dedicated Bose editors have not been able to turn this into much more than a litany of consumercruft, and that this effectively demonstrates that there is no propensity for Wikipedia to produce an encyclopedic article on Bose headphones at the present time. I have already indicated my proposed cleanup of the article; it consists of the two sentences' worth of encyclopedic information I was able to find. Once one is forced to reduce an article to that length, AfD follows not only appropriately but as a matter of course. <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 14:36, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> — Some of the marketing language and the upgrade pricing information can be foregone to make it a bit more encyclopedic.

<li><b>Comment</b> It appears that some editors of this article will not accept what might be called the "zero-based approach" of cutting it down to a stub and selectively adding back encyclopedic, verifiable, neutral information that is not entirely sourced to Bose Corporation sources.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I don't even use them, but I know that the individual products are notable. An objective description can be given, and it should have been done, and I am about to do a little of it. Deletion of the article is not the remedy for excessive commercial content. Reporting price in such articles is a dilemma. It is normally material for a catalog page or a website, not WP, but in some cases the pricing is itself notable. In this case, that the headphones are such a success despite being priced above competitive projects is relevant. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:22, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b>I have now made a first pass at copyediting , mainly at the first portions. I have, undoubtedly more controversially, boldly removed the hidden product specifications. This is much better done with external links &amp; I assume the existing external links lead to them.</dd>
<dd>It rather startles me that outside sources could not be found for documenting the various features, considering the very large number of product reviews that have appeared. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:41, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm glad that you agree on the articles worth and ecstatic that you decided to help improve the page. Though I do think the specifications are a necessity and if you check any well documented article dedicated to a product you will see that they list them also, with notable examples including <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a>, <a href="../../../x/b/o/Xbox_360.html" title="Xbox 360">Xbox_360</a> &amp; <a href="../../../p/l/a/PlayStation_3_8051.html" title="PlayStation 3">PlayStation 3</a>. So I do think that we should list specifications. The reason that they were using hidden text was to save space and to focus on the article itself allowing the reader the choice of reading the info or not. As one user said, these are just facts and a any good article should use the facts as the basis of everything else that appears. Do you know of any solution to including this? I wont revert back for a while to see if a solution presents itself&#160;:-) -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 02:37, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It is much better without the specifications. The Bose Corporation has a perfectly good website where anyone interested can find this sort of details.

<dd>It actually does not list all the specifications... Go to the Bose website and try to find the decibel rating, driver size, operating temperature, impedance or the Magnet type. Bose does not list such information and it was through a lot of digging that such information was found. But like stated before is it not a common practice on wikipedia to list such tings?

<li><b>apology</b>I am Samgoody777.

<li>this page will be deleted. why all of the beating around the bush? i will not repost this word if it is deleted. the points that y'all have made make it clear that chreamo is not ready for inclusion in an encyclopedia. i was ignorant as to the purpose and integrity of Wikipedia as an accurate source for solid information.--<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamgoody777_6b2e.html" title="User:Samgoody777">Samgoody777</a> 01:22, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The page has been moved and recreated here: Christian emo, I think it should also be deleted (see talk page). <a href="../../../x/d/i/User%7EXdiabolicalx_68c5.html" title="User:Xdiabolicalx">Diabolical</a> 15:01, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This is also posted on the newly moved page, but I felt that to re-emphasize my point, it should be posted here as well, so here it goes:
<ul>
<li>What happened? Is this a different page? I once remember a Chreamo page filled with a plethora of useful knowledge about the uprising, once underground genre of Chreamo. Now, I seem to have stumbled upon a page full of babbling nothingness that can be found anywhere else on the Internet.</li>
<li>Chreamo is an uprising fad at my school. The punk, Goth, Emo and scene kids have vanished into the past and Chreamo is what all the cute guys are talking about. And, being the pathetic follower that I am, I decided that by researching Chreamo for myself I may actually have the opportunity to fulfill my destiny with the man of my dreams (this is, after the fact that I make eye contact with him, after the fact that I awkwardly drop my pencil and hope that he picks it up, and after the fact that I tell all my friends about him hoping they’ll keep it a secret when deep down, I know they’ll tell him I like him since I‘m too shy to say it myself.)</li>
<li>The previous Chreamo page was the only website that gave the specifics about the Chreamo clique-everything from what bands are “hot and happening”, to what to wear, and how to act. True, it could have provided a picture or two of a very cute Chreamo kid with hazel eyes, light brown hair, black, white and red checkered Vans that are ripped on the left, and typical Chreamo garb, topped off with a stripped scarf, but other than that I found the previous page to be highly informational.</li>
<li>As cheesy as this sounds I actually felt as if I had a feeling of belonging and self worth, something that I hadn’t found anywhere else on the Internet including EHarmony.com (why was I looked for self worth on the Internet? I have no idea, just call me a troubled soul who searches relentlessly for the next trend so I can fit in with the “it crowd.”</li>
<li>Now, that feeling is no longer and I feel even worse. I feel as if I’m sinking back into my rock bottom state of depression, never again wanting to commit to any activity, only wanting to float around until I fly away, never to return to this lonely planet they call Earth.</li>
<li>So much for my life as a Chreamo. Now, all I seem to have to look forward to is a padded cell…</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I gave this pup a good overhaul; now it focuses on Christian emo music, but also mentions "Chremo." — <b>Phantasy Phanatik</b> | <a href="../../../p/h/a/User_talk%7EPhantasy_Phanatik_518a.html" title="User talk:Phantasy Phanatik">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Phantasy_Phanatik_516a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Phantasy Phanatik">contribs</a> 10:49, 14 January 2007 (UTC)
