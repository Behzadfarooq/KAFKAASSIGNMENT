<li>The previous VfD resulted in a clear vote for deletion (explicitly discussed and rejected was the suggestion that the page be kept and turned into a redirect). A motion for undeletion was almost unanimously rejected. Mikkalai has twice recreated the page, making it a redirect, and most recently gave it its own content, with links to other pages. What he refers to as <i>speedy deletion</i> is in fact the deletion of his redirect code, and later of his content, and the placing of a message explaining the situation. All of this has been explained to him at length at Talk:Jewish ethnocentrism. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis (<font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 19:31, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Mikkalai is simply trying to engineer a third vote here. The title and contents were deleted according to the vote at VfD, where only two users voted to redirect, and the decision was upheld at VfU. Mikkalai is making a mockery of that entire process. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 19:40, Feb 13, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know whether there's a policy. I know only that the vote was clear. People were at liberty to vote to redirect, as this was presented as an option, but only two voted in favor. You should quote the policy that allows you to distinguish between votes regarding content and votes regarding the title. Perhaps you'd do better explaining why you feel strongly about retaining it, because it seems to me that you're engaging in sophistry and acting like a vandal. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 19:52, Feb 13, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you. Ignorance is not argument. What baffles me, is a series of violations of multiple policies in fighting me, see Talk:Jewish ethnocentrism. At the very beginning I stated that I was <b>against the original artice</b>. So I am not defending my POV. I am against <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doublespeak.html" title="Doublespeak">doublespeak</a>, in particular, against pretending that some words do not exist. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 19:57, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>When people vote for deletion on VfD, they are voting on whether an article of that title should exist. In most cases, they are not voting about the current content of the article. If the content of the article is the issue, then they will typically vote Keep and Cleanup. (I admit sometimes when Cleanup would make the article a stub or sub-stub, people will vote to Delete without prejudice to the title because they believe a redlink is preferable to a sub-stub; however that was not the case in these votes.). If people want the title to exist, but think the title does not merit independent content, they will call for a Redirect, or a Merge/Redirect. Delete means "there should be no article of this title". That the article should be deleted was the overwhelming consensus of the VfD vote: that the article should be not be undeleted was the overwhelming consensus of the VfU vote The recreation of VfD-deleted article is one of the grounds for speedy deletion, by that policy. . Reinstating the article as a redirect flies in the face of this consensus and renders the votes meaningless, and those reinstatements are properly speedily-deleted. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:07, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Delete means "there should be no article of this title"</i>: This is your interpretation. If you believe it is correct, please suggest the policy update. "No article with this title" is way too strong, like <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_punishment.html" title="Capital punishment">capital punishment</a>. Forbidding any words smacks really bad. Sorry for yuor democracy, guys. I am abandoning the issue; no more pissing against the wind. Good bye. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 20:16, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think you've misunderstood the VfD process. It's not simply a question of 50 for, 10 against. The admin reads the comments and tries to determine from those what the community consensus is. For example, there's a vote going on regarding Conscious Evolution, which was a pile of garbage. Most people have voted to delete, but many made the comment that
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscious_Evolution_dc8b.html" title="Conscious Evolution">Conscious Evolution</a> was a pile of garbage, and I voted against as well. But it does not preclude writing an article that in a NPOV way explains this kind of stuff. We have plenty of articles about various kinds of <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snake_oil.html" title="Snake oil">snake oil</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/o/Kook.html" title="Kook">kookery</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 20:42, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>there's nothing wrong with having an article with that title, just not this article. Therefore, an editor decided to rewrite it to make the content acceptable. But with Jewish ethnocentrism, people did not comment that rewriting or redirecting was appropriate. They voted, with no hesitation or ambiguity, to delete the whole thing. Can't you see the difference? You are splitting hairs by demanding that there be an explicit policy (i.e. instruction creep) for every single decision the community makes and that's why I'm calling you a sophist. Also, I have a question for you. Did you use your admin powers to unprotect the article even though you're involved in editing it? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 20:23, Feb 13, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I did. The article was protected with violation: by an article's editor. All my actions are explained at the talk page. You will say that I am splitting hairs again, b ut the protection policy speaks about <b>protection</b>, not <b>unprotection</b>. Why is it always allowable to split hairs only in one direction? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 20:32, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>"<i>When people vote for deletion on VfD, they are voting on whether an article of that title should exist.</i>" Absolutely false. Votes are made for the article as it exists at the time.

The only votes for deletion that should be counted against articles of that name are votes that <i>specifically</i> vote for deletion based on the name and <i>only</i> on the name.

<p>This is, and was, already resolved.
