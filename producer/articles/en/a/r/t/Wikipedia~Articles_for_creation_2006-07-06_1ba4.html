<p>DJ Princess Cut,(juri Koshikawa) was born in Wakayama, Japan 1979 She moved to Dallas Texas in the 90s Here she studied the culture of America that Japan was thristy for. The southern rap scene was what truely embraced her and influenced her to stay. For a young impressionable teenager in foreign country, times could be very difficult. For DJ Princess Cut the decision to stay was an easy one. In a very short time she gravitated toward the urban music culture. She wanted to be a part of budding art of Hip Hop. When returning to her hometown of Wakayama, Japan, she began making attempts to push her way into the music scene. She tried her hand in everything related to the music culture including: breakdancing, graffitti art and even rapping. It was only when she got behind the turntables did she find her true calling. After mastering her newfound skill, she began ripping turntables all over the country of Japan. She began generating street credibility as a profound Hip Hop DJ. Princess Cut wanted more than anything to move to the United States and join the ranks of the hottest DJs in the South, such as DJ Screw, DJ Michael Watts and O.G. Ron C. FInally, she saved up enough money to follow her dreams to Texas. Princess Cut has become a certified dirty south chopped and screwed dj. Her techniqes and quality far surpassed the current standard of screw music. She is now building a name for herself as Dallas's number one female dj by spinning in clubs and creating mixtapes that the fans can't get enough of. She is the dj that Japan has been waiting for. Texas is behind her. you can see her actually chopping and screwing her late friend HAWK of the SUCs H-Town stomp at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/djprincesscut" class="external free" title="http://www.myspace.com/djprincesscut" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/djprincesscut</a></p>

<p>The Muses Are Heard</p>
<p>One of Capote's earlier ventures into journalism was a piece for The New Yorker called The Muses Are Heard, a narrative account of The Everyman Opera's cultural mission to the U.S.S.R. in the mid-fifties. Capote was sent to accompany them as they put on a production of Porgy and Bess. Originally published in two parts, it was later released as a short non-fiction book. The title is taken from a speech given by a cultural ministry spokesman in which he says, “When the cannons are heard, the muses are silent. When the Cannons are silent, the muses are heard.”</p>
<p>The book opens with the travelers - the cast, directors, support personnel, and Mrs. Ira Gershwin - waiting for their visas in Berlin and wondering if they will be under constant survelliance. They also consider political issues and how to answer sensitive questions - especially those about the “Negro situation.” Capote, who is present in the narrative, returns to his hotel room to find a brown paper parcel of anti-communist pamphlets. After a train ride of several days (the first two without a dining car), the cast and crew arrive in Leningrad a few days before Christmas and are dispatched to a hotel called the Astoria, which boasts “a trio of restaurants, each leading into the other, cavernous affairs cheerful as airplane hangars.” The rooms are small and over-furnished with “a miasma of romantic marble statuary” Capote discovers that these rooms are seemingly assigned according to payroll. According to some Bolshevik logic, the less you make the better the accommodations. Predictably, the production runs into a few snags. Programs are not printed in time for opening night. The directors are unable to gauge the Russian reaction, beyond their appreciation for certain musical numbers and their disapproval of the sexual themes.</p>
<p>It was hoped that Capote would paint the whole enterprise with a rosy brush, but instead, he seeks out the culture shock, odd juxtapositions and humor wherever possible. He unapologetically describes the tawdry stores in Leningrad and denizens of the local working class bar. In true Capote fashion, he chooses the exact detail to set the scene: a cast member's jive talk, the crunchy pillow in the train berth smelling of hay, meals of yogurt and raspberry soda, the wardrobe lady updating the only available America flag with three new stars.</p>
<p>While the cultural differences are so obvious, Capote does manage to show the East and West coming together at various times. The cast and crew are truly touched when the cultural ministry sets up a Christmas tree in the hotel lobby. The atmosphere warms up even more when the cast members commandeer the band's instruments and do a jumping “Sunny SIde of the Street.” Beyond the music, the two sides have one more thing in common; as a Norwegian businessman observes, they truly yearn for the love and approval of the rest of the world.</p>

The Utah Basketball League (or UBL) is the first-ever basketball league in Utah and grew from twelve to twenty-seven teams since its establishment (October 2005). The league was established in October 2005 with its first 12 teams (Logan Flames, Ogden Rockets, Woods Cross Ballhogs, Salt Lake Devils, Tooele Killer Sharks, Provo Mirage, Orem Panthers, Murray Volcanoes, Park City Knights, Syracuse Eagles, Spanish Fork Avengers, and Draper Coyotes). The league's only state champions were Park City (over Tooele 68-56). Then, when 2006 got underway, the league grew to 25 teams with 13 teams including the Riverdale Tigers, Garland Matadors, Farr West Razors, Morgan Maniax, Sandy Galaxy, and Moab Falcons. Finally, it added two more teams, the West Valley Dragons and the Uintah Earthquakes.</p>

<p>Guitar smashing is the act of a musician, usually a guitarist, deliberately smashing their instrument during or after a performance on stage. The act is usually an intentional and physical, albeit destructive, expression in spirit of the energy of the music. It is usually associated with musical genres of hard rock and heavy metal.</p>
<p>Arguably, the father of guitar smashing must be Pete Townsend of the Who. Already a very physical and energetic performer, a Townsend performance would not be complete without him smashing at least one guitar. In 1966, while guests on the Smothers Brothers, after performing “My Generation”, Townsend destroyed his Rickenbacker guitar, shoving it headstock-first into a speaker of his amp stack, while drummer Keith Moon set off an explosive charge (accidentally too large) in his drum kit. In more recent days, Townsend alone performed “Pinball Wizard” with his Gibson acoustic on the Late Show with David Letterman. At the end of the song, he took the Gibson by the next and with a swift blow, sent it across the edge of a stage monitor, causing the body to submissively disintegrate.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy example is Jimi Hendrix smashing his Fender Stratocaster on stage at the Montery Pop Festival. As Hendrix tortured his instrument gradually, because it was still plugged in, it made very unusual and grotesque sounds as it slowly died. At the end, Hendrix knelt before the defeated body, sprayed lighter fluid on it and set it on fire. As it burned, in a paganesque way, Hendrix gestured its spirit to rise up.</p>
<p>Since these early predecessors, many other guitarists followed suit smashing their instruments.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hendrix smashed the guitar after he burned it.</p>

<p>Crack Ups formed in 2003 after J. Crack Up had seen Screeching Weasel play live at the house of Blues in Chicago. The group formed in Palatine, Illinois. A northwest suburb of Chicago. The lineup was originally a list of ficticious names that coincided with the Ramones names. They just started playing Ramones songs really fast at the jewish community centers. Our first show we opened up with the song Browns Chicken after the Browns Chicken murders occured in Palatine back in 93'. This song wasn't played on any of the radio stations for any of the colleges because they thought it was too realistic. The band has since not reunited yet.The band never released an album but are on myspace music (AIM Screename is GoonIsland99)</p>

<p>Atlético Español is the name that was adopted for a few years by the Mexican football club Necaxa. It was supposed to cater to the huge spanish community living in mexico at the time. The name never stuck with the traditional fans and the spaniards never warmed up to the team, so it switched back to Necaxa.</p>

<p>Emory Campbell is a renowned community leader among the Gullah people, African Americans who live in the coastal low country region of South Carolina and Georgia. The Gullahs have preserved more of their African linguistic and cultural heritage than any other black community in the US.</p>
<p>Campbell began his career in the 1970s as a community development activist, working to implement public health measures in impoverished areas and to preserve traditional Gullah communities threatened by out-of-control resort development on the sea islands. Later, as the Executive Director of <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penn_Center_0872.html" title="Penn Center">Penn Center</a> on St. Helena Island, South Carolina Campbell helped lead the movement to preserve Gullah culture and make Gullah people in the rural areas aware of the importance of their uniquely rich traditional culture. Campbell was a member of the committee that translated the New Testament into the Gullah language.</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1980s, Emory Campbell helped spearhead the efforts to reestablish the family connection between the Gullah people and the West African nation of Sierra Leone. Campbell hosted Sierra Leone's President Joseph Saidu Momoh at Penn Center in 1988, and led the "Gullah Homecoming" to Sierra Leone in 1989. These events are chronicled in the South Carolina Educational Television documentary film "Family Across the Sea" (1990).</p>
<p>Throughout his career Emory Campbell has been a peacemaker within his community and a bridge-builder between the Gullahs and the outside world. Campbell was born and raised on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina before that island -- now an internationally recognized resort area -- was connected to the mainland by a bridge. When Campbell went to high school on the mainland in the 1950s, he discovered that his Gullah language was so "deep" that even his African American teachers had trouble understanding him and the other children from the islands. Campbell would later earn a master's degree from Tufts University in Boston. Having bridged different worlds at a tender age, Emory Campbell has spent his entire life moving between cultures and acting as an ambassador of goodwill in the process.</p>

<p>If Bangalore today is looked upon as the "Silicon Valley of India" with a number of electronic units coming up, both in the hardware and software sectors, one of the names that will be remembered for long for pioneering efforts is that of Mr Ram Krishna Baliga.</p>
<p>According to the Indian Express (1) when Mr Baliga talked of his dreams in the early 70s of making Bangalore an Electronics City there were many who laughed in their sleeves. However, the then Chief Minister Devaraj Urs and Chief Secretary, G.V.K Rao of Karnataka had faith in him and made him the Chairman of the Karnataka State Electronics Development Corporation ([Keonics]) in 1976. Although he envisoned the Electronic City in mid 1970's it did gained traction only in 1990's when the Indian goverment opened up the economy for outside investment.</p>
<p>He was also president of the Indian Institute of Plant Engineers which comprised of 4000 members according to the Deccan Herald (2), president of International Club at Westinghouse Electric Corporation (USA) (3), and president of Karnataka Productivity Council (1)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-06_1ba4.html" title="Edit section: Project Sapphire">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Project Sapphire</span></h2>
<p>Project Sapphire By John A. Tirpak, Senior Editor</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>During the Persian Gulf War, US officials worried that Iraq might have succeeded in processing a few tens of grams of uranium into nuclear weapons-grade material—enough to make a single low-yield bomb. Later, the CIA became alarmed that North Korea had generated enough nuclear material for two or three bombs.</p>
<p>Imagine, then, the shock to the US government when it learned in fall 1993 that roughly 600 kilograms of highly enriched uranium (HEU)—almost pure U-235, much of it directly applicable to weapons—was sitting in an ill-protected facility at Ust’Kamenogorsk in Kazakhstan. This was more than half a ton of fissile material. To someone with even limited knowledge of atomic bomb-making, it would be enough for twenty weapons. A skilled bomb-maker would be able to produce fifty.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan’s revelation, made secretly to the US, seemed to signal that the nightmare age of “loose nukes” truly had arrived. Ever since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the West had feared that poorly protected nuclear materials from the Soviet arsenal would reach the hands of black marketeers and then those of terrorists or hostile powers. The stockpile in Kazakhstan suddenly made these fears palpable.</p>
<p>Thus began more than a year of intense cooperation to stave off that nightmare and prevent a nuclear catastrophe. From the beginning, the US Air Force was deeply involved in the operation, code-named “Sapphire.”</p>
<p>Kazakh authorities discovered the enriched uranium in the Ulba Metallurgical Facility in Ust’Kamenogorsk in 1992 while they were assessing the nuclear legacy left on their soil by the fallen Communist regime in Moscow.</p>
<p>Kept in the Dark</p>
<p>The Ulba facility was located in a “closed city” because of the highly sensitive work done there. Even local authorities had been kept in the dark about the plant. They could only speculate about the extent of dangerous nuclear testing that had been going on in their back yard. These nuclear tests, performed with few or no safeguards, had produced terrible environmental and health consequences over the previous forty years.</p>
<p>Once inside the Ulba plant, Kazakh officials discovered about 2,000 tons of radioactive material. They found within this stockpile the 600 kilograms of HEU, which was contained in a beryllium alloy. Soviet scientists had intended to use it in a research reactor dedicated to development of new Soviet naval nuclear propulsion systems, a project abandoned when the USSR dissolved.</p>
<p>When the Kazakhstan government understood what it had, it quickly realized that it could not care for it properly. “They wanted to be responsible about it,” said Jeffrey M. Starr, the Pentagon’s principal director for Threat Reduction Policy. “They didn’t want to sell to aspiring nuclear states.”</p>
<p>He added that the Kazakhs “did what they could” to secure the facility with locks, gates, and militiamen with dogs, “but they knew it wasn’t enough.” Whereas such measures might have been “reasonable by the standards of forty years ago,” said Mr. Starr, they likely could not stand up to a dedicated assault by a modern terrorist team or even well-armed thugs from organized crime. Despite their good intentions, the cash-poor Kazakhs lacked the resources to protect the material in the long run.</p>
<p>“ There were threats” to the security of the material, Mr. Starr said. “We found it to be vulnerable.”</p>
<p>He explained that there was “information to suggest that Iran was aware of the Ulba facility.” Unconfirmed reports have alleged that Iranian operatives attempted to contact Kazakh officials about possible sale of the material.</p>
<p>The Kazakhs “knew the interest was not limited to just the Iranians,” Mr. Starr added. As knowledge about the uranium spread, it would inevitably come to the attention of terrorists, who might find it an irresistible target.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan’s revelation of the existence of the Ulba material—as well as an urgent request for assistance in either caring for it or disposing of it—came quietly to William H. Courtney, the US Ambassador to Kazakhstan. He passed on the request to Washington.</p>
<p>Soon, the United States dispatched a specialist from the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge, Tenn., nuclear storage and processing facility to assay the material and determine “just what we were talking about,” Mr. Starr said. The visit was not hard to keep under wraps; there already was a good deal of traffic from the US to Kazakhstan relating to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and various programs to dismantle old Soviet weapons.</p>
<p>The DoE specialist returned after a couple of weeks. With him came protected samples of the HEU, transported by diplomatic pouch to prevent the scrutiny of US Customs officers and others without a “need to know.”</p>
<p>Based on the specialist’s assay and reports, the National Security Council (NSC) determined that the Department of Defense should take the lead in a coordinated effort—with the Departments of State and Energy—to secure the fissile material and, if necessary, remove it to a safe storage site in the US. Mr. Starr was appointed to head a “tiger team” to accomplish the mission.</p>
<p>Phoenix and Sapphire</p>
<p>Given the extreme sensitivity and danger of the situation, tight security was clamped on what the Pentagon first code-named “Project Phoenix.” Eventually, the project would be known as “Sapphire”—its State Department code name.</p>
<p>The team initially considered keeping the material where it was, only with tighter security. This option was quickly rejected because of the huge investment required to beef up security at Ulba. This step would also have required routine infusions of upkeep money because the Kazakhs simply could not afford to pay the high price for it. Besides, Mr. Starr noted, “there would always be some [US] uncertainty about how secure it was.”</p>
<p>US officials determined that the material could be easily accommodated at DoE’s Oak Ridge facility, where it would represent a relatively small fraction of the total stockpile of nuclear materials already stored there. The Y-12 facility had just been certified by the International Atomic Energy Agency as “safe” for storage of large quantities of nuclear material.</p>
<p>In the end, the NSC decided to bring the material out of Kazakhstan, a conclusion with which Kazakhstan quickly agreed. The nations further decided that, in order to ensure that the project would have a low profile, no negotiating teams would shuttle between Washington, D. C., and Almaty, the Kazakh capital. All negotiations were to be carried out quietly, using embassy personnel.</p>
<p>By February 1994, the project was well advanced. Officials in Washington and Kazakhstan concluded that it was time to consult with Russia because Russia had inherited virtually all the nuclear facilities and weapons of the Soviet Union and might lay claim to the uranium. Moreover, Russian cooperation—however tacit—was an absolute requirement. Any airlift mission to remove the material would have to cross Russian airspace. As Mr. Starr put it, a covert operation that kept Russia in the dark “was out of the question.”</p>
<p>Low-Level Shakedown</p>
<p>Initial contacts with Russian authorities led many in the US government to believe that the Ulba material had been forgotten. A low-level official at Minatom, the Russian atomic energy agency, asked for a “cut” of whatever revenue the Kazakhs might get from the transfer. “We thought maybe these were not the right people to ask,” Mr. Starr said of the response.</p>
<p>As a result, the US took further steps to ensure that Russians at high levels were aware of the impending transfer “in generic terms,” Mr. Starr said. Vice President Al Gore wrote to Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin explaining that the US had been contacted by Kazakhstan and had been “asked to assist in the safekeeping” of the nuclear material.</p>
<p>The letter was carefully worded to make it clear “we were not asking permission,” said one Pentagon official. Russia, he explained, “would have no veto power.” In addition to these rather awkward communications, Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev simply picked up his phone and called Russian President Boris Yeltsin to explain what was in the offing. Mr. Yeltsin assured him that Russia would not interfere.</p>
<p>Still, alerting the Russian authorities carried some risk. Corruption in post-Soviet Russia had reached such heights that US officials worried that information about the impending transfer might be sold to precisely the people both Kazakhstan and the US wanted to keep in the dark.</p>
<p>The two sides developed a plan for the transfer. First, the uranium had to be put into a transportable form. Though it was already in some 1,000 canisters and 6,000 sample bottles, it was still in a corrosive, “wet” form. Technicians had to remove the material from the containers, then “bake” and “dry” it to remove water and oils so that they could work with it.</p>
<p>Next, the material had to be placed in special metal containers—about the size of a spray-paint can—which in turn would be put into canisters the size of a fifty-five gallon drum. Finally, the drums would have to be transported to the local airport, loaded aboard aircraft, and flown to the United States.</p>
<p>At every step of the process, danger loomed. The drums made the uranium safe to handle; the containers could survive an airplane crash without breaking apart. But that also meant that no special equipment was needed to move it—or to steal it. Once in the canisters, the uranium could be handled by anybody. Security would have to be tight on where the material would be and when it would move.</p>
<p>The US recruited a team of thirty-two volunteers for the processing and “recontainerization” phase. Of them, twenty-seven were technicians at Oak Ridge, four were Russian linguists from the US On-Site Inspection Agency, and one was a physician.</p>
<p>“ We had no trouble getting volunteers,” Mr. Starr said. “They recognized that this was important work.”</p>
<p>The team, led by Alex Riedy, an Oak Ridge technician, put together a transportable, collapsible processing facility the size of a three-car garage. Team members practiced dry runs and emergency drills with it throughout the summer of 1994.</p>
<p>In August, an assessment team traveled to Ust’Kamenogorsk to determine if the local airfield could accommodate Air Force C-5 Galaxy airlifters, which would be needed to transport the necessary people to and from Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>“ Things to Consider”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, USAF officials summoned Lt. Col. Mike Foster, operations officer of the 9th Airlift Squadron, Dover AFB, Del., to Air Mobility Command headquarters for a classified briefing. Colonel Foster and a handpicked loadmaster went to the Tanker Airlift Control Center at Scott AFB, Ill., where they received a top-secret briefing on the mission and were instructed to develop a list of “things to consider” that would affect the success of the operation.</p>
<p>Number one on the list was weather.</p>
<p>If there were ice, Colonel Foster wondered, would the runway be long enough? Would there be adequate deicing equipment at the field? How would they get permission to fly through the airspace of other countries to get in and out of Kazakhstan? The leaders of Project Sapphire hadn’t thought of some of these questions, but Colonel Foster got in touch with the US military attaché in Kazakhstan, Lt. Col. Dan Perry, for the answers. None of the problems posed an insurmountable barrier to the operation.</p>
<p>In September, US security officials drafted a top-secret presidential order authorizing American personnel to initiate Project Sapphire and go into Kazakhstan to bring out the half-ton of HEU for ultimate disposition at Oak Ridge’s Y-12 facility.</p>
<p>Carrying out the proper consultations and providing necessary assurances took some time. The presidential order was not issued until October 7, and Project Sapphire got under way in earnest.</p>
<p>Colonel Foster, leading a flight of three C-5Bs, launched from Dover AFB on October 8. One of the enormous Galaxys carried support crews, offloading equipment, and a detachment of Air Force Security Police personnel. The others carried DoE’s processing plant, the Oak Ridge team, the ovens to bake the uranium, and the 1,400 containers to hold it. Aboard all aircraft were USAF pilots fluent in Russian.</p>
<p>The flight path taken into and out of Kazakhstan remains a secret; nations that permitted overflights are still sensitive about publicly acknowledging their cooperation with the United States in the venture. For their help, said Mr. Starr, these countries received nothing more than “the hearty thanks of the US government.”</p>
<p>The 8,000-foot runway at Ust’Kamenogorsk was “like a bucking bronco,” Colonel Foster reported. Though it was not up to Western standards, the runway proved adequate for the huge transports. The C-5s landed and unloaded without mishap and headed home the following day, thus completing the first phase of the Air Force operation.</p>
<p>Sliding Toward Winter</p>
<p>Next came phase two: preparing the uranium and hauling it out of Kazakhstan on another C-5 flight. The lateness of the presidential order threatened to turn Colonel Foster’s worst-case scenario into reality. The departure time—originally set for November 1, to beat the arrival of winter—was slipping into mid- to late November, when the bitterly cold weather could seriously imperil the extraction mission. Snow removal capabilities at the field were “not great,” Mr. Starr admitted.</p>
<p>Finally, a week before Thanksgiving, technicians completed the processing of the uranium and packed it into the canisters. Colonel Foster and his team began the second flight to Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>The weather had turned very bad. In its first attempt, the C-5 group had to turn back because of blizzard conditions along the way. On a later try, only the first of the four aircraft that were launched actually made it to Kazakhstan. The others had to divert to other bases. Visibility and runway conditions were below minimums. The first airplane, however, landed at 4:00 a.m. At the same moment, a convoy of trucks set out from the Ulba facility on the eighteen-mile trip to the airport. On board the trucks were the uranium-filled canisters, the DoE team, militiamen, police, and Special Forces from the Kazakh Army.</p>
<p>Originally, there was to be only one convoy, to capitalize on the element of surprise should bandits attempt to waylay the shipment. Because a second C-5 had not made it through to the airfield, however, officials decided to break the shipment up into two convoys. The second convoy would stay put until the arrival of another C-5 airplane.</p>
<p>Along the route to the airport, all roads were closed and every available light was turned on to illuminate the path.</p>
<p>The Loadout</p>
<p>With the convoy en route, the C-5 crew unloaded 40,000 pounds of relief items collected by families and friends of the Oak Ridge team in the US for donation to local orphanages. This humanitarian shipment was possible because the C-5s hadn’t been modified for the mission; the canisters made it possible to handle the uranium like any other cargo. Even so, when the convoy arrived, crew members exercised extra care, and the loading took several hours. Security Police ringed the operation side by side with Kazakh Special Forces personnel.</p>
<p>USAF team members wore dosimeters, made periodic checks of radiation levels, and looked for any damage that might have been done to the canisters during loading. They found not a scratch.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kazakh workers cleared the runway with a novel device—a truck-mounted jet engine, which literally blew ice and snow off the hard surfaces. “We laughed, but it worked,” said Colonel Foster.</p>
<p>As the first aircraft finished loading, the second arrived, and the second convoy set out from the Ulba complex.</p>
<p>The first C-5 prepared to launch and head home. The weather was worse than Colonel Foster could have imagined. The airfield was pummeled by sleet, ice, and rain, but the runway was usable, and the Galaxy had no difficulty getting airborne. The flight home took twenty hours and required five air refuelings. On the way, said Colonel Foster, “we were sitting there in the cockpit, writing Tom Clancy novels in our heads about what would happen if we had to go down.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, the flight proved uneventful, and all the aircraft arrived at Dover AFB with crews and cargo intact. There, the material was loaded on unmarked Department of Energy tractor-trailers and sent by varying routes to Oak Ridge’s Y-12 facility, where it was to be blended into low-enriched form and used as source material in commercial nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>The value of this material is hard to estimate, but it certainly is far less than the billions of dollars Kazakhstan could have reaped had it chosen to sell the HEU on the black market. That nation will receive a cash grant and US aid to help clean up the problems created by Soviet nuclear operations there.</p>
<p>Once the material arrived at Oak Ridge and was safely stored at Y-12, Washington finally let the world in on the story. Defense Secretary William J. Perry, Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher, and Energy Secretary Hazel R. O’Leary issued a sketchy joint statement announcing the unprecedented venture.</p>
<p>The mission, said Secretary Perry, had succeeded in putting the bomb-grade material “forever out of the reach of . . . black marketeers, terrorists, or a new nuclear regime.” The Sapphire team “not only completed a highly complex, sensitive mission with great success, they have done a great deal to make the world safer from nuclear danger.”</p>

<p>A “petitioning democrat” is a politician who claims to be part of the Democratic Party but receive no support from the constituents of their represented region. It is a politician’s political phrase that essentially self proclaims oneself above a political party and process. It is a way for a politician to let the public know that the will of the people and democratic process that they have been taught to respect and believe in will not be recognized or accepted.</p>
<p>It is a tactic a life long politician will use in a time of desperation.</p>

<p><b>J-Throez also born Jose Larios was born in Tegucigalpa, Honduras on July 3, 1991. J-Throez released his first street mixtape which was underground and did not make good credibility on the street. Trill Thug Muzik got alot of respect from rappers catching alot of attention and getting record labels wanting him on their label. His lyrics are very poetically written and he sometimes loses pace as in changes the "flow" to loose the audience. Now working on his album which MIGHT in fact be another mixtape is already getting people to turn heads in the streets. The new album(mixtape) is called "J-Throez: The Untold Storiez". He recently has been talking to dj's and might get radio play. That has not been contacted to him about. Through his music myspace off a very famous website, he doesn't get his music out much by that, although there are millions of people on myspace. He is "reportedly" might in fact get Radio Play by some radio stations in his home town of Miami, Fl.</b></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>The Real news on J-Throez has in fact changed since that last topic. The Untold Storiez name has been changed to Smile Now, Cry Later...But this has not been identified by J-Throez. The radio play issue was determined, and...well he doesnt know about this. He is trying to come out with a song that is "radio quality"-and-"can get radio hits". Smile now cry later might be in fact just another mixtape since most of his instrumentals have NOT been purchased. He, not at this time, has only about 10 songs. On his soundclick, his songs are very poetically influenced and can be fast catching. He is still recording in indie studios and hopes he gets signed to a label that"pays dat good money, and getz a yung nigga what and where he needa get in life". The new mixtape will be dropping soon or maybe mid 2007. More info. on J-throez soon.</b></p>

<p>The Powere plate is a new technology that allows people to exercise far more efficiently than previously available technologies. You basically stand on a vibrating platform which causes your muscles to contract and relax 30-50 times per second. These rapid contractions/relaxations allow exercising times to decrease drastically. A 10 minute work out on the power plate can be equivalent to 1.5 hours in the gym.</p>

Much used in the London area and well known in Police slang/jargon. Usually inhabiting encampments, tresspassing on private land, layby's, large retail park car parks and living in caravans towed normally by Ford Transit vans or similar. Main income sources are crime of any type including theft, burglary, car theft (especially 4x4's), deception (posing as builders/contractors for roofing, tarmacadam mechants)etc. Known for leaving any camp site used by them in filthy and unsanitised conditions. Parodied by satirical UK Magazine Viz in "'The Thieving Gypsy Bastards' which was withdrawn after complaints to the UK Race Relations Board. Well known by UK Social Services to "borrow" and misrepresent each others children so as to obtain welfare handouts. Use many aliases and it will not be uncommon to enter a site to find several people with the exact same name so as to confuse the authorities. Latterly have taken to large scale drug dealing to supplement incomes. Exceedingly violent and this is exhibited by both males and females. Now more numerous in the UK as legislation was enacted in Eire to empower the Eire Police (Garda) to move on any such persons on public property. As no such law exists in the UK many "diddies" have crossed into England to continue their lifestyle there. Generally when an encampment appears in a locality petty and more serious crimes soar. The women folk are well know to walk out in groups offering bunches of the plant "heather" for money. When refused they will resort to foul mouthed "gypsy curses" to frighten the unlucky victim. Women and children operate in conjunction in town centres and shopping areas (Mall's) to distract and steal anything resaleable. The males try to take over drinking establishments frightening off other customers and attempting to use the premises as a bolt hole and a base for crime. Will also steal dogs for use in trapping, blood sports, and dog fighting. Heavy drinkers. Heavy gamblers. Will "intermarry" both within cousins, siblings, father/daughter etc. Thus exibit many inheritable diseases and conditions.</p>

<p><i>Joseph W. Boswell</i>, aka "Boz" is currently a rugby player in the USA Rugby Super League <a href="http://www.usarugbysuperleague.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usarugbysuperleague.com" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p><b>Early Years:</b> Boswell graduated from Hamburg High School in 1996 receiving a New York State Regents Diploma. He was a member of the Football and Wrestling teams, as well as a member of the Varsity Club, Service Club, Student Council and the Men's Ensemble. During his senior year, he suffered a sever injury to his right shoulder that would plague him for years afterwards.</p>
<p><b>College Years:</b> Upon his graduation from High School, he attended SUNY Fredonia where he initally majored in Math. One year into his education at Fredonia, he tranferred to SUNY Cortland in pursuit of a return to football glory. Unfortunately, his injured shoulder prevented a revival of a once promising football career. After only once lackluster semester at Cortland he returned to Fredonia where he had much greater academic success.</p>
<p>Now majoring in Physics, Boswell flourished as a student, earning several academic awards as well as having the honor to meet Stephen Hawking at a conference in Chicago. However, it was during the stresses of the academic rigors of majoring in Physics that Boswell discovered his true passion, the sport of rugby.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1998, Boswell joined the SUNY Fredonia Blackhorse Rugby Football Club where he was part of what would be a very successful career where he amasses 16 tries in 2 years. During his time at Fredonia, he was elected by his teammates to Vice President as well as the New York State Collegiate All-Star Rugby Team. Though he was not able to lead Blackhorse to a State Championship, his short career is one of the most successful in the 20+ year history of the rugby club.</p>
<p><b>Post College Years:</b> After college (Summer of 2000) Boswell accepted a job as a Physicist for Eastman Kodak Company in Rochester, NY. He joined the Lockport "Gang Green" RFC for that fall season and as a rookie in men's league, was a significant contributor to Lockport's 2000 NYS Div 3 State Championship.</p>
<p>In 2001, he was reassigned to Washington, DC on business for Kodak. Upon his assignment to DC, Boswell joined the Washington RFC, a USA Super League team. This was quite a step up in competition, but he excelled from the beginning, starting on the A-Side during the whole Fall season.</p>
<p>Due to prolonged damage to his right shoulder, he underwent a shoulder re-construction in the spring of 2001, causing him to miss the entire Super League season. During his rehabilitation, he got his referee certification and stayed in contact with the game while on IR. By the summer his rehab was complete and he was able to begin competiting again.</p>
<p>Since his surgery, Joe Boswell has become a stalwart on the team. Leading from the front as the starting loosehead prop since the 2003 season, he has been a main cog in the rebuilding of the Washington RFC. He also has been one of the main leaders in the forming of the SUNY Fredonia Blackhorse Rugby Alumni Touring Side (B.R.A.T.S.) which took 4th place at the 2004 Saranac Can-Am Rugby Tournament.</p>
<p>He continues to live and work in the metro DC area and still is active with both Blackhorse RFC and Washington RFC.</p>

<p>Marion Harris (1896-Aril 23, 1944) was a popular singer of the late teens and 20s and one of the earliest promoters of the new jazz craze. She was born Marion Ellen Harris and little is known about her early career although she must have been active by 1910 in the vaudville scene. Legends tell that she was discovered by <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vernon_Castle_2329.html" title="Vernon Castle">Vernon Castle</a> and introduced to promoter Charles M. Dillingham who got her work in the show Stop! Look! and Listen in December of <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a>. Shortly thereafter, she began recording just as another new artist <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Original_Dixieland_Jazz_Band_d63d.html" title="The Original Dixieland Jazz Band">the Original Dixieland Jazz Band</a> was making itself felt in music circles. Harris recorded When I Hear That Jazz Band Play, probably the first jazz record recorded by a woman. Suddenly she was in great demand. She issued further releases taking advantage of the jazz boom including Jazz Baby (1919), Take Me To The Land Of Jazz (1919), and Im A Jazz Vampire (1920). She moved from Victor to Columbia as the new decade began over issues regarding recording of <a href="../../../w/2E/c/W.C.Handy_3b94.html" title="W.C.Handy">W.C.Handy</a>'s <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Blues_f80f.html" title="St. Louis Blues">St. Louis Blues</a>. Harris continued recording songs written by afro-american songwriters and tended towards blues and jazz flavored numbers. She is primarily remembered for her rendition of I'm Just Wild About Harry and <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tea_for_Two_cbfc.html" title="Tea for Two">Tea for Two</a>. She was never without work during the roaring twenties playing the palace and Ziegfelds Midnight Frolic in New York and appearing in shows such as A Night In Spain with Irene Dunnand The Second Little Show in 1930. She also like many of her generation, tried her hand at films. Her feature length debut in 1929 in Devil May Care with <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramon_Novarro_1a78.html" title="Ramon Novarro">Ramon Novarro</a>] and <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorothy_Jordan_5a65.html" title="Dorothy Jordan">Dorothy Jordan</a> was followed by Gems of M-G-M (1930) and Trouble Ahead (1936). She retired in the late 1930s moving to England with her husband Leonard Urry. During the Blitz in World War II, her house was bombed and shortly thereafter she chose to return to the U.S. She died from injuries suffered in a fire at the Le Marquise Hotel in New York on April 23 1944.</p>

<p>Daniel Coulombe (music producer) also known as: DCMIX.</p>
<hr />
<p>Starting as a D.J. in the mid 70's, DCMIX became renowned locally for his famous montages (Quéson, punk 1980, etc...). Becoming a remixing engineer in the early 80's, bands like B-52's (Party mixes) and Icehouse (can't help myself) had remixes produced by DCMIX. French artists like (Indochine, R.B.O., Katee, Mitsou,...) were also produced by DCMIX in the 90's.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-06_1ba4.html" title="Edit section: Hired Truck Scandal">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hired Truck Scandal</span></h2>
<p>"Hired Truck" is a scandal-plagued program in the city of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> that involved hiring private trucks to do city work. It was overhauled in 2004 (and phased out beginning in 2005) after after an investigation by the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Sun-Times_5b28.html" title="Chicago Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a> revealed that some participating companies were being paid for doing little or no work, had mob connections or were tied to city employees. City employees were supposedly barred from the program. Truck owners also paid bribes in order to get into the program.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite the revelations in the Sun-Times, and as the first indictment was unsealed after a sweeping Federal investigation, Chicago City Corporation Counsel Mara Georges said the $40 million-a-year program "is a good program which does a good benefit to the taxpayers of Chicago. It saves taxpayer money. It allows the city to efficiently get jobs done. It is the appropriate use of private resources, as opposed to the city having to engage in its own use of resources.”<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Sun-Times investigation began when a reporter on his way to work noticed a truck idling at a work site. For two eight-hour days the truck parked at a city job site in the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humboldt_Park_e152.html" title="Humboldt Park">Humboldt Park</a> neighborhood. It did nothing. It arrived in the morning, parked and moved only at quitting time. It cost taxpayers $50.17 an hour.</p>
<p>The scandal has been damaging to Chicago Mayor <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_M._Daley_293a.html" title="Richard M. Daley">Richard M. Daley</a>, whose brother sold insurance to three major trucking companies. Additionally, 25 percent of all Hired Truck money went to companies from Daley's 11th Ward power base and $108,575 in campaign contributions flowed to the mayor from companies in the program beginning in 1996.</p>
<p>In February 2005, Daley denied complicity in the unfolding scandal saying, "Anyone who believes that my interest in public life is in enriching my family, friends or political supporters doesn't know or understand me at all. My reputation and the well-being of this city are more important to me than any election."<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In February 2006, John Briatta, whose sister is married to Cook County Commissioner John Daley, the mayor's brother, pleaded guilty to taking at least $5,400 in bribes to steer Hired Truck work to a trucking company.</p>
<p>The litany of cases of bribery grew to include former City Clerk James Laski, who pleaded guilty to taking bribes in return for steering Hired Truck business to friends.</p>
<p>It was also revealed that tons of asphalt paid for by the city were stolen by truck drivers in the Hired Truck program. The asphalt was then used on private jobs.</p>
<p>The scandal eventually sparked a Federal investigation into hiring practices at <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_City_Hall_43ff.html" title="Chicago City Hall">Chicago City Hall</a>, with Robert Sorich, Mayor Daley's former patronage chief, facing mail fraud charges for allegedly rigging city hiring to favor people with political connections.</p>

<p>Natural Home Remedies for common disease is not a concept of twenty first century. It is an age-old practice that has been passed down from one generation to the others, through trial and error. Home remedies are based on the knowledge that most natural foods like fruits, vegetables, cereal grains, seeds and nuts, as well as other natural substances, possess many medicinal virtues. These natural foods and substances have been tried and refined as natural cures in different countries. Research has proved many of these cures to be astonishingly effective. The living proof is that our ancestors-with the help of these cures-lived a happier, healthier, and longer life than the present generation.</p>

<p><br />
Something of Greg's nature is apparent in the flashback when he meets Duncan at the gallery. Gregor is shot by an enraged father whose son died of cholera, blaming Gregor (who was the town doctor) for his death. On the cart as Duncan takes Gregors body away, Gregor wakes up asking "It never gets any easier, does it."</p>
<p>Gregors photography exhibition is full of dark and violent images, a stark contrast to Linda Plager's photographs. Befriending Richie, he leads him into doing the stunt that he performed with a former friend at the beginning of the episode - where he friend almost drowned and Gregor stood asking his drowning friend what it felt like to die before pulling him from the water. Richie is injured and Duncan is angry with Greg for getting Richie involved.</p>
<p>Greg begins losing his grip, destroying the photographs in the gallery before going to the hospital to see a dying Linda. Greg tries to aid her on her way until Duncan drags him to the roof, showing him mercy when his swords on Gregs throat. Greg realises that he doesn't want to die.</p>

<p>The Board of Trustees unanimously named Dr. Ed Richardson as interim president of Auburn University on Jan. 20, 2004. As State Superintendent of Education, Richardson had served on the Auburn University Board of Trustees from 1995 until his interim appointment.</p>
<p>Upon accepting the position, his primary task was to convince the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to lift the probationary status placed upon Auburn University late in 2003. Clearing the university's name with regard to its accreditation status in December 2004 was the culmination of a year of difficult work.</p>
<p>With the SACS accreditation problem behind him, Richardson began working on projects of lasting importance: positioning Auburn to attract a permanent president with outstanding qualifications and working to establish a pattern of institutional control.</p>
<p>To that end, Richardson put before the AU Board of Trustees an aggressive agenda for 2005-2006.</p>
<p>The agenda, expanding upon six initiatives unveiled in 2004, places major emphasis on AU creating a comprehensive and ongoing strategic planning process, changing the concept of the AU System, developing a process of academic program review and creating an institute to give a new focus to AU’s programs in agriculture, forestry and the natural sciences.</p>
<p>Prior to assuming the post at Auburn, Richardson had been state superintendent of education since October 1995. During his eight-year tenure in Montgomery, Richardson was the Alabama Board of Education's executive officer for the State Department of Education.</p>
<p>Before he became state superintendent, Richardson was superintendent of schools for the Auburn City Board of Education for 13 years. He spent nine years as a teacher, assistant principal and principal in the Montgomery County school system and served nine years as principal of Andalusia High School.</p>
<p>Richardson has earned three degrees from Auburn University—a B.S. in science education in 1962, an M.Ed. in 1967, and an Ed.D. in 1972, both in educational administration.</p>

<p>This process (is also known as "photogelatin") is, like lithography, a planographic process. It is now rarely used: only a handful of printers in the world still use collotype.

The gelatin, which lies in a film on a thick sheet of plate glass or a metal plate, is placed in contact with a photographic negative and exposed to light. The gelatin then hardens according to the amount of light reaching it - the harder the gelatin, the more capable it is of accepting ink.<br />
As with lithography, the process depends on the physics of water repelling grease; the unexposed parts of the gelatin are kept moist with water and glycerine so that they repel the ink, while the other parts accept ink to a greater or lesser degree. This gives a result rather like a photograph as it cann print graduations from the deepest black to the lightest tone of grey.<br />
The tone is not broken into dots, as it is with a screen.<br />
Collotype presses are similar to direct (as opposed to offset) litho machines but run at particularly slow speeds; it may take two days to produce 2,000 sheets - the maximum that can be taken from any one plate. Nevertheless, this process can produce extremely high-quality results and is consequently sometimes used for printing small runs of fine-art reproductions.</p>

<p>William Cobbett, the son of a tavern owner, was born in Farnham, Surrey, on 9th March 1763. Taught to read and write by his father, Cobbett worked as a farm labourer until 1783 when he moved to London and found work as a clerk. A year later Cobbett joined the army and eventually achieved the rank of corporal. While his regiment was in Canada, Cobbett discovered that the quartermaster was stealing from army funds. When he attempted to expose this scandal he was accused of being a troublemaker. Cobbett, who had recently married, decided to flee to France with his new bride. After seven months the couple moved to the United States where Cobbett taught English to French refugees.</p>
<p>In 1799 William Cobbett returned to England. Three years later he started his newspaper, the Political Register. At first he supported the Tories but he gradually became more radical. By 1806 he was a strong advocate of parliamentary reform. An unsuccessful attempt to be elected as M.P. for Honiton convinced him of the unfairness of rotten boroughs.</p>
<p>William Cobbett was not afraid to criticise the government in the Political Register and in 1809 he attacked the use of German troops to put down a mutiny in Ely. Cobbett was tried and convicted for sedition and sentenced to two years' imprisonment in Newgate Prison. When Cobbett was released he continued his campaign against newspaper taxes and government attempts to prevent free speech.</p>
<p>By 1815 the tax on newspapers had reached 4d. a copy. As few people could afford to pay 6d. or 7d. for a newspaper, the tax restricted the circulation of most of these journals to people with fairly high incomes. Cobbett was only able to sell just over a thousand copies a week. The following year Cobbett began publishing the Political Register as a pamphlet. Cobbett now sold the Political Register for only 2d. and it soon had a circulation of 40,000.</p>
<p>Cobbett's journal was the main newspaper read by the working class. This made Cobbett a dangerous man and in 1817 he heard that the government planned to have him arrested for sedition. Unwilling to spend another period in prison, Cobbett fled to the United States. For two years Cobbett lived on a farm in Long Island where he wrote Grammar of the English Language and with the help of William Benbow, a friend in London, continued to publish the Political Register.</p>
<p>William Cobbett arrived back in England soon after the Peterloo Massacre. Cobbett joined with other Radicals in his attacks on the government and three times during the next couple of years was charged with libel.</p>
<p>In 1821 William Cobbett started a tour of Britain on horseback. Each evening he recorded his observations on what he had seen and heard that day. This work was published as a series of articles in the Political Register and as a book, Rural Rides, in 1830.</p>
<p>Cobbett continued to publish controversial material in the Political Register and in July, 1831, was charged with seditious libel after writing an article in support of the Captain Swing Riots. Cobbett conducted his own defence and he was so successful that the jury failed to convict him.</p>
<p>Cobbett still had a strong desire to be elected to the House of Commons. He was defeated in Preston in 1826 and Manchester in 1832 but after the passing of the 1832 Reform Act Cobbett was able to win the parliamentary seat of Oldham. In Parliament Cobbett concentrated his energies on attacking corruption in government and the 1834 Poor Law. William Cobbett died on 18th June 1835.</p>

<p>(1) William Cobbett, The Progress of a Ploughboy to a Seat in Parliament (1830)</p>
<p>I enlisted in 1784, and, as peace had then taken place, no great haste was made to send recruits off to their regiments. I remember well what sixpence a day was, recollecting the pangs of hunger felt by me, during the thirteen months that I was a private soldier at Chatham, previous to my embarkation for Nova Scotia. Of my sixpence, nothing like fivepence was left to purchase food for the day. Indeed not fourpence. For there was washing, mending, soap, flour for hair-powder, shoes, stockings, shirts, stocks and gaiters, pipe-clay and several other things to come out of the miserable sixpence! Judge then the quantity of food to sustain life in a lad of sixteen, and to enable him to exercise with a musket (weighing fourteen pounds) six to eight hours every day.</p>
<p>The best battalion I ever saw in my life was composed of men, the far greater part of whom were enlisted before they were sixteen, and who, when they were first brought up to the regiment, were clothed in coats much too long and too large, in order to leave room for growing.</p>
<p>We had several recruits from Norfolk (our regiment was the West Norfolk); and many of them deserted from sheer hunger. They were lads from the plough-tail. I remember two that went into a decline and died during the year, though when they joined us, they were fine hearty young men. I have seen them lay in their berths, many and many a time, actually crying on account of hunger. The whole week's food was not a bit too much for one day.</p>

(2) William Cobbett, Political Register (November 1816)</p>
<p>You have been represented by the Times newspaper, by the Courier, by the Morning Post, by the Morning Herald, and others, as the scum of society. They say that you have no business at public meetings; that you are rabble, and that you pay no taxes. These insolent hirelings, who wallow in wealth, would not be able to put their abuse of you in print were it not for your labour.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>(3) William Cobbett, Thirteen Sermons (1822)</p>
<p>All property has its origin in labour. Labour itself is property; the root of all other property; and unhappy is that community, where labourer and poor man are synonymous terms. No man is essentially poor: poor and rich are relative terms; and if the labourer have his due, and be in good health, in the vigour of life, and willing to labour, to make him a poor man there must be some defect in the government of the community in which he lives. Because the produce of his labour would of itself produce a sufficiency of every thing needful for himself and family. The labouring classes must always form nine-tenths of a people; and what a shame it must be, what an imputation on the rulers, if nine-tenths of the people be worthy of the name of poor! It is impossible that such a thing can be, unless there be an unfair and an unjust distribution of the profits of labour. Labour produces every thing that is good upon the earth; it is the cause of every thing that men enjoy of worldly possessions; when, therefore, the strong and the young engage in labour and cannot obtain from it a sufficiency to keep them out of the ranks of the poor, there must be something greatly amiss in the management of the community; something that gives to the few an unjust and cruel advantage over the many; and surely, unless we assume the character of beasts of prey, casting aside all feelings of humanity, all love of country, and all regard for the ordinances of God, we must sincerely regret, and anxiously endeavour to remove, such an evil, whenever we may find it to exist. The man who can talk about the honour of his country, at a time when its millions are in a state little short of famine; and when that is, too, apparently their permanent state, must be an oppressor in his heart; must be destitute of all the feelings of shame and remorse; must be fashioned for a despot, and can only want the power to act the character in its most tragical scenes.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>(4) William Cobbett, Political Register (August 1830)</p>
<p>I perceive that you want very much to be enlightened on the state of our press, which you appear to regard as being free, and which, as I am going to prove to you, is the most enslaved and the vilest thing that has ever been heard of ii the world under the name of press. I say, that I am going to prove this; and proof consists of undeniable facts, and not of vague assertions.</p>
<p>Advertising is the great source of revenue with our journals, except in very few cases, such as mine, for instance, who have no advertisements. Hence, these journals are an affair of trade and not of literature; the proprietors think of the money that is to be got by them; they hire men to write them; and these men are ordered to write in a way to please the classes who can give most advertisements. The Government itself pays large sums in advertisements, many hundreds a year, to some journals. The aristocracy, the clergy, the magistrates (who are generally clergy too) in the several counties; the merchants, the manufacturers, the great shopkeepers; all these command the press, because without their advertisements it cannot be carried on with profit.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>(5) Archibald Prentice, Historical Sketches and Personal Recollections of Manchester (1851)</p>
<p>In the first week of l830 William Cobbett delivered four lectures in Manchester to crowded audiences. Ten years before, on his return from the United States, the authorities notified to him that he should not be permitted to pass through the town. Many of his hearers were persons, who, at the former period, approved of that extraordinary exercise of power. His leading propositions were, that lessening the quantity of the currency had increased its value; that the increase in the value of money had increased the claims of all creditors, especially the public creditor; and that the fall in the price of every commodity, without a correspondent reduction of taxes, had occasioned intolerable distress. His wonderful power of illustration, on these few propositions, engaged the deep attention of crowded audiences every night, and the thunders of applause, with which he was greeted at the close of the course, must have made some amends to him for his scurvy non-reception in December, 1819. Two omissions, however, were remarked upon by even his ardent admirers, the monopoly of the corn growers, and the want of an adequate representation in the House of Commons, His then rival Hunt, a man of far inferior abilities, even as a speaker, had much sounder notions on the corn laws; and Cobbett seemed less anxious to have parliamentary reform than that he himself should be a member of parliament.</p>

<p>The Wyoming Commemorative Association is a non-profit organization, founded in 1877, to commemorate the Battle and Massacre of Wyoming, a Revolutionary War battle fought on July 3, 1778, near Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The Association was founded to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Battle and in an observance on July 3, 1778, about 50,000 people turned out to hear an address on the grounds of the Wyoming Monument (grave site of the recovered bones of the Massacre victoms) by then U.S. president Rutherford B. Hayes. Since that year, each year the Association holds an annual observance at the Monument.</p>
<p>The Commemoratove Association publishes their annual "<i>Proceedings</i>," which is distributed to their membership and to historical libraries.</p>

<p>Quox is a dragon that appears only in "Tik Tok of Oz". He is sent by Jinjin, a powerful ruler to assist a group of people (Ann Soforth, her army, and assorted friends) to punish the king of the Nomes. Quox is chosen because he had been disrespectful to his ancestor the Original Dragon. "His body was a lovely sky-blue in color and it was thickly set with glittering silver scales, each one as big as a serving-tray. Around his neck was a pink ribbon with a bow just under his left ear, and below the ribbon appeared a chain of pearls to which was attached a golden locket about as large around as the end of a bass drum. This locket was set with many large and beautiful jewels." (Tik Tok of Oz by Frank Baum). An electric lilght was attached to his tail and 12 seats were on his back. His 3056th birthday was approaching in "Tik Tok of Oz"</p>

<b>Dominic Toretto</b> is a character from the <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fast_and_the_Furious_b011.html" title="Fast and the Furious">Fast and the Furious</a> movie trilogy. He was played by actor <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vin_Diesel_e33d.html" title="Vin Diesel">Vin Diesel</a></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Biography</b></p>
<p>Toretto is presumably in his mid 20's during the first movie. It can be ascertained that he grew up in Los Angeles, and was interested in cars during his childhood.</p>
<p>His father was an up and coming racer in the Stock Pro Circuit, who's life was cut short when another racer named Linder struck his car as he was coming around a corner, and forced the car into a wall at a speed of over 120 Mph. This would have a profound affect on the young Toretto, who would go on to nearly fatally beat Linder to death with a wrench a week after the incident. He was subsequently banned from the tracks and served 2 years in jail at Lampoc.</p>
<p>During the time of the <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fast_and_the_Furious_b011.html" title="Fast and the Furious">Fast and the Furious</a>, Toretto would meet undercover officer Brian O'Connor of the M.A.P.D., who was investigating him for a string of truck robberies involving several high tuned Honda Civics. Even though Toretto was proven to be the mastermind behind these robberies, O'Connor let him go due to the friendship they developed, along with the fact he owed him a "10 Second Car" after initially losing his <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pink_slip.html" title="Pink slip">pink slip</a> to him during a race. Toretto has sinced eluded authorities for 5 years.</p>
<p>During the time of the Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, Toretto is currently in <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>,<a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>. It was revealed that sometime during those five years, he had made his way to <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>, met Han, and formed a close friendship to him. It was also revealed that he was beating many racers across Asia during this time.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-06_1ba4.html" title="Edit section: ArtSpace Virginia Miller Galleries">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">ArtSpace Virginia Miller Galleries</span></h2>
<p>More Than 300 Exhibitions Curated By South Florida’s Longest-established Contemporary Fine Art Dealer</p>
<p>For more than 35 years, Virginia Miller has introduced emerging and mid-career artists with unique personal visions as well as a number of historically significant modern masters to the South Florida art community.</p>
<p>Altogether, she has presented more than 300 exhibitions in a dozen locations, including five galleries: Coconut Grove, downtown Miami’s Miamarina, the Biltmore Hotel, her present ArtSpace/Virginia Miller Galleries in downtown Coral Gables, Florida, and the 9,000-square-foot ground floor of Douglas Centre. Her other venues include Broward Community College, the Boca Raton Museum, and various financial institutions and corporate offices. Miller also exhibits at such shows as Art Miami, Art Palm Beach, and arteaméricas (cq).</p>
<p>Some of her exhibitions have been spectacular, such as the one-person show of sculpture and paintings by Karel Appel, the installation of grass growing in the shape of Ana Mendieta’s body, or Eric Staller’s “Lightmobile,” a VW Beetle studded with 1,659 tiny computer-programmed light bulbs flashing in computer-generated patterns.</p>
<p>Other shows have been bold, such as Fernando Luis’ one-person exhibition of lascivious priests and pregnant nuns, or contemporary Russian art years before glasnost and perestroika, when the Soviet Union was still viewed as our nation’s enemy.</p>
<p>Their common denominator has been the “spirit” or artistic integrity of the work, a highly accomplished technique, and outstanding value. “As a dealer in contemporary works, I consider it my responsibility to help people learn how to look at art, to feel what it’s about, and not to be intimidated by new art forms,” she says.</p>
<p>Miller’s start in the art field was as unique as the works she sells. After working in a law firm and bank, then managing an advertising agency, she decided to return to college. As an undergraduate, she met artists who complained that local galleries only exhibited nationally known artists. Miller saw an opportunity, and soon she was organizing exhibitions of fine art in banks and other venues to benefit local charities. Beginning in the late 1960s, those exhibitions probably were Dade County’s first synergism of art and business for the benefit of charitable organizations.</p>
<p>After opening her gallery in 1974, five years after she began dealing in art, Miller sought out and curated major exhibitions of a number of important artists who had never beeen shown in the region.</p>
<p>In 1978 she held a retrospective of Alice Neel’s works on paper dating from 1926 to 1977. It was Neel’s first exhibition in Florida, and like all of Miller’s shows, it was curated by the director herself.</p>
<p>About that same time, Miller arranged for the first exhibit of models and architectural drawings by SITE, the multidisciplinary art and architecture organization from New York that had created a number of famous “deconstructed” buildings around the nation, including two in Greater Miami. Miller arranged for Greyhound buses to take art enthusiasts to tour them. Works from the SITE show went on to be exhibited in Ronald Feldman Fine Arts in New York and at the Museum of Modern Art.</p>
<p>The following year, ArtSpace/Virginia Miller Galleries mounted one of its largest exhibitions, 130 images from 19th and 20th century master photographers. Including works by the inventor of the photographic negative, William Henry Fox Talbot, and the first woman photographer, Anna Atkins, the show presented a history of photography.</p>
<p>In 1985 the gallery presented another historic blockbuster: Richard Pousette-Dart’s “Paintings: From the 1940s to the Present.” It was the first exhibition in the south for Pousette-Dart, youngest member of the first generation of the New York School of abstract expressionists. The following year Miller did a second Pousette-Dart exhibition, “Magical Radiances: Black and White” that included works from 1978 to 1981.</p>
<p>The gallery made cyber-history in December 1990, when Laurence Gartel used a digital camera developed by Canon for the Gulf War to photograph visitors as they entered the gallery and the first large toner printer to output manipulated color prints of their images. Gartel believes the event was the first time in history digital art had been produced at a gallery’s opening reception.</p>
<p>In 1992 ArtSpace/Virginia Miller Galleries presented Florida’s first major exhibition and sale of Australian aboriginal art, “Walk About In The Dreamtime.”</p>
<p>Six years later the gallery notched another historic exhibition, a one-person show of paintings by Ramón Oviedo, leading master artist of the Dominican Republic. Oviedo had never had a major exhibition in the United States.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2004, ArtSpace/Virginia Miller Galleries offered the latest in its series of exhibitions of modern masters. “Gunther Gerzso: Defining Mexican Abstraction” featured 86 works done from 1935 to 1941 by Mexico’s leading abstract artist, a world premiere of those early works as well as the artist’s first important exhibition in the Southeast.</p>
<p>While curating historic art exhibitions, Miller also commissioned two of the nation’s largest bronze sculptures—a 36 by 78-footer on Biscayne Bay in Miami and a 60-foot-tall work at the International Airport in Omaha, Nebraska. Other public sculptures she’s arranged include a larger-than-life bronze of baseball immortal Joe DiMaggio and a small boy at the Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital in Hollywood, Florida.</p>
<p>How does she select the work from the 200 applications that come into her gallery every month? “Early on, I chose to ignore the latest fads and instead to show only works that I personally relate to and artists that I believe in,” Miller says. “I always insist that my clients buy only art that they love. Although many of those works have appreciated in value substantially, I urge clients not to consider their art acquisitions merely as a financial investment, but as an investment in their quality of life.”</p>
<p>Judging by the number of grateful letters received by Miller from clients who bought work from her years before, her philosophy has proven successful.</p>

<p><b>The Beginning</b> In December 1915, Paul Doumer, on a visit to Russia, proposed that 300,000 troops be sent to France in exchange for munitions. While the Russian high command was not enthusiastic about this proposal, Czar Nicolas II was. General Alexeyev, chief of state, made an offer to send Russian troops to France so long as the Russian troops would be overseen by Russian officers under the French High Command and that the French Navy must equip and transport them.<i>1</i></p>
<p>The 1st Russian Special Brigade was formed in January, 1916, led by General Lokhvitsky. It was composed of the 1st and 2nd regiments from Moscow and Samara, respectively. The Brigade was formed mostly by reserve units, with the 1st regiment's troops mainly being factory workers and the 2nd's mainly being peasants, with a total of 8,942 men. It left Moscow on February 3, 1916 and arrived in Marseille on April 16 of the same year.<i>1</i></p>
<p>The 3rd, 4th and 5th Brigades soon followed. The 2nd and 4th Brigades arrived in Salonika in August and November of 1916. The 3rd Brigade was made up mostly of professional soldiers and reserve units formed in Yekaterinburg and Cheliabinsk and left for France in August of 1916.<i>1</i></p>
<p>General Brusilov was responsible for the 4 Special Brigades which contributed a total of 44,319 men to the war in France. The 6th, 7th and 8th Brigades were never formed because of the Russian Revolution. <i>1</i></p>
<p>Approximately 450 Estonian troops also served with the REF, mostly in the 1st and 3rd Brigades. After February of 1917 these troops wore small Estonian flags to distinguish themselves from their Russian allies. <i>3</i></p>
<p>On the 23rd of April the 1st Special Brigade was transferred to Chalons-sur-Marne and overseen by General Gouraud of the 4th Army. The French President was impressed by the camp and awarded General Lokhvitsky with the "Commander of the Legion of Honor" medal. The 1st Brigade was then sent to the East between Suippes and Auberive at the end of June, 1916.<i>1</i></p>
<p>By March of 1917 the Special Brigades were in the Fort Pompelle region, and on April 16, 1917 the 1st Brigade took Courcy and the 3rd brigade took Mount Spin, resulting in 4,542 men killed, wounded or missing in action.<i>1</i></p>
<p><b>Mutiny and Massacre</b> After the Russian Revolution and subsequent withdrawal of Russia from the Allied countries the Russian troops were looked upon with distrust and relegated to work companies and internment camps, primarily at Camp Militaire, near Courtine. The camp was divided into the 1st and 2nd Brigades. The Russian soldiers in one of the camps began questionning why they were fighting for the French at all and mutinied. The other camp was still led by Russian officers (notably Colonel Gotua) and was used to help supress the rebellious one. Finally the French, backed by a newly arrived Russian artillery force, shelled the rebellious camp, resulting in approximately 10 dead and 44 wounded, as well as an unknown number of dead and wounded shot by Gotua's camp. The survivors were at first sent to jail camps in North Africa and France, and after some months many were sent back to Russia, while a good number of the men integrated into French society.<i>2</i></p>
<p><b>Legion of Honor</b> The loyal men under Colonel Gotua demanded that they be allowed to fight and thus was formed the Russian Legion. It joined with the Moroccan Division on December 13, 1917. The combined units then took place in the fighting around Amien in March of 1918, with severe losses to the Moroccan Division and the Russian Legion. Captain Loupanoff of the Russian Legion was decorated with the Medal of the Legion of Honor by the commander of the Moroccan Division, General Douzan.<i>1</i></p>
<p>In May of 1918 the Moroccan Division took part in the fierce fighting on the road from Soissons to Paris. The Russian Legion was sent in by Colonel Lagarde as badly needed reinforcements for the Moroccan Division. Losses during the fighting accounted for nearly 85% of the Russian Legion's forces .<i>1</i></p>
<p>In July the Legion was sent reinforcements made primarily of volunteers from old regiments of the Expeditionary Corps and was reformed into the 1st Brigade of the Moroccan Division. More reinforcements arrived in August to bring the total to 2 1/2 infantry companies as well as a mortar unit which turned the Brigade into a Battalion. The Battalion was then sent towards Laffaux.<i>1</i></p>
<p>Marechal Foch, Commander of the French Army awarded the Russian Battalion with a special flag after their actions on September 12th, where the Battalion managed to pierce the German defenses, making its way through 3 lines of fortifications and capturing prisoners and materials, despite taking heavy losses. This attracted more volunteers such that by the 1st of November, 1918 the Battalion was comprised of 564 men. this in turn was divided into a machine gun company and 3 infantry companies.<i>1</i></p>
<p>After the German withdrawal to the border the Moroccan Division, including the Russian Battalion advanced upon Moyeuvre. The operation was halted by the signing of the armistice treaty on the 11th of November. Near the end of 1918 the entire Russian Battalion was recalled and demobilized.<i>1</i></p>

<b>Metro Valley/I-64 Corridor</b></p>
<p>The Metro Valley and I-64 Corridor are two overlapping areas located in the West-Central portion of West Virginia. Although the two terms are used synonymously, they do not in fact mean exactly the same thing or encompass the exact same area. They do overlap to a great extent. A large part, but not all, of the Metro Valley lies along the I-64 Corridor. Much, but not all, of the I-64 Corridor is located within the Metro Valley. The I-64 Corridor does not include the parts of the Metro Valley that do not lie along Interstate 64. The Metro Valley does not include those parts of the I-64 Corridor beyond the point where I-64 permanently diverges from the Kanawha River at Nitro.</p>
<p><br />
<b>The Metro Valley</b></p>
<p>The term “Metro Valley” in West Virginia refers to the cities, towns and unincorporated communities which are located along the Kanawha River, and two of its tributaries; the Elk River which flows into the Kanawha from the North in downtown Charleston and the Coal River which flows from the south and joins the Kanawha in St Albans. The largest city and hub of the Metro Valley is the city of Charleston, which is also the capital city of West Virginia.</p>
<p>The Metro valley stretches along both sides of the Kanawha River. The most populous section of the Valley includes the cities of South Charleston, Dunbar, St. Albans and Nitro and the unincorporated communities of Cross Lanes, Institute and Jefferson. The bulk of the population of the region lives in these communities. However, the Metro Valley contains communities farther upriver from Charleston, arguably as far east as Montgomery, and communities as far downriver as Winfield can be included in the region. In addition, the Metro Valley includes a small string of communities which lie along the Elk River as far north as Elkview and along the Coal River as far south as Tornado.</p>
<p>The Metro Valley also includes a rather populous area beyond the southern city limit of Charleston lying along US Route 119 as well as a similar populous area which stretches north along Interstate 77 and the Pocatalico River as far a Sissonville.</p>
<p><br />
<b>The I-64 Corridor</b></p>
<p>The I-64 Corridor is a term which refers to those communities and populated areas lying along the path of Interstate 64 between the two anchor cities of Charleston and Huntington. The Corridor begins in the East in Chelyan, which is the point where I-64 first begins to run parallel to the Kanawha River. (At this point I-64 is also designated the West Virginia Turnpike and I-77.) The western termination of the Corridor is usually considered to be the Kentucky state line. The cities and communities contained in the I-64 Corridor include Chelyan, Marmet, South Charleston, Dunbar, Institute, Cross Lanes, Nitro, St Albans, Teays Valley, Hurricane, Milton, Barboursville, Huntington, Ceredo and Kenova. There are numerous smaller populated areas along the Corridor as well.</p>
<p><br />
<b>The Metro Valley/I-64 Corridor as a Region</b></p>
<p>When considered together to be one region of the state, the Metro Valley/I-64 Corridor contains nearly 20% of the population of West Virginia, as well as the two largest cities in the state, a preponderant section of the state’s industry and commerce, three of the states public higher education institutions, the state’s two largest airports and the crossroads of its three major Interstate Highways. The rivers, highways and railroad systems in this region transport a large portion of West Virginia’s coal, chemical products and other industrial output.</p>
<p>In recent years, many of the communities in the region have dealt with loss of population, lack of employment opportunities and other economic difficulties. Since 1950, Charleston’s population has shrunk from over 85,000 to about 51,000. Huntington has experienced a similar population loss. During the mid-twentieth century, water and air pollution were a major problem due to the heavy industry in the Metro Valley.</p>
<p>However, the middle section of the I-64 Corridor, mostly located in Putnam County, has experienced a particularly strong period of growth since the early 1980’s, much of it fueled by people moving out of Charleston or Huntington.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-06_1ba4.html" title="Edit section: Shanith Samarasekera">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Shanith Samarasekera</span></h2>
<p><b>Shanith Aishan Samarasekera</b> (born november 12, 1991 in Boston, Massachusetts) is a teenager currently enrolled at Durango High School in Las Vegas.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Boston Days</b></p>
<hr />
<p>Shanith lived the first four and a half years of his life in the Boston metropolitan area. Living in a 3 bedroom apartment with his family (mother, brother, and father). He attended a pre-school named Lord Baron which was about a 5 minute walk away from his apartment. In these days young Shanith was a huge fan of Power Rangers, the green one being his favorite, he had all the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers memorobilia. Then during 1996 a member of his family on his dad's side got ill and in June of 1996 him and his family left for Sri Lanka.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Life in Sri Lanka</b></p>
<hr />
<p>Arriving in Sri Lanka in mid June of 1996 his mother, brother and grandparents lived in a single story 3 bedroom 2 bathroom house in the town of Kotte (this was his aunt's, who was residing in Boston at the time), while living here his parents were paying for the construction of a new house also in Kotte. His father lived in a suite in a 5 star hotel called Eden in the city of Beruwala where he was the GM. Shanith and his brother (rukesh) both attended Wycherly International School. In 1997 the new house was finished being built and his mother, brother and grandparents moved into it. The house was a beautiful 4 story, 4 bedroom (2 with balconies), 4 bathroom house that had an indoor garden, a guest house(which you could enter through the backyard or through a section of the 4th story), and a rooftop. The family also had 2 dogs, a street dog named Lucky and a Black &amp; Tan, Smooth Coated Miniature Dachshund named To-To. While living in this house Shanith became friends with the neighborhood kids and would regularly play cricket with them on the streets. On the weekends they would go to Eden and visit his dad, where Shanith became very close friends with a son of his dad's boss who lived on the floor below him named Nipuna. In 1998 thing's started seeming different in his parent's relationship, always hearing them argue and fight young Shanith knew that something wasn't right but didn't understand what was going on. He later found out that his dad was cheating on his mother with the hotel's hairdresser, who he's with to this day. This wasn't the first time that his father had been unfaithful but this time it was different, he was serious about the relationship, and things between his parents kept getting rockier and rockier (divorce was an option in Sri Lanka but at the time it was something that was something that people never considered). However one night when his mother had had enough of his cheating ways she confronted him and his dad went balistic, trying to kill his mother, Shanith and his brother tried helping out there mother but his dad knocked Shanith out and after sometime his brother finally pinned down his dad and security was able to come and take him away. This incident led to the divorce of his parents, in which his father specifically said he did not want custody of the children. Afterwards his mother, who was a lecturer at the Hotel School in Colombo, had a hard time managing on her paycheck alone and so she sold the dogs and the house and in September 12, 1999 left for Anaheim, CA to live with Shanith's aunt (the one whose house they lived in that used to reside in Boston).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Anaheim</b></p>
<hr />
<p>Arriving in Anaheim on September 15, 1999, Shanith and his family (mother, brother, grandfather)lived in a 2 bedroom apartment with his Aunt, Uncle, his Grandma (who had left for Anaheim in the beginning of 1999) and their newlyborn daughter. Shanith's stay here was for a little less than 3 months because in December of '99 his mother found a job in Vegas, and on January 1st, 2000, him, his mother, &amp; brother moved to Las Vegas, Nevada. His grandparents stayed in Anaheim and would go back to Sri Lanka together in February of 2000.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Vegas</b></p>
<hr />
<p>When the 3 first arrived in Las Vegas they lived in a 2 bedroom apartment, and attended Doris Hancock Elementary School. He soon became friends with a boy named Edwin Cerna Jr. who lived in the same apartment complex and went to the same school. He became very close with Edwin and to this day still talks to him. When 4th grade started he met a kid named Kuijan (Michael) Liang, and still thinks of Mike as the friend that he's been through everything with, and spends the most time with. In February of 2001 he moved to a 2 story, 3 bedroom 2 1/2 bathroom house in the southwest area of Las Vegas, in which he resides in today. When Shanith moved here he still went to Hancock for the remainder of his 4th grade school year. Then went to Helen Jydstrup Elementary School for 5th grade, here he became friends with a kid that lived by him named Erik Batres. The next year Shanith attended Grant Sawyer Middle School, where he remained close friends with Erik. For 7th and 8th grade Shanith went to school at Hyde Park Middle School. Where Mike went and where he would meet Guan (Kelly) Li; a beautiful, one in a million kind of girl. Also he met another kid named Abner Martinez, who is affectionately known as Donutman for his love of donuts, he clicked immediately with "donutman" and became close to him faster than he has with anyone he's ever met that wasn't family. When high school came Shanith decided to go to Valley High School where he started talking to a boy he went to middle school with named Jonathan Landy. He hit it off with Jonathan almost as fast as he did with Abner, and Jonathan became the kid that he always talked to when needing to get cheered up or just bored. Although him and Jonathan spent alot of time together freshman year Valley High School didn't work out for Shanith and he enrolled at Durango High School for the start of sophmore year.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Heroes</b></p>
<hr />
<p>Vince Carter- Shanith's favorite basketball player, he has accomplished what Shanith dreams to AND he did it even though his parents parted with a tough divorce too</p>
<p>Chris Bosh- Shanith's second favorite basketball player, he's a star in the NBA even though he came is as a real skinny kid with a long neck (like shanith)</p>

<p>Some men use the name "doats" as a pejorative (insult) to other men who act blonde or air headed. Also when one smokes weed in a group they are termed doats. Practically nothing to do with Mairzy Doates and the nursery rhyme that we grew up with. Although thats where I think the name started to come to use in.</p>

<p><a href="../../../m/y/s/Myschievia.html" title="Myschievia">Myschievia</a> is a regional burn event that happens every year in early October in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Texas_b5f0.html" title="North Texas">North Texas</a>.

<p>Myschievia started in 2005. Approximately 200 participants attended at a location about 2 hours west of the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex.

Sherwin Glass founded Farmer's Furniture Company, the largest furniture store in the US by number of stores. He was elected to the furniture hall of fame and engaged in huge philanthropy including providing the Sherwin Glass Swim Center at the Atlanta Jewish Community Center and endowing the Shana Glass Leadership Conference for the Anti-Defamation League in memory of his daughter who was murdered by her husband in 1993. There are lots of articles about the murder of course but there are also articles in the Atlanta Journal about the 30,000 square foot house he built. There were also magazine articles about him and he was on the cover of a magazine but I don't remember what it was called. He also received major awards from the Anti-Defamation League, Jewish Federation,</p>

In todays value, that deal would be worth approximately $100 million. Post-merger it created the largest performance based internet advertising network.</p>
<p>From December 1998 till November 2000, Gurbaksh retained the role as Chairman and CEO. After the merger, Gurbaksh retained the role as President where he oversaw the day-to-day operations of the Click Agents/ValueClick, Inc. media business. As well as continued to execute the strategic vision of the combined companies.</p>

<p>The Great Moderation is an economic term that refers to the phenomenon of reduction in the volatility of output in Gross Domestic Product. The Great Moderation is still in the midst of literature debate as it has not been yet fully identified. It is note worthy to mention that the Great Moderation Literature has become a focal point of research for economist in the past two years. The literature is very young and dynamic that there are more working papers established in the fiedl than there are published. Few published works citing the discovery and hypothesizing theories has been established The Great Moderation has been used to explain the reduction in volatility in GDP in the United States and later discovered (Summers, Peter 2005) in G-7 countries. The pattern of volatility reduciton is interestingly split between the G-7 nations that witness the phenomenon. On one hand, nations such as the United States, Great Britain, Italy, Australia and France experienced a rapid reduciton in growth variance, other nations such as Canada and Japan experienced up to two swings from high to lows before an established output volatility reduction. The United States GDP volatility reduction began in 1984.1 (the first quarter of 1984) according to Perez-Quiros and Maggie McConnel. The four most prevelant stories for output volatility reduction are: Structural change Labor Market Story Better Monetary Policy Good Luck International trade growth</p>

<p>196.27.76.73 07:09, 6 July 2006 (UTC) Thank for the opportunity allowed to me to request for an article.</p>
<p>I have family who have recently had strokes. Interestingly, it seemed to strike several people within close intervals of time, irrespective of age (but mostly above 40) and mostly men.</p>
<p>At first the patient recognises only close family and not much else. That is why they need a lot of love and attention and should be left, at any cost, to believe that they are alone on their own. As they grow out of the dangerous three weeks (or more, even up to a few months depending on the severity of the stroke) they might seem slowly to grow up from being a small child to an adult.</p>
<p>However some may encounter back pains and neck pains which I believe might be the result of nreves being reactivated. However I would welcome more information on that.</p>
<p>Thanks Minerva</p>

<p>A common connection point for devices in a network. Hubs are commonly used to connect segments of a LAN. A hub contains multiple ports. When a packet arrives at one port, it is copied to the other ports so that all segments of the LAN can see all packets.</p>
<p>A passive hub serves simply as a conduit for the data, enabling it to go from one device (or segment) to another. So-called intelligent hubs include additional features that enables an administrator to monitor the traffic passing through the hub and to configure each port in the hub. Intelligent hubs are also called manageable hubs.</p>
<p>A third type of hub, called a switching hub, actually reads the destination address of each packet and then forwards the packet to the correct port</p>

<p>Βρίσκεται στο νομό Ημαθίας. Δε γνωρίζουμε την προέλευση του ονόματός του. Πολλοί θεωρούν ότι η παλιά ονομασία του ήταν Καρυές. και βρισκόταν σε απόσταση περίπου τριών χιλομέτρων πιο πάνω από το σημεό που βρίσκεται σήμερα. Ιστορικά στοιχεία και έγγραφα όμως αναφέρουν την συνύπαρξη την ίδια εποχή τόσο των Τρικάλων όσο και των Καρυών ως ξεχωριστές περιοχές. Η παλιά εκκλησία του Αγίου Δημητρίου, λίγο έξω από το χωριό, χτισμένη περίπου το 1750 μαρτυρά τη μεγάλη ιστορία της περιοχής. Οι πρώτοι κάτοικοι ήταν ντόπιοι. Το 1925 έρχονται οι πρώτοι πρόσφυγες από την Ανατολική Ρωμυλία, το 1938 Σαρακατσάνοι Βλάχοι ενώ το 1940 έρχονται και αρκετοί Πόντιοι. Σύμφωνα με την τελευταία απογραφή του 1991, ο πληθυσμός του χωριού φάινεται να είναι 1725 κάτοικοι. Σύμφωνα με τα σημερινά δεδομένα όμως οι κάτοικοί του φτάνουν τις 550 οικογένειες, τους 2000 κατοίκους δηλαδή. Το χωριό είναι εξ ολοκλήρου πεδινό και απέχει 40 χμ. τόσο από τη Βέροια, την πρωτεύουσα του νομού, όσο κι από τη Θασσαλονίκη. Αρχικά υπαγόταν στην κοινότητα Κορυφής Ημαθίας που απέχει 5 περίπου χιλόμετρα. Το έτος 1947, για πρώτη φορά, απέκτησε δική του κοινότητα. Λειτουργεί Δημοτικό, Γυμνάσιο, και διθέσιο Νηπιαγωγείο. Εκτός από αυτά στο χωριό υπάρχει επίσης Αγροτικός Συναιτερισμός, Γραφείο Τοπικού Οργανισμού Εγγείων Βελτιώσεων, Αγροτικό Ιατρείο και Μετεωρολογικός Σταθμός. Τα Τρίκαλα είναι κατεξοχήν αγροτικό χωριό. Τα προϊόντα που καλλιεργούνται είναι βαμβάκι, καλαμπόκι, ροδάκινα, μήλα, αχλάδια, σπαράγγια, βιομηχανική ντομάτα, κηπευτικά, ρύζι, σόγια κ.ά. Αρκετοί κάτοικοι ασχολούνται και με την κτηνοτροφία. Τα Τρίκαλα ως χωριό ξεχωρίζουν για την άριστη δυμοτομία τους. Το έτος 1986 με Προεδρικό Διάταγμα χαρακτηρίστηκαν ως "ΑΝΟΙΧΤΗ ΠΟΛΗ".</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-06_1ba4.html" title="Edit section: Ishpeming Public School District No. 1">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../i/s/h/Ishpeming_Public_School_District_No._1_b1e3.html" title="Ishpeming Public School District No. 1">Ishpeming Public School District No. 1</a></span></h2>
<p>The people of Ishpeming have always desired a quality education for their children. In 1868, before Ishpeming was incorporated as a village in 1869 and a city four years later, a charter to form a school district was granted. The meeting to organize the school district was called by Julius Ropes who started the Ropes Gold Mine north of town. The first school house in the district was built at the Cleveland Mine. It was a single story frame building which was closed in 1870, with a new school being erected on Ready Street at a cost of $2,000. This school also closed and now serves as a Masonic Temple. A second school was built on the corner of Main and Division Streets containing three classrooms to accommodate the Lake Superior Mine and Barnum Mine locations. It was closed when the Division Street School was constructed on the present high school site. Another school was located at the Nelson Mine Location which was in the area now known as Wabash Heights. This building was moved to the Junction Location in 1896. The Junction School was closed in 1943 due to falling enrollments in the area and the advent of bus transportation.</p>
<p>The Division Street School, a large three story brick building, was constructed in 1874 where the present high school now stands, at a cost of $38,000. It was poorly constructed and not well-planned, being heated with coal stoves in each room. An interesting note was that the teachers went out on strike in 1879, refusing to continue carrying hods of coal from the basement to their rooms. It would be 110 years later, 1989, when the teachers would walk out in the only work refusal in the 20th century. In 1880, a hot air heating system was installed, but during cold winter days children had to be sent home. In May, a new heating system was installed. The school was demolished in 1908 to make room for a new high school. The old Salisbury School, a two-room structure, was built in 1881 at a cost of $2,000 for the building and site. This school was replaced by a six room building in 1890 at a cost of $13,000. It was closed in 1949. A three room school was constructed on the corner of Ridge and Lake Streets in 1891. This proved to be inadequate to the needs of the locality and a second story, consisting of five rooms, was added the next year, completing the very neat and attractive Ridge Street School. This school was closed in 1962 and is now utilized as an apartment building.</p>
<p>The High Street School, or the first high school, was a beautiful structure of brick with sandstone trim and a slate roof. A substantial iron fence surrounded the landscaped grounds. The total cost was $23,445 when completed in 1886. This school was later demolished to make room for the C.L. Phelps Middle School. The Grammar School, the then new high school, was dedicated in 1896. The total cost of this superb building, with its landmark clock tower, was $24,580. William G. Mather, President of Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co., purchased the equipment for the Manual Arts Department which was located in the basement of the new building.</p>
<p>The Manual Arts Building, the west wing of the present high school, was erected in 1900. It was described as the first and best appointed building entirely devoted to industrial arts in the State of Michigan. Charles M. Schwab, President of Carnegie Steel Co., donated $1,000 for equipment. He made this comment, “It is a fine place for young gentlemen who will be taught to use their hands and heads within its walls.”</p>
<p>The old high school building on Division Street, that most of the older residents remember, was built in 1908 and was destroyed by fire on August 25, 1930. During the 1930-31 school year the entire town served as campus for the student body. Makeshift classrooms were set up in community lodges, halls, and vacant business space. By September of 1931, the student body was welcomed back to the present high school. Razing of the old and erection of the new, magnificent high school had been completed in one year a at a cost of $330,000.</p>
<p>This completed the building of schools by a group of dedicated men elected to the Board of Education in those pioneer days of Ishpeming. Many of the names are very prominent in our early history as being leaders in business and industry. Ishpeming was a very fast growing community in the late 1800’s. By 1900 the population was about 13,000, or nearly twice as large as it is today. One realizes why schools were being built so rapidly when one looks at school enrollments. In 1868, there were 307 pupils. In 1875 it had increased to 1300 and to 2790 by 1897. In contrast, the total enrollment in 1984 was only 1339. While the total enrollment was large in those days, less than 5% entered high school and less than 2% of graduates entered college. From 1884 to 1893, the largest graduating class contained eight pupils, with no graduates recorded for 1885 and 1902 school years. Teachers today would be horrified to learn that grade school instructors had an average of 56 pupils in their rooms in 1896. High school teachers had a few less in each class.</p>
<p>Sports played an important part in the lies of students and the whole community. Our school teams played not only other high schools, but teams from the colleges in Marquette and Houghton and adult city teams. One Lower Michigan reporter said that our boys tackled hardwood trees all winter and summer in logging camps and came back to play football in the fall. His team lost by a big score in a game played for the championship of Michigan.</p>
<p>Another era in the history of our schools started when C.L. Phelps was hired as superintendent of schools in 1915. He had a tremendous impact on the educations in Ishpeming during his twenty-seven year tenure. His ancestors were farmers in southern Illinois, but he wanted no part of that. He worked his way through Dartmouth College earning Phi Beta Kappa honors on his way. One of his main goals in education was to have instructors teach all children how to read, write, and cipher to the best of their abilities. Attesting to his success in this endeavor are the grand achievements of thousands of IHS students recorded in all walks of life. He was a strong believer in a diversified education by stressing industrial arts, music, forensics, arts, and sports. His love of sports led to the building of one gymnasium in 1923. At that time it was one of the finest athletic facilities in the state. Mr. Phelps retired in 1942 and Ogden Johnson very ably continued the idea that every student deserved a quality education.</p>
<p>Two new schools were built in the1950’s. The Birchview Elementary School was dedicated in 1958. It contained eight classrooms, a multipurpose room, kitchen, and cafeteria. A new facility for special students was also provided. An addition to the school was constructed in 1971 to accommodate an influx of students to the area created by mining expansion. The C.L. Phelps Middle School was dedicated in 1959. In addition to the formal classrooms, the school had facilities for home economics, industrial arts, music, art, a large multipurpose room, and a large kitchen and cafeteria. 1985-86 would see the High School/Central School complex receive all new doors and windows, along with other heat conservation measures, a cost just exceeding one-half million dollars. The highly successful 1984 IHS Centennial Yearbook and Reunion proved to be a catalyst for physical change in the district. The Centennial Celebration profits of approximately $20,000 would provide the seed money for a $300,000 renovation of the beautiful auditorium which would soon after be named for long serving teacher and administrator, W.C. Peterson. This auditorium renovation would be financed almost in total by alumni and friends. The project also benefited from many hours of volunteer labor. The community continued the push to bring our educational facilities up to standards in 1995 by passing a 15 year millage levy that finances physical and technological improvements in the district and generates approximately $140,000 per year. The most recent commitment made by our community was the 1997 bond issue that generated $4.3 million and allowed the district to bring the 70 year old facility up to standards, correct some long standing deficiencies, construct a new gymnasium, and enhance the beauty of this historic complex. Modern Art and Music rooms would also be created in the new Technology and Fine Arts wing (old Manual Training Building.)</p>
<p>Keeping pace with the Technological Revolution is the continuing task of the school district. Classrooms, from preschool to high school, find this technology available. The Technology and Fine Arts wing now boast a Computer Assisted Design (CAD) Lab and computer driven machinery in the Woods and Machine Shops. The challenge lying ahead for our school district is to allow our future leaders to effectively compete in this fast-moving revolution. Schools of Choice legislation has dictated that a “business as usual” approach is no longer acceptable. Accepting and retaining students is and will be the challenge of schools throughout Michigan. Modern and attractive facilities, a current, comprehensive curriculum, a dedicated staff, and scholarship incentives to higher education all play a part in this most challenging educational period.</p>

<p>Explome is pronounced ah-splome ignoring the "k" sound in the x. Explome is the feeling one gets after an internal sneeze. An "internal sneeze" is really a sneeze someone tries, and fails, to hold in. Explome is the feeling of the sneeze shooting out your nose, and making your nose and/or face feel blocked as it puffs up, it usually lasts for 5-10 seconds or until you inhale again. The word explome comes from the word "explode" because an internal sneeze explodes out your nose (or at least that is how it feels). The pronunciation coincides with how a person speaks with explome ( because your face experiences this "spasm" it tends to mumble words, also the "puffing up" of your face and nose causes you to speak like you have a blocked nose) so the "e" sounds "ah".</p>
<p>I am not certain how farspread explome has been experienced, or if it has been experienced before, there are also some who feel explome with every sneeze, some don't feel it at all. I am just noting that this is a feeling that has not been researched remarkably</p>
