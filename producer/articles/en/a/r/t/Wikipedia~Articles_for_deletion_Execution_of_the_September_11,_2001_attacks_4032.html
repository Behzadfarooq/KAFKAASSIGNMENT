<li>Unsubstantiated? Every statement in the article is backed up with a verifiable source. Is there anything specific that you disagree with or can contend to? In not, there is no justification for removing this information. --Ghost of Jefferson
<ul>
<li>Every statement might be backed up, however the fact that they are all related to the execution of the 9/11 attacks is not. As it is, the article is a bag of statements with no real connection between them and the attacks. Also, there is no visible link between the first and the second parts of the article. The article looks too much like <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 03:35, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why does it seem that there is something like this on Wikipedia floating around already? You might also want to check the 9/11 category -- <a href="../../../r/i/f/User%7ERiffsyphon1024_ff13.html" title="User:Riffsyphon1024">Riffsyphon1024</a> 03:05, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Really interesting. Notice how different that article was before User:69.202.14.140 started editing it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Planning_and_execution_of_the_September_11%2C_2001_attacks&amp;oldid=9907563" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Planning_and_execution_of_the_September_11%2C_2001_attacks&amp;oldid=9907563" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> compared with the current version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Planning_and_execution_of_the_September_11%2C_2001_attacks&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=9907563" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Planning_and_execution_of_the_September_11%2C_2001_attacks&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=9907563" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. It also adds a new reason for deletion -- <a href="../../../d/u/p/Wikipedia%7EDuplicate_articles_da79.html" title="Wikipedia:Duplicate articles">duplicate article</a>. Not that it's User:Ghost of Jefferson's fault; he did try to remove the contents from that article in the same day he created the subject of this VfD, but someone else reverted him (wrongly thinking he was removing whole sections in a feeble attempt to improve the quality of the article). <a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 04:12, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Any useful information should be included in one of the many other 9/11 articles. This article also needs so much cleanup that it likely wouldn't be worth the effort. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarrp_aa18.html" title="User talk:Carrp">Talk</a> 03:41, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Please do not delete.</b> I apologize for all the confusion. I originally included this material in the "Planning and Execution" section, however the page became too large. In order to clean it up I separated "Planning" and "Execution" into two separate categories. The "Financial Support" doesn't exactly fit the title but I believe the information is very relevant and should remain someplace on the site. I'll admit that it needs clean up, but I plan on improving and expanding both parts of the article in the near future. In response to this being <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, there are no "new theories" proposed in the text; it is all documented information. In response to CesarB, the war games <i>are</i> connected to the execution of the attacks for the following reasons: Officials at NEADS and the FAA originally considered the hijackings to be part of Vigilant Guardian and acting CJCS Richard Myers reported Vigilant Warrior as conflicting with fighter response. NORAD's already limited amount of fighters were participating in a bi-national live-fly exercise that pulled Air Force resources away from NEADS and towards Alaska and the North Pole. False blips had been injected onto FAA and military radar screens. A nuclear strike/retaliation was being simulated and planes were sitting on the ground armed with nuclear weapons. The NRO and the CIA were simulating a plane crashing into their headquarters. And there were other exercises that have yet to be investigated, such as Apollo Guardian and Crown Vigilance. This information is almost impossible to find, and I would argue that Wikipedia is the only place that it is fully and objectively documented. I am therefore issuing a plea to the community to keep this information available and accessible to all Wikipedians. --Ghost of Jefferson

<li>1. On 9/11, NORAD had 20 fighters -- 14 in the US, 6 in Canada -- an unknown number of which were participating in at least two of the war games -- Vigilant Warrior and Northern Vigilance -- both of which drew fighters towards Alaska and the North Pole.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>2. Numerous military and FAA officials said they thought the attacks were part of Vigilant Guardian, including one who said "everybody" at NEADS originally considered the hijackings to be part of the exercise.</li>

<li>5. At 9:38, almost an hour after the WTC had first been hit, when asked about fighter response, acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Richard Myers stated, "Not a pretty picture...We're in the middle of Vigilant Warrior, a NORAD exercise".</li>

This was <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/defense/1227842.html?page=1" class="external text" title="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/defense/1227842.html?page=1" rel="nofollow">just covered</a> by <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_Mechanics_bb04.html" title="Popular Mechanics">Popular Mechanics</a> including the datas regarding scrambling of jets.

</ul>
<p><b>According to the Popular Mechanics article</b>: <i>"In the decade before 9/11, NORAD intercepted only one civilian plane over North America: golfer Payne Stewart's Learjet, in October 1999."</i><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/defense/1227842.html?page=3&amp;c=y" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/defense/1227842.html?page=3&amp;c=y" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> However the Associated Press reported on August 12, 2002: <i>"From Sept. 11 to June, NORAD scrambled jets or diverted combat air patrols 462 times, almost seven times as often as the 67 scrambles from September 2000 to June 2001, Martin said.</i></p>
<p><i>In June, Air Force jets scrambled three times to intercept small private planes that had wandered into restricted airspace around the White House and around Camp David, the presidential retreat."<a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/020812ap" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wanttoknow.info/020812ap" rel="nofollow">[4]</a><a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/iraq/comment/0,12956,1036687,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/iraq/comment/0,12956,1036687,00.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></i></p>
<p>Popular Mechanics also states <i>"it took an F-16 1 hour and 22 minutes"</i> to reach Payne Stewart's jet, however <i>The Dallas Morning News</i> of <i>The Knight-Ridder Tribune</i> reported on October 26, 1999 the following...</p>
<p><i>"according to an Air Force timeline, a series of military planes provided an emergency escort to the stricken Lear, beginning with a pair of F-16 Falcons from the Air National Guard at Tyndall Air Force Base, Fla., about 20 minutes after ground controllers lost contact."</i><a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/991026dmn.orig" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wanttoknow.info/991026dmn.orig" rel="nofollow">[6]</a><a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/991026dallasmorningnews" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wanttoknow.info/991026dallasmorningnews" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<p>Popular Mechanics also states: <i>"Rules in effect back then, and on 9/11, prohibited supersonic flight on intercepts."'</i> However ABC News reported in September 2002, after interviewing the pilots, that the fighters scrambled on 9/11 were traveling at <i>"mach 1.2, nearly 900 mile per hour."</i><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/cache/pentagon/attack/abcnews091102_jenningsinterviews.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://911research.wtc7.net/cache/pentagon/attack/abcnews091102_jenningsinterviews.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>All the other points made in the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_Mechanics_bb04.html" title="Popular Mechanics">Popular Mechanics</a> article refer to the ridiculous claims made on letsroll911.org, which never really required a debunking because very few people believe in such garbage. Most people questioning the government's official story don't believe in missile/pod theories. In fact, they have risen some very valid arguments, however such people are usually shadowed by-, grouped with-, or dismissed as-"conspiracy theorists". Incredibly, the points in the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_Mechanics_bb04.html" title="Popular Mechanics">Popular Mechanics</a> article that <i>do</i> refer to the topic I've been discussing, as shown above, are false. --Ghost of Jefferson</p>

<li><b>Please do not Delete!!</b> I have looked into the suspicous facts surounding 9/11 and this is the way it happened. The wargames threw off NORAD and it is important for people to understand this. It was an inside job, and the use of the wargames explains how so many good people operated for the execution of the ultimate crime.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> - It seems there are three parts to this entry: the title, an article on military exercises and another on the money trail. Both the articles are on topics of general importance and interest. When someone has taken the trouble to collect together the relevant sources on a topic it is a waste to just delete it all.
