<p><b>Nomination for deletion</b> This article is primarily an original research synthesis (which is anyway based on primary source material of a comedic nature which is unreliable for the serious-mindedness of this analysis) - fails <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. An earlier version of the article briefly made it onto the main page DYK section before being removed for lacking reliable sources.</p>
<p>Please see the earlier version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amphibiosan&amp;oldid=103900966" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amphibiosan&amp;oldid=103900966" rel="nofollow">here</a> with my comment about this on the main page error report page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Main_Page/Errors&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103906406" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Main_Page/Errors&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103906406" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>Since then the article has been updated - the original version's own assertion that as Futurama is a comedy, it is an unreliable primary source and may not be regarded as an effort at creating stable or canonical definitions has been removed, though the long list of serious-minded research conclusions about the biology of this fictional comedy species derived from the primary source remains. Further references have been added but these amount to further original research efforts to justify the long list of serious-minded guesses - the new references are mainly links to actual biology texts that do not mention this species at all. They are simply used to support a fan's speculation. Then there's a link to a one-line speculation in a review on Startrek.com that the "Grand Midwife "seems like a cross between Yoda and T'Pau""(?), a link to an almost-no-content random fansite page<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~mountfuturama/worldsoffuturama.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.earthlink.net/~mountfuturama/worldsoffuturama.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and also, it is strangely implied that as one of the Futurama writers may have a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry, this supports the original research?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the problem of the name of the article persists from the original version - the article itself indicates that it is not based on reliable sources:<i>"Although the name "Amphibios 9" is shown clearly in "Kif Gets Knocked Up A Notch", "Amphibiosans" are never referred to as such in the series. The name has, however, been picked up by fans and is used in such capacities as fan fiction and role-playing game statistics. Note that in Futurama, the inhabitants of Earth are called "Earthians"."</i></p>

<dd><b>Reply</b> The main issue here is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> - the name of the article is but one element of the problem with the article content. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> is a core content policy. The previous version of the article is relevant for the related comments which still apply to this version. I created <a href="../../../r/a/n/Wikipedia%7ERandom_page_patrol_a2ff.html" title="Wikipedia:Random page patrol">Wikipedia:Random page patrol</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedian_random_page_patrollers_e410.html" title="Category:Wikipedian random page patrollers">Category:Wikipedian_random_page_patrollers</a> - I encourage all to join. Fans do often put a lot of work into their fan culture artefacts and writings - this doesn't make these encyclopedically notable. I already gave the creator a break by not opting to afd immediately after the article was pulled from the main page, but waiting for a few days instead. There are a ton of Wikipedia articles with "blatant problems" - this one appeared on the main page, so it was rather more "blatant" than average and caught my attention. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 09:48, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The author has apparently left Wikipedia in disgust over matters having nothing to do with this article. He's had 45 DYK's in 2 months and wrote <a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHouseOfScandal_Articles_ee78.html" title="User:HouseOfScandal/Articles">all of these articles</a>. They’re not fancruft either. Because of that track record that was hoping he will return. And now, out of all the crap on Wikipedia that sits there unchallenged, this admittedly stupid but at least well-written article gets dragged to AfD. There are guidelines regarding when to ignore all other guidelines when it serves the greater good. Going tough on this article is not serving a greater good. It’s just mean. -<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaundakulbara_cc51.html" title="User:Shaundakulbara">Shaundakulbara</a> 10:27, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I didn't say it was it crufty, I said it was original research. He may have written a lot of DYK articles (kudos to him - though its hardly the same as writing featured articles or even as hard as writing ones classifiable as good articles), but this one's below par. <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> (which is a poorly thought out policy anyway, in my opinion) is designed to serve the encyclopedia's mission, not to protect people's feelings.

<dd>Yes, thanks for your recent "surveillance run" through my list of articles on my user page, which was apparently a response to my expressing my opinion in an unrelated discussion<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2007_January_31#Adam4Adam" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2007_January_31#Adam4Adam" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I'm baffled why I was singled out for this monitoring/discrediting effort, as my role in that discussion was quite limited before you started your little exercise. I was waiting to see if it would cross over into full-blown wiki-stalking or not. If you bothered to look at the histories of the few articles you tagged as having reference problems (actually you overlooked the external links provided in the articles for a couple of them - and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Pearl_96c2.html" title="Princess Pearl">Princess Pearl</a> is out of my hands. I keep that up to mark the first time that I rescued a badly written stub from speedy delete - I rewrote it as a coherent stub with a notability claim and pretty much left it to the fans after that (I've never seen the show)), you will see that those articles come from much earlier in my wikiexperience when I was experimenting with creating stubs and basic articles and was content to just to drop in a few external links). I keep them on my user page for nostalgic purposes. The kind of article content I create now are more like <a href="../../../j/m/w/JMWAVE_8bce.html" title="JMWAVE">JMWAVE</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_American_School_of_Medicine_5b99.html" title="Latin American School of Medicine">Latin American School of Medicine</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Soubise_dffc.html" title="Julius Soubise">Julius Soubise</a> which reflect my experience gained since those early days. For the record, I've <i>never</i> attempted original research synthesis - even in my novice days. It's useful to have someone to remind one that one's early attempts at articles could do with some brushing up (I'd rather forgotten about them) - but may I respectfully remind you to read <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, and to avoid the comprehensive "checking out" of editors you disagree with in policy discussions - it can give a bad impression. If you feel that editors without a perfect editing history should be barred from nominating articles for afd or participating in article discussions, I encourage you to voice your ideas in the appropriate policy channels. Apologies to the rest of the afd participants for this disruption of the discussion. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 11:08, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> At first glance the article has references, but on examination they turn out to be a Futurama comic book, which would be ok if it contains the statement that it is supposed to reference. In addition there are the editors' original research from viewing the TV show, and blogs and fan fiction, which are not reliable sources. The reliable sources, biology books, are not about the subject of the article. The series is notable, and has multiple independent reliable sources to show that. The individual episodes probably do not, and the individual characters such as this probably do not. The mass of related articles appear to be a case of loyal fans of a fictional work showing their appreciation of the work by spewing articles about every minute aspect of it all over Wikipedia, however non-notable they are by the applicable standards. I like Sherlock Holmes stories, but I do not find it necessary to write an article about every person he encountered, every place he went, and everything he touched in the stories. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 01:12, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The article actually uses <i>only</i> written sources, mostly scripts. The blog and fan fiction mention is a <i>tiny</i> element of this article and could be removed in a snap if we rename it. Let's please try not to judge this article differently because it is based on scripts of a comedy show. I'm not convinced discussing certain elements of a script is original research. Any article involves selecting info to present versus info that isn't relevant. There are no theories here nor personal observations other than saying what species traits the green guy showed in certain episodes. Pointing out stuff like Amphibosians have nipples like mammals but are invertebrates because they have no bones doesn't cross the line into original research. And please remember that there is lots of esoteric minutae on Wikipedia...while it can go too far Wikipedia really is the place for it. <a href="../../../c/e/p/Cephalopod_size.html" title="Cephalopod size">Cephalopod size</a> is its own article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cheetah_Girls_tours_3772.html" title="The Cheetah Girls tours">The Cheetah Girls tours</a> is its own article, as is <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Marx_25d1.html" title="Young Marx">Young Marx</a>. I'm not convinced this is original research nor that it's too specialized since other Futurama races have articles as well. No one answered me when I asked if those should be proposed for deletion too. How about this article on the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mor-Taxan_cc81.html" title="Mor-Taxan">Mor-Taxans</a>?

It would be irrational and illogical to simply delete the information contained in this article. I haven't looked at all the race/planet <i>Futurama</i> articles on wikipedia, but I'd imagine if there's that big of an objection, they could all be merged into one article, maybe? Ok, now I have looked at all planet/alien <i>Futurama</i> articles and they could be merged into one article of <i>all planets and their inhabitants of Futurama</i>.

<dd><b>Reply</b>. My thought that it would be irrational and illogical to simply delete the information of this article was not because of compliance to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> (although I'm not so sure it truly is in violation of that policy). Why I believe it to be irrational and illogical is because of all the other fictional material that is articled on Wikipedia. Nearly everything in this article can be verified by looking at the script of one episode and a few pictures. That's why I think it could just as easily be condensed and merged with one or more of the other Futurama articles. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChickenmonkey_1a0f.html" title="User:Chickenmonkey">Chickenmonkey</a> 21:37, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> Just because similar fictional material exists on Wikipedia is not a solid argument for keep per <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">WP:POKEMON</a>. And if that material has similar problems, they are also subject to action under <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Most of the article (including the <i>title</i>) cannot be sourced to primary source material (which itself has been described as unreliable by the article in the version which appeared on DYK) without original research leaps of faith <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/a/n/Wikipedia%7ERandom_page_patrol_a2ff.html" title="Wikipedia:Random page patrol">Join Up!

<li><b>Reply</b>. It is my understanding, through reading <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOSWAF_a12d.html" title="WP:MOSWAF">WP:MOSWAF</a> and similar guideline articles, that citing an episode is acceptable as a primary source. The episode of "Kif Gets Knocked Up A Notch" contains much of the information in this article. There are faults, which include analysis that seemingly came from the editor(s) of this article (which should/could be reworded), and as I said, it could be merged with <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amphibios_9.html" title="Amphibios 9">Amphibios 9</a> (or more Futurama articles about races/planets) which would take care of the title issue. If the information not needed in this article and the information that shouldn't be in this article were removed and it were rewritten, I believe it could be merged easily. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChickenmonkey_1a0f.html" title="User:Chickenmonkey">Chickenmonkey</a> 23:42, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge, redirect and delete pics</b>. Indeed, a article for the planet and another one the species isn`t usefull. Also, there are too many images, I would leave only one with the planet, the larval stage, Kif Kroker of course and upload one with the president of DOOP.--<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlextrevelian_006_56b0.html" title="User:Alextrevelian 006">ometzit&lt;col&gt;</a> 18:52, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
