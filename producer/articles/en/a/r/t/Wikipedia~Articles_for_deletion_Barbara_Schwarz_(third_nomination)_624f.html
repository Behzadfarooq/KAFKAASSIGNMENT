<li>Perhaps I misunderstand Wikipedia policy, but from what I have read it is wrong to have an article whose only purpose is to attack an individual. This seems to be what the Barbara Schwarz article is about. People who disagree with her opinions about Scientology, be they Church of Scientology members, Scientology critics, or church members pretending to be critics to make the real critics look stupid and mean spirited, have been running a personal attack on her for years. Perhaps someday history will judge that Barbara was important enough to merit a place in the encyclopedia. However, as of now, the only reason people are writing about her is to try to frighten or intimidate her to silence a person whose opinions don't fit into their own particular worldviews. Although I don't agree with everything Barbara says I admire her courage and I will stand up for her right to express herself.<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 03:04, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Subject appears to be notable enough for encyclopedia in context of history of Scientology and perhaps the FOIA. Users such as Steve Dufour may have concerns about the neutrality of the article, but deletion nomination is the not the proper channel to address this. Use the talk page and neutrality dispute tags.

<li><b>Comment</b> This is actually the third nomination (see <a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarbara_Schwarz_ee6c.html" title="Talk:Barbara Schwarz">Talk:Barbara Schwarz</a> for links to the first two). It would be good if an experienced admin could rename it, since the operation seems possibly a little tricky (pagemove the afd, update the afd log, and I would say delete the redirect resulting from the page move, edit the subst'ed afd template in the article, and conceivably I'm still missing something). I'm reluctant to attempt the move myself because of this complexity. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 03:37, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Wikipedia community as a whole. A number of quite valid issues with the article have been raised here. The more people who can get involved and collaborate, the better. The policy, <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons</a>, recognizes that controversial people can be difficult, so reliability and citation of information is critical. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 13:24, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Barbara has made a name for herself in both the internet community, in the FOIA community, and among many in the federal, state, and local court systems. She has activly searched and worked to place herself in the public eye and certainly has never tried to protect her privicy. She has done interviews with newspapers, made lots of legal threats, gone on hate campaigns against people she has never met, contacted peoples employers to complain about them, filed reports of alleged wrongdoing with various police departments of people she does not like, and spammed various news groups with her libel (although she might not call it that.) Much of this is known by her own admissions or her advertising what she has done. Barbara has certainly worked to make herself notable over the past three years. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuper7_252b.html" title="User:Super7">Super 7 - Everything else is just transport</a> 13:57, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I concur with user Brimba. This does not appear to be an "attack article" as the nominator for deletion suggests. It appears that this Wikipedia article is based completely on Ms. Schwarz's own public statements on Usenet and her subsequent spamming and abuse of Usenet as detailed by the links in this article. This article is also sourced with public records including judicial rulings and newspaper articles. In my estimation, the nominator proposes this deletion simply because he seems to feel that the facts regarding Ms Schwarz, and her apparent eccentric behavior, are unflattering if not embarassing when presented for public analysis and consumption. This article, I feel, is an integral piece in a body of research on the unique Church of Scientology and one of it's more outspoken former members. --Vrenault 14:47, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't think there is harm in having this discussion. Wikipedia is built upon <i>consensus</i>, which can change and evolve as the Wiki Community grows.
