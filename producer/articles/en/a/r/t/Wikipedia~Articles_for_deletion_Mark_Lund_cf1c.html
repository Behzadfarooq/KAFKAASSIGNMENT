<li><b>Keep</b>, I am the author of this page. My experience in the world of figure skating speaks for itself and I refer to the user who quoted Google. It is fair to say, that having skated for 10 years, coached for several, published a figure skating magazine for 11 years, appeared on countless TV shows as an expert, my work during the 2002 Winter Olympics, winning an award from the Professional Skaters Association for best figure skating publication, published a book on the sport and was selected by one of the top four networks in the United States for a television show specific to the sport of figure skating, speaks to notability. Whether it is I, or a publicist, or other person that promotes the facts of my experience based on truthful knowledge, the page should stay. This page has been up for months and it is only because of a recent television appearance that certain users want this page removed. Everything in this article is factual and, I believe, keeps within the policies of Wikipedia. This great Web site should not be a forum for those that wish to delete pages because they simply do not like someone or disagree with what they have said.MarkAshtonLundMarkAshtonLund 02:21, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
