<li><b>Comment</b>: AfD is related to the <i>article</i> for deletion. That is a redirect link established because another of the user's articles is for his personal website which has an alias domain called Goo(many o's)gle.com. <i>If</i> his personal website article were to remain, the redirect would actually be important and correct.

<li><b>Comment</b>: See above vandalism/hoax/vanity in whatever order. You don't do good defending this.

<li>You are not <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assuming good faith</a>. Writing a legible article about a school that attempts to present facts in a neutral manner is not graffiti.

<li>Personally, i assume most graffitti artists perform in actually very good faith. However, the police has a different viewpoint. Webhosting is not really expensive, see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> - W not a generic webhosting, personal website stuff must go. Otherwise anyone can plug in their personal sites. I don't even call the offensive sitenames. It is not required for Afd nomination, but backs up argumentation. <a href="../../../y/y/-/User%7EYy-bo_c77b.html" title="User:Yy-bo">User:Yy-bo</a> 02:40, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thank you. You are approaching this the right way. However, in order to show that the school satisfies, say, the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> criteria, you'll need to cite some sources that aren't the school itself, i.e. not its web site and not its publicity blurb. Has anyone published a book about this school? Has an independent inspection agency published a report about it? Stuff published by sources independent of the school is what we need here. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:56, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for the help. I added 3 reviews of the school and another unofficial external link. Does that help at all? Also, when and by what means will this debate be resolved?<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteevven1_c049.html" title="User:Steevven1">Steevven1</a> 02:08, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>A bit. An independently published history of the school would be much better, though.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Author's other contributions are not relevant. AfD is not a punitive action to be taken based on other article creations.
