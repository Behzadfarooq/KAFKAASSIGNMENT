<p>Though this is a three-year-old (!) article, the more I look at it, the more I smell a hoax. I can't find a reference to the kingdom of Biffeche anywhere on Google but our mirror sites, nor is it in JSTOR or Academic Search Premier. Its website strikes me as highly suspicious--why only an English language version for a Wolof/Arabic/Frenchspeaking kingdom? why the references to selling titles? Why does it provide American and European contact info but none within Senegal or Mauritania itself? I suspect that this article is either an elaborate hoax by an American who visited Senegal (the pictures look suspiciously like those a Peace Corps Volunteer or some such would have) or by someone interested in profiting from a micronation. Of course, I'd be very happy to be proved wrong, and maybe 24 hours from now I'm going to feel really stupid for posting this--but until we can verify some of this independent of the website, I'm recommending <s><b>delete</b></s> <b>delete the anthem and keep the island</b>. <a href="../../../d/v/y/User%7EDvyost_72a4.html" title="User:Dvyost">Dvyost</a> 08:21, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> per nomination. I've added the anthem article to this AFD too. Can't find any evidence that this place actually exists, let alone that it's a kingdom. Few Google non-Wikipedia links <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Biffeche+-Wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=lB4&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=Biffeche+-Wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=lB4&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and they don't seem to show much either. Of course there's information that's not on Google, but I would think that a functioning kingdom would get at least a few hits from repuatlbe sources. I'm also thinking that a kingdom would have at least a somewhat more professional looking website... <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 08:42, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The link you posted mentions in passing (in French) an "island of Bifche." But the article isn't about an island at all (doesn't even mention the word). Also, effective hoaxes do tend to sound plausible - generally because the hoaxter has some background knowlege of the over-arching subject. And there's a good chance he's laughing his ass off that he was able to have his hoax remain on Wikipedia for three years with all the resulting mirrors and everything. But at any rate, <i>plausible</i> is not the same thing as <i>verifiable</i>, and if a kingdom does in fact exist, then its existance shouldn't be too hard to verify. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 09:27, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

At first I thought this was just a hoax for the purpose of humor, but now it seems like it's a more sinister fraud - designed to profit from the poverty in West Africa. This con artist motive would also explain why the hoaxsters went to the trouble and expense of having an official looking sign made <a href="http://www.kingdomofbiffeche.net/visiting.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kingdomofbiffeche.net/visiting.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> (and probably paying some locals to pose by it). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 19:40, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm changing my vote to <b>Abstain</b> for the main article (still <b>Strong Delete</b> for the anthem). I really have mixed feelings here. On the one hand, I appreciate all the work that Dlyons493 and others have put in to research and re-write the article. I also think the en.Wikipedia's coverage of African geography and culture really needs to be expanded. But I'm still not quite comfortable giving this article an official "Keep" vote for a number of reasons. 1. My comment above seems to have been largely ignored. I think it's quite likely that the hoaxsters are perpetrating this whole Biffeche scheme as a charity-scam to profit off the poverty in West Africa. Assuming this article is kept, it should note that the Biffeche website is a hoax/scam (but without actually hyper-linking to that site). 2. I clicked on several of the maps that the article now links to, but I couldn't see any of them actually including the word Biffeche. A couple of the old ones were really low resolution, so maybe I just couldn't see... 3. Even assuming that Biffeche has been verified, I'm not sure that its notablity has been established. If this is the historic name of an island, then couldn't that just be mentioned in an article with the island's current name? Or maybe the river's course changed over time and the island no longer exists - so then couldn't it just be mentioned in an article about one of the towns in the vicinity?... At any rate - I'm just not sure that this deserves its own article - so with this and the concerns above, I'm abstaining with regard to the main article.

<dd>For 1, nearly all of the bad info on the web is limited to the hoax web site and WP derivatives. I'm open to possibly mentioning the self-proclaimed king hoax in the article, but I don't think it's necessary since the WP mirrors should die-out now that we've gotten our act together. Without WP the hoax notable? I really don't know. For 2, check out JJay's antique maps from the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblioth%C3%A8que_nationale_de_France_0ab3.html" title="Bibliothèque nationale de France">BNF</a>. For 3, I agree that given the poor coverage of West Africa, this article sticks-out like a sore thumb, and also that much of the information would ideally go into an article about a population-center, but the island is pretty big, and (I think) notable enough for an article. <i><b>×</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 06:26, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah - I guess that's true that we probably shouldn't include about the hoax. I was just wanting to make sure that if anyone Googled to see if the website was legit then they would know for sure that it wasn't.

<dd>Re the valid notability question raised - the area in question is where Arab North Africa starts to merge into <i>black</i> Sub-Saharan Africa. It was also an early locus of competition with the Dutch, English and French trying to expand. It was one of the early slave areas a bit north of the famous island of Gorée and the Gambia (of Alex Haley and <i>Roots</i> fame). So there's a <b>lot</b> of interesting history. There's also a stong Wiki tradition that places/settlements are intrinsically notable. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 10:38, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah - I wasn't disputing that tradition - I just wasn't sure if this was the current name of a place, or just a historic name - in which case it could maybe redirect to and be mentioned in an article with the current name for its title... <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 10:13, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Quite a bit of effort was made to fix this article, but I'm not following what it's saying. Some of the maps don't have any names on them and others don't have the names of what is supposed to be on them. I looked at the online sources, but I can't read French and only one of them is in English. From the English source, I am unable to verify the article's claims.

<li>Those are all good points. I just want to say that the three map links from the BNF that I added all show and name the island/and or region with good resolution. If you can find the Senegal river on the maps, scroll upstream a bit and you should see the island. I don't know if the area was important, so far I have just tried to locate it on old French maps. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 04:43, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Those are very helpful. Bifiche is one of five big islands in the river's delta. The first map is the easiest to find the island on, but the second map (on which East is up and Bifiche is written in light &amp; thin script) shows the most detail, including a number of locations on the island. I'm not as happy with the modern maps – as Blackcats suggested, the island's size and shape may have changed a bit. <i><b>×</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 05:33, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's an interesting topic to look into. Based on some of the maps, the name seems to refer to the region as well. I added the reference in the first paragraph that describes the island, but we need better primary sources. The area has to have some interest because the French maintained a fort at St. Louis for centuries. The BNF has many first-hand accounts but they are not searchable. In any case, I hope to expand a bit on <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493">Dlyons493</a> excellent work. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 05:49, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Re the difference between maps - that's to be expected as all the area is very flat and low-lying. The river is slow-moving and silty and much of the delta is mangrove swamp. So the peripheries of the islands would naturally change quite a lot over time. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 10:49, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
