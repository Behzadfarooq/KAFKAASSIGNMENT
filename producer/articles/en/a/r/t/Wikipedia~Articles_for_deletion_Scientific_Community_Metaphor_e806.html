<li><b>Keep</b> Bringing it up for deletion before a paper trail of arguments for and against content has been made seems overly agressive. Does not appear to be original because at least four articles have been published on it, and many more, and very notable people, reference it, making it seminal. It can't be just vanity because the prime author of the the concept is Kornfeld, not Hewitt. You can't delete articles just because the primary contributer is pissing people off. I think Hewitt can be persuaded to be more cooperative. Take your differences out on the Talk page first where it's more appropriate.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't think a <i>delete</i> outcome is appropriate for this article: the topic is notable as Carl Hewitt has amply documented, and as I am aware of from colleagues who are working in AI. There are problems with leaving the article as it stands, as CH is using the article to push his ideas in an inappropriate manner. I'll make an alternative suggestion that instead the article is merged into a broader article, where the SCM ideas are seen side-by-side with rival theories and a more balanced picture of the history emerges. The currently stub-like <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_agent.html" title="Intelligent agent">Intelligent agent</a> article might be a better home. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 15:13, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: The topic has notability, agreed. Nevertheless, the position and importance of this idea in the network of sociological and philosophical concepts is still unclear. Carl Hewitt who appears to be one of the proponents this idea and the article, has extensively linked this article to other articles, (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Scientific_Community_Metaphor" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Scientific_Community_Metaphor" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) thus possibly establishing for it a position in the network that it might not have had otherwise. This is damaging to WP. More seriously, I also regret that I need to mention the following: This action makes Hewitt suscepible to the charge that he is not acting in good faith, trying to use WP to distort the importance of his work. This is aggravated by similar behaviour in other places: see for instance <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denotational_semantics.html" title="Denotational semantics">Denotational semantics</a>, which in my view should be rewritten from scratch, with only relatively minor mention of the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model.html" title="Actor model">actor model</a>. I would urge Hewitt to stop this activity which is widely seen as pushing his own agenda. He can usefully contribute with his knowledge and experience to WP, but does not need to mention the actor model and other work of his at every turn.--<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 19:15, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: This article is really an advertisment of Carl Hewitt's work, with its proper title being "Carl Hewitt's personal scietific community metaphor". It starts out OK, but quickly degenerates into a combination of discussion of this Ether thing and references to Carl Hewitt's other work. When he makes references to physics, I find this article to be erroneous. The comments of <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> and <a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> above also demonstate the inappropriateness of this article. Even if the subject of this article is notable, it should be documented by someone who can do so in an impartial manner and focussed on the concept itself. Until then, Wikipedia is better off without an article on this "scientific community metaphor" than with keeping the current article. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 19:39, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I should emphasise that I do find encyclopedic value to this article, and an article on this topic could hardly fail to put CH in a prominent place.

<dd>I hope that most abstracts of scientific papers have some sort of encyplopedic value. The question that is interesting is when it stops being original research and start being and mainstream scientific knowledge. A second point, the article start with <i>The Scientific Community Metaphor is an approach to understanding scientific communities by extending pattern directed invocation programming languages that invoke high level procedural plans on the basis of messages...</i>. Shouldn't that be the other way around? E.g. patern directed invocation programming languages modelled according to scientific communities? Carl? --<a href="../../../r/2E/k/User%7ER.Koot_9d15.html" title="User:R.Koot">R.Koot</a> 20:38, 17 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Historically, it was the other way around. The pattern-directed invocation programming languages came first and the Scientific Community Metaphor was developed afterwards. However, you are correct that at this point the pattern-directed invocation languages should be developed according to the Scientific Community Metaphor which is in fact the way that research is currently proceeding. However, the results have not yet been published.--Carl Hewitt 07:07, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I don't fully agree that the only problem is the role this article plays in WP. The fact of the matter is that for or better or worse, concepts and links of concepts created within WP have a tendency to diffuse outward; this tendency is in fact one of the <i>best arguments against wikipedia</i> . For example, the relations between Latour and SCM or Popper and SCM I believe are tenuous. I don't dispute that associations have <s>not</s> been made, but does this really justify the following statement in the 4th or 5th graf of the <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruno_Latour_3467.html" title="Bruno Latour">Bruno Latour</a> article?:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In computer science there are interesting parallels with Latour's work on science in action and the Scientific Community Metaphor. Subsequent work by Latour and others in the sociology and philsophy of science have deepened this connection.</dd>

<li>I have conceded the point that the topic after which this article in entitled is probably encyclopedic. However, the article itself seems meander all over the place, bringing in the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turing_test.html" title="Turing test">Turing test</a> at one point and <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a> and the software paradigm of class inheritance at another. <i>If this article is wholely rewritten by someone else</i> I will happily change my vote. However, the only reason that I am not recusing myself is beacuse I know enough about software, relativity, and proper article flow to identify this article as the poor excuse of an article that it is. I cannot in good conscience allow it to stand as-is. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 04:01, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This suggests the possibility of shortening (drastically) the article and removing most of the links into it as an acceptable compromise (although there is nothing to compromise, not with me at least, because I'm not voting to keep). --<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 05:36, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Recuse</b> per DV8 2XL above. I have already had too many unpleasant interactions with Carl Hewitt and am not interested in engaging in yet more. I agree with almost every statement made above that wasn't made by Carl: the topic is probably sufficiently notable for some mention, somewhere; this article almost certainly needs editing and revision; it will be impossible to revise due to endless edits wars and lack of civility from Carl. There is a broader problem here: Carl is repeatedly engaging in behaviour that violates the spirit if not the letter of Wikipedia policy, and he seems immune to criticism and unable to reform. I am at a loss for what to do in such a situation. Its easy enough to vote <b>delete</b> but that hardly seems fair, and I certainly don't have the energy to do more than to ask Carl to, once again, take the criticism of others to heart and try to react to that criticism in a positive, constructive fashion. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 02:45, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as vanity and bordering with OR. I sympathise with Linas, as I have not had the will to indulge in discussion with Carl, which is generally a bad thing, but probably good for my nerves. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarol_Langner_26da.html" title="User:Karol Langner">Karol</a> 10:00, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. I'll admit, Hewitt is a bit abrasive and overly expansive in his additions, but this is a development of his actor model, which was important for Scheme's development. Let's not make this a referendum on Hewitt himself. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">Maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">Contribs</a> 20:54, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I personally think that the content is as important as the topic in a case like this. So if you want to moot this action, then please do the rewrite. [I can't. Although I am a sotware engineer by trade, I have not dealt with this side of computer science. Instead I do much better in areas involving physics (in which I majored), especially relativity (in which I do independent research). So I know enough to see this article as written as invalid, but not enough to fix it.] To me, this is about the article, and it's being <i>as written</i> a significant part of Carl Hewitt's egregious self-promotion campaign. After all, the article talks more about Ether and physics than about the "Metaphor". --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 15:53, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your comments. What parts of this article strike you as "invalid"? If you could be more explicit, it would help to improve the article. The article is constrained to talk about Ether because it is reporting on published work. Also it would be helpful if you could say a little more about what you would like to know about the "Metaphor". Regards,--Carl Hewitt 18:06, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I think that is sufficient evidence that it is notable enough for a Wikipedia article. I don't know anything about the guy himself or his tactics but this basic question seems beyond dispute. Whether the author himself wrote it means it should be parsed over for NPOV, but it doesn't violate NOR at all (it is published in a mainstream, peer-reviewed source). The place to discuss the behavior of the editor/author in question is RfC, not AfD. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 22:34, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
