<li><b>Undecided</b>. Apparently this is part of an excessively detailed episode guide to something called <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Piece_aa17.html" title="One Piece">One Piece</a>. It was previously speedied twice under the name 1. I'm Luffy! The Man Who Will Become Pirate King as patent nonsense. Later User:OnePieceMaster5000 who contributes the articles started creating articles without episode numbers in the title, and moved existing articles to these names. Other articles in the series have been speedied too because they provide so little context that the appear to be nonsense. All (or most) are linked from <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Piece_Episode_Guide_bcc6.html" title="One Piece Episode Guide">One Piece Episode Guide</a>. Since we have other TV episode guides on Wikipedia, I don't think these are candidates for outright deletion (except if copyvio) but they do need a strict loving hand for pruning and wikifying. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenning_Makholm_0024.html" title="User:Henning Makholm">Henning Makholm</a> 12:48, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> <b>Merge</b> I only managed to click that it was an episode synopsis when I deleted the first one. There must be a List of One Piece Episodes somewhere.

<dd>It could be like serebii.net, which is a Pokémon site with tons of synopsis but you can't copy any of it straight from the page. You can however open it up with the Microsoft Word 03 and edit it there. So it could be done that way.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I am not of the opinion that this series is notable enough that individual articles are needed synopsizing every episode; however as I'm aware and as Henning Malkolm's comment suggests the consensus on this is not yet clear. I would suggest no prejudice against recreation if the creator, or any recreator, does it right and in a manner clearly indicating they're episodes of a TV show. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 13:17, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It isn't notable enough to have an episode per article. It's below the notability of the Pokémon anime which doesn't. The English articles (which are listed near the bottom of article) are more noted. But I'm still voting on merge. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighwayCello_1384.html" title="User:HighwayCello">H</a><a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighwayCello_Esperanza_6275.html" title="User:HighwayCello/Esperanza"><font color="#009933">ig</font></a><a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighwayCello_1384.html" title="User:HighwayCello">hway</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighwayCello_d327.html" title="User talk:HighwayCello">Rainbow Sneakers</a></sup> 13:20, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> but probably needs a bit of cleanup (at least something at the top explaining what these are episodes of). We have episode guides for Star Trek, Buffy, Firefly, etc etc etc. and I don't see why we can't have them for One Piece too. Marging isn't the best solution as these are pretty long and the resulting article would be unwieldly. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 14:31, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Starblind, but the articles will need major cleanup and (probably) more uniform titling. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 14:38, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> as these crufty articles, or, barring that, redirect to one main one. Totally absurd that these all would exist, as they do not come close to meeting notability requirements. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 22:00, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> I am of the opinion that view if any TV shows should have long individual episode summaries. This show is not notable enough to deserve this kind of in depth summary. I would create a main article for each season or volume or however anime is divided, and have a season's worth of shorter summaries on a page. I know this is a minority view, but there it is FWIW.<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 01:00, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> for one simple reason - these summaries are based on the subtitled versions of the original Japanese, and so do not belong here. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 02:56, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can see other reasons to delete these pages, but why on earth should "based on subtitled Japanese" in and of itself warrant deletion? Confused <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenning_Makholm_0024.html" title="User:Henning Makholm">Henning Makholm</a> 11:54, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The pages would be based on <i>illegal</i> fansubs, first off.

<li>The MoS mainly talks about names and not content differences. I can find nothing that says "don't discuss foreign things".
