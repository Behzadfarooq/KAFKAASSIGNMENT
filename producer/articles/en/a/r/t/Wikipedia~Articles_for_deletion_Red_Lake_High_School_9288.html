<p>Another non-notable high school. Don't be fooled. Just because some kid killed some people dosen't make the school notable. Otherwise any kid could come and commit a crime to get their school in the encyclopedia. School deletionist 11:29, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

The last paragraph "<i>the order Columbiformes includes the 308 species of doves</i>" is also a joke. A high school is a high school. Unless it actually becomes something such as an elite high school, it's no more than a human butcher shop. Is there an article dealing with the garage at 2122 N. Clark Street, Chicago? Certainly not.

The car does not have an article. The bullet that killed him is stored as a museum exhibit in Czech Republic. It also does not have an article. Neither do the car, bullets, blood-stained shirt and other things involved in the JFK assassination have an article of their own. That high school is just a faceless high school. It does not have a story of its own. Even if it has some, we are not interested in them (other than the massacre). That school is not a place for you to visit. If we need its information (who?), we visit its website (place it as an external link in the massacre article) for the latest information. Otherwise, just another useless high school article does not enrich this encyclopedia in any way. <a href="../../../b/e/s/Beslan_school_hostage_crisis.html" title="Beslan school hostage crisis">Beslan school hostage crisis</a> occured about six months ago, do you care about that Beslan Middle School Number One?

<li>Wiki is not paper not is it garbage can. Other than a murder, these schools are not noteworthy. There are articles for colleges because you may want to select a college that's best for you regardless of distance. A New Yorker who lives next to the NYU may want to go to Stanford to complete his/her education. I don't see too many people who live in Long Island and go to a high school in, maybe, Brooklyn.
