<li><b>KEEP</b>This article should be kept as the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_magicians.html" title="List of magicians">List of magicians</a> has now been put into alphabetical order and thus The Magic Dudes appears in alphabetical order (under M for Magic Dudes... originally slotted as D for Dudes, which was why it followed <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Copperfield_dc94.html" title="David Copperfield">David Copperfield</a>). As noted in the article, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_31.html" title="Channel 31">Channel 31</a> was just where the first pilot showed, and so what if it was community TV? The TV station still had to request the pilot and decide to air it.MagicFan 9 July 2005 05:30 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> Promotion for non-notable magicians. The whole point of public access is that anyone can get a show. BTW, "Magic Dudes" would go under "M", because "Dudes" isn't a last name. <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla"></a> — <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> | <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwalla_1816.html" title="User talk:Gwalla">Talk</a> 9 July 2005 06:31 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Please note <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_31.html" title="Channel 31">Channel 31</a> just aired the pilot. OTHER television stations requested the series. I also beg to differ on the comments made regarding Channel 31 and community television in general. I believe the comments made probably come from people who aren't invloved in the television industry (neither am I BTW), have never had a show on TV and have probably not seen the series mentioned or the television station in question (BTW I have at least seen both). In general, a lot of programming on community TV comes from shows previously aired on commercial networks (e.g. look at Channel 31 in Melbourne). There are numerous articles throughout Wikipedia mentioning community stations all over the world. I also do not believe that it can be that easy to get a show on TV (I can't say I know anyone who has a show on TV). I personally think a 12 part series that has been shown across a country as big as Australia is very noteworthy. BTW, Magic Dudes are now listed under M.MagicFan 9 July 2005 08:51 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I reviewed all the info I could find on the subject, unfortunately, it's mostly self-promotion, that I found on the web, links on shopping sites pointing to their "unused" website. If at some time in the future, these guys become syndicated, then it may warrant an article. There is not enough information or content to support an article for a public broadcast channel show. As for the socketpuppets, I kind of feel bad, new user, getting their first article Vfd'd, and asking friends to help. Hard way to learn, but hopefully with more time on Wiki, will learn the rules and develop some good research and editing skills.

<li>If they truly had such a wide fan base, someone (a contributing wikipedia member that has shown good edits) would have heard of this group. Not to mention it needs press coverage. Plus, these sockpuppets ARE NOT helping your cause. I am not saying new wikipedians should not comment, but the fact that they got DIRECTLY to this VFD page suggest there is something fishy. I am not accusing the biting the newcomers as there have been no personal attacks or harsh critcism. <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch">Sasquatch<span class="Unicode">′</span></a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch">Talk</a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch">Contributions</a> July 9, 2005 10:54 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>COMMENT: Incl notes on precedent supporting article</b> As The Magic Dudes was my first entry to Wikipedia, I am really miffed at what is going on here. I had had other "edits" on Wikipedia and added other magicians and acts etc. to the Magic entries. As you can no doubt guess, I am a huge fan of magic. I am really angry to see my hard work of adding links etc. has been deleted by people who have nothing to do with my entries and maybe aren't even magic fans at all (so how would they know anything about the topic). My thought in putting the post up in the first place was that these guys have been on TV, had their own series etc etc. It wasn't just a guest appearance on someone elses show... they had their OWN show. I thought that was pretty noteworthy as I haven't seen any other magicians on TV in Australia apart from the old favourites such as Copperfield and the arch enemy of magicians, The Masked Magician. When I put the entry up, I obviously told other magic fans about my entry so they could see what I had done. Before all I have ever been able to do is add information on magicians already named. This was my first new entry. To see it be called into question is turning me off the whole Wikipedia experience. I cannot be held responsible for some fans of the Magic Dudes going over board in their support of this entry and doing things they shouldn't be doing. I am thrilled however that word is spreading that people are trying to destroy my post and people are taking the time to not only come and look at my post but also to register to try and stop its destruction. To abuse them by calling them sockpuppets is just not warranted and I agree with Mr Douglas that new comers should be given the benefit of the doubt. They obviously new enough about the Magic Dudes to spend the time to register and vote and I think that speaks volumes as I found the whole process of learning Wikipedia less than easy. I have done my best to change the post to answer its criticisms, but just because you people from overseas haven't heard of some Australian magicians makes their achievements no less notable than of they had been Canadians... outside of the magic community, I doubt very much people in Australia have heard of <b><a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Sankey_bbc6.html" title="Jay Sankey">Jay Sankey</a></b>, but it makes him none the less a very notable magician. I am sure many more Canadians have heard of him, just as I suspect many laymen in Australia are familiar with the Magic Dudes, having seen them on TV. The Magic Dudes meet the requirements to be considered <b>notable</b> by <b>precedent</b>. Wikipedia states that an author is considered notable if they have had a book published. The Magic Dudes have had a TV show broadcast. Some people in their delete comments have stated that Channel 31 is not noteworthy, but for a television or radio station to be notable, Wikipedia says that it should have broadcast "at least regionally". Considering Channel 31 is established in most Australian states, I would think that is pretty notable. I therefore think there is <b>precedent</b> for my post. As an <b>indication on the quality of talent</b> shown on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_31.html" title="Channel 31">Channel 31</a>, see the Wikipedia post on <b><a href="../../../r/o/v/Rove_McManus_ffb9.html" title="Rove McManus">Rove McManus</a></b>. If you look at his offical biography at <a href="http://www.rovelive.com/rove/current/bio.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.rovelive.com/rove/current/bio.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.rovelive.com/rove/current/bio.asp</a>, you will see that he had a show on Channel 31 and sees it as important enough to include in his bio. And Rove is no light weight. In no less than 2002, 2003 and 2004 he won the <b>Gold Logie award</b> for the most popular personality on Australian television! Hardly a goldfish swimming in a bowl!!MagicFan 9 July 2005 12:43 (UTC)

<li>I can see why you might be miffed. <b>However</b> to carry out your miffed-ness by shameless repeat voting on your own article (or encouraging friends to) is an <i><b>extremely</b></i> good way to make the community want to delete it. Go back, retract the false votes (by striking them out with &lt;s&gt; and &lt;/s&gt; and prove their notability in what remains of the 5 day VfD procedure. Otherwise be sure it will go down in flames. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 9 July 2005 14:04 (UTC)</li>
<li>Note that rove has had national recognition and extends FAR beyond Channel 31 whilst the Magic Dudes seem limited to a very very local prespective. Also, anon IP's are allowed to vote on VFD and their votes are counted. But think about it, what are the chances that ALL these new users would come to this VfD first? Its really hard not to suspect sockpuppetry.... Plus, i'm not saying their votes don't count, in the end, it will be weighted by an admin who will close this vote. Again, please read <a href="../../../i/m/p/WP%7EImportance_ffbd.html" title="WP:Importance">WP:Importance</a> and brush up on policy a little. Also, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_31.html" title="Channel 31">Channel 31</a> is not as notable as the major networks as it IS public access. Heck, there are lots of shows on my local public access station, most of which DO NOT deserve an article in an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> eg. <a href="http://www.thegeekshow.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.thegeekshow.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thegeekshow.com/</a> its only syndicated in Alberta on Access. and Channel 31 broadcasts different things in different locations unlike nationally syndicated networks. That's a big difference, ultimately, public access focuses on local audiences and locally produced shows for most of their shows. Of this time, The Magic Dudes do not meet the WP criterion for notability. Until further press coverage/show expansion is achieved, they do not deserve a encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch">Sasquatch<span class="Unicode">′</span></a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch">Talk</a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch">Contributions</a> 19:52, July 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>On channel 31 right now is "On The Couch" and they are doing a special on the Espy Hotel. Never heard of it? That's because it's about two kilometers away from my house and it is a (really bloody fantastic) pub where mostly unsigned (but really bloody fantastic) bands play. After that is "Vasili's Garden", another good show, I like that Vasili, He sold me some good tomatoes this year, his nursery is like four blocks from my house. Who is he interviewing tonight? Jumping Jesus on a pogo stick, that's Cosimo, he <b>literally</b> lives right across the street from me! Small world, man. (This, by the way is all completely true, I was watching it before I decided to come in here and write this.)</li>
<li>I watched Rove on 31 back when dinosaurs roamed the earth. I thought his show was great on then and it's shite now that Dave is gone. But if someone had put a Rove article up then, I'd have nominated it for VfD. Rove, you may have noticed, went on from channel 31 to <i>do something else</i>. And no one found his "31" roots important enough to add to his page until your edit of 12:57, 9 July 2005.</li>
<li>So when <s>you guys</s> sorry, those guys, go on to win a Gold Logie (as voted on by the reader of <a href="http://www.isubscribe.com.au/title_info.cfm?prodID=5508" class="external text" title="http://www.isubscribe.com.au/title_info.cfm?prodID=5508" rel="nofollow">TV Week</a> magazine) I'll vote <i>keep</i>.</li>

<li>I went and followed the Rove link. Why would you want to delete Australia's most popular TV talent of three years running (I thought he had won in 2005 too, but maybe we haven't had that award yet)? Anyway, I followed all the links including the one to Rove's biography. Turns out that Rove actually mentions Channel 31 himself. I think this has more to do with you hating magicians than anything else. I read an article by Jay Sankey once (yes, I've heard of him even though he is Canadian) and he mentioned the "magician haters". IMHO, if you aren't into magic as an art form, then why are you commenting on the noteworthiness or otherwise of a particular magician (or in this case two?). Have you heard of Jay Sankey, or Brad Christian, Oz Perlman, Darwin Ortiz???? I can well understand why fans of magic are getting upset on here. Michael Douglas 01:26, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Aaron was saying that IF there was an article on Rove back when he was ONLY on Channel 31, he would have VFDed that page, but Rove has had much more noteriety than that. And we are not "hating magicians" as you put it. We are simply following the set Wikipedia policy. It doesn't matter if they're magicians, or artist, or scientist or CEOs, we still apply the same standards. Jay Sankey shows notability as his trick was performed by Copperfield, an OBVIOUS credit to his talents and meaning he has achieved a degree of notability to be noticed in the magic world and general public. The Magic Dudes have put their own show on public TV (heck, gimme a couple hundred bucks and i can do the same thing) and produced their OWN DVD thats not mass distributed. Doesn't quite make the cut. And it doesn't matter if we've heard of them or not, we're judging on the basis of the article. That's a fair judgement for an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch">Sasquatch<span class="Unicode">′</span></a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch">Talk</a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch">Contributions</a> 22:54, July 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment: Sasquatch, thank you for you feedback regarding "Anyone can contribute to the discussion and vote, anonymous users as well as pseudonymous users". and advice that "If you are contributing your first article, or are a newly pseudonymous user, please state this clearly and up-front" which none of these users have done and that "Unsigned contributions may be discounted." I didn't know this (being new to Wikipedia) and I'm sure other people voting didn't either. Good to see some constructive comments for a change rather than the newby bashing that has gone on before. I must comment on Fur Experts comments. Access TV in North Amercia must be different to community TV in Australia. My understanding is that the shows are programmed by a programme director. You can't just "plug in" and transmit stuff. The fact that The Magic Dudes had a pilot on C31 before OTHER stations asked for the series seems to indicate to me that it is more complex than what you make out. Also, can you confirm your source that the DVD was self produced? Do you have a copy? There seems to be so much emphasis on the fact that these people made a START on C31. I don't see other people who STARTED on C31 being deleted. Furthermore, can someone please explain to me why THESE magicians are different to all the other magicians on Wikipedia? Is this a North American thing? If having their own TV series in multiple states of a country of 20 million isn't noteable, what is? Do they have to be North American? I have edited articles on other North American magicians before (both before and after registering) and none of these magicians has come up for deletion.MagicFan 02:58, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</b>

<li>Let me show you something from this very article itself: "While the series continues to be shown on television, the Magic Dudes have not been seen performing together since producing their television series and DVD. It is hard to find out much more information on the Magic Dudes as they protect their actual identities closely. Their real names have never appeared on any advertising material for their shows or as credits on their TV series and at present their existing web site is under renovation after the announcement they are working on a stage show." To me, that sounds like this article is mostly used for promotion, which was why it was even put on here in the first place. I tried to look up information about these guys, I found nothing (see <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=The+Magic+Dudes" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=The+Magic+Dudes" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>). <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 03:03, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yea, I have to take Zscout's side on this one. Even though they have been on TV, it just doesn't seem enough. For a couple of reasons a) Channel 31 is public access (even if threre is a program manager, it is signifangantly easier to get your own locally produced programs on air) b) they have done nothing else BEYOND just going on TV to indicate a level of notability and c) <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> due to the lack of outside media coverage and public knowledge of the issue. This all seems to point that these guys do not deserve an article <b>as of yet</b>. I sincerely hope you guys luck in promoting yourselves and making a name for yourselves, but right now, you have to remember Wikipedia is not an advertising agency, its an encyclopedia, and The Magic Dudes just isn't encyclopedic yet.

<li><b>Message for Sasquatch</b> Sasquatch, not sure how to send you a message, but sure you'll be revisting this one again... you seem to understand the whole Wikipedia thing. I noticed that a VERY notable Canadian magician does not have an article in Wikipedia, but there is already an article on someone with the same name. How do you add an article on a different person with same name as someone who already has an article? Also, I getting really sick of the bullshit name slinging going on here (sockpuppetry, vanity, puffery etc etc). As you have actually made some constructive comments, as opposed to some other butt wipes who have posted here, could you make any suggestions as to what I need to do to improve this particular article for it to stay? I am a HUGE Magic Fan and I think any magician that has been on TV or is known more than regionally is worthy of an article (for example, lay people in Australia wouldn't have heard of Jay Sankey, but most magic fans I know know who he is... maybe he is more well known in Canada, but in the magic community, he is certainly WELL known and I notice the article on him has no such hassles as mine on the Magic Dudes). There are really notable magicians in Australia I would like to add, but I don't want to waste my team if I get abuse like I have on here.MagicFan 03:12, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Calling people "butt wipes" isn't constructive either. Accusations of sockpuppetry and vanity are meaningful in this forum. Grade-school insults are not. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 03:17, July 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>First, let me clarify sock puppet accusations, they arise from the INFLUX (you can go look at other VFDs and compare) of new user accounts suddenly being drawn to this page and voting keep. This tends to indicate <b>EITHER</b> a) someone is setting up multiple user accounts and voting repeatedly or b) that someone has told all their friends and family to come here and vote keep. Either way, a) means sockpuppet votes and shouldn't be counted and b) suggests that they have no notability outside people who know them personally. This would make those votes relatively meaningless compared to the others who have judged the article. Hope that makes sense? Anyways, I'll leave you a message on your talk page on how to create pages like that. And a vanity page just implies that The Magic Dudes was either written by the Magic Dudes themselves or someone really close to the Magic Dudes.

It used to have more than one page, but looks like it is down for reno at this time as the links from the page have gone. Also in Google, I got four other sites referencing this site.MagicFan 03:12, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Now it makes more sense. Since their official site is down, the Magic Dudes are trying to use Wikipedia for free promotion and webspace, neither of which are allowed. --<a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadchester_c727.html" title="User:Madchester">Madchester</a> 05:15, July 11, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>From the four references, if we are even talking about the same thing, could be mirrors of Wikipedia. Many have popped up, so looking for stuff is hard. Plus, most of the mentions the Magic Dudes have to here refer to this vote. Plus, since most of the stuff you mainly copied from is from their website, that is where the vantity/promotion aurguement kicks in. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 03:16, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>For Zscout again... no, I didn't get those Wikipedia links you mentioned? Does Google give different things in different countries? The references I got were from other web sites to the Magic Dudes web site. I can almost see what you are saying re the vanity if I cut and pasted from the Dudes web site. Do you have an constructive suggestions as to what I could change in my article to remove that aspect? I only added them because I was online doing Google searches for them and came across Wikipedia links to magicians, but couldn't find them there. I've seen them on TV, so I thought they deserved an article. There are a few other Australian magicians I have noticed that are also not in Wikipedia, as well as some North American ones, all of whom have had TV series. I am quite happy to take constructive criticisms of my article, just getting a little tired of the allegations made against people who have actually heard of the Magic Dudes. I obviosuly think the article should stay, so I am happy to make changes that people suggest (already took out some rumours and also fixed the caps etc etc as mentioned by other people). You will also note I have asked Sasquatch for his input.MagicFan 03:33, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>ARTICLE REWRITTEN</b>: Hope nobody minds, but I read all the comments, read the cries for help and looked at all the links. All rumour, promotional type material and awkward history has now been completely rewritten. The article now only talks about what the Magic Dudes HAVE achieved, deletes reference to any potential vanity material (i.e. their DVD which they may or may not have produced themselves) and diminishes the emphasis on their starting role on Channel 31 and instead emphasises that this was were they started, not where they are now. I hope that this appeases both camps (i.e. KEEP and DELETE). I don't know why anyone else didn't think of this before they tried to discourage all the newbies.</p>

I have seen these guys on television and they are really funny and really good. They have a cool animation at the start of their shows which is so funny. Kids love it and just want it played over and over. I have all their DVDs. Do they not appear on TV overseas? I don't know if this is the forum, but I am trying to put an entry in Wikipedia on the Doug Anthony All Stars. Does anyone know where I can find more information on them? Thanks.

<li>Hi Madchester, they were definitely on TV as I've seen their show too. I also did a Google search and I think the links you are talking about are old. There must have been a previous owner of the URL as the Magic Dudes aren't a shop, they are an act. If they were a shop, it would be a pretty crud shop as they don't sell anything.

<li><b>Comment</b> Proof that the delete voters don't know their notable from not notable magicians. The same guys delted Richard Sanders from Wikipedia. Richard Sanders has had TV shows in North America, appears with Jay Sankey, delvelops magic with Jay Sankey and gives lectures on magic. The same people trying to delete the Magic Dudes say Jay Sankey is notable, but delete Richard Sanders. By the same token, they leave Magic Joe in Wikipedia. It is becoming very apparant that certain individuals here just go around deleting other peoples articles without doing any research into what is notable and what isn't. If you don't know anything about magicians, then why are you making decisions regarding which ones are notable? <small>Previous unsigned comment by 203.54.40.161 (<a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.54.40.161.html" title="User talk:203.54.40.161">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.54.40.161_36b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.54.40.161">contribs</a>). --<a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch">Sasquatch<span class="Unicode">′</span></a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch">Talk</a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch">Contributions</a> 19:31, July 11, 2005 (UTC)</small>
