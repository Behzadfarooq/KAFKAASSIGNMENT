<li><b>Delete</b> no substantial citable sources. The blurb on <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Jones_9070.html" title="Alex Jones">Alex Jones</a> already consists of as much as is appropriate or citable about this film. There was substantial debate and work after the last AfD, which resulted in the page you've seen.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This article has already survived an afd, and the article has not changed substantially since that time. The film is notable, has had widespread distribution, returns many Google hits, and has an IMDB entry. Describing a publicly available film is not original research; the film is the primary source. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 19:00, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Untrue. Weregerbil added the enormous summary. He and Schizombie both made good faith efforts to find sources and found none. The last AfD resulted in no consensus with many editors wanting to see more sourcing. Well, at least four editors have tried and failed to find sources for this. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 19:11, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It looks to me like the overview was added by <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMary_Read_6eb5.html" title="User:Mary Read">Mary Read</a> while the previous AfD was still ongoing. It is perplexing to me how one could claim that there is inadequate sourcing for this documentary when it has 24,500 Google hits, of which 352 are unique; ratings on several review sits; and when it is available for public download. Are you really concerned about verifiability?? --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 19:26, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The overview deleted (and readded) by Gnetwerker was originally added by Weregerbil after watching the film and noting the 9-11 content of the article at AfD time was only a small piece of the movie. Mary Read proofread most of it during the AfD. Tell me, what is there to say in this article other than to synopsize the movie? 352 ghits is notable these days? --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 19:33, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> WP doesn't have a guideline for notability of movies, which makes things difficult to decide what to do about them. IMDb's criteria for inclusion was mentioned above; it's at <a href="http://us.imdb.com/updates?update=title" class="external free" title="http://us.imdb.com/updates?update=title" rel="nofollow">http://us.imdb.com/updates?update=title</a> if anyone is curious. There are a couple of movies I had a devil of a time submitting to IMDb, though I'd bought one in a video store and the other from online after hearing about it (if I recall correctly) on Leno. Factual observations about a primary source that others can consult and make the same observation are AFAIK permissible. E.g. you don't need to cite a secondary or tertiary source to note that a given person is in a movie, or to quote it. Such sources are needed when the article starts getting deeper; what the meaning or ramification of things are, whether it's good or not, etc. See the part of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html#Primary_and_secondary_sources" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary_and_secondary_sources</a> that states "In some cases, where an article (1) makes descriptive claims the accuracy of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable adult without specialist knowledge, and (2) makes no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, or evaluative claims, a Wikipedia article may be based entirely on primary sources (examples would include apple pie or current events), but these are exceptions." <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 22:53, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>General Theory of Relativity would not be on Wikipedia if it had not been peer reviewed and especially if it had been posted by Einstein himself. It would have been an Original Research vanity posted by Einstein until it could be reviewed by an outside source and validated. In fact, I think that's how science treated it when it was originally published. It's certainly how Einstein treated Quantum Mechanics. This is a blog that was committed to film and posted by the author.--<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 02:02, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>General Theory of Relativity would also not be on Wikipedia if the criterion set forth by the nominator is literally applied. The point is not that <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">General relativity</a> should not be here, and not even that the nominated article should necessarily stay, but that there is something wrong with the given reason for nomination <i>by itself</i>, independent of the merits of any past, present, or future articles.

<li><b>Keep</b>While I do not agree with what the movie has to say, I do not see anything wrong with this article.

Eh.

<li><b>Comment</b> Whether or not it is "fuel for the conpiracy theories" (and if that's the best you can do that must be a very weak flame) is irrelevant for separate notability.
