<dd>If they don't deserve an article, then yes, they would get deleted. But Danny Phantom is NOT a huge show, not nearly as big of a show as SpongeBob or even Fairly OddParents. If we were to compare Danny Phantom to Chris Noth's character on <i><a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_%26_Order_27ea.html" title="Law &amp; Order">Law &amp; Order</a></i>, he wouldn't even come close to being as deserving. My logic is that the only reason they're on WP is because a fan of the series wanted them to be on it, not because they thought that all of these characters were notable enough (many characters likely were put up for the first reason, but they survive because they pass the second). Danny Phantom has little exposure outside of the source material. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 21:17, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why not? It seems like your reasoning is based more on the fact that you don't like the show and don't personally think it noteworthy.

<dd><i>I</i> was suggesting a merge might be worthwhile, not you. <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> explicitly states major characters such as Danny Phantom can have their own article if the main article about the show would be too long, which it certainly would be. As for merging the rest to a list, I'm not going to arbitrarily determine the cutoff of which villains are "major" and which are "minor" by myself. Could they be written more encyclopedic? Certainly, but a need for cleanup is not a reason for deletion.

<dd>One, SpongeBob SquarePants gets more than 6 million Google results. SpongeBob is a huge show, which appeals to young and old alike. And while DP appeals to many including me, it's just not nearly as notable. And the Google results are skewed - the possibilities of Danny and Phantom appearing in the same page but not referring to Danny Phantom are significantly higher than someone saying Fairly and Oddparents, but not meaning to say Fairly Oddparents. SpongeBob warrants a page because of his massive popularity. Danny is not nearly as big or as notable, so why does he need to be separate from a list of the main article? Is there a pressing need for him to be separate? Hell, why do these other characters need to be? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 21:58, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Searching it the way I did "Danny Phantom" (notice the quotation marks) hits only for exact matches, not askewed ones.

<dd>One, you stated he was as notable as SpongeBob, when he clearly is not. Two, a Google search for Danny Phantom is evidence that the cartoon is notable, not that the character is. Danny Phantom does not transcend his source material. If Danny Phantom warrants an article, then why don't King of All Cosmos, various Advance Wars characters and Blue from Pokémon (significantly more notable than SpongeBob x1000)? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 22:06, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, I said he wasn't as popular. Popularity comes in all shapes and sizes. Popularity does NOT equal notability. Personally, I'm not in favor of President Bush as many people aren't, which makes him unpopular, but his notablilty doesn't lower because of it. Why doesn't all the characters from Pokemon have an article? Because most Pokemon only make one-time appearances. Only popular Pokemon like Pikachu should have articles, if there is sufficant information enough to withstand it's own article. If it's going to be a short little stub, merge it. Ash and other characters that are major characters should have thier own article (I haven't checked to see if they did or not though). Minor characters from Danny Phantom should be merged onto one page. Major characters that have lenghty articles that describe different ascpets of a character does merit it's own article. And your comment that a Google search on Danny Phantom equal that the cartoon is popular, but not the character is completely ludacris.

NO, I wouldn't defend an article about The Box Ghost's eye color, but I sure as hell wouldn't agree with some tired-excuse you present as notability. The only reason I don't agree with the deletion is because I think main characters of a TV show are notable enough for thier own article.

<dd>Stop being lazy and address Moe in replies to Moe then. Let's keep things orderly. I never commented on another user's speculations, only that your speculations are entirely irrelevant as 'most wikipedians' are not voting on this article, so saying 'most would vote delete' means nothing, as most who have voted went for 'keep' (Ok, yes, I editted, it didn't make sense before--Jace Draccus 20:53, 18 October 2006 (UTC)). If you're referring to the 'speculation' I think you are, then look at their reasoning as to WHY they think its good. And argue it with them... as for not being fanatical? Stop quoting rules that don't exist, and find some justification more solid than 'OMG IT'S NOT AS POPULAR AS SPONGEBOB SO IT ISN'T AS IMPORTANT'... and don't flag EVERY article relating to the show for deletion. That's a napalm approach. Better to review each article on its OWN merits. Also, learn to read. I said Moe _may_ be 'an extreme keepist', but I defended his REASON for being so. Which has more to do with the Wikipedia process than a personal bias towards the show, unlike your portrayal of your reasoning. --Jace Draccus 20:22, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

I like DP and Final Fantasy VI, yet I nominated character articles of both for deletion. And the rule does exist, according to you - who stated that I was fanatically against the Danny Phantom articles. So logically, you are fanatically for the Danny Phantom articles. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 21:46, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The way you are acting, it does seem like you have a bias towards the show. You don't have to be fanatically one way or the other to have a strong bias towards something.

<dd>To Moe: But shouldn't I actually have a strong bias to have a strong bias towards somkething? How am I acting? Oh, I know what you mean - I must hate Danny Phantom because I'm not making an article about every single orgamism in the Danny Phantom series. I seem to have forgotten that one's opinion on a subject has no bearing compared to what some person with absolutely no knowledge of one's actual opinion. And I applaud you for forming an opinion on my true intentions without having any evidence whatsoever that even indicates that your opinion has any value whatsoever.

<dd>And Draccus: Ever notice that you look at two people doing the same thing and decide that only one person - conveniently the one you disagree with - is wrong for doing it. Moe is claiming that I have a strong bias towards this article and is assuming bad faith (meaning that what I am doing is vandalism). But it's always okay when the person agrees with you. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 23:15, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Moe isn't basing his arguments on anything as absurd as 'It's not as popular as Spongebob'... also, the bit about how you're not writing about every single organism in the show so you must hate it? No, that's absurd. The fact that you're so relentlessly against the articles, against even the main character having his own article, to the point that you're fervently proposing a massive delete bomb of 20-30 articles, tells us you hate it. --Jace Draccus 23:34, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So deleting the character articles means I cannot like Danny Phantom? Can you imagine why I think that both you and Moe are incompetent fools? No human being with an ounce of intelligence makes such a claim unless they're just trying to make baseless accusations. You are either an idiot or are trolling. Next time you decide to act like a moron and decide that you know what I think more than I do, smack yourself upside the head and throw your computer in the trash. Whether you're an idiot or a troll, you ruin the internet. If you are an idiot, let me explain something - I like Danny Phantom. I have stated that. But you seem to not like to bring up evidence that hurts your otherwise solid point that I hate Danny Phantom. Apparently, someone didn't consider that the fact that one likes Danny Phantom kind of shows he doesn't hate it. But then again, can't let logic and reality stop you from accusing those who dissent from your opinion of bad faith. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 00:18, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I never mentioned bad faith. I also never said I had a problem with deletion to some extent, I just don't like the way you've proposed it, or tried to defend it. You ignore what others actually say in favour of blowing things out of proportion (which is listed on <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> as potentially disruptive behaviour), you make statements of little relevance or no evidence ('It's not notable because it's not as popular as Spongebob'), and, well, trying to get 26 articles deleted at once seems excessive.

<dd>But if I do that, I've committed the cardinal sin of assuming I know more about what you think than you do! Gasp! Shock horror! And yes, that behaviour <i>tells me</i> that. I didn't say you actually <i>hate</i> the show, just that it sure seemed that way. Oh, do you want me to bring up the comments you made about how un-notable Danny Phantom is, to the point that even the main character shouldn't have his own article, and how much less popular than Spongebob it is? How about all the sarcastic and insulting remarks you've made to posters here, mostly myself and Moe? How about how you deliberately and unnecessarily distort things in attempts to discredit our arguments? If we say that Wikipedia should be comprehensive, then YOU say that we're suggesting EVERY CHARACTER IN EXISTENCE should have its own article. If we say that we think you are acting in bad faith because you are being such an ass about it all, then suddenly EVERYBODY who does an AfD is acting in bad faith!

<dd>To Draccus: You make it sound like telling everyone what their opinion is - even when they have told you that it's not - is perfectly alright. And no, I would prefer you cease your incessent lies. How does "Danny Phantom isn't notable enough to have character articles" mean "Danny Phantom isn't notable?" Tell me - if I thought DP wasn't notable, why the Hell wouldn't I nominate the TV show? And, the sarcastic comments come from you spreading bullcrap. "Because he doesn't think Danny Phantom isn't notable enough, he hates Danny Phantom". And another bullshit statement! I never knew one Wikipedian could be quite as laughable as you two. I was responding to a comment that Wikipedia should be as extensive as possible. You claim I'm distorting things when you make false claims? Psh. And being an ass about it all? Timeline: Created AfD. Watched people vote Keep a bunch o' times. Watched Moe spew fuck a few times. Watched Moe, etc. make baseless claims. Asked for proof of these things. Watched Moe, etc. make baseless claims and refuse to give proof, began to assume bad faith. Then I acted like an ass. That was the point where I acted like an ass. Not your viewpoints, not getting flamed, being told that I am wrong about the facts of me and you both are right and that I must be acting in bad faith because... well, no reason provided, apparently. So my AfD is in bad faith because I have a thing about dirty liars? Then can I invalidate your vote for being a potty mouth? And how exactly am I not the victim? What does you attacking me first constitute? Are you the victim because I actually asked you to not make bullshit statements? And to Moe, it makes me look bad when you tell half truths. Of course, it doesn't make you look good when people see all truth. Such as the idea that most people would vote delete being in response to someone saying that these articles are good for most people. Can he proof it? No. Can I prove what I say? No. So basically, my proofless statement is bad and his proofless statement is good. I guess that it's not so bad when you want to believe what they're saying, eh? Grow up. You may not want to admit it, but you both are dead wrong. All you have been doing is making up false statements about me. You tell me I hate Danny Phantom (and continue insisting it after I prove you wrong by *gasp* revealing that your baseless accusation is incorrect), that I hate character articles (yeah, because I've AfDed so many character articles, like Wario and Lakitu... oh, my bad, I featured those), that I made several of the above statements towards you (when anyone who is capable of reading can tell who I was speaking to). The only reason I'd assume bad faith in either of you is because you have both been trolling towards me by telling me I am incapable of having my own opinion and must be reminded what my opinion is. But of course, I'm not assuming bad faith, because it's against policy. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 06:36, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Show me where I said you hate the show. Show me where you asked for proof of anything. Show me where I attacked <i>you</i> in the way you attacked me (moron, fool, idiot, troll). Show me one single statement I made about you as a person or what you actually think, rather than how you come across. Quote my supposed bullshit, my false statements. You can't. I said nothing about bad faith until the post immediately above, and I have not ever insisted you hate THE SHOW. The only thing I said CLOSE to it was that you SEEM to dislike it. I have never tried to tell you what your opinion is, only that I don't agree with it. --Jace Draccus 07:01, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As for watching Moe 'spew fuck', apart from his vote he hasn't posted anything that wasn't in response. Don't make it sound like he's just saying things without any trigger. The proofless statements... fine, it was an idiotic thing for the other guy to say. Doesn't make yours any better? Happy now? --Jace Draccus 07:11, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"Except for the fact that you haven't responded to my request for a non-idiotic statement to prove that your accusations aren't actually bullshit." That's one of two that I've found where I ask you or subtly ask you to show evidence by pointing out you have nothing to back it up. You attacked me by making false statements. I couldn't care less about personal attacks, it's when people lie about me. Additionally, the only time I made the insults was when the both of you had told me that I hated Danny Phantom (and how does "it tells me that you hate Danny Phantom" not telling me that I hate Danny Phantom? You seem convinced that I hate it with out any good reasoning). And no, not wanting characters from the show to have articles is not logic to assume I hate it. I do not come across as a Danny Phantom hater. The fact that I don't think it's notable enough to warrant character articles has nothing to do with what I think of the show itself. And yes, you have said I hated it.
