<p>Were to start... Tim lockner was born in a small farm in the Mississippi Delta. As a young child Tim had many hobbies. He enjoyed singing in his local church group, drowning the family cat, and most importantly playing drums. Tim first got his love of drums when he found a pair of bongos laying in the street. He filled the voids not working in the coal mines playing at local poetry clubs and began writing poetry. While at Stevenson High School Tim joined a band named Montey's Inferno. It consisted of Mike, Jack and Steve. They recorded a song reaching the top of the Stevenson charts and getting on the school's local CD. The song was named "Lobster Attack" which was released with the other single "The Ballad of Kate &amp; Schomer" After this the band fell into tough problems. Greg had joined and later used it as a defense for the murders he commmited. Jack was taken away by trolls and Mike converted a Hot Dog stand into a pirate ship and now attacks people off the African coast with Jim Morrison (The Doors). Tim left with the name decided to try and reform the band. After many failed attempts the downward spiral started. He changed the band name to Montey's Inferno Mach 2 and began a long hard journey. At this time Jesus Christ came to him in a vision. He told him to have a final reunion concert and over charge the public. With the help of Mr. V. a local marketing teacher Tim had the concert. But horribly his backing band was struck by a car on the highway killing them instantly. After this Tim formed a christian rock band, Satanica. After playing many gigs at a local church the unthinkable happened. Tim sold all of his assests and moved to Germany to try and construct a Chocolate monument which will go unnamed. While building a large piece of chocolate fell disabaling the use of his right leg and arm. Tim then wittled new legs out of chocolate and rumor has it bought a castle in the Alps and now resides nder the name Count Chocula, which the cereal was named after. Many people have gone disapering and the locals blame him for the murders. Never admitting to it Tim swears to one day restore the power of his fatherland to it's 1940ish status as ruler of Europe.</p>

<p>Emil Salman (Full Name: Emil Arvin Salmanzadeh) is a Swedish-born Persian youth football player. After helping his team win the 2006 Boys U14 PQ Cup, he is soon to be playing spring football for PQYSA (Peńasquitos Youth Soccer Association). Playing as a left offensive midfielder and a center forward, Emil scored four goals total in the season for the PQYSA Galaxy.</p>
<p>Emil, 13, lives in San Diego, California (USA). He was born on July 14, 1993 in Stockholm, Sweden. Both his parents are full Persian (Iranian). He has had the talent and want for playing football ever since he could walk.</p>
<p>"My parents told me that I started kicking the ball soon after I started walking. I played against my dad, friends, and family. My friends think that I am too good at football, and my parents support me and believe that I will become a professional football player." said Emil.</p>
<p>Most people who know him adore his soccer skills. His dribbling is like Ronaldo, Zidane, and Beckham put together. His speed is as fast as Rooney, and his shooting is on target. He has won the San Diego Iranian Olympics every time he has competed. At school, he scored many goals against all his classmates.</p>
<p>"I think that I am great at football. My dribbling is what shocks everybody. I use a small goal for target practice so that my shots will become accurate. Yet everyday I think I am getting better, I don't think that I can be compared to professional football players. I have out taken many people older than me, and sometimes beat my dad. I really wish to become a football player soon so I can show off my skills. My dream club team, of course, is Arsenal. I think I have a shot at becoming a professional football player, and if I do become a professional, I would like to play for Sweden or Iran's national team." reputed Emil.</p>

<p>The Buck ith vine inn is a reputable public house in Lancashire england. It was built in the late 1700s and is the oldest in the county and has remained similar to its original state due to preservation orders by their local council. The Building is a grade 1 listed building and therefore cannot be demolished or changed in any way. The pub played a role in the 1800s as a hostel for slave traders and tobacco merchants giving them a place to eat sleep and drink en route to Leeds and Manchester from liverpool. The pub is famous in the region for the shackles still affixed to the wall in the cellar from the slave trading days. Local residents have signed petitions for their removal however the preservation order prevents this.</p>

<p>Ryan Giovanni Iacumin (RIÁN Gêovanę Yáķamèn) is from Italian and Aglo-Indian decent. Born in Australia, Ryan always had national pride although still felt strongly about his European background. At age 7 Ryan started playing soccer (football) at a local JFC, Bangor Brumbies. At age 10 he was accepted into the Junior Sutherland Sharks Rep Team. At the age of 14, Ryan was picked up by scout Glenn Foyle during a Sutherland Sharks game. Ryan went on to sign a 6 month trial at Arsenal FC (england). Ryan was made a regular at the junior gunner games, soon to become captain. During his time at Arsenal JFC he and a fellow team mate, Gordon Ou, from China Rep. worked together so powerfully and consistently they came to be known as "the duo". Ryan is a strong leader in the juniors. Many critics suggest he will move up to the reserve side or possibly the first team before he turns 17.</p>

<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>Front Line was established in 2001 to provide immediate and tangible support to the global community of at-risk human rights defenders. Its initial work was based on the Plan of Action devised during the 1998 Paris Summit, which brought together more than 300 human rights defenders from over 100 countries.</p>
<p>Front Line identifies partner organizations and individuals on the basis that they are human rights defenders, i.e. they "work non-violently, for any or all of the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights." Within this group, Front Line has focused its mission on the protection of human rights defenders that are at risk as a result of their activities.</p>
<p>Today, Front Line works in open partnership with a network of human rights defenders in more than 90 countries. All of Front Line’s activities are in direct response to needs and requests expressed by human rights defenders.</p>
<p><br />
<b>The Front Line Program since 2001</b></p>
<p><i>Small Grants Program</i></p>
<p>Front Line has disbursed over €300,000 in grant support to 100 qualified human rights defenders in need of medical, legal and security assistance. Front Line has evacuated 42 human rights defenders in 26 countries facing imminent persecution, torture, imprisonment, and death threats as a result of their human rights work.</p>
<p><i>Training</i></p>
<p>Front Line has provided local, regional &amp; international HRD training seminars and workshops on the topics of security &amp; protection capacity-building, IT Security and Women Human Rights Defender issues. Training locations: Africa, Central America, Asia, Central Asia, the Former Soviet Union, the Middle East and Europe.</p>
<p><i>Research &amp; Publishing</i></p>
<p>Front Line has conducted research and published detailed reporting on the situation of human rights defenders in Rwanda, Guatemala, Palestine, Brazil, Indonesia, Sierra Leone and the USA. The organization has also published resource materials and training packages designed to aid the work of at-risk human rights defenders. Organizational output: Protection Manual for Human Rights Defenders; "NGO in a Box" program of IT capacity expansion &amp; security; on-line manuals on civil, political, economic, social &amp; cultural rights.</p>
<p><i>Dublin Platform</i></p>
<p>Front line has hosted three bi-annual international platforms for human rights defenders designed to foster interaction &amp; learning, promote mutual education &amp; skill development and enable engagement with senior-level political and civil leaders. Each platform has brought together over 100 at-risk HRD from over 70 countries. Advocacy</p>
<p>Front line lobbies European Union member states to adopt a clear and active role in support of human rights defenders. In recent years, the organization has also successfully lobbied for the creation of the "EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders". The document subsequently created a system of established measures that encourage EU member states to engage in active support of at-risk human rights defenders. In order to consistently promote the needs of human right defenders among EU leadership circles, Front Line has established a permanent office in Brussels</p>
<p><i>Front Line Internships &amp; Fellowship</i></p>
<p>Front Line manages a number of internships/fellowship programs including a Dublin/Geneva United Nations intern programme designed to provide logistical support to the UN Special Representative on Human Rights Defenders. Front Line also established a six-month fellowship program, which brings two international human rights defenders to the Front Line Dublin office for specified, related projects and training as appropriate to their needs.</p>
<p><i>Need for International Intervention</i></p>
<p>Front Line recognizes that the priority request from human rights defenders is the need for an increase in the speed and effectiveness of international intervention. This priority has been clearly identified by defenders facing imminent threat of danger or incarceration as a result of their activities. Additionally, human rights defenders recognize that the political space available to them to safely carry out their work is also of vital importance. These needs were identified by defenders during Front Line’s three Dublin Platforms and at the UN Paris Summit in 1998</p>
<p><i>Rapid Response</i></p>
<p>Front Line has maintained its programme at the international level with a clear focus on the “fast, furious &amp; flexible” protection of human rights defenders. The organization’s central objective is to provide rapid response and increased response capacity to defenders facing imminent threat and to find ways to strengthen the means of preventing violent and/or illegal measures taken against them (expand human rights defender capacity, promote local and international acceptance and awareness of the legitimate role of human rights defenders; foster development of defender support networks).</p>
<p>Award</p>
<p>Front line is the winner of the 2007 King Baudouin International Development Prize. <i>...for the effectiveness of their efforts to combat the isolation faced by human rights defenders around the world, for the support and protection that they offer them, and for their continuing advocacy in favour of an international plan of action for human rights, which is an essential condition for development.</i></p>

<p>The first african-american owned rental car company was called Logan Luxury and was based out of Willoughby, Ohio. The company was run by the owner Christopher B. Logan who was only 24 years old at the time. Christopher B. Logan was born in the City of East Cleveland, Ohio and moved to Cleveland, Ohio in 1980. Graduated from M.L.K. High School in Cleveland and attended University of Akron. Married in 1994 to Wynette S. Brown then started Logan Luxury Auto Rental in 2000. The Company carried fine luxury cars like the Cadillac STS valued at a whopping $55,000.00 the most expensive in the cadillac fleet. Most rental car companies at that time required a credit card and the minimum age of 25 to rent. Logan Luxury requirements were to pay the rental in cash up front and to be a minimum age of 23 with full coverage insurance. This helped a lot of people who had no credit card and could only dream of driving an expensive luxury car rent one without the discrimination faced by other companies. Logan Luxury delivered all cars to any GM Dealer close to your home or job so pick-up and delivery was always accessible. Logan Luxury went out of business in 2002 because of the suffering economy after the World Trade Center Attacks but will be remembered by hundreds of satisfied customers.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-01-23_57f1.html" title="Edit section: Conscious Automatism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Conscious Automatism</span></h2>
<p>Conscious automatism (C.A.) is a position on the philosophic question that asks whether determinism, as distinguished from “free will,” can be considered the sole operant principle in human decision making. C.A. holds that we human beings, like the other animals we generally consider our inferiors, are conscious but respond as automata to our prior conditioning (within our physiological powers and limitations) in all of our apparently “willed” decisions. According to this view, the “freedom” we exercise in decision making, a uniqueness that convention leads us to believe distinguishes us from the other mammals, is illusory, for our motives are all, without exception, caused, in the manner we concede that all other changes are causally initiated in the world around us.</p>
<p>Thus in epistemology C.A. is the logical conclusion of a strictly determinist explanation of human conduct and denies that our decision making is free in any sense from causal determinants. Conscious automatism, in refusing the compromise long in vogue among philosophers between freedom and determinism, has as its most disturbing corollary the abandonment of ethicists’ traditional reliance upon the notion of moral responsibility as the foundation of most moral systems and criminal justice institutions. It is, therefore, one of the most iconoclastic principles adduced in the history of moral philosophy as well, having profound practical societal consequences if widely accepted.</p>
<p>The term was recently given significant new substance in the book Grandest Illusion: The Seductive Myth of Free Will, 1 by Norman Haughness, which states forcefully the case for acknowledging the power of exceptionless determinism in human behavior. In Grandest Illusion the arguments claiming that the human will is free in any or all cases from total dependence on causal antecedents are analyzed and criticized in an overtly partisan effort to reveal the flaws in their coherence and logical validity. This in contrast to most recent literature in the field, well-exemplified by The Oxford Handbook of Free Will, edited by Robert Kane, 2 whose contributors without exception take positions supporting voluntarism or maintaining agnostic reservations.</p>
<p>Haughness contends that freedom of willing is no more than a faith, which he calls “voluntarism“. He claims that, despite having little empirical basis except in unexamined intuition, free will has been accommodated and, indeed, vigorously defended by philosophers in large part because its abandonment is emotively an extremely repellent notion, suggesting loss of personal autonomy to nearly all who contemplate it. Equally intolerable to many is the fear that, without it, moral responsibility would lose its customarily revered place in society and moral chaos would thereupon necessarily ensue. This problem he addresses only briefly, urging that it is only by changing prior conditioning that conduct can be made conducive to decriminalizing society rather than, as at present, by reliance on ethical norms that are simply not present or are defective in most offenders.</p>
<p>The term “conscious automata” was employed as long ago as November, 1868, by Thomas H. Huxley in a famous address he delivered in Edinburgh titled “On the Physical Basis of Life.” But Huxley’s version of conscious automatism was a compromise. He acknowledged the validity of David Hume’s attack 3 on the popular but illusory notion of a causal nexus, extending it to a firm denial that laws of nature state what “must” occur (admitting only that they state what “will” occur, a distinction that has remained unclear to many). Huxley saw this as an opening to deny that there exist any sort of “iron laws” that necessitate human conduct. 4 He believed in such abstractions as “spirit” and insisted that we possess enough “freedom” to “do our duty” and “do as we like,” obvious exceptions to a thoroughgoing determinist view of human motivation. Thus, at bottom he supported only a conscious semi-automatism similar to the ambiguous views of most contemporary philosophers.</p>

The song "Devil's Dance" was the first "ReLoad" song which Metallica played live before the album has been released.It has occasionally been played live before the "ReLoad" album has been released. "Devil's Dance" was played for the first time live on August 23, 1995 in London, England. In the show in Brimingham, England, 1996 where it was played for the second time, James Hetfield Said the following words: We are going to play a new song. Its so f***ing new, you might not even have heard its so new. Its a heavy one, and it is comming off the next record we might be putting out. Its Titled Devil's Dance. It is about the devil's attempt to get somebody following him. It starts with a distorted wah-wah bass intro from Newsted.</p>

<p>Eid ul-Adha Eid ul-Adha Official name Arabic: عيد الأضحى Also called The Festival of Sacrifice, Sacrifice Feast, Tabaski, Eyd-e Qorban, Kurban Bayramı, Qurbani Eid (In Bangladesh), Type Islamic Significance Commemoration of Prophet Ibrahim's (Abraham's) willingness to sacrifice his son for God. Marks the end of the Pilgrimage or Hajj for the millions of Muslims who make the trip to Mecca each year. Ends 12 Dhu al-Hijjah Observances Prayer, Sacrificing a Goat/Sheep, Eating with Family and Friends Related to Eid ul-Fitr, the other Islamic festival, which occurs the first day after Ramadan Eid ul-Adha (Arabic: عيد الأضحى), (Persian: عید قربان) occurs on the tenth day of the Islamic month of Dhul Hijja. It is one of two Eid festivals that Muslims celebrate. Eid ul-Adha is celebrated by Muslims worldwide as a commemoration of Prophet Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son (Ishmael) for God. Others celebrate Eid-ul Adha as it marks the end of the Pilgrimage or Hajj for the millions of Muslims who make the trip to Mecca each year. Like Eid ul-Fitr, Eid ul-Adha also begins with a short prayer followed by a khutba. In Mecca, the Khutba is delivered from Mount Arafat.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The story behind Eid ul-Adha Muslims believe that Ibrahim (Prophet Abraham) wanted to have a son but he was too old. God answered Prophet Ibrahim's prayers and granted him a son, Ismael. Later, when Ismael was a young man, there was an examination for Ibrahim and Ismael: Allah revealed in a dream to Ibrahim that he should sacrifice his son Ismail (Ishmael). Ibrahim and Ismail set off to Mina (Saudi Arabia) for the sacrifice. Both Ibrahim and Ismael stayed true to Allah and were adamant to obey His order but as Ibrahim prepared to sacrifice his son, Allah stopped him and gave him a sheep to sacrifice instead. This is the story behind Eid ul-Adha. The story of Ismael continued as he was ancestor to the Arab nation in which Muhammad was born and Islam was founded. Muslims celebrate Eid-ul Adha as it marks the end of the Pilgrimage or Hajj for the millions of Muslims who make the trip to Mecca each year.</p>
<p><br />
Observing Eid ul-Adha It is celebrated on the 10th day of the month of Dhul Hijja (ذو الحجة) of the lunar Islamic calendar, after Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. This happens to be approximately 70 days after the end of the month of Ramadan.</p>
<p>While Eid ul-Fitr is considered to be one day long, Eid ul-Adha is supposed to last for three days. Some Islamic cultures consider Eid ul-Fitr to last three days and Eid ul-Adha to last for four, but this is not part of original Islamic teachings. The first day is the primary holiday, on which men, women, and children are expected to dress in their finest clothing and perform prayer (Salah) in a large congregation. Muslims who can afford to do so sacrifice domestic animals, usually sheep, as a symbol of Ibrahim's sacrifice; this sacrifice is called "Qurban." The meat is distributed amongst their neighbours, relatives, and the poor and hungry. The regular charitable practices of the Muslim community are demonstrated during Eid ul-Adha by the concerted effort to see that no impoverished Muslim is left without sacrificial food during this day. Coming immediately after the Day of Arafat (when Muhammad pronounced the final seal on the religion of Islam), Eid ul-Adha gives concrete realization to what the Muslim community ethic means in practice.</p>

Eid ul-Adha in the Gregorian calendar See also: Islamic calendar While Eid ul-Adha is always on the same day of the Islamic calendar, the date on the Gregorian calendar varies from year to year since the Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar and the Gregorian calendar is a solar calendar. Each year, Eid ul-Adha (like other Islamic holidays) falls on one of two different Gregorian dates in different parts of the world, due to the fact that the boundary of crescent visibility is different from the International date line. Furthermore, some countries follow the date in Saudi Arabia rather than the astronomically determined local calendar.</p>
<p>2005: January 21; January 20 in Saudi Arabia (See note 1 below.) 2006: December 30 or 31, depends on the country 2007: December 20 2008: December 8 2009: November 28 2010: November 17 2011: November 7 NOTE 1: The Saudi authorities had originally confirmed that Eid ul-Adha in 2005 would begin on Friday, January 21 ([1]), but subsequently moved up the date by one day to January 20, possibly for better crowd control by avoiding Hajj during the weekend ([2], [3], [4]). The official reason was that the new moon was sighted earlier than expected, starting the month of Dhul Hijja one day early.</p>

<p>Yes! We are hoping to release an AS3 framework later this year. AS3 contains a lot of great changes so there will not be a direct port; more of a parallel framework with commonalties.</p>

<p>EEGLAB is a Matlab toolbox distributed under the free GNU license for processing EEG, MEG and other electrophysiological data. Along with all the basic processing tools, EEGLAB implements independent component analysis (ICA), time/frequency analysis, artifact rejection, and several modes of data visualization. EEGLAB allows users to import their electrophysiological data in about 20 binary file format from standard EEG manufacturer, preprocess it, visualize activity in single trials, and perform ICA (Independent Component Analysis). Artifactual ICA components may be subtrated from the data. Alternatively, ICA components representing brain activity may be further processed and analyzed. EEGLAB also allow users to group data from several subjects, and to cluster their independent components.</p>
<p>In 1997, a set of data processing functions was first released on the Internet by Scott Makeig at the Salk institute, under the name “the ICA/EEG toolbox”. In 2000, Arnaud Delorme designed a graphic interface on the top of these functions along with some of his own artifact removal functions, and released the first version of the “EEGLAB software for artifact removal”. In 2003, Delorme and Makeig joined effort to release the first stable and fully documented version of EEGLAB. In 2004, EEGLAB was awarded funding by the NIH for continued development of research software.</p>
<p>EEGLAB has been downloaded about 25,000 times from 73 countries worldwide (2003-2006). EEGLAB comprises about 380 stand-alone Matlab functions (version 5.03), and a total of about 50,000 lines of code. EEGLAB also contains 22 user-contributed plugins (2006). The most popular plugins are the DIPFIT plugin for source locazation of ICA components of EEG data. Another popular plugin called FMRIB allows removal of fMRI artifact in EEG data. A total of about 200 researchers have contributed directly or indirectly to the software by programming functions or reporting bugs.</p>

<p>Stryker is a band from Massachusetts. They are the self-titled, "Seekers of all things delicious." Stryker was created when Christopher "Crazy Ass," Andrade, dropped a giant load, giving birth to Nick Poitras. Nick, hailing from the deep recesses of Christopher's anal cavity, decided that he wanted to be just like Chris, albeit a little skinnier. So Nick picked up a guitar and instantly played every Dragonforce and Motley Crue song ever made. He was just THAT cool. Chris realized Nick's (Now dubbed "Cleft") amazing potential and decided that they should start a band. But no, not just any band. They would return to the glorious roots of their washed-up, drug-addicted idols such as Vince Neil and the Cookie Monster. They would be........an "80's Hair Metal Band." But what to name this amazing creation? Surely, an amazing band must have an amazing name. The name must convey both Nick's awesomeness, along with Christopher's desire to strike things (namely a plate of spaghetti with a fork). After long hours of endless thought, combined with endless cookie dough ingestion, they finally had a name. They would be called Stryker. There isn't much more to tell, especially since I am sick of typing this article. However I will tell you this. Stryker is coming to a town near you. And you'd better hide your cookies ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p>Dana L. French is a prominent U.S. computer scientist working in the fields of business continuity, disaster recovery, and high availability. He has designed and written numerous software packages to automate the processes of disaster recovery and high availability. He is most noted for his approach to system administration as an automated process, rather than an interactive one.</p>
<p>He operates several companies that specilize in providing business continuity services to large world wide organizations. These companies provide services that include consulting, disaster recovery facilities, application and business function hosting.</p>
<p>French is well known in the Unix community for his advanced shell programming skills and is a noted advocate of Korn Shell programming. He provides source code for most of his programming work on-line free of charge. One of his most well known shell programs is "shell curses", which is a shell script implementation of the "C" language "Curses" library. Another is "kshsql" which is a Korn Shell implementation of a complete SQL database system. French is also the author of "shunix", which is a project to implement all of the GNU Unix utilities entirely in shell script code.</p>
<p>French currently works as a business continuity consultant, and teaches courses in disaster recovery planning and Korn Shell programming. He also publishes articles on these topics on a regular basis.</p>
