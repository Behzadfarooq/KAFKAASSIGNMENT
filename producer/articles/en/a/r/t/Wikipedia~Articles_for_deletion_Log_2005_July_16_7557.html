<li>Delete: Let's be clear: <b>nothing</b> is inherently a keep. It's article by article. There are, however, subjects that are almost always not notable, and student organizations are one of them. The answer would be, if it were on a campus organization, to redirect to a section of the university article. In the case of a person holding an office on campus, there's no point at all.

<li>What the editor intended to discuss is irrelevant.

(See <a href="../../../i/n/t/Category%7EIntegers_a721.html" title="Category:Integers">Category:Integers</a>.) A redirect from a year title to an article on a number would be contrary to the naming conventions. What the original authors wrote isn't even important from the perspective of retaining information.

<li>Okay, you're right that the naming conventions need to be followed.

<li>Delete: I guess you had to be there, and that is the problem. What significance does this show have? It was a show. Was it national? (No indication of its audience given.) Was it a thing referred to in popular culture (the newspaper account of one DJ accusing the other of plagiarism doesn't count)? There are lots of radio shows, and they're generally forgotten.

<li><b>Transwiki</b> The game is playable, and pretty far along in terms of completion, so being 'complete' isn't a reason not to have a guide. Plus by definition, MMOs are never 'complete'.

<ul>
<li>a/ If we added every book we fancied then we'd just duplicate Amazon, etc.</li>

<li>Not sure: It should be <i>Human</i> Growth hormone releasing factor. Further, the bit about its pulsatile expression during hypoglycemia is misleading at best. It's a detail that isn't germane, because hypoglycemia is not going to make someone taller; rather, during <i>local</i> hypoglycemia, an increased expression is found (very small amounts). The various connections between this and glucagon factors is interesting, but, well, we're not really a biochem site.

<li>Comment: Is it from the pituitary? Is it released in a pulsatile manner? Is it increased in hypoglycemia? I.e. is <i>this article</i> about GHRF or about hGHRF? In either case, what else is there to say about it? What are the clinical presentations of surplus and deficit in humans (i.e. is this the cause of <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acromegaly.html" title="Acromegaly">acromegaly</a>, or is it something else? is this the cause of <a href="../../../d/w/a/Dwarfism.html" title="Dwarfism">dwarfism</a>, or is it something else?). Is it ever administered therapeutically? If not, why not. (I know why not, but the article doesn't tell anyone else.) If so, in what cases? What are the other factors produced by its metabolism or production?

<li><b>Comment</b> Dirt, don't feel bad. Nobody's going to get mad at an innocent newbie. However, it's likely that this article will be deleted. Many editors are against the creation of what they feel are vanity articles, even though that wasn't your intent. Also, there are many, many ISPs in the world, just like there are many bands, many teachers, and many websites. Many people here believe that a subject should be noteworthy in some way to have an article. Normally, I'd be voting to delete, but I won't vote in this case, in hopes that you realize the community here really is generally friendly. Hope you stick around, and don't take it personally if this article gets deleted. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> 03:06, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment reply</b> In hindsight, ISP was a bad choice of word (acronym) - i chose it because there was an article i could link to. I've changed the wording - and found a new article to link to. monkey.org spawned a handful of well known computer security researchers and has since become home to others, articles about whom i plan to write (or at least stub.) Having been involved in the monkey.org project for so long i thought it would be a decent article to write from scratch. I'll continue to flesh it out until it is deleted or not - at the very least this is a good learning experience. As a side note, i've been browsing and tweaking wikipedia for a while, but only today did i create an acount. Thanks for taking the time to comment, <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirt_eccd.html" title="User:Dirt">Dirt</a> 05:15, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> but only because I like to be consistent. It is a pleasant change for the author of a <s>vanity</s> page about themselves to sound so reasonable.

<dd>Actually, the genesis of the article was a statement, in a May 31 e-mail, from a UK physician expressing concern about another MD promoting software that filters out the comments of <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine.html" title="Vaccine">vaccine</a> policy critics from <a href="../../../b/m/j/BMJ_b90d.html" title="BMJ">BMJ</a> 'rapid responses': "I have no way of knowing how his mind works or what motivates him - though he does seem to take the medical establishment line on vaccines.

It seems quite plausible to me that mercury may play a role in ASDs. The few doctors who bother to contribute to the debates on vaccines at the BMJ tend to be patronisingly certain about their safety." Thoughts along the lines of how rose colored glasses may often be used by doctors, to shield themselves from <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_sense.html" title="Common sense">common sense</a>, came to mind. Initially he article's content was largely limited to relevant quotes, rather than "essay observation," due to the relative dearth of available material defining 'moral compass'. An article on the topic is quite necessary to fill the void. Wikipedia, as an <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institutional_memory.html" title="Institutional memory">institutional memory</a> resource, is well suited to helping rectify this glaring blind spot. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 04:39, 17 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for that digression on thimersol and vaccines and autism. Responding to the portion of your statement relating to the VfD, "the dearth of available material defining 'moral compass'" would seem to be an argument not to have an article on "moral compass", not to fill up the article with personal essay, quotations and links. Perhaps the reason there is a dearth of material defining "moral compass" is because the simple dictionary definition says all that needs to be said. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 22:35, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The term is real in the sense that it is often used rhetorical devise. It is often used in accusations that the opposing faction or person lacks the moral compass (presumably similar to that of the speaker) for whatever reason.

<li>So, are you saying the Wikipedia doesn't have room for articles about the moral bearings of POV? With so much discussion on the Wiki about POV, and tens of thousands of goofle hits providing secondary evidence of the significance of the concept, such a conclusion seems odd. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 05:03, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<p>This page offers no new information about this individual, merely duplicating what is originally stated in the Kinsey biography, and so is not even worth a merger.

<li>Whether <a href="../../../p/a/g/Page_Three_girl_e598.html" title="Page Three girl">Page Three girls</a> are "pr0n queens" is a subject of longstanding debate. It's irrelevant here, though. These are women who are simply models that have their pictures shown in a newspaper, and no more meet the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria on that ground than do the models that drape themselves over cars and furniture in newspaper advertisements to sell cars and furniture. <a href="../../../p/a/g/Page_Three_girl_e598.html" title="Page Three girl">Page Three girls</a> can be encyclopaedia-worthy, but they have to do <i>more</i> than just appear on page 3 in order to be so.

<li>I turned up that biography via a Google Web search, it being the first result in the search for <i>"Anna Taverner" biography</i>. I've since discovered that following <i>any</i> of the hyperlinks on the biography leads, either directly or via just 1 intermediate step, to pornography. Some research reveals that this site hosts a wide range of biographies on people from Anna Taverner to <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lindsay_Lohan_4008.html" title="Lindsay Lohan">Lindsay Lohan</a>, doubtless for the express purpose of capturing Google searches, all of which are just fronts. This calls the legitimacy of the information contained in that biography into question, of course. If the hyperlinks are lies, why not the rest of it, too? My vote remains unchanged. I cannot find any other biographies that contain <i>even as much</i> information as that one. Seemingly all that is known about this person, as reported by sources that are not untrustworthy pornography industry sources, is her name, place and year of birth, and occupation as a model for a newspaper. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:44, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Then somebody needs to confirm it. As of right now, to me it looks like an exceptionally weak excuse of a nude picture of dubious legality (how do photos from <i>british</i> papers come under <i>US</i> law?) on Wikipedia.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> if she's a regular Sun girl, as that is notable in itself. I'd argue that Page 3 girls (who appear in mainstream newspapers with 7-digit circulation figures) are far more notable than "pr0n queens" known only to purchasers of adult DVDs.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't think this is advertising although it still may not be encyclopedic. It appears that a user has found two tools that help analyze the HijackThis log file (which I plan to try next time I run that program) and he/she is just trying to share that information. It looks to me like Help2Go itself may be notable enough for a listing but the Help2Go Detective should just be a part of that article.

<dd>Good point -- it should not be linked to by such a range of pages. Also, I agree with JamesBurns tht it should be cleaned up -- and hopefully improved significantly by someone.

However, being for an interdisciplinary philosophy doesn't justify linking in and of itself - there needs to be a good reason. That good reason should be clear in the sources (i.e. clarify why a theory is relevant to other things if you think it is). Taken to the extreme, you can't have random links between things without any apparent justificaiton at all. Assume that's what you're referring to (?). Whatta you thing?

<p>This shouldn't even be an article. The H3 receptor is probably so minor that this one sentence that wikipedia has about it should go on the histamine page.

<p>Irish-American mayors are very popular and a list of them makes sense. Saying that African-Americans are more notable is point of view. 64.109.253.204 04:02, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I think you misunderstand my comment. I mean that the political participation of African Americans is more notable because it was specifically restricted by notable policies and events of American history.

<li><b>Keep</b> Just because we're not fans of a paticular series, is NOT a reason to delete information on a paticular topic. This is factual information about a topic that happens to have a great appeal to many people. That is the sort of thing this wikipedia was meant to do, provide a place for the community to talk about and post relavent facts for topics that interest them. So while i myself am not a fan, I say keep it.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think it is important to recognise that Harry Potter is a unique phenomenon - not even the His Dark Materials trilogy caused such a stir even though many would argue that it probably should have given its formidable subject matter. The leaks, speculation - its all part and parcel of the Potter experience. Given that - I think deleting for its own sake would be a huge mistake. Information can be re-organised, re-named - but it is valid exactly because of the uniqueness of the situation. I am glad to see that Wikipedia provides such in-depth detail and I honestly dont see how anything that has been done either here or in the main article (especially the summaries - which are just brilliant!) contradicts what this enterprise is supposed to be about. The main article can't possibly house everything and I think this is a very worthwhile repository. I agree with whoever said that "Cleanup is required to remove duplicate material and cite sources, but that's no reason for deletion." Keep it. Severina 18:51, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> on renaming: On the talk page for this, I suggested renaming the article to Pre-release speculation about Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, as a cleaner alternative to an anon's suggestion of Pre-release speculation as to the content of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. Having a rum(o|ou)rs page about it doesn't make sense, since it has already been released (and thus there won't be any more rumors). Pre-release speculation sounds like a better phrase to put in the title to me, and it gets around having some word in parentheses at the end of the title, and the US/UK spelling issue.

Information about the widespread speculation should be included in the merge. However, this is not the same as noting every theory that was speculated. I.E. it is okay to say that millions of fans debated the identity of the Half Blood Prince. That's because that entails a notable amount of speculation. It is not okay, however, to say that the best theory is Bill Weasley and then give a page-long explanation of the reasons why. It is not necessary to include every last theory proposed because they are not the interesting part. If there was something especially notable about any of them, such as a radical or controversial prediction, that would be different. Right now, however, the article's focus is on what was believed, rather than the fact that people believed it. In fact, its stated goal is to say "what was known" prior to the release. This is just a deliberate limit of the information we have on HBP. This is not acceptable on Wikipedia, where we strive to be comprehensive. We would never have an article on "what was known about chemistry in 1942," although that is a part of history. I am going through the article now. I will remove most of the guesses and previews themselves while leaving notable information about them. I will leave what is necessary to support the previous.

<li>I do not know about any of this, but Jeff Riggenbach is a well known libertarian who knows what he is talking about; it is very likely he did write the comment duncharris deleted. It should be restored. It could be Riggenbach made a technical mistake or does not konw what a sock puppet is (as I do not quite my own self).

<li>I am Jeff Riggenbach, and I did in fact write the comment duncharris deleted. I'm a bit unfamiliar with protocol around here, and wasn't aware I was supposed to "register" anywhere -- where? If anyone wishes to confirm my opinion on this issue, I can be reached at jriggenbach@bigfoot.com
<ul>
<li>I'll add that I've known Tom Palmer since he was a college kid in the '70s, and an intern at the Cato Institute, then located in San Francisco. I was executive editor of The Libertarian Review at the time, and executive producer of Byline, Cato's daily public affairs radio program. I think Tom has done well over the years, but he's hardly so important that he merits an encyclopedia article devoted to his greatness. - Jeff Riggenbach</li>

<li>This user account is not a sock puppet. My screen name is my real name, Gil Guillory. I have not been especially active on Wikipedia, except for usage and a single edit I made in the market failure page last April, after having written an article on the topic. However, I did not create the account specifically to enter this foray, nor is it a puppet account of another. I think it is self-evident to most libertarians that Palmer is not even a minor intellectual in the libertarian movement. An important activist, yes; but, I don't think that qualifies for a Wikipedia entry. Gil Guillory 07:36, 18 July 2005 (CST)

<li><b>Delete</b> The entry is clearly self-promotion. Furthermore, Palmer isn't a particularly significant libertarian thinker. Prior to noticing his slanders of Hans Hermann Hoppe, I'd never heard of him at all. There are libertarians of more importance who have no Wikipedia entries at all, or much shorter ones.

He has used that web-page as a place to counter some of the outrageous libel against Hans-Hermann Hoppe that comes from Palmer's webpage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Furthermore, aforementioned "obscene sexual comments" were just comment spam which Palmer falsely portrayed as being written by Kinsella. --Dfranke</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Come on this is a campaign by Kinsella to get rid of a Wiki entry! Has the man got nothing better to do?</li>
</ul>
<p>I find Palmer to be a figure of not enough significance to be mentioned in an encylopedia. He is not a key figure in libertarian thought. There are libertarians of much more significance than Mr. Palmer who do not have a Wikipedia entry, or who have a shorter entry than Palmer's.</p>

<li>Stephan Kinsella here: Please note: I did NOT start this campaign to delete Palmer's site. <a href="../../../n/s/k/User%7ENskinsella_1eb3.html" title="User:Nskinsella">Nskinsella</a> 18:47, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Kinsella drew attention to this article on his anti-Palmer blog, and then promoted this VfD on it when another editor nominated it. Whether Kinsella made the nomination itself is a minor point - he has lobbied heavily for this VfD. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 04:59, July 21, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, Willmcw, that was before I realized what the rules on notability were. I initially assumed that, since my first entry had been previously deleted, then Palmer's entry was deletable too, since he is arguably not significanly more notable than I. But when I read up on the actual Wiki rules for notability, I realized that my entry qualifies, so I put up my entry. And I have removed my comments on Palmer's site about deleting it; that is for others to decide.

<li>For the record, my attention was also drawn here by Stephan Kinsella, as were many others. I find the practice of such lobbying distasteful, but have concluded that deletion is merited, not in the least because the conflict ongoing among these parties cast a cloud over these articles. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 01:59, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Lobbying? Are you kidding? I don't maintain Palmer's site should be deleted, Xoloz! Now that I'm aware of the bio criteria. Were I you, I'd vote to keep it (perhaps, w/ some improvement, toning down of the self-promotion etc.). Why are you blaming me for your delete vote? Change it to keep if you want, I'm not stopping you. <a href="../../../n/s/k/User%7ENskinsella_1eb3.html" title="User:Nskinsella">Stephan Kinsella</a> 03:41, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I did not "blame" you. I stated, for the record, the facts which led me here. The "lobbying" to which I refer most strongly related to your own article, but (because your message was such an obvious attempt at advocacy), I think it not unreasonable to draw the inference that you were, more sublty, lobbying against Palmer as well. My vote is, of course, my own judgment, by which I stand. I think it fair to say, though, that you have exerted some influence over this VfD. While such efforts are not prohibited or uncommon at Wikipedia, many users consider such conduct less than ethically pure, and, in any case, the question had arisen above. If you, in fact, do favor the "keeping" of this article, then your attempt to draw my attention here has yielded a (very minor) result unwelcome for you, a consequence which you may (or may not) wish to note for future decision-making. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 04:08, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's rich for you to bemoan my "influence" over this VfD when you are yourself voting here. And just because I would have had you vote "keep" here (if only because I favor adherence to the Wiki bio policies, which you and other deleters evidently feel free to disregard), it does not mean I do not also favor a democratic system where you have the <b>right</b> to vote as you will. There is no inconsistency. Any more than it is inconsistent for a democrat politician to ask people to vote--even if they vote against him. If anyone influenced this VfD, it is those who tried to delete this very site, which made me review the bio policy, which led me to put up my own entry again. <a href="../../../n/s/k/User%7ENskinsella_1eb3.html" title="User:Nskinsella">Stephan Kinsella</a> 04:31, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As you continue acquainting yourself with Wikipedia policy, note that Wikipedia is not a democracy, so your point there is rather inexact. Further, I fail to understand your first point, since my voting here is a (minor) result of your influence, and that was among the reasons I chose to comment to keep the record clear. And lastly, I do not believe any "deleter" here "disregards" Bio policy -- I feel that the disfavoring of autobiographical articles creates a presumptive disqualification which has not been overcome by evidence, nor helped by this air of advocacy which, I hope you see, you helped foster. I suggest further discussion between us, if you care to respond, move to my talk page. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 05:27, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article contains lots of unsubstantiated claims, goofy urban folklore, and wild speculation, as well as a lot of material that is about the <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> in general, rather than its costumes. The Klan has always tried to sound mysterious, ancient, and exciting, and this article is a symptom of that, with lots of nonsensical speculation that the costume was meant to emulate ancient druids', etc. A large portion of the article is simply a list of depictions of the Klan in popular culture. Of the part of the article that actually deals with the costume, I don't think any of it is true based on the print sources I have access to. The images are duplicated in the main <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> article.--<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 04:10, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - where claims are mere speculation, this is clearly stated. I think it is important to discuss, for example, the evolution of the costume, which is documented, and which was originally quite different. Why should cross burning have its own article, but not this? As for the Klan trying to sound exciting and mysterious, I don't think that's what the article about, since it is not a pro-Klan piece. If there is a "druid" influence, this may well have come in via Sir Walter Scott, whose influence on the KKK is quite well documented. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 14:09, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Rebuttal</b> Simply posting someone's name on the VIP page does not "document" him a vandal. I could easily put your name on there and later claim you are a "documented" vandal, after all. I'm sure the evaluation of my entire corpus of contributions will show that they are, on the whole, more helpful than harmful, a few minor indiscretions aside, for which I have apologised. And my German grammar is <i>Ausgezeichnit,</i> thank you!SamuraiBoywithaDrugProblem 05:47, 18 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Rebuttal'</b> It is obvious Casito is too biased to be the arbiter of who's contributions are worthwhile and what is vandalism. Just look at what he said about his over-zealous and stifling over-reactions on HIS OWN TALK PAGE: "I realize that it would be in the best interest of both Wikipedia and my sanity if I stay away from Recent Changes and similar pages which put me in the office of Wiki-cop. Without fail, I eventually get upset and bite the newcomers. The previous talk messages should reinforce that point. Furthermore, RC tends to stress me out and I would rather play it cool. I have decided that, at least for now, I'm not the best person to police recent changes and I could be much, much more constructive working in other areas." Now, in the legal world, we call that a "party admission," and hardly the type of person you'd want policing what is supposed to be an open arena of ideas.SamuraiBoywithaDrugProblem 06:03, 18 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Rebuttal</b> First, I don't pretend to be an arbiter, I am simply documenting all of your misdeeds; think of me as more of a procurator. Second, the comment on my talk page is not relevent, since it refers to my actions on <a href="../../../r/c/_/WP%7ERC_d77e.html" title="WP:RC">WP:RC</a>, not <a href="../../../v/i/p/WP%7EVIP_552d.html" title="WP:VIP">WP:VIP</a> or <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a>. I never found any of your crap by using RC, I ran across <i>it in the wild</i>. Furthermore, you are not a nai-ive newcommer, but rather an established troll. Also, my admision shows that I recognize my "over-zealous-ness" and that I conceded to more experieced users who I knew were correct. The opposite could be said of you. Finally, considering your "interpretation" of copyright law at <a href="../../../a/i/n/Ainu_people.html" title="Ainu people">Ainu people</a>, I doubt anyone here believes your insights into the legal world. -<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasito_3c90.html" title="User:Casito">Casito</a>⇝<a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECasito_0bf9.html" title="User talk:Casito">Talk</a> 18:39, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Rebuttal</b>. You are obviously of narrow mind, perhaps angry at some unspecified longings in your subconsience. Just because someone else propounds views contrary to yours does not make him a "vandal." And say what you will about my methods, it is obvious that I started a quite positive development on this article, namely, calling attention to the outdated and racist banality of the piece so that all our friends on Wikipedia can begin to improve it.SamuraiBoywithaDrugProblem 15:53, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> You have an unusual editing history for someone concerned about racist attitudes toward the Ainu, having repeatedly inserted a line about the "inherently superior culture" of ethnic Japanese into the article. If you wish to reform your vandalism, this is not the way to do it; but we are, and I am, open to reformed vandals. If you change your "methods" you can still become a fully respected member of the Wikipedia community. BTW, I notice it has been a while since you last made the ridiculous claim about "international thievery", that we are violating copyright on a 1911 publication.

<dd><b>Response</b>. You seem to be quite a bit more civilised and reasonable than that bloody Casito fellow, who most recently implied the threat of an Interpol sting operation in response to my enlightened editing. As far as the copyright issue goes, copyright law is statutory in nature, and not common law (another thing Casito bolloxed up), and I would have to do some research on the issue and get back to you. It would simply be malpractice to render an opinion straightaway without doing the proper reflection, after all. God forbid a nice young man such as yourself might rely upon my snap judgment and wind up getting yourself sued or something horrible like that. Keep up the good work!

<ul>
<li>You don't get a vote. And apparently you don't understand how deletion works here. If we delete this article, we are saying that the Ainu people should not have an article, period, which is a decision we could not override without a successful vote for undeletion. Therefore no matter what you think of the <i>current</i> article, if you think the Ainu need an article, you vote keep. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:07, 18 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually that is not correct. If an article is validly deleted, a different article on the same topic and under the same title can indeed be created, unless the article is protected in a deleted state, which typically only happens if there is a persistant attempt to recreate the article as it was prior to deletion.<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> 08:45, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Uh not quiite. <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> says (Criterion G4) <i>Reposted content that was deleted according to Wikipedia deletion policy.</i> Note it says <b>reposted content</b> not reposted <b>articles</b>. A new article with different content, but the same title as a previously deleted article, is not "reposted content". See also <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia_talk%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_Archive3_8151.html#reposted_content" title="Wikipedia talk:Criteria for speedy deletion/Archive3">Wikipedia_talk:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion/Archive3#reposted_content</a> where this is discussed a bit. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> 10:14, 18 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are cases in which that could be the case, for instance if I wrote an article called "Ainu people" that had little to nothing to do with the Ainu, but if the only issue is a POV complaint, then the content is going to be roughly the same, since both versions would about the Ainu. If this was deleted and someone wanted to start over they'd have to go through VfU, plain and simple. That's a long established practice. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 22:12, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>See <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> where criterion G4 says <i>A substantially identical copy, by any title, of an article that was deleted according to the deletion policy.

<li><b>Comment</b>. That being said, we should STRIKE Everyking's comments as misleading and prejudicial, for he gave a procedurally incorrect and perhaps dishonest reason to vote to "keep." It is clear that you CAN vote to delete and STILL have a future, better, less racist article on the Ainu People.

<ul>
<li>No you can't. We delete articles based on a judgment that they are unencyclopedic. You vote based on whether an article on the Ainu is encyclopedic. You mostly definitely <i>do not</i> vote based on a POV complaint you have, unless you feel the entire notion of having an article on a certain topic is POV. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 22:16, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, I don't feel strongly on the matter but a Google search of "Allan Boyd" antipoet returns 135 results. The majority of which are ads for poetry workshops and listings in magazines for his shows. I've found no mention of published works, but that might have been me. So what we have is a guy in the suburbs who wrote an internet opinion piece a year ago and now coordinates small workshops and performs as other nn poets do.

<p><b>Delete</b> Article about, as far as I can see, a pointless and non-existent game. The article doesn't assert that the game is played anywhere, there is no external links that could help verify its existence, and it just looks to be a figment of someone's imagination. Google, admittedly, has 851,000 hits for Polk game, but that's mainly due to the number of people named Polk. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 20:41, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not so! He has become a Legend within the University and has had several articles written on him in such eminent journals as "AT501" He is becoming well known throughout Scotland and should have an entry inase people want to find out more about the legend.
