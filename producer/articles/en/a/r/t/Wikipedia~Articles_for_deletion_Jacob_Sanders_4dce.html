<p>2005 British parliamentary candidate who came in 4th with 4.3% of the vote.

<li><b>Delete</b> unless evidence of stronger notability is provided. Losing candidates from major parties for a nation's highest office generally get enough detailed media coverage and general public attention to be notable. A fourth-place finisher from a minor party for an ordinary legislative seat, however, isn't encyclopedic unless there was some really major issue related to that candidate's involvement. No indication of that is in the article.

<li>Unlike Sanders, Kilroy was at one point a Labour MP, and appears to have been notable for more than just coming in fourth.

<li>Um hello? I'm saying 4.3% for a Green candidate makes him 'notable', since that's a criteria for some.

<li><b>Keep</b>. – mildly notable for his good share of the vote, but even so, I can't see any reason why standing in a parliamentary election does not justify an article. It's not that hard to do so, agreed, but then not that many people do it, and those that do often have other, interesting, attributes. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENaturenet_7833.html" title="User:Naturenet">Naturenet</a> 21:21, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. It's a lost cause, but I have to protest at this notabilizing of everybody who ever ran for public office. <i>Millions</i> of people do this <i>every year</i>. Most of them have fewer accomplishments than are listed on our typical vanity page created by a high school sophomore. It's absurd that we reject successful businesspeople as "self-advertisers" and people with some community stature as "vanity", but carefully list every idiot who got 100 people to sign their candidacy petition! ---<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 02:17, 14 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Running for parliament is not the same as running for a local council, so "millions of people" doesn't apply to this case. The concept of "notable" should not get in the way of "verifiable and important to users". If wikipedia is doing its job of explaining national politics, it needs to cover these <s>idiots</s> minor party candidates. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 06:40, 14 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Can I just point out an error in Isaac R's comment? It's not 100 signatures needed to run for UK Parliament. It's ten. Oh, and 500 quid for the deposit. Oh, and you can't be bankrupt, a judge, a bishop, a peer or in the army. That's about it really. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 10:42, 14 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sanders, however, also received the Green Party nomination for his office, if I understand the facts. Getting that nomination presumably took more than 10 signatures. This is still borderline notable IMO, but the family connection with a quite notable USA politician makes this entry interesting (should be expanded though). The fact politics "runs in the family" and so on. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 19:21, 2005 May 14 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who said anything about local elections? There are about a hundred national legislatures on this planet, with a collective membership of maybe 20,000. I guess I was overestimating when I said that millions run for these 20,000 seats every year, but it's gotta be in the high six figures. Is every single one of these people notable? Or are British politicians more notable than others? ---<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 17:41, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This wasn't a particularly good result even for a minor party candidate. Do we include every candidate at a UK general election in recent years? This must be thousands of people. If you vote to keep this, you are setting a very problematic precedent. We would have to include candidates for legislatures in other important countries. You were warned!

<dd>WP is not paper, but it not a general knowledge base either. The "not paper" argument says we draw our boundaries very broadly -- but we do draw them.

<dd>I have now read these linked articles, and I stand by my vote to <b>delete</b>. There are over 600 seats in the UK House of Commons, an article for every MP in recent years (which I am prepared to go along with) already takes us into 4 figures. An article for every candidate, or even every one from the dozen or so semi-serious parties with significant representation in elected authorities must take us into 5 figures. And then you have the issue of candidates from other countries... <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 21:00, 2005 May 14 (UTC)

For example, <a href="http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge05/candidates.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge05/candidates.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> estimates 3,521 candidates for the 2005 general election.
