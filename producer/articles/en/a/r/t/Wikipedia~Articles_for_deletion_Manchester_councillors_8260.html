<li><b>Keep</b> the fact that they have been elected to public office says they are noteworthy. Simon Ashley is the leader of the Liberal Democrat group on Manchester City Council. If we are going to delete all these articles, why not delete all Councillors entirely - such as <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Boothroyd_079b.html" title="David Boothroyd">David Boothroyd</a>. I know his article is comprehensive showing his political career to date, but surely that started as a stub....</li>

<ul>
<li>If you are arguing that anyone elected to public office anywhere is notable, then I disagree. Do you really think an article on every member of Abbots Langley Parish Council (to take one at randon) would be useful? Or perhaps I should create a page for Henry Luttman-Johnson, elected unopposed to represent Hamlet of Knightsbridge Ward on Westminster City Council on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_1.html" title="November 1">November 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>, died on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_20.html" title="November 20">November 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>. Councillors are not notable in themselves but they are notable if there are other reasons.

<li>Can I enquire how many people the Toronto City Councillors represent? (clue: 55,000) San Francisco's Supervisors have districts as large as UK Parliamentary constituencies. Would it surprise you to know that these Manchester City Councillors represent an electorate of about 3,000 each? <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 22:25, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>That may be so, but the councillors do not apportion a third of the electorate each, the councillors still represent all 10,000 or so electors in the ward!!!</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>That is a sophist's argument. In my experience most councillors in three-member wards do apportion them out. While all three may speak collectively for the ward, it is normal in measuring the level of representation to take the number of electors per councillor and not number of electors per ward.

<li>What rot this person is spouting - being a councillor in a three-member ward I cannot not represesent someone who may have been "allotted" to another ward colleague. We represent all electors in the ward. The practice of allotting a third each might operate in Westminster, but no-where else to my knowledge. Also what happens where councillors in a ward of differing political parties? Who decides who represents which third is those circumstances? Utter rot to suppose that wards are divided by three.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I'm gonna go for delete on this one. How many local councillors can you name? I'm not sure about systems in other countries, but in the UK, local councillors just do menial bureaucratic tasks. They do have influence on the local area, and have some local notability, but it's on a too small scale. When local council elections take place, the news channels never look at specific election battles, or even bother naming any individual candidates. It's just used as a popularity poll for the major parties, and can help people guess the outcome of a general election, when people vote for MPs, actual notable people. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 02:47, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Having too much time on my hands I have looked up the election results<a href="http://www.manchester.gov.uk/elections/types/local/2004.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.manchester.gov.uk/elections/types/local/2004.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Not only do the wards have only 10,000 voters on average but the turnout in 2004 was about 30%. Each voter has 3 votes i.e. the total number of votes in each ward was ~9,000. but as far as I can tell none of these councillors got more than 2000 votes. Obviously if you have enough friends and relatives (about 500 will do) and join a voting block in Manchester you can become a councillor. These stubs are only to increase the notoriety of nn officials.--<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorturology_8c86.html" title="User:Porturology">Porturology</a> 06:06, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>, there may be some notables in the list, it is wrong to delete everyone at the same time.

<li><b>Just a thought.</b> If you are going to publish details about us for an encyclopedia online, then perhaps the first thing you should do is contact us to ask us to funish you with information you are interested in publishing. The entry about me (for example) would appear to have been taken directly from a summary list that was created for the Manchester Liberal Democrats website, and certainly does not cover my political career, nor does it give any mention of my personal philosophies and/or achievements. The difficulty you would appear to be having here is that some person has, unbeknowned to me (and certainly at least one other councillor who drew my attention to this site) taken copyrighted material out of context and posted it here, leaving you in a most unnecessary quandry as to what to do with it. I believe that if you are looking to produce an online encyclopedia that perhaps the most productive approach would be to create a basic summary of the local work of the three parties elected to local government in Manchester - 57 Labour, 38 Lib Dem, and 1 Green. This could then be linked to the appropriate local Government and local party websites for further information. Our local party website, just for the record, is WWW.manchester-libdems.org.uk. Sorry about the poor editing btw, couldn't quite work it out. Iain Donaldson</li>
<li><b>Question</b> - is this a case that if one goes, the whole lot have to go? Certainly the article on Iain Donaldson cannot be classed as a stub now, and I would vote that his entry stays.<a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhyddfrydol_22ef.html" title="User:Rhyddfrydol">Rhyddfrydol</a> 20:10, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
