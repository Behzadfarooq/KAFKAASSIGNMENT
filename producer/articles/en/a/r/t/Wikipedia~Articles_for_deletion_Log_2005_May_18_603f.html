<li>Gazpacho's edit flagged it for VfD, the next edit removed the VfD notice, Ravenhull subsequently flagged it for speedy, and Golbez then deleted it. Unless someone asks here or on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_ecb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion">Wikipedia:votes for undeletion</a> for it to be undeleted, I'm not inclined to, as it's in many ways the article's creator who has brought this upon themselves, and I don't think this article is all that important in itself. But it's a clear breach of speedy delete policy IMO. No vote. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 10:13, 18 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You do have a point, but since the article wouldn't survive VfD anyway I don't really want to drag it through VfU mechanics. But if it happens more than once, we should bring it up with the deletor. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 11:04, May 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: Andrewa's right. For my part, I've seen a lot of CSD's given as "vanity." Vanity isn't a speedy criterion. I haven't always (to my shame) gone to the nominating author and explained this, but folks need to know that things that violate the deletion policy don't usually qualify as speedies. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:22, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Right, I know... I was just apprehensive given the fact that the status of the original deletion was still being debated to some degree here. Should we just wait until this deletion passes normally after the week, and delete then? --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DropDeadGorgias</a> <a href="../../../d/r/o/User_talk%7EDropDeadGorgias_66ce.html" title="User talk:DropDeadGorgias">(talk)</a> 22:18, May 18, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> both, but wait until the VfD period expires before deleting or redeleting either. The VfD notice on Invisible existence now points to this discussion; I mightn't have done it quite that way but it can work. It only becomes a CSD as recreated material after a <b>valid</b> deletion, and we haven't had that yet. I'm still not proposing to undelete Invisible Existence, but I couldn't object to it happening even without going through VfU, as the deletion was not according to the proper process. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_MWOT_5f31.html" title="User:Andrewa/MWOT">MWOT</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 01:58, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Appropriate content for <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burger_King_5522.html" title="Burger King">Burger King</a>. Inappropriate content for a standalone article.

Start an "Other countries" section in <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burger_King_5522.html" title="Burger King">Burger King</a>, which can be expanded to discuss its operations in the other 55 countries in detail, just as its operations in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> are <i>already</i> discussed in detail in that article, and <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:25, 2005 May 19 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Not only are those lyrics copied all over the place, I'm pretty sure Bobby would only feel complimented by seeing the lyrics posted here; Let's point him to this page! Also, any fool with decent ears can quote them after hearing them, what is the harm in writing them (or part of them) down for once? I really don't see what the fuss is about. It is exactly by posting them here how you would make them 'belong' to those who wrote them. <a href="http://jult.net/txt/extern/westendgirls.htm" class="external text" title="http://jult.net/txt/extern/westendgirls.htm" rel="nofollow">West End Girls</a> &lt;- there, was that so hard?&#160;;-) JuliusThyssen 12:50, 20 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If a) Mr. Orlando is the sole owner of the copyright to the lyrics and b) can verifiably express his permission to post the lyrics on a Wikimedia project, then the lyrics <i>might</i> be appropriate for Wikisource (but not Wikipedia). Incidentally, not "any fool" can discern all of the lyrics in <i>West End Girls</i>. It wasn't until I read the article that I found out that what comes after <i>In a West End town</i> is <i>a dead end world</i> and not something completely different. And my ears are fine, thank you. <tt>:-)</tt><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 20:19, May 20, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So why again is the West End Girls page taken offline? Again, if I can post these lyrics the way I just did, anyone can, and Wikisource can too. I won't be sued for it. Wanna bet on it? By the way, I <i>did</i> hear what they were saying there in that track (seems my ears are better than yours then). The text <a href="http://jult.net/txt/extern/westendgirls.htm" class="external text" title="http://jult.net/txt/extern/westendgirls.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> is not the same as that of the page on wikipedia.195.64.95.116
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_8c2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright">Wikipedia:Copyright</a> explains it all. "We won't get sued" is a terribly naïve attitude. Websites that have posted lyrics in the past have faced litigation; there's no reason to take the chance that Wikipedia <i>won't</i>.

<li>I don't think Alexa understands the internet very well. First of all, post a link to my page on West End Girls/Temp and you're done. Mine will still be considered "unnoticed", the viewer will notice, but Alexa won't, everybody happy. I have a great deal of respect for Orlando, and he knows that he should have thought of keeping his writing for and to himself before he made sure it would be yelled in my ears. If I hear something, I will post it on my site if I damn well please. They (Pet Shop Boys) should have kept their mouths shut if they didn't want that to happen. I still don't see what this has to do with copyrights, since I'm not copying anything, I'm reporting what I heard in free air. JuliusThyssen 10:50, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Let me explain: We can use lyrics under fair use, provided that they're there for educational purposes only. This is how the other lyrics sites get away with it.

<li><b>Delete</b> as copyvio, but without prejudice as to whether a legitimate article about the song may be recreated. Though I have been unable to find any case law directly on point, I don't buy the fair use argument because the copying is too substantial and the argument for academic use too tenuous. At best it's right on the outer edge of fair use, and we should err on the side of caution because we really don't gain very much from being a lyrics depository. Re: "everyone else is doing it," that's hardly the best argument, particularly if you really look at the notices of some of these lyrics websites, they seem to be trying to shield themselves from contributory infringement claims by characterizing themselves as a mere venue for users to post lyrics without their intervention or supervision.

<p>I originally speedied this, considering it nonsense, until someone left a comment on my talk page suggesting that it was a valid term of some kind. So I restored it. Then <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevelCheck_4bca.html" title="User:LevelCheck">User:LevelCheck</a> tagged it for speedy deletion again as a restoration of properly deleted content, and it was again deleted by someone else on that basis.

<li>Hypothetical and highly unlikely, by the article.

<li>Delete: I prefer pannaphobia, the fear that you're someone's beast of burden. I don't think a Wiktionary move is appropriate, because what we're looking at is a dictdef, yes, but a coincidentally created mistake by a bunch of folks. There's no stable or consistent definition, so it's not really one word. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:27, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No need for copying alternative spellings notes. And <i>certainly</i> don't add to the list there. (We've had this discussion about keeping the list trimmed and free of non-words before. See <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a>'s comments at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Afrophobia_c5fb.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Afrophobia">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Afrophobia</a>.) Just <b>Redirect</b> (as a mis-spelling) if you keep this at all. There's a perfectly good dictionary right next door. It will tell you about <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/panphobia" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:panphobia">panphobia</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/panophobia" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:panophobia">panophobia</a>, and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pantophobia" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:pantophobia">pantophobia</a>, and how they relate to one another. I know this because I wrote the articles. (Editing Greek text is difficult for technical reasons, which is why I couldn't complete the etymologies.) It will even tell you how they are commonly confused. And the reason that Wiktionary doesn't have "panaphobia" is simple: There's no such word.

<dd>Background: Notpron was inspired by an earlier site, [http:/thisisnotporn.com/ thisisnotporn]. I have (tried to) play both and I can attest that they are not pornographic. They are multimedia puzzles. It's also my understanding that MIT has similar, but larger-scale games each year. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 04:34, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Actually, I created the page, and it's not an ad for a porn site - click on the link, it's a really neat riddle game that's quite popular right now. Google "not pron" and you'll see it. Also, check out <a href="http://www.memepool.com" class="external text" title="http://www.memepool.com" rel="nofollow">memepool</a> - it's on the top of their list right now. --<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommertron_03d9.html" title="User:Tommertron">Tommertron</a> 04:06, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, it's not pornography. But it's not really an encyclopedia article either. I don't see any way to <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiably</a> expand past the current sub-stub. The parent site, deathball.net, has an <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=1y&amp;size=medium&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=t&amp;url=deathball.net/notpron/#top" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=1y&amp;size=medium&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=t&amp;url=deathball.net/notpron/#top" rel="nofollow">erratic Alexa ranking</a> and I can't find anything independent on the puzzle itself. <b>Delete</b> but without prejudice against re-creation if/when this truly becomes a verifiable web-phenomenon. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 04:29, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sorry, Tommertron, for mistaking it for a porn site. However, I tend to agree with Rossami, that it remains not notable. Please convince me that I'm wrong about that, too.&#160;:) <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerrace4_4860.html" title="User:Terrace4">Terrace4</a> 04:33, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> this advert, but if there are more URL-guessing games besides notpr0n and the earlier thisisnotporn.com, then that could be a subject for an article, although not just a list of exlinks. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 05:09, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

<p>I think the Merge is a good idea, but I've been racking my brain to figure out a common name for these types of games, that people might actually look up. What do you think, "URL Guessing Games"?

<li><b>Delete</b>: Practically an infinite variety of different chemical compounds can be made by putting some extra groups on some skeleton structure, but the majority of them will not be worthy of an article in a general all-around encyclopedia like Wikipedia.

The abstracts of neither one mentions any use, application, or general relevance. I conclude the compound is not notable.

<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>This thread was made more difficult than normal to sort out by the movement of comments and the multiplication of relevant discussions on several different talk pages. I think I finally found all the relevant facts and comments. Taken together:</p>
<p>I count 12 clear "delete" votes in this discussion, 7 "keep as is" votes (but four of them have to be discounted as anonymous or very new users), 2 explicit "keep only if rewritten", 1 "abstain" and 1 that was too ambiguous to call. In addition, 4 users took the time to separately endorse the "Sandbox" version.</p>
<p>My own investigation is confirming the original allegation that the theory remains "original research" at this time. It has not met Wikipedia's standard of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verified</a> external sourcing. A great number of web-based links were provided and were dutifully researched by several Wikipedians. The results were ambiguous at best. Two of the people who reviewed the links concluded that they actually worked against the author's claims.</p>
<p>The original author has already expressed his dissatisfaction with the Sandbox version and has created a Sandbox2 version. This makes it seem less likely that it will be possible to keep a balanced and neutral article on this topic. My conclusion here is tempered by the author's behavior during this discussion. While diligent in the defense of his article, he has remained polite and fact-based. The dispute is only an interpretation of Wikipedia policy on the standards for inclusion of an article topic.</p>
<p>I am going to call this one as a "delete" as original research. The article in full probably should not be re-created until it the theory has been independently published in accordance with the "no original research" guidelines or until it has reached a level of notoriety equivalent to some of the other pseudo-science theories mentioned below.</p>
<p>After deletion, I am going to move the sandbox version to the main article space. Noting the controversy, however, I am going to immediately tag it as a procedural nomination to VfD so that a separate discussion and decision can be made on that version. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 23:06, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's the problem - I _haven't_ been able to reproduce the list of references.

<dd>Update - searching for "ray tomes" and "cycles" gives mostly RT's work, but a handful of other references to it. <a href="http://www.spaceandmotion.com/Physics-Cycles-Harmonics-Universe.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.spaceandmotion.com/Physics-Cycles-Harmonics-Universe.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spaceandmotion.com/Physics-Cycles-Harmonics-Universe.htm</a> seems to be a similar write-up by a different author that cites Mr. Tomes' work. Other references I've dug up so far are mostly newsgroup posts and the like. So, still not looking Notable. I'm trying to prod the vocal supporters in the Talk:Harmonics Theory page into digging up the bona fide references they say exist and posting them here, but no response so far. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 19:03, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, the phrase occurs most commonly for my theory, but also quite commonly for general theory of harmonics of a regular type, and also some for an astrological meaning (which has an "indigo ray" with it - that is not this Ray!). I fail to see how you can criticise a lack of mathematics when I put a simple program to show the exact logic of the calculation.

<li>There is no connection with Bruce Cathie, but he does live in the same city&#160;:-) Although his UFO grid does have harmonic 2880 around the earth, which is a strong harmonic in harmonics theory. However that side of harmonics theory is not in dispute (I think) as it has been found by PRF Brown to be a known mathematical equation. But Cathie uses the word "harmonic" to sometimes mean a numerological one, whereas my meaning is always mathematical/musical/physical. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 04:19, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The phrase "original research" in this context refers to untested theories; data, statements, concepts and ideas that have not been published in a reputable publication;' The people that are putting this have been badly informed by Gazpacho. He makes a statement that is totally untrue without first checking the facts. I think that all these votes (based on original research) should be discounted. I have published papers on harmonics theory with the Foundations for the Study of Cycles conference proceedings and from a conference proceedings run jointly with University (Nevada?) and Apeiron journal. These are all reputable organisations. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 03:19, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Dcfleck, I request that you look at Harmonics Theory/Sandbox2 which has incorporated a lot more wikifying and also has additional references etc. The emphasis has also been changed to show that the theory arose out of cycles studies. Unfortunately there are no peer-review journals in cycles studies, so FSC proceedings and cycles magazine are the best available. The FSC was the most reputable organisation in the field. As far as it relates to physics and cosmology the problems of new ideas in peer-review journals has been raised by a nobel prizewinner, Josephson, as being almost insurmounrable. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 02:10, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Keep: No theory is ever complete. The expectations of too many is that theories need somehow to be legit before they should have space in the public domain. Nothing could be further from the truth. Peer review journals have been proven to not perform in the publics interest. They along with their organizations get caught in the rightness of their dogma and let nothing challenging in. It takes a revolution to displace them. In the meantime it takes spaces like this to communicate ideas toward individuals of different minds to come up with concepts to replace wholesale the prison yards of dogma. It is unlikely that any single subject will make the difference. But what will make the difference is someone that just happens to wander inside this space and with a few other ideas makes a whole new idea of the ages. That will not happen if you take that opportunity away from them. Doing so is almost always a bad idea. Why take the chance? James Conway May 29 2005.</p>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. I can imagine a lot of people turning to Wikipedia for these lists. I at least feel that "Wikipedia is not a memorial" refers to obituaries of people who were not particularily notable and whos' deaths are not notable. Although most people on this list are not notable except for having perished in the 9/11 attacks, their deaths are. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 11:15, 18 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's sad when people die, especially as the result of violence, but most individuals who perished in those attacks are not more notable than people who die of violence every day. If these sorts of causualty lists are to be in WP, then we need lists of victims of every such tragedy in WP. I think this is not a good idea. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 15:05, 18 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>September 11 was not just any tragedy. Nevertheless, I have read the comments of Geogre and MacGyverMagic. I think that these lists belonged in some sort of wiki, and if they're in WikiMemorial that is okay <i>as long as we have an external link to those lists in the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11_terrorist_attacks.html" title="September 11 terrorist attacks">September 11 terrorist attacks</a> article on WIkipedia.</i> Alright: <b>merge</b> per MacGyverMagic's proposal. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 06:28, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: Wikipedia <b>already has the lists</b> in Wikimemorial. That's why we don't recreate this, why we don't need mass lists. This is duplicate material.

<li><b>Delete</b> The definition of what a superstar is tends to be pretty hazy, especially if, as the article suggests, superstars specific to one country or area are to be included as well.

<li>I apologize for not doing the search before voting, but I'm fairly sure that the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Exodus_bed1.html" title="Book of Exodus">Book of Exodus</a> is on Wikisource. Consequently, that particular verse is on Wikisource, so <b>delete.</b> However, if I am wrong and Wikisource doesn't yet have the whole Bible (several KJV Bibles are already flat coded and out there as public domain), then, really, this is a thing Wikisource should address. In either case, it's not appropriate to have an article that's a PD quote, nor for the article on Exodus to be picking verses hither and thither (and yon). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:54, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

There is "encyclopedic" information and history on the name, so I don't think it should simply be thrown away.

<li>The list of people with the surname Yoder that has begun to grow qualifies the article as genealogy. And <i>very little</i> of the content of this article is encyclopaedic. How to pronounce the word "Yoder" isn't encyclopaedic, for example. There's a perfectly good dictionary right beside the encyclopedia, that has holds written (and, in some cases where Wiktionarians have been really enthusiastic and uploaded sound files, spoken) information on the pronunciations of words. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:19, 2005 May 19 (UTC)

<li><i>"The list of people with the surname Yoder that has begun to grow qualifies the article as genealogy"</i> - so we should get rid of all the disambig lists of people sharing the same last name, because that's genealogy? Genealogy is <u>not</u> the study of people sharing a last name, but of the lines of ancestry and descent within a single family (see, e.g. <a href="../../../d/u/k/Dukes_of_Swabia_family_tree_15a0.html" title="Dukes of Swabia family tree">Dukes of Swabia family tree</a>). This article is clearly <i>not</i> that. It seems that a lot of people here are a) confusing geneology with etymology, and b) presuming that etymology is not a legitimate part of an article. Shall we scour wikipedia for articles that describe the origin of the word in question - such as <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Thames_9174.html" title="River Thames">River Thames</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>, and <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantheism.html" title="Pantheism">Pantheism</a>, and eliminate those descriptions as unencyclopedic? --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: green" color="#FFC000">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="blue"><b>talk</b></font></sup></a> 15:44, 2005 May 19 (UTC)

<li>Whoa, let's take a step back here! What we're really discussing is whether the information in this article should a. be discarded, b. maintained in its current place, c. moved to somewhere else in wikipedia (presumably the Yoder article) or d. moved to somewhere else in wiki* projects (presumably Wiktionary). Consensus seems to be moving toward c. around here, and that's fine with me. What I really *don't* want is a., and I also don't think d. is appropriate, considering this isn't a "word" in the English language, with a definition, etc. An encyclopedia really does seem like the most appropriate place for it. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenmoss_cfa1.html" title="User:Greenmoss">Greenmoss</a> 16:02, 21 May 2005</li>

<li>No need for Wiktionary now. A shiny new <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Yoder" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Yoder">Wiktionary:Yoder</a> article now exists, written from scratch. I note that some misguided editors are copying information that is already in <a href="../../../y/o/d/Yoder.html" title="Yoder">Yoder</a> into this article, in particular disambiguation information for places named "Yoder". Aside from the fact that information on place names doesn't belong in an article that purports to be on a surname, <i>the disambiguation is already at <a href="../../../y/o/d/Yoder.html" title="Yoder">Yoder</a></i>. Trying to bolster this article by duplicating the disambiguation article is just plain silly. We also appear to be growing a list of people with the family name Yoder, but who don't have encyclopaedia articles (or even redlinks from other articles). That way lies <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">a genealogy database</a>. The only content to merge into <a href="../../../y/o/d/Yoder.html" title="Yoder">Yoder</a> is the third paragraph, <i>the only actual encyclopaedic content of the whole article</i> (apart from the <i>original</i> family name disambiguation), on the demographics of people named Yoder, which fits quite snugly into a "people with the family name Yoder" section of the name disambiguation article at <a href="../../../y/o/d/Yoder.html" title="Yoder">Yoder</a>.

The disambig is valid, and there's no reason on earth to exclude a few lines of etymology from it, especially where they might be useful to a person searching for information on their name (both in terms of what it means and in terms of who shares it). As an example, I recently did something similar for my own surname, 2412. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: green" color="#FFC000">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="blue"><b>talk</b></font></sup></a> 05:24, 2005 May 21 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. Etymologies and pronunciations of (attested) proper nouns go in Wiktionary. (And, conversely, Wiktionary is not an encyclopaedia.) This one would go in <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Milnes" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Milnes">Wiktionary:Milnes</a>. See <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Hastings" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Hastings">Wiktionary:Hastings</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Churchward" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Churchward">Wiktionary:Churchward</a>, and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Jock" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Jock">Wiktionary:Jock</a> for existing examples of how this works. Articles about names, i.e. <i>about words</i>, should go in Wiktionary, whilst articles about people/concepts/things/events/places by those names should go in Wikipedia. Compare <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darlington_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Darlington (disambiguation)">Darlington (disambiguation)</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Darlington" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Darlington">Wiktionary:Darlington</a>, for example (or indeed <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hastings_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Hastings (disambiguation)">Hastings (disambiguation)</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Hastings" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Hastings">Wiktionary:Hastings</a>). Once the etymology, pronunciation, and other dictionary article content has been moved to Wiktionary, there's scope for a name disambiguation article here. Whilst there may not be concepts, places, or things, there are certainly people to be disambiguated. I find at least two encyclopaedia articles for people with the family name <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milnes.html" title="Milnes">Milnes</a> (<a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherrill_Milnes_8f9c.html" title="Sherrill Milnes">Sherrill Milnes</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Monckton_Milnes%2C_1st_Baron_Houghton_8d65.html" title="Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton">Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton</a>, possibly <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Crewe-Milnes%2C_1st_Marquess_of_Crewe_1948.html" title="Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe">Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe</a>, and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Shore_Milnes_df3a.html" title="Robert Shore Milnes">Robert Shore Milnes</a>) . My only problem with this article is its lack of cited sources, and the fact that the original author basically cited himself, meaning that it might be better to start from scratch at Wiktionary than <b>transwiki</b> the article.

<li>I agree that <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milnes.html" title="Milnes">Milnes</a> isn't a genealogy page, and I agree that etymologies can be useful parts of encyclopedia articles, but <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milnes.html" title="Milnes">Milnes</a> as it stands is basically a dicdef. Being a name, there's no meaning to be assigned, but there's an (unsourced and highly speculative sounding) etymology, a vague pronunciation guide, and a paragraph about coats of arms that doesn't even show us any of the three coats of arms associated with the Milnes family but merely warns us not to trust everything we see. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub>comhrá</sub></a> 06:39, 20 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. This project is less than a <i>week</i> old according to the history, but Radiant!'s note on the Talk page is from May 11, far older than the project itself, so I'm quite confused as to what's going on. Nonetheless, if that date discrepancy is just a glitch, then it skirts the boundaries of bad faith to nominate this for deletion at this point.

<li>I'm accusing you of a bad faith nomination. If the VFD is withdrawn at this point, that would indicate your good faith, because as you pointed out the new project is very different from the old one. Also, "why would there be conflict between two groups of people improving templates" .. come on, Radiant! give me a break. The remits are the same by and large (not identical but undoubtedly overlapping); as both of you know of the standardisation page and I can only assume that the WikiProject was "re"created and perhaps in the first place created as a formalization of the stnadaridisation work and your nominating for deletion indicates that you want nothing of WikiProject involved. So, demonstrate your good faith and withdraw the nomination. <a href="../../../c/e/y/User%7ECeyockey_fb55.html" title="User:Ceyockey">Courtland</a> July 4, 2005 21:38 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Something is VERY weird in the article history. I know that it was created in February or March of 2005, by <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">User:Stevertigo</a>. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><font color="#F660AB">∅</font></a> 4 July 2005 19:23 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Okay, here's what's going on... it was created on May 2nd by Stevertigo. On May 11th I asked on the talk page what it was about. Then on May 18th I nominated it for deletion (since I had gotten no answer from the note). Then on July 1st, Stevertigo deleted the project, possibly as a result of this VFD. Then on July 1st, Blankverse created an entirely new project, which, needless to say, is very different from the old one. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> July 4, 2005 20:58 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My guess is that I was editing the page at the same time that Stevertigo deleted the page, so when I thought that I was just saving my edits, I was actually creating a new version of the same article. Now the only thing that I wonder about is how this VFD fell through the cracks and the page never got deleted. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><font color="#F660AB">∅</font></a> 4 July 2005 21:21 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reason that it fell through the cracks was that a formatting error on the May 18th VFD log page made it appear that every VFD article for that day was closed, when in fact that was not the case. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 4 July 2005 22:13 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for the advice. I think I've already found it, though: verifiable. You see, when something exists for a day, it isn't really stable enough to be discussed. The purpose of encyclopedias is contextualizing of information, not announcing neato things. Oh, and advertising. That's another deletion guideline violation.

<li>It is hosted here. That is clear. You founded it here. You claim to have created the freeonlineuniversity.org web but while that domain name is taken, there is no serving host. Thus, at this moment in time, you are hosting the project on Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not a hosting service. Sorry. Even if this 'university' passed such a test (which it doesn't), then the article still fails on a number of points including notability and verifiability, both of which it clearly and utterly fails, your arguments not withstanding. Regardless of my opinion or yours, this article is currently being voted to be deleted, and it is highly unlikely it will pass muster. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 17:41, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I note that there is a serving host for the domain name now (side note: the page is badly formatted HTML). On the single page on that site it says, "Accepting teachers in the Fall, 2005.". So, this 'university' has no teachers (other than you?). We have a multitude of high schools and primary schools that are not on Wikipedia because of a lack of notability, and they <i>have</i> teachers, in fact lots of them. Also the Wikipedia entry here for this 'university' has considerably more information than the domain name site.

<li><s><b>Keep</b>. Msh210, you listed the article one minute after it was created. I appreciate your vigilant observation of the new pages folder, but I encourage you to show patience before tagging articles for deletion. I don't really feel like saying that youre giving Ponyboy a chance to expand it is fair, it's more like youre trying to push him into expanding it, which he was already doing. I understand that it's hard to know based on a first look at a new article whether or not the editor will return, or intends to expand it, and oftentimes they do not. I guess it's just something to think about. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">EvilPhoenix</a> 05:05, May 19, 2005 (UTC)</s></li>
