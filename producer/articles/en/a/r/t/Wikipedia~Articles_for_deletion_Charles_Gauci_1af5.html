<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Maltesedog you really show how silly you are. If you go to the history books at the University you will find a number of books written by Dr Charles A Gauci.

<li>You have a strong interest in keeping articles concerning Maltese Nobility online, even though they are of no importance whatsoever. I look forward to the view of others concerning deletion of this article, whose encyclopeadic content is barerly none, since the article only contains figures and date.

<li>I do have a strong sense of the Nobility as if you refer to your deletion to the Maltese Nobility, there is an essence of recording history. Dr CA Gauci biobraphy does need to be cleaned up especially with those titles, but I dont agree his biography should be deleted at all.In future you should place a cleanup tag and note reasons for the clean up, then make communications with its author, and if its not to the satisfaction of Wikipedia, then proceed to deletion. I find this very unfair that you simply strike something rightaway to deletion when this biography was simply published only a week ago. Be fair and give others a chance. .<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">Tancarville</a> 08.49 16th September 2005 (EST)

<li>Given the size of Malta and the number of Maltese nobles, having an article for every Maltese noble in Wikipedia would be like having an article for every city councilman for every medium size city in the world, and the Maltese nobles don't even have any real power. None of the accomplishments listed in any of the links provided above strike me as notable. At most, authoring a directory about Maltese nobles merits linking to his website from an article about the Maltese nobility and including his name in the description of the link. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 05:07, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> My my my, Maltese Dog, you are such an important fellow! Whether you keep me on Wikipedia or not is of no real consequence; for your information, I am a Senior Consultant in chronic pain management based in London with two textbooks to my name (the latest is being translated into Spanish, Korean &amp; Japanese), I am a Member of the Board of Directors of the World Institute of Pain, a member of the Board of Examiners for the FIPP Diploma, an author of many medical papers, an international lecturer on chronic pain (Europe, Asia, USA &amp; South America) and also happen to be a visiting consultant in Pain Management to St. Luk'es Hospital in Malta. Have written several books on Maltese Genealogy and Heraldry which have become the standard reference works. I'm sure you can think of many other people who have achieved more than me; maybe one day you will too; until that time, learn some manners, this will serve you well when you graduate.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_CA_Gauci_MD_1f78.html" title="User:Dr CA Gauci MD">Dr CA Gauci MD</a>...(ps I'm not the magician!)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Holding a non-exclusive title of nobility from an extinct state that possesse no de jure power deriving from that title is not enough to warrant being notable and I don't see anything other than that in this lengthy article that is a claim to notability. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 11:39, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Maltesedog you should really take note of comments made in the deletion of the Maltese Nobility. You are unjust with your comments and most importantly if you even look at the who's who in Malta you will find me there.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> (Hopefully my last) I see three claims to notability that Dr. Gauci and his supporters are making</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>He is a Maltese noble. Problem: Simply having a noble title is not sufficient to make someone notable.</li>
<li>He is the leading expert on Maltese nobles. Problem: The number of people interested in Maltese nobles (at least in an English encyclopedia) is almost certainly below the 5000 person threshold to make that notable enough for Wikipedia. Probably would be enough to justify an article on the <a href="../../../../mt/p/a/%C4%A1/Pa%C4%A1na_prin%C4%8Bipali.html" class="extiw" title="mt:PaÄ¡na_prinÄ‹ipali">Maltese Wiktionary</a>, but there doesn't seem to be one there. (Which I readilly admit doesn't mean much since there are less than 1,000 articles on the Maltese Wiktionary, but perhaps if the gallant defenders of Maltese nobility would make an effort there would more articles there.)</li>
<li>He is a notable practioner in pain management. Problem: While I can't speak of his second textbook, I can find a great deal more information on the co-author of the first J.R. Wedley (who happens to have first billing on that textbook by the way) than I can on the Dr. Gauci. Unfortunately for Dr. Gauci, what I can find on him indicates that he is not any more notable than an average professor. Now if Dr. Gauci has developed a bold new technique in pain management that has become a standard approach in that field, that would certainly make him notable, but it's not in the article and I haven't found any indication that he has.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>In short, I stand by earlier view of this article, that it is a non-notable vanity article and should therefore be deleted. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 14:43, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi ,</p>
<p>I was searching the site when I came across this articly, and I must say I was quite impressed by it.</p>
<p>How come that this Lt. Colonel Dr Charles A. Gauci, a totally irrelevant person to Malta is featured here? I find it to be a very misleading article as readers who are not familiar with Malta are inevitably induced into believing that he is somehow to be considered important, whilst in fact he can be considered anonymous!</p>
<p>I don't think that this person, whoever he is [with due respect], should be mentioned here, and thus this article should be removed.</p>
<p>Maria P.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi there Maria., you failed to provide Facts to why Dr Charles Gauci shouldnt be listed here. Charles does come from a very historical and influence Maltese family. His sister (Mrs Zammit Cordina)only just received the Highest Order in Australia for her work in Malta and Charles will soon receive one of the Highest orders by the Republic of Malta for his efforts to Heraldry and Genealogy. Please be sutle and respect those who have achieved. This gentleman does deserve the honour of being listed on wikipedia. If not then we might as well delete all Maltese biographies including former Primeministers. Maria you also failed to provide a User name and also proof of membership. On that account your words are meaningless. Maltesedog has always failed in his attempt to provide FACTS other then a reduction to Dr CA Gauci's biography. .<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">Tancarville</a> 07.00 17th September 2005 (EST)
<ul>
<li>That his sister may be notable, does not make him notable. That his familiy may be notable does not make him notable. That he may receive an award, may make him notable once he has received that award if the award is notable and that fact can be verified. The onus of demonstrating notability is on those claiming that he is notable as if he is notable, that fact should be easy to show. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 03:42, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Tancarville has created a bunch of troublesome articles on persons who are allegedly Maltese nobility. Against Wikipedia norms he signs the articles, and they are generally taken directly from web pages Tancarville authored. Original research, verifiability suspect, notability unclear. Finally, the article is a dreadful read. If you had been interested in Charles Gauci before, you won't be after trying to read this article. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 03:17, 17 September 2005 (UTC)

I don't know, but the same matter applies to whole list of articles listed in <a href="../../../m/a/l/Maltese_Nobility_baaf.html" title="Maltese Nobility">Maltese Nobility</a>.

<li>Thanks for your support Farmbrough., Dr Charles Gauci does have a legitimate noble title, though I do agree that his biography should be shorten. But I dont agree that it should be taken down. I am persistent with this as I am the author who placed this on wikipedia. Many thanks. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">Tancarville</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Caerwine said it all. Just because you're noble is not reason for retaining an article. Tancarville, you should understand the scope of wikipedia.
<ul>
<li>Just to be clear on my point of view, I feel that <i>modern</i> nobles, who have no political powers deriving from their status are not by default notable. Charles Gauci is just such a modern noble, and as such the fact that he is modern noble does not make him notable. It doesn't preclude him being notable on other grounds, but none of the other facts presented about him are sufficient to warrant him being called sufficiently notable to have an article of his own in a world-wide English-language comprehensive encyclopedia such as Wikipedia. A brief mention that he is the sole and current holder of a particular noble title would be appropriate in an article about that title, assuming he has such a title. The text of the article makes it sound like his brothers and sons (if any) also qualify to concurrently hold those titles that he does possess. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 18:24, 20 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree with Caerwine that noble Titles are not sufficient for someone to have a biography on wikipedia, though has any one read what Dr Gauci is, other then his noble connection?? He is one of the world specialist in Pain management. Does the annoying <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaltesedog_6843.html" title="User:Maltesedog">User:Maltesedog</a> understand this or is it as silly as the dog is? At the end of the day, common sense should prevail, not studipity because one has a disliking to those who were born with a silver soon. Please view Dr Gauci's biograpghy from the first two paragraphs and comment on that please. With respect Dr Gauci is connected to a title which I am also connected to <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vassallo-Paleologo_8013.html" title="Vassallo-Paleologo">Vassallo-Paleologo</a> which is extended to all descendants through the male and female lines. This does give those the right to style the title of Count or Countess. HM, Queen Paola of the Belgiums is also a descendant. Importantly, only a small faction really style themselves a title, as there are descendants all over the world and can run into the thousands of living descendants. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">Tancarville</a> 14.15, 21 September 2005 (EST)
<ul>
<li>I already addressed the other points raised as arguments for Dr. Gauci's notability in my comments of 14:43, 16 September 2005 and 17:51, 20 September 2005 and said why I found them lacking. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 09:54, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> I dont believe that wikipedia would let me place your name here, or you (maltesedog) would use that against me.

<li>Very mild intimidation - ignore it. Argue solely on the merits of the case. I'm interested in knowing more about these "founts of honour" - they seem worth documenting. Furthermore if titles are legitimate enough for Burkes Peerage, they should probably be on Wikipedia. If not, then there is a good chance we should document the various "founts" of these titles, in order to clarify for users their relative obscurity and unimportance. What, for example is a Hereditary Patrician of Rome &amp; Messina? Is it a title in an disetablished nobility? Or is it a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Shield_stamp_7688.html" title="Green Shield stamp">Green Shield stamp</a> title like some <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_manor.html" title="Lord of the manor">Lord of the manor</a> titles? Or is it a bunch of people who have found what they believe is a legitmate way to confer honours on each other? It appears that there are several categories of "Maltese noble". Firstly and secondly those whose title stemmed from the Maltese state/kingdom, living either before or after the titles were disestablished. Thirdly those whose titles are from some other court. The number recognised by the state as legitmate forms for "social use" seems small enough to document exhaustively, the last group is less certain, and may not be bounded, depending on the answers to other questions psed earlier. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich Farmbrough</a></i> 15:22, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>It's sad to see that a simple discussion and exchange of opinions has turned into a barrage of personal attacks of the base kind. You would expect a little good taste from such 'notable' and 'reputable' figures. All this 'mud-throwing' going on in here in an attempt to dirty the other side's reputation and make him seem less credible is really childish. Unfortunately, those in favour of the article seem to have picked on <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaltesedog_6843.html" title="User:Maltesedog">Maltesedog</a> and haven't really answered the comments of the other Wikipedians who are opposing the article. But I digress. The article, IMHO, should be deleted for all the reasons stated by <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a>. Being mentioned on a website or publishing a study doesn't make you notable; and neither having a title with no particular significance. We've got renowned specialists as well in Malta apart from Dr. Gauci. But are they notable? Of course not. Maybe if they took part in some ground-breaking research or came up with something original and innovative it would be a totally different story. Unfortunately Dr. Gauci doesn't seem to fall in any of these categories. --<a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERoderick_Mallia_21d7.html" title="User:Roderick Mallia">Roderick Mallia</a> 16:09, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Further reading of what Tancarville said above (see <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vassallo-Paleologo_8013.html" title="Vassallo-Paleologo">Vassallo-Paleologo</a>) this "style" of Count is not what we would normally consider nobility, as it passes to <b>all</b> descendents. So remaining claims to notability are that he is an expert in pain and nobility, which makes it marginal. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich Farmbrough</a></i> 16:28, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Totally disagree with your comments regarding Dr CA Gauci, and your a lecturer at RMA. Take pity as you dont know this distinguished man. In many eyes he is similiar to Dr Debono. <i><a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaltesecount_1d59.html" title="User:Maltesecount">Maltesecount</a></i> 19:28, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is getting rediculous. Both Maltesecount and Zepplin are brand new accounts with 3 edits each, to this AfD and their user pages. Wikipedia is not a democracy, so creating new accounts to flood this discussion will not affect the outcome as any competent administratior will discount both of these "votes" as per Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 20:59, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Aparently there is some foal play over here. Most interesting is the talk page of Maltesecount. "Born with a silver spoon my desires are to ensure the Maltese nobility are given a fair play in this wonderful world we live in.". The underlying meaning within this user is to prevent deletion of this article!! Admins, take notice of the three users which posted DELETION notification who are brand new entrants to wikipidea. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaltesedog_6843.html" title="User:Maltesedog">Maltesedog</a> 06:02, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Keep in mind that this is no election. This is just a discussion amongst Wikipedians where anyone can voice his/her opinions in a civil way. But we have all noticed (and I hope the admins have too) that there have been three users who are supposedly 'noble' who have registered and whose first (and possibly last) posts where made in this discussion. Coincidences don't happen that easily. Also please do keep in mind that we're all equal in here so forget the titles, whistles and bells you're accustomed to. Being of noble descent doesn't entitle you to any privileges like flooding a discussion (which in a way is vandalism). --<a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERoderick_Mallia_21d7.html" title="User:Roderick Mallia">Roderick Mallia</a> 07:00, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> This is absurd, Roderick Mallia. I now cant use my surname as a username? Lets remember this forum is about Dr CA Gauci MD, not about some of us that are of Noble Maltese descent.

<li><b>Comment</b> It seems that Roderick Mallia and Maltesedog have teamed up to fight for the deletion of Dr CA Gauci, but it doesnt seem ok for others to support it? Even if they logged on to support such works?? Wikipedia is about democracy, not socialism or communism, which you both seem to argue deletion!!!!. I really believe that Wikipedia should take a strong look at Maltesedog and Roderick Mallia as they have demostrated foul play in a constant arguing about everything other then the subject we are here to discuss, which is Charles Gauci. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">Tancarville</a> 18:23, 22 September 2005 (EST)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia is not a democracy as Caerwine said. You have to abide to the rules. Did you read the wikipedia rules on Biographies? Nobility does not fit under the category. Btw, I have not teamed up with anyone. I just suggested deletion of the article, and 7 persons voted for deletion. This is no democracy, however if you beieve there is democracy, there is always the majority rule. Any votes placed by the same users are invalid. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaltesedog_6843.html" title="User:Maltesedog">Maltesedog</a> 11:48, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Preziosi, I'm not implying that you can't use your name and surname or title; it doesn't really make a difference to me or to anyone else. I'm just saying that I find it strange that all of a sudden the Wiki is being overrun by Maltese nobility. And please stick to the facts and to what I stated instead of attacking me personally. Other people who share my opinion have stated this fact before me, and yet it seems like I'm the only one who said it. And even if there was only one person who said it, you still haven't got a right to attack him like that. Tancerville, I haven't teamed up with anybody. I'm just another Wikipedian who, while doing some interwiki work between the en.wiki and the mt.wiki (of which I'm an admin), happened to stumble on this discussion (if you can call it so) and decided to leave his two cents. I just stated an opinion, which I'm entitled to of course, as have all the people here. Why you're attacking me and Maltesedog personally when there are others who oppose the article is still beyond my comprehension. And what is all this talk about foul play? If I have committed any wrong in stating what I think, I honestly invite the admins to take actions. Tancerville, you seem to preach so much about democracy and yet you can't accept an honest opinion or point of view from anybody else if it differs from what you think. You really should get *at least* a crash-course in manners, etiquette and Wikipedia policy before posting anything else. --<a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERoderick_Mallia_21d7.html" title="User:Roderick Mallia">Roderick Mallia</a> 11:51, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
