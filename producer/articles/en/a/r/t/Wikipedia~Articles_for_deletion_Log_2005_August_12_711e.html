<li><b>Comment</b> I suppose you have to read past the first paragraph of the <a href="../../../v/a/p/Vapourware.html" title="Vapourware">Vapourware</a> article to get to the meaning of the claim. But I did look, and feel my claim is satisfied by sections of that article. What I really meant was, "when they release it, it might be notable." That hasn't happened yet.

<li>Don't know, seems notable/verifiable.

<li><b>Weak delete.</b> It's definitely not vaporware and is notable, but <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> stipulates that this article should only exist if "planning or preparation for the event is already in progress and the preparation itself merits encyclopedic inclusion," which I don't think it is. -<a href="../../../d/2E/_/User%7ED._Wu_3a90.html" title="User:D.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is yet another case where we give more slack to a computer/videogame related topic than we would to, say, a band. If this were an album being released by a band, everyone would vote delete because <i>Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</i>.

</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I think that even if it does actually get released in October, it won't be particularly notable. Thus far, they have only released a single screen-shot, so it reeks of vapor to me. Note that the links to the developer and both publishers are actually red links, not blue. (<a href="../../../d/r/e/Dreams.html" title="Dreams">Dreams</a> is not about a company named Dreams, <a href="../../../r/i/s/Rising_Star_6acd.html" title="Rising Star">Rising Star</a> is not about <a href="../../../r/i/s/Rising_Star_Games_45ab.html" title="Rising Star Games">Rising Star Games</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvelous.html" title="Marvelous">Marvelous</a> doesn't exist, though they meant the equally non-existent <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvelous_Interactive_1ca5.html" title="Marvelous Interactive">Marvelous Interactive</a>.) That is to say, the people who plan on making and releasing the game may not be notable <s><b>AND</b> <i>they</i> didn't even issue a press release to say they planned on any activity, just a screen shot.</s> --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 17:13, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, possibly missing <i>a</i> release date does not always define vaporware. Otherwise you might as well rename the term to "Nintendo" because they're constantly optimistic on their first release date. To <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">User:Habap</a>, the game was just recently unveiled as recently as <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_29.html" title="July 29">July 29</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> and at the time only released a single screenshot.

<li><b>Comment</b> there have been a few articles in this VfD page over the past month that I have thought salvagable. I rewrote them, or did some editting, and <i>Presto</i> most of the delete votes would change to keep and bobs your uncle, the articles are in! It happens all the time, there are some great editors in Wikipedia. Maybe you can just work on it yourself, move it back where you think it belongs and let the voters here know its been edited. I know I'd take a second (or third) look at it. I just thought the article as it was presented today was a crass attempt to make a point critical of people who might not necessarily deserve it.

<p>This does NOT meet the speedy deletion criteria. There are articles on wikipedia about very similar websites like myspace and livejournal. it is an unbiased, informative article on a popular website. It is in no way promoting or advertising for the site. Who would try to advertise on an encyclopedia anyway? The article was deleted initially because it was incomplete. It is now complete and should be reconsidered.</p>

<li>Sorry "Android" but your reasoning is a bit flawed. It's a legitimate annual event, and should be noteworthy if not of important interest, ESPECIALLY to east coast Wikipedia users, kayakers, and water sport enthusiasts.

From <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_metal.html" title="Death metal">Death metal</a>: <i>Death metal has, like most subgenres of heavy metal, proven notoriously difficult to define. Some fans and musicians have a firm concept of the genre, its categories and subcategories</i>. From <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_metal.html" title="Black metal">Black metal</a>: <i>Some black metal fans, musicians and critics use a strict definition of the genre, though others view this as limiting and view black metal more as an artistic movement than a sub-category of popular music</i>. Seems to me that, if there's no clear idea of what either death or black metal are, there can't possibly be any sort of meaningful definition for the combination of the two. Also, none of the wikilinked band articles indicate that any of the bands classify themselves as "blackened death metal" bands. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 17:09, August 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If you read further into the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_metal.html" title="Death metal">death metal</a> article (obviously, you didn't) you would notice the genre has subgenres, including blackened death metal. As for bands not "identifying themselves as blackened death metal on their websites", how about bands that don't identify themselves as <a href="../../../n/u/-/Nu-metal.html" title="Nu-metal">nu-metal</a> on their websites? After all, Nu-metal is a Wikipedia article (and an unofficial genre) so what is the problem? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanteferno_ab29.html" title="User:Danteferno">Danteferno</a> 18:10, August 13, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Who said anything about websites? I'm talking about the individual articles for the several bands that are listed in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackened_Death_Metal_b459.html" title="Blackened Death Metal">Blackened Death Metal</a>, <i>none</i> of which mention blackened death metal. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 00:05, August 14, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The same could be said for bands listed as "nu-metal" on the "List of Nu-metal artist page", eventhough nu-metal isn't mentioned on their biographical Wikipedia page. Where's the VFD/complaints there? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanteferno_ab29.html" title="User:Danteferno">Danteferno</a> 00:23, August 13, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>What I meant above is that the bands aren't described using this term on their Wikipedia pages, not their websites. This term would have more credibility if it didn't seem to contradict the evidence on other WP pages. —<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">talk</a>) 04:04, 15 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And I have clarified the term on some of those band pages. Whatever reasons, there is no good reason the article should be deleted. Google "blackened death metal", do a bit of research.

<li><b>Please do delete it!</b> Perhaps the ultimate proof that this is not a "vanity" page on my part is that I do indeed hope you all delete this page. This has been a nightmare of the surreal kind. The fact is that there are many pages on Wikipedia about people that are not famous, and being famous has never been the qualification for being on this page. (Talk about not knowing about what makes an entry encyclopedic. Since when has being famous qualified one as being worthy to be in an encyclopedia?

But please, God, DO delete this page. What a nightmare this has all become. And -- for the record -- the only reason I really got angry and it became a "edit war" is because I resented the comments that this page was a "malicious hack job" by me, that I didn't know the facts of my own father's life, and that I got his ethnicity wrong.

Thank you user JYolkowski for the fresh suggestion. Even though Mr. Parodi may not be worthy of a dedicated article himself, it would seem that the <a href="../../../t/e/g/Tegal_Corporation_26be.html" title="Tegal Corporation">Tegal Corporation</a> is. I just did a Google search on 'Tegal Corporation' and came up with over 5,000 hits. Clearly Tegal Corp is worthy of an article, and if Tegal is worthy of an article, then the info re: the Tegal CEO for the last 10 years is also very pertinent to that company. I say, nearly all bio info on Parodi could be merged verbatim from the Parodi article into the Tegal Corp article, and then the Michael Parodi article could be redirected to Tegal.<br /></li>

<dd>Romer, long time no see. Odd, I noticed someone logged in under the name <i>Romer</i> for the first time in several days just 5 minutes after you posted here. I don't see why you find this article to be worthy of such personal interest to yourself that you have created a special sock-puppet just to focus on this article and to annoy the rest of us. I must admit, you certainly did get a few of us to have some very serious, meaningful, philosophical conversations with a few sock-puppets. &#160;:-)</dd>

<ul>
<li>This article is 100% BS. Swiss-Italian cheese simply does not exist. It does not have hallucinogenic properties, nor is it an aphrodisiac, nor do people eat it, because it is non-existent. The sources are not backed up in any manner, the "Political fallout" section is a bad attempt at satirical humor. This needs to be <b>Deleted</b>. --<a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKlestrob44_b154.html" title="User:Klestrob44">Klestrob44</a> 05:39, 9 August 2005 (UTC).
<ul>
<li>Quote from Article:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Political Fallout</i> The liberal American media has downplayed the role of Swiss-Italian cheese in George W. Bush's War on Terror, claiming that its properties have not affected the morale of the soldiers to whom it is being provided in the popular Papal Cheesesteak meals-ready-to-eat (MREs).</p>
<p><i>Democratic senators voted for the Papal Cheesesteak MREs in recent legislation, citing the fact that the cheese contains immense amounts of protein and low sodium, but blatantly ignoring its narcotic properties and high flammability.</i></p>
<p><i>Conservatives have consistently devised linguistic tricks to turn the populace against Swiss-Italian cheese--primarily through Rush Limbaugh's constant jabbering induced by large amounts of the Swiss-Italian cheese itself. Liberals point out the contradiction, but Limbaugh insists he doesn't eat the cheese while on the air. It is a fundamental right, he says, to be able to consume the cheese in the home--unless, of course, you are unemployed, a minority, homosexual, a Democrat, ugly, poor, Alan Colmes, or any combination thereof.</i></p>
<p><i>Religious Use</i> Swiss mountain men have used the cheese in religious ceremonies for centuries. It is served on a fine, hand-tooled platter of gold harvested from Lombard caves and mines. No women are allowed to touch the sacred platter at any time, and children are told an old Swiss mountain folk tale about being turned into rats by touching the Holy Platter. According to recently uncovered Persian scrolls, Jesus ate from the Swiss-Italian Holy Platter during his secret pilgrimage with Mary Magdalene to the Swiss Alps in 28 A.D.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I am relatively new and don't know all the vagarities of the rules, but is "notable within its fanbase" a valid argument?

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b>. This is useful information for anyone searching for information on GameFAQs' board system and in its present state is to big to be merged with the main GameFAQs article. If GameFAQs is allowed an entry, then its boards (as a major feature) need to be explained as well. I think (ignoring some vandalism...) this entry does a decent job of introducing the boards and gives a nonuser of the system a decent understanding of what it is like. However, much of the information could be stripped out if necissary to maintain an elitist standard for the encyclopedia... with the rest merged with the main GameFAQs article (which should then be marked for a significant cleanup to better integrate all the data.) Simply deleting it outright would be a disservice. - Mr1bh 04:36, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>"The details to the forums should already be self-contained within their own community" Which does nothing for people outside the community such as the typical users of Wikipedia. True, these forums are not notable enough to deserve a page in their own right. However, Wikipedia makes provision for secondary pages to be made for content that does not fit within the main article. As it is right now, the GameFAQs forum entry is to large to merge with the GameFAQs article, and the GameFAQs article itself is not written well enough to cleanly facilitate a merge. Something needs to be mentioned about the forums as they are a major part of GameFAQs. Tt seems there are two issues at hand 1) The existance of a second article for the forums and 2) what should be mentioned about them. I suggest first editing the current page to the Wikipedia community's standards, and then considering whether or not the data will easily merge with the main article.Mr1bh 22:24, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>That's funny because <a href="http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Essays/Dino90.html" class="external free" title="http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Essays/Dino90.html" rel="nofollow">http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Essays/Dino90.html</a> records 'paleoweltschmerz' as a theory concerning a mental disorder, put forwards to explain the extinction of the dinosaurs. You can find it by searching on the word 'paleoweltschmerz'. You may also like to note that the page says the theory was put forward (although it does not say by whom) as a deliberate joke, which is (as far as I'm concerned) the only unverifiable part of it. Presumably, the Earth Sciences department of Bristol University did not invent it.</p>
<p>As for 'tinfoil hat theories that no-one apparently believes', I don't think that is a reasonable comment, let alone a legitimate reason for deletion. If it is a legit reason for deletion, Wikipedia could be getting a lot thinner.</p>
<p>Unusual/exotic theory; historical footnote; proposed solution to natural history phenomenon; <i>if</i> the theory was intended as a joke by its inventor (which I have been unable to ascertain) certainly of minor historical note (cf '<a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackalope.html" title="Jackalope">jackalope</a>').</p>
<p>Also: my Spanish is poor, but this page <a href="http://mitosyfraudes.8k.com/INDICE/Prologo.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://mitosyfraudes.8k.com/INDICE/Prologo.htm" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> seems to relate that the 'theory' of paleoweltschmerz was created by <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schopenhauer.html" title="Schopenhauer">Schopenhauer</a>.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This theory gets only 8 hits on Google, which seems to me to be extremely non-notable. The first hit is actually an essay on humorous reasons for the extinction of the dinosaurs.

<li>Wikipedia: namespace pages can certainly be listed on VFD.

<li><b>Keep it!</b> The thing that makes Wikipedia better than any other encyclopædia is that it contains entries that may be only interesting to a smaller population. The entry is factual and non-slanderous. By voting for removal of entries like this you are removing the whole essence of Wikipedia. Every 5-a side football team should have their own Wikipedia page, thus helping to complete vast information database that we are working for. Vanity? I would have to disagree. The entries that we should be deleting are the ones that are clearly fictitious, not the ones that are just less interesting to the general populace. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinButt_136b.html" title="User:MartinButt">Martin Butt</a> 19:18, 13 August 2005 (UTC) — <i>(<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinButt_136b.html" title="User:MartinButt">MartinButt</a>'s <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MartinButt_9d12.html" title="Special:Contributions/MartinButt">1st</a> edit.)</i></li>

<li>So what? Like MartinButt said, the essence of Wikipedia is compiling this wonderfully vast source of knowledge and information. So where is the sense in rejecting a particular genre of entry just because it has a large number of constituents? Surely opening Wikipedia up to the world of amateur football (as an example) can only be of benefit to the knowledge-seeking populace? Or put another way, what harm/detriment can come from accepting such entries? None. It is simply another step towards making Wikipedia the greatest source of information this world has ever experienced. 7killer7 00:25, 22 August 2005</li>

<dd>So you've now shown Color or Country fails the notability test on Google. But I admitted that. The point is that just because something doesn't exist on Google doesn't mean it doesn't exist (Google is NOT a deity). A number of Wikipedians from a number of different regions and schools in North America have heard of this game, and this is just the Wikipedians who noticed the article on VfD. With all the ones who missed it and all the non-Wikipedians who've heard of it, I think this easily implies passing the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability test</a> (which isn't policy anyway). In fact, neither is the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">importance test</a> (which it probably passes as well). The only policies that apply are <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifibility</a>, which this passes considering how many people agree this is verifiable, and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">no original research</a>, which this is not, again because many users agree this isn't isolated. Do I really need to search for less verifiable things on Wikipedia to handwaive my point, just like you did when you searched for inane things on everything2 to handwaive your (and my!) point? I may be a deletionist at heart, but this constant nitpicking is reminding me why I stopped watching VfD. <a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelso_ce03.html" title="User:Telso">Telso</a> 18:54, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm curious how you come to this conclusion. There are a bunch of people voting on this page, some of whom never went to mathcamp, who have heard of this game. I learned for this game back when I was in college at MIT six years ago. I didn't know what Mathcamp was and I didn't know anyone who had gone to Mathcamp. So it certaintly isn't a phenomenon restricted to Mathcamp. Do you seriously think we are all high school students enjoying our little joke? You seem to be attacking this with a vehemence usually reserved for pranksters and vandals. <a href="../../../c/m/o/User%7ECmouse_943a.html" title="User:Cmouse">Cmouse</a> 15:22, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, I don't think you guys are pranksters, and if the page is kept I'll just shrug. But it really bothers me that there seem to be substantially zero webpages about it (and by contrast the equally silly game Mornington Crescent has nearly a thousand Google hits). People create webpages about almost <i>anything</i> at the drop of a hat... I've researched my share of highly obscure topics. It's all the more anomalous because it's a geek/nerd type topic, which are normally heavily over-represented on the Internet (a million pages for the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_kid_473a.html" title="Star Wars kid">Star Wars kid</a> and only a handful on, say, ancient Persian poetry).

<li>Mornington Crescent is connected to a popular radio show. There are no pages dedicated to Mornington Crescent; all or most of the pages found by searching for Mornington Crescent are pages about the radio show, with Mornington Crescent a subtopic. Color or Country doesn't get on the Internet as much because it doesn't have that connection. Also, most people learn Color or Country by word-of-mouth, and so it tends to spread within groups that have ways to communicate other than web sites. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESho_Uemura_8e10.html" title="User:Sho Uemura">Sho Uemura</a> 23:02, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Have you ever argued over politics? Neither side can lose except on purpose. Why on Earth would you do such a thing? Is it a test of endurance, just to see who gives up first? The reason Color or Country is called a game is because it is for fun, not because it is some measure of skill. As a conventional game, Color or Country sounds rather silly: you can say "blue" each turn and not lose. However, one should not judge Color or Country as a game, but judge it is a phenomenon, a pastime, or an odd form of conversation. The fact that <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> asks why people would play this game, and the fact that many people <i>do</i> play it, should make it an interesting enough phenomenon to keep as an article. <a href="../../../y/a/s/User%7EYashabk_fe7c.html" title="User:Yashabk">Yasha</a> 19:10, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>that's a good point. If you add a page for your drinking game and get 8 or 9 of your friends to come on the vfd page vouching for it, it would meet the standard that we're currently setting here. This of course begs the eternal question "how do we define notable?" If your drinking game became popular in your apartment building and 75 people played it, does that make it a "social phenomenon?" I am not a proponent of the google test mostly because of the insanely high false positive rate, but if something scores a big zilch, that's really saying something. <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApollo58_818b.html" title="User:Apollo58">Apollo58</a> 23:38, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. While I've never actually participated in a game, I've heard it referenced by multiple unrelated social groups in real life.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - I have scoured my address book for geeky friends who went to math camps around the country, as well as asked numerous acquaintances at MIT, and no one reports ever hearing of the game. I would argue that it is known only to a very, very small and insular social circle and probably treated as a joke even there, and hardly qualifies as a "social phenomenon." I played a bizarre card game in summer camp that some of my friends made up that was quite popular and if you looked really hard you could probably find 100 people with a dim recollection of it, but that doesn't make it a social phenomenon.<a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApollo58_818b.html" title="User:Apollo58">Apollo58</a> 23:32, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I first encountered this game at the PROMYS program, and later at my high school, and later at several other programs. Arguments that the game is stupid are irrelevant, since the discussion regards the worthiness of the article, not of the game. The fact that people would play such a game at all is fairly surprising and interesting information. While this game is confined to a small culture, this culture consists of much more than Mathcampers. It tends to spread through various programs such as Mathcamp, CTY, Ross, PROMYS, MOSP, the U.S. Physics Team training camp, Clay Research Academy, and many others. However, it is not confined to those programs. It is fairly well known to nerds in many high schools who did not go to any of these programs. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathNerd_a40a.html" title="User:MathNerd">MathNerd</a> 03:28, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: At least something useful is coming from this VfD. I imagine that whoever originally posted the article, along with Rock Scissors which pretty much is non-notable, thought it was an isolated Mathcamp phenomenon. As a result of this discussion, various people have realized that their social group did not invent Colour or Country, and a lot of the history of a difficult-to-trace phenomenon has been traced. I guess VfD does generate some light along with its heat every once in a while. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer">RSpeer</a> 04:46, August 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Another comment</b> - I want to further differentiate this from Mao and Mornington Crescent, because in those games you can actually win. This game has no purpose other than to confuse newcomers, which is fine, but then it doesn't move beyond that. One can only lose, and if the newcomer isn't an idiot s/he will probably not lose. In mornington crescent, a quick newcomer can win in one move and the game ends. If the newcomer here passes the test, the game immediately becomes unfunny. Not that this has bearing on delete/keep, just saying.
<ul>
<li>Another difference is that Mao and Mornington Crescent have hidden rules. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 05:39, August 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The Game might be a better comparison than those two, altho it isn't quite the same. But it appears to have similar difficulties with winning/losing, and doesn't have hidden rules. --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMairi_7ec6.html" title="User:Mairi">Mairi</a> 05:41, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Blind, stupid persistence. Of course, you've got to be imaginative as well or the spectators boo you.

<p>As far as I can tell, the "KN300 Assault Rifle" does not exist. The original article was signed "Article by Napster KN." Combined with a suspicious lack of factual information about the manufacturer or history, I am convinced that this weapon is a work of fiction. I've looked through all the edits of the page and they have only been to wikify, with no expansion or contextual editing that suggests anybody else has a knowledge of the weapon.</p>
<p>Searching for "KN300 Assault Rifle" through Google returns only Wikipedia text, and a search for "KN300" by itself returns pages about a crane, a pocket knife, a cell phone, a cafe, and a country club.

<p>It is very superficial information. Migrants from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are generally referred to as "bhaiya", "or "bhaiyyah", ("bhaiyya" means brother in Hindi). Generally people in the places they work see them as a collective entity. Many of them are labourers/working class people-this is a term which a migrant would not prefer to called by (though it is quite a respectable word WITHIN the community. The dialects spoken by these people are Awadhi, Bhojpuri, Maithili and Maghi - all having entries on Wikipedia. These differene dialects are not differentiated by people of the other provinces and (especially Awadhi) is quite often used to in providing "character" to a character in Bollywood films <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.101.91.81 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.101.91.81_d663.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.101.91.81">contribs</a>).</small></p>

Also, someone will probably put it up again anyway, since there is a link or pre-link to every contestant already.

<p>KEEP - there is no reason to delete this article. It can be improved but should not be deleted.

<li>Actually, POV <i>is</i> a valid criterion for deletion when the POV of the entire article is skewed. This is not quite a vanity entry, but it comes awfully close.

Who are these censors of freedom of speech? Be they identified by name and address so that they can be brought to justice. They deserve to be charged with suppression of American rights and provisions which are spelled out in the Constitutions. Come into the open, you mischievous and treacherous rabble.

<li>I agree that a movement, even a small one, should have an article. This article provides no evidence of any movement beyond that occurring when the author sits on the toilet. The artile does not even refer to a movement, but rather to an "ideology", which kind of supports Gazpacho's point that it is a personal manifesto. The fact that the author made ridiculous threats of legal action, and has already made aggressive and inappropriate edits to the article tells me that this is not someone we want around. Will anyone be allowed to edit this article to NPOV it or bring it up to Wikipeida standard?

<li><b>COMMENT:</b> I'm worried about the immediate impact this might have on wikipedia. A minute passes that this crap stays on wiki, the more likelihood that someone will take offense and sue wikipedia? I'm not a lawyer (tm) and cannot say with authority what would happen then, but are we not responsible at least partly for the contents that even anon vandals place on it? It's blatantly obvious that this anon vandal's agenda is racism, so there should, in theory, be no discussion about its validity, since it IS racism and not just TALKING ABOUT racism, and the last time I checked, racism is illegal. I suggest that we at least quarantine this article first and make it inacessible or something. This might be something I wanna bring up at the vfd reform too. -<a href="../../../h/m/i/User%7EHmib_4096.html" title="User:Hmib">Hmib</a> 05:07, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>CROATIAN METAL HISTORY</b> Most of you are probably not familiar with any bands coming from Croatia, but there are quite some reasons for this fact...Apart from being a very small country with a population of only 4 million people, the Metal scene had to fight with several other problems like for instance the civil war, that took place from 1991 until 1995, and through which Croatia got an independent country. In days of former Yugoslavia and even nowadays, there was and is no underground label (because of the bad economical situation of the country), that could make promotion, but labels governed by the state. For this reason, there are only very few Metal albums done on a more proffessional format, which were mainly distributed to Yugoslavian only. But, nevertheless, quite a lot of underground bands were active, playing their music without getting much attention from the press. In the following lines, I will present you only bands from the nowadays Croatian territory (I focus mainly on the bands from the 80s, but also a few, that started in the early 90s!)........</p>
<p>........................Surely Grindcore legend <b>PATARENI</b> from Zagreb must not be missed, though many people would disagree to bring them in connection with Metal due to their influences from the Punk genre. But in my opinion, Metal is the biggest part of their music and therefore I will comment on them. PATARENI started back in 1983 and they are still alive! Their discography is immense with a lot of CDs, LPs and split singles with nowadays very famous bands such as Extreme Noise Terror, Agathocles or Cripple Bastards but also with unknown ones. Through this releases they gained a reputation as a cult band and many wellknown bands claimed PATARENI for being one of their main influences, which was prooved by several tribute releases. By the way, if you want to listen to their early from their long sold out split releases without paying exagerated prices, let me tell you that there was a CD released with the title "Tko Ne Pamti Iznova Prozivljava", that includes many material of those times. However, this band has made a lot of tours through foreign countries in the past and even played some shows in the USA. <b>BUKA</b> was a project of some Patareni members, that started around 1980 and ceased to exist in ca. 1990. I don`t have any information on their discography, but I know, that they have some split releases with Patareni. Well, I had only the oportunity to listen to their split CD and their side was called "Untalented After All These Seconds". Well, by selecting such a title, you can imagine how serious they took themselves. To me, the music is similiar to Patareni, but it is less Metal and more noisy and chaotic Grindcore with many crazy ideas, though still justified to categorize them in the Metal genre. But still I am of the opinion that if you like Patareni, you will also enjoy BUKA as long as you have a big sense for humour (but normally, every Patareni fan is humouristic, otherwise they would not like them!).</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think it's borderline so I'm not surprised that someone has transwikied it to WikiSource where it would also be appropriate, but I can conceive of encyclopedic uses for this list.

<li>Sarcasm doesn't work well on the internet. Your examples are trivial; the principle works best when you see a character whose name you <i>don't</i> know. For example, this list would make the article for <a href="../../../g/i/m/Gimel_%28letter%29.html" title="Gimel (letter)">gimel</a> accessible to people who only know the character as a funny-looking, nameless squiggle. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a></li>

<dd>Do you know how many papers are published every year? Just take a look at one of the indices or sets of abstracts for a single subject-area. There are hundreds of thousands of them (probably millions if we look at world-wide publications; a paper from the "Institute of Science in Society" quotes a rough estimate of millions a year, and a paper on <a href="http://physicsweb.org/articles/world/17/2/2/1" class="external text" title="http://physicsweb.org/articles/world/17/2/2/1" rel="nofollow">Physics Web</a> reveals that "the number of papers published every year in the natural sciences has increased by a factor of between two and four since 1974"). There might not be much difference between an individual separate article and a bibliographic listing (though in fact I'm pretty certain that there would be at the numbers involved here), but 99% of papers wouldn't be mentioned in any bibliography on Wikipedia (or anywhere else). (Research done a few years ago, using a couple of prestigious Physics journals as its subjects, showed that individual papers were read by an average of one and a half people.)<br />
In any case, that's not my main reason for the nomination. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 09:38, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>What can I say? We have a quite extreme bias towards popular culture, especially the kind enjoyed by young, white (, male) Americans and Europeans.

I'm definetly a defender of the academic myself, but fiction still tends to be more notable than scientific papers, and going overboard with the inclusion of very obscure material is hardly a good way to counter this problem.

<li><b>Keep</b> Motorhead has a full discography, removing it makes timelines and moving from one single to next impossible. The singles were released to support different albums. Moochocoogle states that most band don't deserve a song entry and redirected without reference, note or moving deleted data to talk (removed pictures, lyrics etc when 'merging'). Now I've unmerged: immediately on VfD. Also for both, take a look at the discography section on the motorhead page and suggest what to do if this are deleted, leave them red? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_alf_522c.html" title="User:Wiki alf">Alf</a> 11:44, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>If you view my merged version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ace_of_Spades_%28song%29&amp;oldid=20805824" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ace_of_Spades_%28song%29&amp;oldid=20805824" rel="nofollow">here</a>, you will see that i managed to keep all the information, (including pictures), in one article (except for the lyrics, which are almost certainly copyrighted). I preserved the single timeline by slightly altering the infobox. It makes so much more sense to do it this way. Currently, song articles in Wikipedia are all primarily about the song, with single releases of the song mentioned as part of the article (see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Songs_9a56.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Songs">Wikipedia:WikiProject Songs</a>). Creating two articles about one song doesn't make sense, no matter how many times it has been recorded and released as a single. By the proposed scheme of having articles about each single release of a song could end up creating hundreds of articles with little meaningful information about frequently covered songs (or duplicating most of the information in each article). --<a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoochocoogle_46ae.html" title="User:Moochocoogle">Moochocoogle</a> 19:57, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>You did embed the items I do apologies for that, the picture was in a place I didn't expect, from a reader point of view I find it confusing, chart listing, producer, space for timings (when I have a break to time the ones that aren't on the records), album position all of these are really unclear (IMHO). A note on the article or my talk page have alerted me to the ongoing discussion on rules for articles subject to this catgory - I understand that a consensus is forming that supports your edits, however, loss of clarity in the topic for the want of two pages would be a shame.</li>

A reader cannot browse ther timeline without it, each single supported a different album. These are not 'just' song pages they form part of the Motorhead discography.

<li>You did embed the items I do apologies for that, the picture was in a place I didn't expect, from a reader point of view I find it confusing, chart listing, producer, space for timings (when I have a break to time the ones that aren't on the records), album position all of these are really unclear (IMHO). A note on the article or my talk page have alerted me to the ongoing discussion on rules for articles subject to this catgory - I understand that a consensus is forming that supports your edits, however, loss of clarity in the topic for the want of two pages would be a shame.</li>

<p>The result of the debate was delete. The "5000 google hits" argument was, in my mind, successfully rebutted by the analysis that only about 140 of them were non-duplicative. 140 hits is well below even the minimal standards normally accepted for an article from popular culture.</p>

<p>I'm an inclusionist, but this is where even inclusionism stops. Forget the nudie pics, which are easily removed, but Wikipedia can quite obviously never contain articles on every porn movie ever created (I'm pretty sure porn movies are shot at a faster rate than we get contributors). It stands to reason therefore that all those that <i>are</i> included should be notable for something (<a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Throat_%28movie%29_9770.html" title="Deep Throat (movie)">Deep Throat</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debbie_Does_Dallas_f560.html" title="Debbie Does Dallas">Debbie Does Dallas</a>). <a href="../../../w/w/i/WP%7EWWIN_b86f.html" title="WP:WWIN">Wikipedia is not</a> an indiscriminate collection of information, which is all an article on a forgettable movie like this could ever be. We recently adopted a speedy criterion that covers articles on <i>persons</i> that do not establish notability. We might need a similar one for fiction, of whatever kind. I regret using this nomination as an instructive example, but I don't think it's <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>—just deleting it would actually violate policy.</p>

<dd>Because this is not what an encyclopedia ought to be. Subjective? Yes. I'm not going to pretend it's not. This article can probably be made verifiable, so that's not the problem. I <i>am</i> voting on notability here. "User would want to be able to look this up", can you imagine anything that falsifies such a criterion? Somewhere, somehow, someone is going to want to look up anything you can possibly imagine. By this criterion, everything of which the existence can be independently verified should have an article. I don't believe that's tenable. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 22:42, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Clarification, as I see an important misunderstanding arising here. The "subjective" part arises not in deciding whether <i>this particular movie</i> should be in Wikipedia, but whether <i>all movies that do not establish notability apart from having been sold to people at some time</i> should be. I can see how applying a criterion like "I don't think it should be here" for <i>individual articles</i> would be wrong and decidedly non-neutral. (Though it still has nothing to do with NPOV as written.) <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 23:02, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>"I want to be able to look this up" is not a point of view, not in the sense we use it. A POV is a way of interpreting reality, not a desire. Your claim seems to be that if something has 5,900 Google hits, this establishes that many people believe it is notable, and it is this POV that ought to be represented. I dispute that. While many people will have been involved in the production, marketing, selling and buying of this movie, you will not convince me that they (or even a significant portion of them) believe this movie ought to be in an encyclopedia, or that they would think it a good idea if it were, or in fact anything else relevant to Wikipedia's coverage. I acknowledge that we have a difference of opinion on what the encyclopedia should contain, but I cannot agree that my opinion somehow violates NPOV. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 23:52, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Before anyone objects, I know cleanup candidates shouldn't be brought here, but I'm being bold. I think this article is beyond cleanup and we should just put it out of its pathetic miserable existence. As it stands, it isn't an assessment of the effects of invasion; it is a POV scorecard on whether the alleged objectives have been met.

<ul>
<li>Wikipedia seldom covers historical events with so many question marks. The reason there are so many is because the <b>actual</b> effects simply aren't known yet, and the only way one can claim to know what they are is to interpret a set of facts relating to one of the most unstable situations in the world. There is no reason why this could not be recreated in 10-15 years' time. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 02:34, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If the question marks bother you, edit the article to replace them with the word "uncertain" or a phrase such as "not yet known". Or comment out the predictions for which the outcome is still uncertain; they can be added back. The other results are useful where the prediction can be sourced (as I said above) and the outcome is known for a fact (such as for instance the toppling of Saddam Hussein, the elimination of the threat of future Iraqi used of weapons of mass destruction, etc). It's close to OR but I think it can be done in a neutral way from sources and should be allowed to continue with that objective in mind. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 08:14, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> (and actually put some work into it!) It is pretty bad as it is, but the idea of the article, in correspondance to the predicted effects... article, is exactly to be a scorecard: to record all of the predictions and compare them with what actually happened. Provided one is thorough and honest about what was predicted (and doesn't revise it retrogressively to fit a conclusion), and these predictions are objective, onecan also be objective about the actual effects. if the result strongly favors a given conclusion, that is no proof that there was any POV involved. To think it would be would be employing the "gray fallacy" - the fallacy that nothing is ever black and white but is always a shade of gray almost exactly between the two. There is absolutely nothing that garauntees this. It is a specail case of "assuming the conclusion" - which is exactly what one wants to avoid when trying to achieve NPOV. And no, the worthwhile material is not already better covered elsewhere.</li>

<dl>
<dd>the corresponding page, "predicted effects..." already faced a vfd about a year ago on the basis of things being "unattributed opinions", but it passed because the authors provided sources, thus <i>attributing</i> the <i>predictions</i>. To say that the information in this article is unattributed is factually incorrect, besides being clearly intended to persuade rather than reason (clearly, in that it is false. and also in light of the following). The fundamental question, whoever, is whether the predictions accurately and proportionally represent the spectrum of predictions made in support of or opposition to the war, during the time prior to the war. The thorough attribution in this article (at the bottom, rather than mixed in) is simply one means of approaching that goal. And certainly there is much further to go; much work to be done on this article. In any case, the point of this article is to be just that: a snapshot of the various predictions concerning the iraq war prior to the war - for the sake of history and reflection. Remember, the coming generations are not going to have experienced the iraq war and the political turmoil surrounding it - they're not going to know all of those things that both the people voting "keep" <i>and</i> the people voting "delete" do, unless we make a record of that information here. That is the point of an encyclopdia, that is the point of academic literature in general. those voting "delete" are encouraged to "then fix it", so that future generations may have the knowledge that they, and we all collectively, do, but would otherwise be lost to them. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_baas_eec8.html" title="User:Kevin baas">Kevin Baas</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_baas_1af8.html" title="User talk:Kevin baas">talk</a>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kevin_baas&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kevin_baas&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">new</a></sup> 16:49, August 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>KEEP, do not merge</b>. It is *not* the Winter Olympics so should not be merged there. We have articles on future Olympics, so if this is deleted, then the 2014 Winter Olympics article should also be deleted. IT should not be merged into the Winter Paralympics page, but probably should be mentioned there, as the IOC and IPC have formed something of an alliance, this event will certainly occur, and it is a major event, as there's television contracts for the paralympics nowadays. As for naming... It's not the "Winter Olympics" either, so you've got to rename every Summer Olympics article as well (Games of the Olympiad, not Summer Olympics)... <a href="../../../1/3/2/User%7E132.205.45.148.html" title="User:132.205.45.148">132.205.45.148</a> 16:43, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
