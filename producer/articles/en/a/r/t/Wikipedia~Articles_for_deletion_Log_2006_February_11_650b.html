<p>Yes, it's autobiographical. It's not intended to be vanity. I could certainly have added a great deal more detail. The majority of my published work is not self-published, just two of the three books mentioned. But if you're going to delete articles because of self-publication, you'll need to get rid of the articles on Mark Twain and a few other more notable people. Any objections to deletng the Twain article for the same reason?</p>

<p>Actually, Ruby, I was simply referring to my having defended you against the ATV trolls and bullies who attacked you incessantly. I wasn't calling you a troll.

<li>Some comments: First, that newspaper article does not actually substantiate much of what this article says. Second, a newspaper column is probably not a reliable source. Third, the term "co-ed" is almost exclusively used in North America, elsewhere a different term is used. Fourth, most of what that newspaper article says is applicable to <i>any</i> sleepover including teens. So, this seems to me to have the wrong title, a lot of unverified content (who has figures for the number of times a single gay man is invited to otherwise all-girl sleepovers?) and reads like original research. The wrong article in the wrong place, in other words. Deleting this does not preclude someone from writing a much better article on the same thing. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 11:15, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

It refers to the edge of a geographic area, regardless of whether there is a community there. For example, "a factory on the outskirts of the city," is not the same as, "a factory in the exhurb of the city." The factory may be in a rural setting with no communites or an industrial area.

<li><b>Comment</b> - When posting the article (that went instantly to rapid deletion) I had intended on making the term "quantum onion" the core element of an article on modeling of hard problems. As it was my first wiki post on my own, I was not aware of the rapid delete. It makes me not want to finish and submit the real article. Why bother? I don't need the PubCred. Perhaps the rapid delete could just (as Aking wrote) move the material to another wiki or the wiki dictionary.] [[[User:Neutronmd|neutron]] 02:40, 11 February 2006 (UTC)]</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If Wikipedia adopted a Limbo namespace, this article could be moved to Limbo during the discussion on deletion. Moving an article to Limbo would remove it from the article namespace and prevent search engines from delivering suspicious content while the community decides whether to keep or delete it.

<li>The images was uploaded using a uploader-bot, the images are PD, I think he who uploaded them did it to include it to the swedish wikipedia, I thought there would be usefull to have it here as well, I think it's encyclopedic to describe them. I can understand thet you think that swedish roadmarks doesn't deserve an own article, the problem at the moment is that all road-related articles needs a major overhaul (mixed generic with us-specific or ireland-specific content etc...). The main difference with swedish road-marks and the most of the european, is that the swedish have yellow background instead of white. Also I don't know how it is in other countries, but in sweden road-marks are heavly regulated in the law, so there are no regional differences of marks. <sub>→<a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzaToth_9bb9.html" title="User:AzaToth"><font style="color:#975612">Aza</font></a><a href="../../../a/z/a/User_talk%7EAzaToth_5ca3.html" title="User talk:AzaToth"><font style="color:#325596">Toth</font></a></sub> 00:14, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would like to say keep and rewrite. I really would.

<p>"Delete for Propaganda/Advocacy" <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_franklin_89f1.html" title="User:Lou franklin">Lou franklin</a> 04:39, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The "Societal attitudes towards homosexuality" article should be removed.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT</a> has a list of "what Wikipedia is not". The page says that "Wikipedia is not a soapbox" and asks that we leave "opinions on current affairs" out of Wikipedia. It says that Wikipedia articles should not be "propaganda or advocacy". Wikipedia says that all articles must be written from a neutral point of view. This article is clearly in violation of all of those standards.</p>
<p>As an encyclopedia, Wikipedia is a place for facts - not editorials. Does this statement belong in an encyclopedia: "In most developed countries, same-sex relationships are accepted"? Is that a fact that belongs in an encyclopedia or is that propaganda/advocacy?</p>
<p>How about this statement: "In some cultures influenced by anti-gay religious dogma, homosexuality is still considered unnatural". Is the reason that some cultures consider homosexuality unnatural really because they are "influenced by anti-gay religious dogma"? Is that fact or an opinion?</p>
<p>How about this "fact": "Violence against homosexuals remains common". Since no definition of "common" was given, is that a factual statement or is it spin?</p>
<p>The article references the "LGBT civil rights movement". But "civil rights" are personal rights guaranteed and protected by the Constitution, e.g., freedom of speech, press. Are homosexual rights spelled out in the Constitution? Then can there really be a "LGBT civil rights movement"? Or was that term crafted to associate gay rights with the rights of racial minorities?</p>
<p>Consider this statement: "Studies by Dr. Carole Jenny, Dr. A.W. Richard Sipe, and others have not found evidence that homosexuals are more likely to molest childen than heterosexuals." I am unclear of how that relates to the topic of "Societal attitudes towards homosexuality" in the first place. Is the purpose of this article to discuss what the "Societal attitudes towards homosexuality" ARE, or to discuss what they SHOULD BE? In any case, the link that the author provided says that "no large-scale national research has been done" and admits that the information is from "small studies".</p>
<p>We can debate whether "homosexuals are more likely to molest childen than heterosexuals" until the cows come home. Links can be found that make the case for either side of that argument, so it is fertile territory for revert wars. The statement is not from a neutral point of view and is off-topic anyway.</p>
<p>The article is fundamentally biased from start to finish and should be removed.</p>

What you have here is a small yet vocal militant group using Wikipedia to get their agenda out.</p>
<p>Wikipedia was a cool idea, but people won't continue to use it once they discover overtly biased articles like this one. (Did you know that "many religious establishments" accord homosexuals "special status as possessing enhanced spiritual abilities"?)</p>
<p>The public is growing more skeptical already. <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm</a></p>
<p>The process of correcting articles is fundamentally flawed because not only don't many "editors" attempt to be impartial and objective, but the very reason they are here is to push their agenda. Somebody made the comment that "the proper response to an article with biased content is to rewrite it, not to delete the article". Yet when I made corrections they were simply overridden. The net effect is that the article cannot be corrected and it cannot be removed.</p>
<p>No encyclopedia in the country would print the propaganda contained in this article. Ultimately, the public will stop using Wikipedia because the authors are allowed to disregard facts and promote their agendas. And, no, deleting this article would not be "homophobia running rampant"; it would be fairness running rampant.</p>

<dd>It's my experience that small yet vocal militant groups tend to show up on AfD when their articles get tagged. So far though, all we've got is you. While I can understand your perspective, I'm unconvinced. Systemic bias is argued both ways with some regularity, and frankly, I doubt this article is going to be the death of Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>Lou, your most recent edit was to mutilate a paragraph which cited a peer reviewed scientific study which showed that homosexuals are <i>less</i> likely to molest children, and before it add a statement that homosexuals are <i>more</i> likely to molest children, and a link to a strongly POV opinion / political action site with an unscientific, un-peer-reviewed opinion web page arguing the latter.</dd>

<dd>The link to your so-called "peer reviewed scientific study" was actually a USA Today article that openly admits that "no large-scale national research has been done" and describes the studies you cited as "small". That USA Today article also mentions a study that concluded "that gay men are three times more likely than heterosexuals to have sex with minors". That was mentioned in the very same article, yet that study mysteriously never made it to the text of the Wikipedia article. I am at a loss to understand how my link was "evidence of bad faith and POV editing" while yours was not.</dd>

<dd>Whether "homosexuals are more likely to molest children than heterosexuals" is moot since it doesn't relate to the topic, and there are no conclusive studies anyway. I can modify the article and site literally hundreds of links that take one position. Then you can site a hundred links with the opposing opinion. Your sites will be no more valid than mine. But is that really necessary? Since it has absolutely no bearing on the topic of "societal attitudes towards homosexuality" in the first place, it shouldn't be a matter of debate. It should be removed.</dd>

<dd>I believe it is a fairly accurate description of the events. The definition of homosexuality was not incorrect simply because it discussed adult orientation rather than restricting the definition to the gender of sexual partners. To claim that male pedophiles who molest boys are homosexual is misleading whether or not it is technically true that their actions are homogenital in nature. The information you added was not correct. It was a grossly misleading statement using, as its only source, a site that based its conclusions on disingenuous distortions of statistics. Rather than add that some (your source) disagree with the distinction between same-gender molestation and adult sexual relations, you deleted everything about the distinction and simply added "Homosexuals are, per capita, more likely to be child molesters" or something very much to that effect. The question to ask is, "Does being sexually and romantically attracted to adults of one's own gender make one more likely to molest children." The logic you present works backwards from same-gender molestation to paint adult sexuality with the same brush saying, in effect, that there is no difference between an adult male being attracted to another adult male and an adult male being attracted to a male child. Would you equate an adult male being attracted to an adult female to an adult male being attracted to a female child since the gender is the same?</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Society does have attitudes towards homosexuality. These attitudes are studied, debated, surveyed and documented. So this article describes a legitimate topic and is clearly not an AfD candidate. The information in the article does appear to indicate societal support of homosexuality, but this simply reflects reality. There is a clear, documented trend in society of advancing support for homosexuality. Wikipedia does not address the right-ness or wrong-ness of such things. The nom obviously does not support homosexuality, but if the nom disagrees that such support is advancing, he is should offer well-referenced evidence to the contrary.

This is vindictive, and does not contribute to a harmonious, constructive community. Please recognize that other viewpoints exist, and other people's opinions are just as valid as yours. I truly hope that a consensus can be reached with the article. I strongly disagree with your apparent views on homosexuality, but I do think that those views are, for better or for worse, a part of societal attitudes toward homosexuality and should be represented in the article <i>alongside</i> other views. <a href="../../../h/b/a/User%7EHbackman_f74f.html" title="User:Hbackman">Hbackman</a> 05:40, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

It can be used to alter the effects of diffraction. Texts on Fourier optics often discuss this at length. A good article in Wikipedia which describes aspects of apodization as it relates to Fourier optics and diffraction would belong in an encyclopedia not a dictionary.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Let's look again at those six news reports. That in the <i>Boston Herald</i> has a certain small amount of content; within it: "The beverage, which contains vitamins B-12 and B-6, has been banned in France and Denmark because 'all soft drinks containing vitamins are forbidden,' said [the company president]." The mathaba.net story is pretty vacuous and anyway comes from local6.com, so we're really down to <i>five</i> "news reports" -- though "report" is a stretch for any of them aside from that in the <i>Herald</i>. The <i>Herald</i> does tell us that the "key ingredient" is the alarmingly named "schizandra". Within WP, <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schizandra.html" title="Schizandra">schizandra</a> redirects to <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schisandra.html" title="Schisandra">schisandra</a>, which tells us that in traditional Chinese medicine it's used for various purposes -- none of them aphrodisiac. The rewritten article on Turn on is much less obviously awful than the one on which I slapped an AfD template, but it still tells us that <i>Turn on is a cherry flavored soda that acts as an aphrodisiac when consumed.</i> NB "acts as", not, say, "is claimed by those marketing it, if by nobody else, to act as". And so on and so on, and then: <i>It is currently only sold via Turn On Beverages, Inc's website, but it will soon be available in stores nationwide.</i> The former half looks a bit like a commercial come-on, the latter raises the question of which nation is discussed, and it seems to me to violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT's rule</a> that "Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place." Is the start of conventional retailing in any nation of soda pop that's claimed by its purveyor to be aphrodisiac a <i>notable</i> event? I say no it isn't. Meanwhile, WP seems to be notably and alarmingly willing to propagate commercial puffery. This looks less like an encyclopedia article, more like the spam emails that make it past my filters. It still deserves deletion. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 06:24, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: <s>While the term "ineffabilism" may be found to have been used in a number of papers, its usage is simply from taking "ineffable" and using the suffix "-ism". (Which, in my opinion, doesn't merit its own article, nor inclusion in <a href="../../../i/n/e/Ineffable.html" title="Ineffable">ineffable</a>).</s> (See comment below). However, the term in this case, "ineffablism" (sic), is specifically taken from the <a href="http://www.undergroundfilm.org/people/user.tcl?pid=41239" class="external text" title="http://www.undergroundfilm.org/people/user.tcl?pid=41239" rel="nofollow">article creator's bio</a> (possibly self-submitted) on an independent filmmmakers site. In view of the vote stuffing (7 votes, see all "unsigned" above) by the article's creator, seems like an attempt to get a Wiki reference to his personal philosophy. Note that all versions until the last one on 07:30, 11 Feb 2006 (UTC) indicated that is was a philosophy developed by the author, and in fact is is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ineffablism&amp;oldid=39178568" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ineffablism&amp;oldid=39178568" rel="nofollow">newly created (2006)</a> (information in many of the first versions of the article). Thus, it doesn't merit a merge, which would support this neologism/"neo-philosophy". —<a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> @ 12:38, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>The claim that the term is new and was invented by the author of the article is the ONLY thing bogus about this article. It is NOT new, nor is this a new definition for the word. Adding the suffix "=ism" is <i>the</i> most common way to form names for philosophical schools of thought; see <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundationalism.html" title="Foundationalism">foundationalism</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Reliabilism.html" title="Reliabilism">reliabilism</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internalism.html" title="Internalism">internalism</a>, etc etc etc. A significant amount of time has been spent criticizing the doctrine of ineffability <i>as it has been presented in this article.</i> Just because the author of the article was only right by coincidence and has not conducted himself well in this AfD isn't sufficient justification for deleting useful information on a real philosophical term. Believe me, before I researched this matter I fully intended to vote "strong delete." - <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdelaMae_b57f.html" title="User:AdelaMae">AdelaMa</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/d/e/User_talk%7EAdelaMae_cb14.html" title="User talk:AdelaMae">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AdelaMae_415e.html" title="Special:Contributions/AdelaMae">contribs</a>)</sup> 13:21, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> AdelaMa made some great enlightening points on this subject but the core of my explanation and rationalization for this ineffable perspective (Ineffablism), using the ideas of “context” and “relativity”, is singularly mine and original and is worth of being kept. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by user:Drpaluga (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_user%7EDrpaluga_c2b6.html" title="Special:Contributions/user:Drpaluga">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Although it appears that this entry will be deleted, I wish to thank all those for their kind, but generally rejecting, feedback.

<li>I'm sorry, but I do not see any controversy. This is a philosophy developed in 2006. It is not yet established knowledge so it does not yet belong in an Encylopedia.

<p>AlphaZealot 07:17, 12 February 2006 (UTC)Speaking as a Staff Writer for MLG, the vast majority, if not all, of the information contained within is correct. There are some problems in relation to the time frame this was created. For example, the currect largest tournament is FC3, at over 180 people showing up for singles (although misrepresented in Nintendo Power as having over 200). However, that is information that is bound to change with time, and not grounds for the deletion of an entire entry. This is the first-hand history of one of the best Smash crews in the country, all the tournament placements are verifiable at www.smashboards.com or you can email someone from MLG at their www.mlgpro.com to recieve rankings for their own tournaments. I find it offensive to the Smash community to suggest this page be deleted, and no, I am not from H2YL.</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. (I removed the prod tag, in the hope of improving the article instead. There's already been some work on that.) It's not a dorm, it's a member of a flourishing, historically significant, independent group of cooperative houses. I agree, an article on an individual coop is somewhat marginal, and I wouldn't be unhappy if it and the other ICC houses were merged back into the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Inter-Cooperative_Council_at_the_University_of_Michigan_4ec3.html" title="Inter-Cooperative Council at the University of Michigan">ICC</a> article, which needs improvement too. On the other hand, the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Inter-Cooperative_Council_at_the_University_of_Michigan_4ec3.html" title="Inter-Cooperative Council at the University of Michigan">ICC</a> is an important organization nationally to the coop movement, not just at Michigan (it's the "home" of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_American_Students_of_Cooperation_9de9.html" title="North American Students of Cooperation">NASCO</a>, among other things), and each house has a pretty long and complex history of its own. So... a weak keep, but this isn't just the condescendingly labelled "nn-dorm."

A very fun website where you can see all the pet colours Neopets (http://www.neopets.com) have ever made. It also has a fun forum (http://www.neocolours.co.uk/forum)

The board has topped over 2,000 members, with some of the best including...well, check the memberlist.

<li><b>Keep</b> Even if the topic is poorly conceptualized it is an important topic. As the world grows more complex and informational overflow becomes a greater problem, knowledge management will become increasingly important. Deleting this page will be like throwing the baby out with the bath water. If the concept is legitimate enough to inspire development of graduate programs, it is legitimate enough to be encyclopedic. Issues concerning lack of objectivity are manageable.--68.222.30.251 05:58, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

Go ahead and delete the page, I could care less. But I will be deleting everything I've written. This page will have to be rewritten from scratch, because it is 99% my original writings. Capice? As it stands now, the KM definition is pretty useless, so good job at 'improving' the content. In fact, to put an end to this 'discussion' once and for all, because all my references have been removed, I'm taking down all of my content, and I do mean all. DO NOT PUT IT BACK UP, or you will be reported and banned for non-compliance of Wikireferencing. I will not have my work de-referenced.</p>

<p>To JzG, who has removed all my references? You are an ADMIN?? OK, I get it now. So Wikipedia wants non-referenced, non-copyright material. Whoever did this edit, well you know, good effort and all, but it now sucks. Sorry, I'm being objective. The article now sucks, the definition you've written sucks. If it was better than the previous article, I'd be the first to congratulate you. If you think these ideas just fall out of the sky, well that's why there called REFERENCES.</p>

<li><b>Keep or Delete</b> THIS IS THE PERSON ABOUT WHOM THIS ARTICLE WAS WRITTEN. MY married name is Kim Deanda. My son has brought to my attention the exceptional immaturity going on here, pretending musical archival research. Wikipedia has a criteria cited above called WP:NMG, for persons of musical notariety. This offers general recommendations. Now, this entry was unfinished and contains no UPLOADED photos, as it was not finished, and this should be obvious. In fact, it wasn't even formatted until a day ago. Meanwhile, a bunch of people ran in here and attempted to research an entry that was unfinished. This created a problem. SECOND, the Wiki criteria states a recommendation that the person recieved radio airplay nationally and that the project was written up in a journal of thier peers. IN FACT, THIS IS THE CASE. The major Music journal was CCM MAGAZINE, which is the number one journal for Christian contemporary music and still is. The primary project I was associated with was Breakfast With Amy, as co-writer, and the Wiki criteria is for songwriters applied here specifically. IF you research the CCM archives you find they have still to upload the actual articles, as they trace back for 15 years or so, in the same way you can't find the Rolling Stone articles for many people. This is not surprising. Most magazines limit the number of back issues they scan onto the internet. However, looking at the WIki criteria, you see that it is enough to qualify B.W.A. as per their national radio airplay, association with Dakota Motor Company, which was on the cover of CCM, another I AM /AMY offshoot. What you find is that we are getting into a genre of music, as the Wiki criteria states, where the persons involved have been influenctial in beginning a 'movement' that influenced many bands to come: Christian Alternative. Here, you have a genre, as Wiki states, where you have the onset of the genre itself beginning with only a handful of people. Those people, in Christian music, changed the genre and developed a new one that has grown immensely. Now, there has been thousands of bands come out of what was originally a movement started by just a handful of folks in Orange County, California. The first such band, was 'I AM'. From 'I AM' came an offshoot of related projects that became nationally known in ivolving its memebers. THe bassplyer CHris Colbert went on to be the first major Christain Alt producer who has now produced over forty bands, and he currently heads the console of Gene Eugene, the first such CHristian producer. Our Guitarist, Koval, started both Amy and Dakota Motor Company, made the cover of CCM Magazine, too. That means the cover of the most important peer magazine inthe world for the entire genre. This was while he was in Amy. I am the singer from 'I AM', and I co-wrote songs for the first 'Amy' album with Koval and Colbert. It appears, Koval and I founded this genre, which is quite surprising, but, we did, and when we met Colbert, he could not even play his bass, but we gave him his start, and this led to a huge movement. AMY are the first Christian project EVER to be what is called 'da-'daist'...like Frank Zappa, the weirdest, strangest CHristian band that had ever come up. Nothing like it existed before&#160;! This was like nothing I could explain but to compare it to Frank Zappa. According to Wiki, you want to see national radio airplay, I also mentioned DJ Diedre O' Donahue, who was the first alt DJ in Los Angeles, citing them as a favorite. They recived national airplay, people as far away as Germany known who they are. I was quite surprised how big this got and I am fair bowled over. THe article is not finishd folks, and in the field of music and archiving, there are research models that include looking up CCM Magazine. Mike Knott of the Lifesavers, also huge in the genree, now controls the re-issues, and what you will find is a unique genre that isn't Amy Grant or CC Wynan, but the CHristain Punk and Alt. genre. I was the first fenale Christian ALt. frontwoman that we know of, and from that project came so many people who changed CHristian music and developed a new genre. THIS is what Wiki is looking for, NOT just anybody's little band. You have to be connected to founding a movement and you have to influence many people who come after you. YOu have to get national radio airplay, etc. Frank Zappa is in this position, rarely selling more than 50k records, but he is in a class of his own, and Patty Smith, The Sex Pistols, Captain Beefheart. Since the article is being read by people who have no idea who opened the door for Creed and Switchfoot, especially, neither of whom I liked, but both are Christian, Stryper was the first such metal band and I would give the Sweet brothers and article here, as well as Mike Knott and the Lifesavers. YOu may not have eve heard of them, but millions of grown kids now know who they are and you are onto the beginning of an entire movement. CCM needs to get its archives up and get on the ball, but being the Rolling Stone of all CHistian music, who knows why they have only lists up. You can find all of these bands on those lists, but not the actual articles. Wiki is looking for the founders of the given genres, and that is in their list of notable requirements. PLease read the categories on the list entirely, and you will understand what this is about. In the meantime, the article still had no photos, no discography, and was just getting off the ground. THe people I have mentioned ALSO deserve an article here - especially Christ Colbert, Mike Knott, and Stryper. I would add Koval here, but I don't know where the guy is. Chris is very renown and he was my Co-writer, as mentioned. He had a lot of success in the secular Duralux, but mostly as the primary CHristian alt producer in the world today. SO, well, see. But I would appreciate a tone of some seriousness and trust about music archiving, and this is a model article to learn what that is. Wiki wants to be the largest info database in the world. That won't happen if everytime you run into something YOU have never heard of in your given taste and you try to delete it. Google hits won't bring up even the Rolling Stone archives. It is quite hairy when you get into notable actors of the twenties: have to go to the Bison Archives. So, I appreciate the maturity of people really interested in music archiving, but this does get goofy. The African heritage thing seems to be inciting something, too, and gosh, after months, the moment I put that up, there is a sudden problem - literally within the hour. Then, there is the Christian thing. Hey, folks, show some manners on the religious affiliation. This is an encyclopedia of the folk sort, anyone can edit, be an administrator, and it seems to open up the whole thing to reckless behavior and poor research models. Normal encyclopedias seek out and only hire the special specialists in each given genre (say, here, Mike Knott would be that), to write the entry for the given subject, but here you have anybody who can type knocking whatever they have never heard of and using models of research that don't fit the given entry, and tantrums and pseudo-intellectualism. I don't care either way about the article because it isn't locked and is part of a folk experiment that is causing a lot of people to withdraw because articles are constantly defaced. Everyone from Bill Gates, to the Country of Germany, to the Prime Minister of NOrway has had thier entry defaced and some with claims they are pedophiles and all kinds of garbage. Every five minutes the thing is a wreck ...and it doesn't look like it is going to stop. Record Co. websites are locked and the KH project will have that. This is just an experimental folk thing. Will it get better&#160;? Maybe not. I don't care either way.

<li>If it is possible to adequately convey specific origami folds through <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origami_techniques.html" title="Origami techniques">Origami_techniques</a>, then, as the main contributor to these pages, I support the deletion of both pages. I believe, however, that if a user of Wikipedia were to search specifically for <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origami_techniques.html" title="Origami techniques">Origami_techniques</a>, then they would be presented with a general idea with a certain vagueness, but not real information. If these pages are deleted, I think that it is imperative that the section to which they are redirected provides more resources and detail. I would also like to mention that the phrase "unencyclopedic crap" is mildly offensive and immediately put me into a defensive state. I would appreciate it if work is considered as time and energy spent rather than the quality (which is subjective) that you see in the entry.</li>

<p><b>Keep</b>. I'll bite. Annoying as Kristopher may be, the article asserts, with apparently verifiable sources, that she writes regularly "in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more." And writing regularly for the <a href="../../../w/w/d/WWD_3c06.html" title="WWD">WWD</a> group is a pretty clear signal of notability. So what's the case for deletion, since <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page"><b>vanity by itself is not a basis for deletion</b></a>. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 18:27, 11 February 2006 (UTC) P.S. It would, of course, be malicious and inappropriate, not to mention being an object lesson, to make one's decision based on the expectation that, since Kristopher is required to release her copyright on her publicity photo under GFDL, it would soon enough appear in phone sex advertising all over metro LA . . .</p>

<li>Difficult one, but an Armenian folk singer who died in the 1980s seems to be just the kind of thing where Google can not be expected to be of much help (transcription issues have to be taken into account as well). We really need somebody with a knowledge of Armenian and access to good printed sources to check this one. I wish we had a way of moving this type of article to a holding area for future checking. Is there an Armenian wikiproject that could keep this as a subpage? If there is, move it there. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 21:18, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article is objectively written and contains specificity to the Armenian arts.

The validity of this article can be verified by inquiries from the Public Radio and Television of the Republic of Armenia.

<li><b>Comment</b> — The fact that the article is listed on the AFD is <b>not</b> a "Serious violation", as you have put it. It simply brings the article to light that it was poorly sourced. The concensus so far seems to be that this is a noteworthy article. However, it was poorly written, which was why it was listed in the first place. In the original (and current) versions, where are the links to the "Public Radio and Television of the Republic of Armenia"? As you are the creating editor, it should be your duty to prove to the community that the subject is notable, and not for the people to find out for themselves. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKareeser_8b5c.html" title="User:Kareeser">Kareeser</a>|<sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKareeser_7817.html" title="User talk:Kareeser">Talk!</a></sup> 06:34, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I am the author of the article, and an Armenian by ethnicity. I have observed many articles on Armenia and Armenians on the pages of Wikipedia, many of which contain distortions of historical facts, are not only poorly written but also create fictions on a given subject. The information contained in this article is factual and verifiable. Moreover, all this information exists in the documentary archives of the Armenian Public Radio and Television. However, because the artist lived before the worldwide web became available in Armenia, these sources were not digitized. All that exists on the internet for this artist are his own recordings remastered by the official permission of the Public Radio and Television of Armenia to make these works massively available. There have also been different opinions on the artist's activity throughout the worldwide web. However, the main sources, which I used to write the article, are the numerous articles about Norayr Mnatsakanyan in different Armenian language periodicals of Soviet Armenia. Almost all of these are not in circulation any longer and consequently have no appropriate websites. I also used the programs and the video footage by the Public Television of Armenia about the artist, which is not available online either. As for the article being poorly written, perhaps, it does not reflect the conventions set up by Wikipedia. At the same time, however, it adequately and insightfully presents the artist to the Wikipedia reader in its theamtic specificity. Not only your consensus but also the consensus of the entire Armenian nation will prove to anyone the notability of this artist. I will welcome any suggestions and/or help to properly edit the article and appropriate it to your norms.
<ul>
<li>All you really need to do is to list all the published sources (articles in periodicals etc.) you have used under a header called "References" in a way which makes it possible for anyone to locate the publications. That will make it easy for anyone to verify the content. (Or at least for anyone reading Armenian - you may consider giving references to some Russian language sources, if any are available, as Russian is more widely read.) The <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a> in Wikipedia often makes it difficult for the average reader to understand the significance of some topics, as the necessary cultural context (other articles on related topics) is missing. This leads to this type of discussion, but as long as a good case can be made for the notability of a specific topic, it will survive. Don't let this discussion scare you away, and please continue to contribute to the coverage of Armenian culture on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 09:49, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I will undertake all the necessary changes for the article. I have technical issues with the refernce section. As you may have seen, I have added the links for both the Armenian Public Radio and Television. However, the literary, and general-circulation periodicals, which wrote about the artist are no longer in circulation. Naturally, the latter have no websites. I can simply provide a bibliography page for the article. The interested readers may refer to the websites in the External Links section, which leads to the artist's albums and several online articles and fora where he has been mentioned.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps you can find online publications of the journals. I know universities have scanned or transcripted journals online or in storage. Perhaps you can check for the "hard" copies there. At any rate, you've prove your point, and I now change my vote to <i>Keep</i>. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKareeser_8b5c.html" title="User:Kareeser">Kareeser</a>|<sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKareeser_7817.html" title="User talk:Kareeser">Talk!</a></sup> 16:21, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Kareeser, thank you for your decision to withdraw your vote for this article's deletion. The hard copies are all available and I can provide an official bibliography for them and have them translated into English to prove my point further and justify the expectations of the Wikipedia community. Again, many thanks!</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Just because you don't see any 'redeeming value' in the article doesn't mean it's not worth having. If that were the case, I could find several articles that most people would find 'redeeming' and I do not. It's not like the article is comprised of, "O RLY? YA RLY! NO WAI! LOLOLOLOL!". For an article about an internet meme, it's quite informative, well-constructed, and complete.

<dd>My point exactly. Just today I remembered a show I watched when I was little called Zoobilee Zoo. When I looked it up on wikipedia there was only a picture and some brief information about it, but that's all I wanted. O RLY might not be much more than a picture of some owl and a short blurb about it, but people will hear it being used and they will come to this site to find an unbiased answer on what it is.

<li><b>comment</b> Oddly enough, they may be notable. The places are certainly real - they are in Pakistan. The parent tribe given, <a href="../../../d/a/u/Daulat_Khel_ed08.html" title="Daulat Khel">Daulat Khel</a>, exists and has an article here on WP. They are Pashtuns. It certainly should <i>not</i> be hyphenated - but if the tribe exists it is either misspelled or not much exposure on the Internet. Did you Google the individual names? There is so little information given in the article, it is hard to be sure one has found a match. There seem to be a million Zahid Khans, it is a common last name, but some of the names are first/middle/last and we may be able to make sense of this given time. There are a lot of Khans here <a href="http://www.contactpakistan.com/ExplorePakistan/derawerfort.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.contactpakistan.com/ExplorePakistan/derawerfort.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, for example, some of the names match.

I just tire of coming to wikipedia and seeing articles for minorly important people who offer great claims of notability. This article is clearly not one of those, but i'm sure you all understand my frustration with people who create articles about somebody just because they played semi-pro baseball or ran in a state election, etc. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 21:35, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

The sole claims of visibility/notability seem to be around membership and/or traffic yet the site's <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=2y&amp;size=medium&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=t&amp;url=offtopic.com#top" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=2y&amp;size=medium&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=t&amp;url=offtopic.com#top" rel="nofollow">Alexa ranking</a> is fluctuating around 10,000.

<li>That is more of a personal attack than relevant to this question: the notability of the article does not depend on the WP-savvy of the advocates, nor even on their character. And please amplify why es: but not en: -- IMO, the assertion of relevance to English-speaking people, even if it is primarily via their command of Spanish, supports notability to en:. Also the apparent impact on how things are done in two predominantly English-speaking markets, and in another where English is, i assume, an extremely widely spoken second language.</li>

<p>For another of thousands of example tha prove my point, see: <a href="../../../r/o/b/Roberto_Gonz%C3%A1lez_Nieves_0cdc.html" title="Roberto González Nieves">Roberto González Nieves</a></p>
<p>His real name or birth name is Jimmey Nievez, but he is Known in the industry , the media, and by his fans as <b>Jimmy Nieves</b>. It's like <a href="../../../d/a/d/Daddy_Yankee_b6fa.html" title="Daddy Yankee">Daddy Yankee</a> (Raymond Ayala), <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wayne_22ff.html" title="John Wayne">John Wayne</a> was born Marion Robert Morrison, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Monroe_4162.html" title="Marilyn Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> (born Norma Jeane Mortensen),<a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Cruise_61a0.html" title="Tom Cruise">Tom Cruise</a> is the stage name of {Thomas Cruise Mapother IV) and thousands of others... Can you imagen? With that name {Thomas Cruise Mapother IV) Tom, would never be famous!</p>
<p>My point is that he should be included in the English-speaking Wikipedia, encyclopedia as <b><a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Nieves_2c98.html" title="Jimmy Nieves">Jimmy Nieves</a></b>.</p>
<p>Also <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Nieves_2c98.html" title="Jimmy Nieves">Jimmy Nieves</a>, was born in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> (USA-Citizen), and speaks fluent English. He is a <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_American_e5d8.html" title="North American">North American</a> son of <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rican_ff02.html" title="Puerto Rican">Puerto Rican</a> emigrants. Remember that the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> was was formed by <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emigrants.html" title="Emigrants">emigrants</a>.</p>
<p>Isn't that enough?</p>
<p>Well here I have more references... "Enjoy":</p>
<p>But it is undeniable that as a result of the Spanish-American War in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1898.html" title="1898">1898</a> and the eventual transfer from Spanish Colony to US sovereignty (1898-1952) to Commonwealth (1952-present), the majority of the people of Puerto Rico feel pride in their nationality as "Puerto Ricans", regardless of the individual's particular racial, ethnic, political or economic background.</p>
<p>Asked about whether she felt Puerto Rican or not by a popular men's magazine, New York native model and rap singer <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloria_Velez_9f68.html" title="Gloria Velez">Gloria Velez</a> declared that "(she) was born in Long Island, (her parents) were born in New York, but (her) grandparents were born in Puerto Rico, so (she is) 100 percent Puerto Rican". Also, there are many of those who are half Puerto Rican that have publicly stated their pride in being Puerto Ricans, such is the case of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freddie_Prinze_ae0c.html" title="Freddie Prinze">Freddie Prinze</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Orlando_7a31.html" title="Tony Orlando">Tony Orlando</a>, <b><a href="../../../s/a/m/Sammy_Davis%2C_Jr._4834.html" title="Sammy Davis, Jr.">Sammy Davis, Jr.</a></b>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freddie_Prinze_Jr_5ff1.html" title="Freddie Prinze Jr">Freddie Prinze Jr</a>., and <a href="../../../g/e/r/Geraldo_Rivera_5c46.html" title="Geraldo Rivera">Geraldo Rivera</a>. This is a feeling shared by most (if not all) Puerto Ricans born outside Puerto Rico. <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilfred_Benitez_0add.html" title="Wilfred Benitez">Wilfred Benitez</a> is another famous person who was not born in Puerto Rico but feels proud of being Puerto Rican. Many others are proud to be American citizens as well.</p>
<p>Some Puerto Ricans also refer to themselves as "Boricua." This term comes from the word "Boriken" (Borínquen) which was what the Taíno Indians called the Island of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p><b>C'mon now tell me your also going to take out <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sammy_Davis%2C_Jr._4834.html" title="Sammy Davis, Jr.">Sammy Davis, Jr.</a>, from the English-speaking Wikipedia, encyclopedia.</b></p>
<p>By the way <a href="../../../j/l/o/JLO_4aac.html" title="JLO">JLO</a> (<a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_L%C3%B3pez_d6b8.html" title="Jennifer López">Jennifer López</a>) is also half Puerto Rican.

<ul>
<li>Actually, no, I personally don't think she is, but that's just me. And I agree with Zoe, he doesn't seem to be notable at all. And as someone mentioned above, we do have other hispanics mentioned here, some even with stage names (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Sheen_cfb0.html" title="Martin Sheen">Martin Sheen</a> comes to mind). If the article on Jimmy Nievez (or whatever) doesn't stand here, it's because he's not notable, not because there's some hidden agenda by anyone. <b>Strong delete.</b>--<font color="#4B0082"><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">み使い</a></b></font> <i><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitsukai_5376.html" title="User talk:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a></b></i> 16:07, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Jimmy Nieves with more than 20+ years of carrear in the Radio and TV Broadcasting industry and awarded by NYMRAD (Morning Stars 2005) and The New York Metro Air Awards, is very notable.

<p>Also remember that NYC, is ranked the (<a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbitron.html" title="Arbitron">Arbitron</a>) # 1, Radio Market in the world. Only the best make it and Jimmy Nieves, made it in "Big Apple"!</p>
<p>The 6:00 to 10:00 am. slot (Morning Show), is the prime time and most competitive daypart of any station. In New York you go against the best including <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Stern_a7e1.html" title="Howard Stern">Howard Stern</a>.</p>

<p>Tagged for {prod} but disputed, bringing here instead. From the article: “Sped” is a term, largely incomprehensible outside of the American state of Maryland, combining the words “Special Education.” Its use can be either derogatory or can be considered educational jargon. Er, right. Mostly a series of what looks suspiciously like insults.

<li><b>Delete</b>, but for different reasons than Guy suggests. I think the word is more common outside Maryland than the article's author realizes. But <a href="../../../s/p/e/Sped.html" title="Sped">Sped</a> currently redirects to <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speed.html" title="Speed">Speed</a>, which has a link at the top to <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_education.html" title="Special education">Special education</a>. I think that's enough info on "sped" for Wikipedia. I can't see anyone looking up "Sped (disambiguation)" without having first looked up "sped". --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 23:13, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am from Maryland and am very familiar with this term as it is described in the article. I will attempt to find some sources so as to verify it, but I can tell you that it is true. This was not "made up in school one day." The kids there have been saying it since <b>I</b> was in gradeschool, and I have yet to hear of it in any other state. History21</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As a Maryland resident, an educator, and a grandmother, I can certify that use of this word is widespread among the youth. I do not know how widespread it is in other states. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Joan53 (<a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoan53_ad90.html" title="User talk:Joan53">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Joan53_aac1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Joan53">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>Here is what I (a Unununium author) sad to say on Unununium's mailing list:</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Well, I can't say much about the current Uuu page on wikipedia. It's pretty much a copy of unununium.org, and much of it is inacurate or dated. As the page exists, it is nonnotable. As the FAQ says explicitly, the value of Unununium is not in its software, but in its ideas. I think wikipedia, and humanity in general would be better served by improving articles on ideas Unununium touches: orthogonal persistence, programming systems, user interface. If there is a Unununium page, it probably belongs more in some "never implemented ideas" section than "software".</i></p>
<p>That said, as shown by the current development pace of Unununium, I don't exactly have time to make these edits; I hardly have time to maintain unununium.org. <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitglue_b7d7.html" title="User:Bitglue">Bitglue</a> 16:02, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
