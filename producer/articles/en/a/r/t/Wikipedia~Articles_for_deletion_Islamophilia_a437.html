<p>It seems many people are voting here before even reading the article, or doing sufficient research on the subject. The article is not about justifiying a point of view. It DOES NOT, or atleast is not meant to justify <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">islamophobia</a> or attacking Islam. It just describes a term being used increasingly by certain European politicians, sociologists and journalists. Please read the article, help making it NPOV and reconsider your vote.</p>
<p>AGAIN, THE USE OF ISLAMOPHILIA BY PROPONENTS MIGHT BE UNJUSTIFIED. BUT THAT IS NOT THE POINT HERE.

<li><b>Keep (BloodOfThePoet)</b>Since "Islamophobic/Islamophobia" exists in the popular consciousness, the world press, and the educational establishment -and is gaining ground in the approved lexicon, there is a need to explore its conceptual antithesis, for a host of reasons: including the analytical, political, aesthetic, religious, philosophical, linguistic and even the counter-propagandistic. I commend the article writer, since, in contrast with at least 75% of what gets accepted in the Wikipedia 'canon', this submission is commendably researched, factually reinforced, literate, and, considering the comments for deleting it (a revealingly passionate compendium of reinforcing "interests" in something usually deadeningly dry and stultifyingly neutral like the discussion of a neologism), has hit such a nerve, that, for this reason alone, "Islamophila" deserves to remain. It will draw many new eyes to Wikipedi, and will allow scholars to fulfill their proper function of expanding the understanding of the human intellectual experiment. I find nothing offensive, anti-religious, biased, bigoted or improper with this article or this ingenious coinage. Keep it, and let it become enriched as the understanding of the word, and is roots, deepen in the interpenetration of cultures, "East" and "West". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.20.176.72 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.20.176.72_0161.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.20.176.72">contribs</a>) 04:05, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Keep (sockpuppet)</b> This is a useful article that would benefit from more editing and contributions rather than removal. Just look at the amount of blind islamophilia that is doing rounds these days. Do a google search if you think it is neologism.

<li><b>Keep</b> Of course my POV is biased as I am a major contributor to this page. Islamophilia is a neologism, as is islamophobia. I have rewritten the page to make it more NPOV. Critics are invited to improve the quality of the page as they seem fit. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGermen_af5f.html" title="User:Germen">Germen</a> 15:38, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is not an anti-islam propaganda article. It just describes people who try to atribute unreasonable characteristics to islam, and actually end up doing harm to Islam, for example, claiming that the Quran contains new scientific theories in a cryptic form, which, if decoded, can change the world, etc. I can understand that islamophiles would love to see such an article deleted, since they love to whitewash anything that THEY THINK reflects badly on Islam, or stops short of attributing to Islam all the best qualities possible.

<li><b>Keep (sockpuppet)</b> STOP ATTACHING SOCKPUPPET TO MY NAME, I only voted once! Either merge stub with related article or keep independent with expectation of expansion. Shouldn't be allowed to fall victim to PC reactionism.

<li><b>Edit:</b> Accusations of 'Sockpuppets' are underhanded attempts to negate votes. The reason the votes are in close proximity is because this Wiki entry has found its way onto a couple of forums. I removed 'sockpuppet' from my entry and included my wiki nickname. I find this tactic very cheap and not in the spirit of wiki. --UlulatingIdiota

<li><b>Keep</b> <i>(sockpuppet)</i> The vote of the Muslims about Islam is generally charged with emotions and subjectivity.

<li><b>Keep - with overhaul (sockpuppet)</b> The premise that the feeling of <i>Islamophilia</i> must inherently be irrational is incorrect. There are Sinophiles who love China and Chinese culture and Francophiles who love France and French culture. I have never heard these <i>philes</i> described as irrational.</li>

<li><b>Keep but overhaul</b> - The article is meant to describe a certain ideology, not to "target" it. Unfortunately, the article is defintely not NPOV in its present form, and was probably written as a reaction to the POV article on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">islamophobia</a>. However, I don't see how it is "irrational." Semitophilia does not exist, so there is no article on it. This cannot be said about Islamophilia which is a reasonably popular ideology. A small example is <a href="http://www.islam-is-the-only-solution.com/science.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.islam-is-the-only-solution.com/science.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> Although it needs to be overhauled, I am surprised that people want it (and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">islamophobia</a> )to be deleted. There is no dearth of articles on wikipedia which produce less than 10 google results, and I checked on FAQs that low google hits is not a sufficient reason for deletion. The term has a very healthy web search to group search ratio on google, so it doesn't seem to be promoted by any one particular group. I don't think it is not a good idea to delete articles simply because in their present form they are POV. There's a POV tag for that. Also, google "Islamophilie" (French for Islamophilia) and you'll get many more hits, and some pages belong to the 90s, even before September 11, etc, so the term is not very new either. ~~deeptrivia</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - The differences between the word "Islamophobia" and "Islamophilia": "Islamophobia" is actually used (Google search for Islamophilia: 215 results; for Islamophobia: 119,000 — obviously the latter is the real word); the article about it does not overflow with bias. As for the argument that an article about "Islamophilia" makes it "fair" to have an article about Islamophobia: I see no "Semitophilia" articles! No "homophilia" articles (simply redirection to the homosexuality page). An encyclopedia cannot contain this bias. No "Islamophilia" nonsense, please. What you define as being "Islamophilic" is simply following Islam. And to call Islam, or any religion, "irrational" is biased and stepping out of the role of an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmiellaiendiay_0236.html" title="User:Emiellaiendiay">Emiellaiendiay</a> 10:36 a.m., 12 June 2005</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> <i>(sockpuppet)</i> - This article is completely irrational and serves no useful purpose. It is inherently biased because it targets a specific ideology. As already said, there are no articles on "Semitophilia", "homophilia", etc. This article tries to pathologize the followers of Islam and non-Muslims who are tolerant of Islam and Muslims. Moreover, this article is unscholarly. It should be deleted.</li>

<li>I got over 200 in English for <b>Islamophilia.</b> This is more of a European word, so you get many more in French, Dutch, etc. For proving that the concept does exist, it suffices to show its use in any language. So, just because the results are in French/Dutch doesn't mean an article on it should not be in English Wikipedia. I don't know other European languages so haven't searched in other languages. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">User:deeptrivia</a></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - This is a neologism with no clear definition. Definitely would involve original research. Islamophile is a legitimate dict. def. about someone who tries to learn about Islam but to say <i>Islamophilia is the attribution of positive qualities to Islam, Muslims or the Islamic civilization, beyond what can be rationally attributed</i> is incredibly subjective and does not have to do with the suffix -phile. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 03:58, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Islamophobia is fear of Islam, that can be of any kind of Islam. Islamophilia takes a specific definition of Islam and compares someone's views on Islam to that. Therefore there is a necessary definition of what Islam "truly is" and then you are complaiming that someone's view <i>and interpretation</i> of Islam is illegitimate. That is the subjectivity I speak of. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 03:58, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Gren, 'Islamophobia' is partisan as well. Fear and hate are subjective.

<li><b>Point of order</b> - I was of the understanding, indeed I was told as much, that only registered users votes' count. When I voted as an anon, way back when, I was told to reg-up and vote again, because my vote would not count. Was I mis-informed, do Un-regged vites by anon users count, or are there a fair amount of votes here not to be counted? --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup>

<li>Jsaid2009 This request for a deletion is based on several logical fallacies. The first is called Argumentum ad Numerum - because more people share the opinion, it somehow must be right. Because Islamophobia garners more google hits than Islamophillia, it must be true. Before Copernicus, the earth was flat because more people believed it. The second argument is equally invalid. I see no Naziphobia or Naziphillia, therefore everyone has no interest in the idealogical system of Nazism?
