<li><b>Keep</b> I agree on that it isn't the best article in the world, and I agree on your second point as well. I found this article because I was told to search for it a while back. But the point is it's an article, and its getting bigger. Plus, this has already been discussed. Twice. Let it be. Maybe if someone wants to know where it says in the bible not hit someone in the groin they can turn to wikipedia.--<a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeomMai_464d.html" title="User:AeomMai">AeomMai</a> 20:51, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I gotta go with keep. For some reason or another, a couple of months ago I read this article. I forget why but, I dont see why it needs to be deleted. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">Chris Kreider</a> 15:17, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, has as much merit for inclusion as any other martial arts technique, and being revered in juvenile behavior has no bearing to its legitimacy.

<li><b>Delete</b>. <i><b>Not one single source has been cited, except a Bible verse.</b></i> I have no problem with the topic choice, just with the quality of the article. In my short time on Wikipedia I have seen several really bad articles about very appropriate subjects. When they get nominated for AfD someone usually comes along and works on the articles to make them better-- improved grammar, more neutral language, some really excellent citations, etc. That hasn't happened with the poor little defenseless groin attack. This is a very readable article, but we have no way of knowing if it is just original research or worse, a copyright violation. Unless there is a real threat of deletion I doubt that anyone will come along and clean up the problems. How long has it been without a cleanup and a fixup even after it was called to everyone's attention? If no one's going to give it the much-needed improvements it shouldn't stay here. Notability isn't the only criterion. <i>I'd wager any one of the men on Wikipedia who has ever been a victim of a groin attack is going to urgently insist that it was notable</i>.<a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 00:05, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>AFD is not cleanup, and {{<a href="../../../s/o/f/Template%7ESofixit_b7f1.html" title="Template:Sofixit">sofixit</a>}} applies. If you want the article free of original research, take pages 70/72/147/194 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0804818762</a>, pages 3–4 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1581601387</a>, page 40 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0275958620</a>, and page 31 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 087364168X</a> in hand, and make it free of original research yourself. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:07, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> It should have been on cleanup notice, but I don't see that it has. The article is a mess. I am not the appropriate person to write for this article. It appears that no one is available to make the article suitable for keeping on Wikipedia regardless of the notability of the subject. When someone writes an article on this subject with proper research and properly cited sources, I'll be strongly in favor of keeping it. Until then, it doesn't belong here.<a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 00:36, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
