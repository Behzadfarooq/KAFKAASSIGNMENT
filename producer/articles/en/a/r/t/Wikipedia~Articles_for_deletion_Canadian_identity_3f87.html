<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Had I known beforehand that the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_identity.html" title="Canadian identity">Canadian identity</a> was on the block to be deleted, I would have objected.... Here are the reasons I propose to keep it...:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Length - most articles listed on <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a>, in my quick random survey, are short - a sentence to two paragraphs. <b>Canadian identity</b> was considerably longer. The length also supports that it is more than some random user’s vanity page, and has been a collaborative effort, one of the main goals of Wikipedia..</li>
<li>Notability - Canada is indeed notable (I hope no one would dispute that). I agree that the question “What does it mean to be a Canadian?” is a slightly different topic, but I would suggest that it is a question that is fundamental to the country. From the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolution_bd44.html" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a> on, the simple answer was “not American.” Why was Canada formed? In part, to keep from becoming American. The same reason is why <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> joined confederation, why the west (now <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberta.html" title="Alberta">Alberta</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan.html" title="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba.html" title="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>) was the subject of a huge drive on the part of the Canadian government to be settled, and why the <a href="../../../y/u/k/Yukon_Territory_2a75.html" title="Yukon Territory">Yukon Territory</a> was formed. <i>See also <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_confederation.html" title="Canadian confederation">Canadian confederation</a></i>. Canada is also special in the fact that its boundaries were not defined by war, ethic group, or common history, like most other nations (Europe, especially comes to mind).</li>
<li>POV - it doesn’t surprise me that the article comes across without a NPOV. By vary nature, the article implies a point of view, because it is about how Canadians see themselves. As noted above, not being American is an important part of that. <i>See “Mild anti-Americanism” in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_literature.html" title="Canadian literature">Canadian literature</a> and the article on <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molson.html" title="Molson">Molson’s</a> <a href="../../../i/_/a/I_am_Canadian_13fe.html" title="I am Canadian">I am Canadian</a> commercials.</i> I would welcome anyone to edit out the POV, but I would challenge them to do so without removing the facts. In any case, the mild POV throughout does not seem to cloud the message</li>
<li>Uniqueness of topic - as you noted, the material here does not readily fit elsewhere. The topic is complex enough to require its own article, as demonstrated by its length. I read the articles that you suggested the material should be in, and found no significant overlap.</li>
<li>Accuracy - this, above all, it what impressed me most about the article - it explained what it means to be Canadian in a clear, concise, and accurate manner. It is the sort of article I would point my American friends to. The clear explanation in and of itself is reason enough, in my mind, to keep the article.</li>
<li>Suggestions for expansion/improvement (things I would be willing to undertake):
<ul>
<li>how the adoption of the maple leaf flag <i>see <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" title="Image:Flag of Canada.svg">Image:Flag of Canada.svg</a></i> has made the maple leaf <b>the</b> Canadian symbol
<ul>
<li>how the maple leaf (or Canadian flag) is frequently attached by Canadian travelers to their backpacks to keep from being mistaken for Americans, who are stereotypically loud and rude</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>British ties, their influence on things such as architecture (I’m thinking of <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria.html" title="Victoria">Victoria</a>) and parliament</li>
<li>differences between French and Quebecois culture</li>
<li>folk songs such as <i>I’s the b’y</i></li>
<li>issues with a united country and culture over the vast distance (it’s over 5000km from <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._John%27s%2C_Newfoundland_and_Labrador_2caf.html" title="St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador">St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador</a> to Victoria, BC)</li>
<li>insuring relevant articles have a link to <i>Canadian identity</i> and the <i>see also</i> section at the end of the article remains relevant</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the article definitely needs some cleaning, may have some mild POV-flavouring and so forth, but that's hardly a pair of criterion for deleting it. Rather, those are criteria for <i>improving</i> it.</li>

<dd>The article topic is perfectly encyclopaedic</dd>
<dd>Large sections of the article are well sourced and referenced. Some parts may not be, but let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater.</dd>
<dd>The claim that the information is also in other articles is wholly irrelevent. If article A and article B have the same content, they should be merged. But if the information in article A can be found scattered across articles B through Z, it makes sense to also have article A, rather than forcing users to scour 25 articles looking for information on a single topic. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:30, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> this is nothing more than an OR rambling social commentary. I highly doubt that any authoritative source has grasped what "Canadian identity" is, and any attempt at doing so is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a>. The references provided are, I imagine, <i>also</i> personal and explorative meanderings on the subject, and we cannot base an encyclopedia article on this. Also, at most 3 of them relate directly to the topic at hand, maybe just 1. The article is also riddled with weasel words to account for the lack of academic backing "Many Canadians believe...", "Canadians often like to see themselves as brave warriors", etc. In short, the article is hopelessly and irrevocably OR. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 18:41, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Reporting Pierre Burton's thoughts on what it is to be Canadian is hardly OR, same goes for Robertson Davies. If you have problems with <i>parts</i> of the article, article them and work on it, but to delete this article is just cutting off your nose to spite your face. <i>Parts</i> of it may fail <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, but the <i>article</i> does <b>not</b> overall. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:49, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> per nom and AdamBiswanger1. This is an <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essay.html" title="Essay">essay</a> masquerading as an encyclopedia entry. It is far too subjective and personal. What constitutes "Canadian identity" mostly a matter of opinion, speculation and conjecture. "Canadian identity" pretty much varies from province to province, region to region and, in many respects, from person to person. Many of the sources cited are opinions in and of themselves. That does not make the statements in the article relying upon those sources factual. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 21:06, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I agree. If the issue is with the POV, it needs a discussion on the talk page, not to be listed on AfD. Canadian identity is unique, it's not American, and it's not British, but a combonation of many different cultures and traditions. -<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalguard11_b1fa.html" title="User:Royalguard11">Royalguard11</a><sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalguard11_4f58.html" title="User talk:Royalguard11">Talk</a></sup> 21:55, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Canadian identity doesn't exist. Neither does American identity or British identity or French identity.

<dd>I believe that there is a seperate Canadian identity. One we've tried to define for 139 years. The main reason we try to make sure people know is so we don't get mixed up with our neighbour to the south. We don't like being called "American's" because we <i>aren't</i>. We have our own identity. In WWI and WWII, we tried to secure our own identity, seperate from the Brits. Now it's from the Yanks. -<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalguard11_b1fa.html" title="User:Royalguard11">Royalguard11</a><sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalguard11_4f58.html" title="User talk:Royalguard11">Talk</a></sup> 03:14, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Canadians' obsession with their own identity is one of their core characteristics.

<li><b>Keep</b> but shorten and rewrite from essay into article. BTW, Canada's borders were also established by war (see <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_and_Indian_War_3b82.html" title="French and Indian War">French and Indian War</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_1812.html" title="War of 1812">War of 1812</a>).

<li><b>Further Comment</b> I suppose a section at the top (of the article) should be added explaining the significance of the Canadian identity to Canadians. I think part of this comes down to a discussion of "soft" vs "hard" encyclodeadic enteries. By hard, I mean things like <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon.html" title="Carbon">Carbon</a>, something that is defined by facts and figures; by soft, I's refering to topics which are defined by ideas (perhaps like <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-concept.html" title="Self-concept">Self-concept</a>). Much policy on Wikipedia seems to have been developed regarding what "hard" topics should and should not be included, but I haven't read anything on the policy of which "soft" topics to include. If someone is aware of such a policy, could they point me there?

<li>Throw the baby out with the bath water? Heall yeah! and throw it far far away and make sure its dead. The article is so unencyclopaedic its not even funny.</li>
<li>By no means does it "explain what it means to be Canadian in a clear, concise, and accurate manner", in fact it does the opposite, pushing an insulting false representation of Canadians everywhere. I would be ashamed to show this to any of my American acquaintances.</li>
<li>The very suggestion that this specific "<a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_identity.html" title="Canadian identity">Canadian identity</a>" exists is POV itself, and best described as superficial make-belief (this coming from a proud Canadian).</li>
<li>There is no single so-called "Canadian identity", and if you make one for every possible imaginable group, (i.e. Canadian identy (terrorists), Canadian identy (right wingers), Canadian identity (socialists)), where are you going to stop? Are you going to do it for every country? Allowing this article to continue to exist sets a terrible precedence for Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Again, most, if not all of it is redundant given that the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Canada_29c8.html" title="Culture of Canada">Culture of Canada</a> article already exists.

<li>For one thing, I don't see why <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_identity.html" title="Canadian identity">Canadian identity</a> merits an article, if things like French identity, British identity, Polish identity, etc., don't.
