<p>Original editor of this page posted this on the article talk, I've left them a note about this page being the best place to discuss this right now - pasting in what they had to say below: (<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerel_7ff5.html" title="User:Perel">Perel</a> 20:26, 1 December 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>Please notice and read this clarification of my assertion</p>
<p>The article on Breaks itself makes the point that breakdown and break are distinct. Has anybody read it??? What is missed here by those recommending to move is that hip hop would not have developed from breaks alone: they are simply too short to use for the purpose intended in hip hop music. Only an extremely skilled DJ cutting at lightning speed could use breaks and not breakdown sections! It had to be the breakdown sections which were used, else the hip hop era could not feasibly have begun until after the era of digital audio, capiche??If this is accepted, then Breakdown Section becomes the parent concept of hip hop musical culture and must have unique placement to avoid screwing up the whole lineage. Also, I can elaborate on breakdown sections and I'm only one user of the Wiki. (see the artist Lime page for some further ideas which can be placed in breakdown section, there are far more I assure you, such as dance records without noticable breakdown sections, breakdown sections which themselves became SONGS (Ride on Time by Black Box and Rapper's Delight come to mind right off the cuff). I am frustrated because the people who want to mess with this language simply don't understand it and yet are voting for deletion less than a day after i posted this, in fact someone wanted to delete it right away! C'mon people, how about we all LEARN something from the WIKI! I am sorry for the tone but this is my first editing dispute and I am incredibly frustrated by the lack of advocates and the haste of my opponents. I thank you all for your consideration and for Wiki-ing in the first place.--Tednor 18:07, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep, expand</b> Alumni lists are more useful in some ways than alumni categories - more easily customizable for sorting and writing summary notes, and easier to manage and expand.

<li>THat is very nice. Good job. But I don't think USF's famous alumni article is long enough to warrant that kind of treatment at this time.

<dd>The place I know to find a definition of what "non-trivial" means in this context is <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, where we read: "<i>Triviality is a measure of the depth of content contained in the published work, exclusive of mere directory entry information, and how directly it addresses the subject.</i>" The sources in question directly address the subject, but the information we gain from them is quite close to the "non-trivial" line, as I see it. We learn what office Mr. Hilton holds, and that he ran for Parliament in 2005, and lost. That's it. I don't see any evidence that his various blogs are notable, seeing as no independent source mentions them. We could write a very short verifiable article on this guy.

<li><b>Delete</b> I agree with <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> that major-party candidates for national legislatures are often notable, but not when they are standing for a seat which they are obviously going to lose. Opposition candidates in safe seats are generally either local people of no note otherwise, or up-and-coming wannabes (like Hilton). In a few years time this man could be influential and more well-known, but then so could anyone. Presumption of future fame should not count as 'notability'. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Graves_78e0.html" title="User:Nick Graves">Nick Graves</a> is right about his coverage in the guardian - it is ridiculously pitiful - one line reading "Not currently an MP." He does not even seem to have a presence in his local press as a Councillor, so clearly he cannot be too important there either. Finally, the article about "RecessMonkey" was already merged with <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">Blog</a> after a decision that it was insufficiently notable to merit an article by itself. <a href="../../../d/r/k/User%7EDrKiernan_4f47.html" title="User:DrKiernan">DrKiernan</a> 11:04, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Just to add to the above post - Hilton stood in Canterbury in the 2005 election, and the seat has been solidly Conservative ever since it became a single-member constituency in the late 1800s. Never elected any other party candidate since - and in fact has the record for the longest one-party representation. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGretnagod_0e96.html" title="User:Gretnagod">Gretnagod</a> 15:59, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Prod" itself asserts this is not a policy: Nice suggestion, but no value. Now you drop a guideline: Possible conflict of interest with what? You can't just just drop templates on pages and run without leaving specifics! Don't you read the policy? You want more editors on this article? What are you trying to do, save 128 bytes of disk space? This article is not a self promotion. This is a cool program that needs mentioning. This is not vanity. It sure would be nice to know how to defend the article when you just use a BOT to drop templates on pages that show up on the WikiAdmin monitor, but you really should give some specifics. You did the same thing with your PROD template. I'm thinking "overactive admin" here. Come on, what's your hard-on for?

<li><b>Delete</b> - This was originally the page for both <a href="../../../n/g/c/NGC_1531_1d92.html" title="NGC 1531">NGC 1531</a> and <a href="../../../n/g/c/NGC_1532_edcd.html" title="NGC 1532">NGC 1532</a>. I split the page into two separate articles. Afterwards, I needed to decide on what to do with NGC 1531 and NGC 1532. I first turned it into a redirect to <a href="../../../n/g/c/NGC_1532_edcd.html" title="NGC 1532">NGC 1532</a> as a short-term solution, and then nominated the redirect for deletion. The nomination failed for two reasons: other editors thought that the edit history should be kept, and other editors thought that external links may still lead to NGC 1531 and NGC 1532. Afterwards, it was turned into a disambiguation page. I honestly do not think that the page or the edit history is needed. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Submillimeter_7547.html" title="User:Dr. Submillimeter">Dr. Submillimeter</a> 09:51, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The history needs to be kept for both articles. Merging history with just <a href="../../../n/g/c/NGC_1532_edcd.html" title="NGC 1532">NGC 1532</a> would create a GFDL issue for <a href="../../../n/g/c/NGC_1531_1d92.html" title="NGC 1531">NGC 1531</a> as there would be no record there of who contributed some of the original content that it came from. That could be remedied by coping the history page to the talk page of both articles or by merging to 1532 and making a note at 1531's talk page. But why bother? This isn't hurting anything. -- <a href="../../../j/l/a/User%7EJLaTondre_be65.html" title="User:JLaTondre">JLaTondre</a> 13:01, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> does the edit history need to be kept with both articles? I don't think so - I believe under GFDL we can merge the edit history to one article and be fine ...

<li>Content was moved from the original article to both articles. If we just merge to one, there is nothing indicating in the second article that Submillimeter wasn't the sole author of the content he added. I believe the history of each article needs to be able to be recreated as they can be exported individually. However, I'm no lawyer either. I know we have worse GFDL issues then this one, but I just don't see any harm in leaving this page. -- <a href="../../../j/l/a/User%7EJLaTondre_be65.html" title="User:JLaTondre">JLaTondre</a> 20:23, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - What about the material that currently exists at <a href="../../../n/g/c/NGC_1531_1d92.html" title="NGC 1531">NGC 1531</a> and <a href="../../../n/g/c/NGC_1532_edcd.html" title="NGC 1532">NGC 1532</a>? Those two articles contain referenced information, whereas NGC 1531 and NGC 1532 contained unreferenced information before the split. Moreover, the two separate articles currently contain different information; the infobox data and the "See also" links are different for the two entries, and <a href="../../../n/g/c/NGC_1532_edcd.html" title="NGC 1532">NGC 1532</a> contains an additional section that should not belong in <a href="../../../n/g/c/NGC_1531_1d92.html" title="NGC 1531">NGC 1531</a>. I would prefer to see this material preserved instead of the edit history. However, if both the material and edit history can be preserved, then I would find the plan satisfactory. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Submillimeter_7547.html" title="User:Dr. Submillimeter">Dr. Submillimeter</a> 11:32, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>(those being simply the first two potent-sounding search terms that caught my attention) suggest to me no great inflation by hits on his non-professional interests, but a competent and serious scientist who has not risen to notability, at least so far. (I can't, BTW, recall ever feeling so compelled -- perhaps via {<a href="http://www.ibnusina.utm.my/~hadi/index1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ibnusina.utm.my/~hadi/index1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ibnusina.utm.my/~hadi/index1.html</a> his science bio} -- in an AfD, let alone one where i'm the nom'er, to express my sense that i'd <i>personally</i> like having him as a WP colleague, or (very hypothetically) as a scientific one or other acquaintance.) I've no sense that he's a poseur or that he's done anything more discreditable than (if this is indeed an autobio) failing to grasp <i>instantly</i> what WP is about, but i think his notability is at best in the future.<br />

<li><b>Very weak delete</b> - taking his site at face value (and assuming good faith), I would barely conclude that he would satisfy <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> for Indonesia, but he is the author of the article itself, which is a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>.

<li>The purpose of CSD is to identify conditions that one admin, or one user of any status subject to the cooperation of one admin, can safely use to ID many articles whose deletion will not be controversial (thereby relieving the burden on AfD, &amp; on its kin for non-article pages). The AfD process patently shows this article to be controversial -- even tho the consensus for deletion is forming -- and the decision to <i>speedy</i> it would have been an error (tho we can foresee its AfD deletion).</li>
<li>The language (emphasis added) "this <i>can</i> be taken as a deletion request" was chosen even tho the language "is the equivalent of a shoot-to-kill-on-sight order" was clearer and available. If the page had been deleted while blanked, its speedy deletion would have been appropriate, but the original editor could then have started from scratch using the same title (in contrast to following an AfD deletion, since that is normally a decision that the topic the title implies is not suitable for an article). It was not deleted, and now it has become crystal clear that no such request was intended, and that the original editor has either reconsidered, or stuck to an intention to start from scratch, as is fully appropriate.</li>

<dd><b>comment</b> it seems to me that the lack of 2 or more additional references is not necessary if the person in question is notable at face value. That is to say, if through some stretch of the imagination the President of Cornell did not have 2 secondary sources discussing him, he is still the president of Cornell and deserves an entry. This does not address the question of whether the provost of a university is inherently notable.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 04:27, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> None of the names listed are given much justification. It's also something of an arbitrary grab-bag of non-mainstream religious thinking called "occult."

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. An essentially meaningless title, unless "occultism" figures in the music itself, in which case nigh every heavy metal band qualifies, regardless of whether the band members believe in that stuff; it's now a traditional theme. It might be more useful broken down into "Wiccan musicians" or "Scientologist musicians" or whatever belief system they practice. OTOH, I question whether it's right to call articles like this "unsourced" or "unverifiable" so long as a musician's beliefs are sourced and verified on their several pages; this is a compilation to assist browsers. At minimum, the article should discuss what the musicians believe. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:27, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think it's verifiable. I just think it's using "occult" in a vague, meaningless, catch-all way that's not very helpful. That could be fixed, but I'm not sure an unvague way of using the word "occult" is possible. If someone wants a List of Thelemite musicians, List of Wicca musicians, or List of Theosophist musicians I'd not object.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li><b>Comment</b> Go back to in the article history to the original text: "..Roman Battering rams were usually in the shape of a pentagonal prism. They were used for destroying big thinks such as walls or houses. They were immune to archery attack and very weak in defense against swordsman." and it is clearly either made up from scratch or from a game guide. Someone later tried to make it a little more factual, but still speculation.

<li><small><i>weeak keep</i></small>. I don't understand notability of DJs. But this one seems visible, if he doesn't lie. Like, from his website:
<dl>
<dd>His releases in 2004-2005</dd>
<dd>Randy Katana "One Solid Wave"</dd>
<dd>Number one on most Dutch dance charts. Also this track influenced the dance industry in such a way *the most trance tracks are now using a tribal beat instead of the usual "bass drum baseline back beat"</dd>
<dd>Randy Katana "In Silence"</dd>
<dd>Number one on most Dutch dance charts. First Dance smash on radio 538. Record of the year "www.Tranceaddict.com"</dd>
<dd>Randy Katana "Fancy Fair 2005"</dd>
<dd>Number one on most Dutch dance charts. Second Dance smash on radio 538. Reaching several commercial charts like Dutch top 100 nr. 43, Slam FM top 40 nr 8. Dutch top 50 nr. 43.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Ditto, the guy gets 172,000 ghits, there shouldn't be any problems with the author drumming up getting enough references and assertions of notability to make this article float instead of flush. As it sits right now it just says he's a popular DJ, and there's like a kajillion popular DJ's that are NN. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 08:37, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> If someone can find 2 or 3 reliable and verifiable independent sources and add them to the article that would justify keeping it. There is a reference section there, just waiting for some such references to be added, such as Dutch version of Billboard or some such to document claimed chart-topping record sales, or reviews in a paper.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:47, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The given reason is: It is an article about a web site, blog, online forum, webcomic, podcast, or similar web content that does not assert the importance or significance of its subject.</p>
<p>The reason of entry is not apart of any of the entries above. I will say that that the closest to the the entry is a website. however, I said it was hosted on RGuardians.com, and I do include a link to find this game. If you read on it is about the story, hints and tricks, and reviews for the game. I am sure more information about the game will be given.</p>
<p>In addition, if you think RGuardians.com is just Realm of Guardians you are very wrong. RGuardians.com is a website/portal for Realm of Guardians AND Galactic Guardians (another game only mentioned in the history of Realm of Guardians. If you like we will take away the development history. Which we think is what gives it the questionable view.</p>
<p>As for the other points, we are not a blog, webcomic, or podcasts. We have an online forum but again we do not mention it. All the information I felt that was related to the entry that we put in.</p>
<p>~~Kyle~~</p>
<p><br />
I agree with the game creator. I will give my history with the game and then I will tell you what I think as well. First, my account name is Furlings and I have been playing for about 3 years. (Right when they changed domain names.) I have been an off and on player, and I have enjoyed this game along with other text based games. I do not know Brinn (Brinn is Kyle but I have a hard time refering to him as such) in real life. But I do talk to him on AIM quite a bit. I tell you this so you know where I am coming from.</p>
<p>However, I am going to add a few edits in a few moments however, I think as long as this post doesn't start promoting the site it should be kept. I read last night about what Brinn wrote. I know Kyle posted a few of the things he has already posted on his website to fill up content of the site. I am sure it will be changed later.</p>
<p>I believe that this posting will grow. I believe the players of this game will post more than Brinn because he tends to disappear every 2 months only to reappear promoting Realm of Guardians strong. I think he believes that with this the people who use the site will go and learn more about the game, the concepts, how to play, and such. I plan I adding my two sence of how the game was create and my insight.</p>
<p>I am not going to beg you to keep this up. I know Brinn will do that enough for everyone on the site.</p>
<p>~~Eric "Furlings"~~</p>
<p>PS. I am not trying to spam. I just don't think Brinn knew how to do this.</p>

<p>No independent, reliable evidence of notability. The site is now a Wiki, therefor hurting reliability of the little information it has. <s>I searched through several random pages and via Google, and can find nothing stating that edits have to be under the GFDL or a similar free license, and</s> no images I found had any sort of licensing.

<li><b>Comment</b> There is no content copied from Wikipedia that I know of, it links to Wikipedia does where Wiki has more/better information. The site is not open to public editing, so the reliability is sound. But I accept the notability argument, though I've never known anyone personally that supported the concept of removing entries for notability, fine for paper-based encyclopedias, irrelevent for massive web-based ones like Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../o/r/b/User%7EOrbling_64f2.html" title="User:Orbling">Orbling</a> 23:49, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The Alexa rank has been falling heavily since September when the site changed to a wiki as all the pages changed entirely and thus the page rankings went down dramatically, this will pick back up in time. Also, as the site is a MediaWiki it promotes the use of the technology. If the page is to go, I suggest keeping the template as it provides a neat way of doing the external links - there are plenty of other sites with external links with far more dubious content, including videos which that site doesn't do, removing the template will just result in the links being entered manually which is less tidy. Any copyright issues on the site could easily be covered as easily as the show logos are handled on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../o/r/b/User%7EOrbling_64f2.html" title="User:Orbling">Orbling</a> 12:06, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The term is generic and self-described. The notability would be that pro wrestlers and promoters acknowledge this group even if it's not always direct. The sources in the article are usually responses to wrestlters who are usually criticizing the IWC. It might be good to get the direct source from Matt Hardy or Eric Bischoff when commenting on internet wrestling fans. I noticed there's a couple of merge votes to <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smark.html" title="Smark">Smark</a> but that has no sources at all and that apparently is now being afd'd.

<dd>What is the threshold for "reliable sources" for this subject matter? It would be people in the industry at the very least. This group may not get a segment on the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> or <a href="../../../6/0/_/60_Minutes_b078.html" title="60 Minutes">60 Minutes</a> but it is notable among wrestling fans. To me, verifiability means something that can be confirmed even if it is not presently sourced. Just because some major outlet outside of the industry has not done something on it, I believe, does not in itself mean sources have to be outside the scope of the industry. That would be like saying a scientist(reputable of course) who does research on evolution is not a good enough citation because no outside media reported on it and therefore any article on evolution should be deleted. I'm sure many scientists would dispute that notion.<a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMurph101_c20f.html" title="User:MrMurph101">MrMurph101</a> 03:49, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's a weak analogy as scientific research usually - eventually - gets reported to, and by, media beyond the people doing the research. Secondarily, since <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> has still some controversy attached to it, it would be likely to be reported by media on both sides of it.<a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 02:21, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It probably wasn't worded in the best way. My point was that if something was notable in the scientific community does it need some sort of coverage by the media or referenced by some other group like, say, the freemasons? Or anyone else not related to science for that to be included? Do you see what I'm trying to say? <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMurph101_c20f.html" title="User:MrMurph101">MrMurph101</a> 05:30, 8 December 2006 (UTC) For example, <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terraforming_of_Venus_0e8e.html" title="Terraforming of Venus">Terraforming of Venus</a> does not cite any references outside the scientific community.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I do not find the external references to be sufficiently well-grounded. It is not enough to cite references outside Wikipedia; it is also necessary that these references would be generally regarded as substantial and targetted at what would count for a broad audience within the general subject area. Thus narrow fan websites don't count, and nor do websites which are run by fans posing as journalists. We need more solid references ( a reputable professionally published wrestling magazine or two would do the trick nicely ). The question I ask myself about articles like this is "could this come up as the answer to a million-dollar quiz-show question?" Clearly something like <a href="../../../k/a/y/Kayfabe.html" title="Kayfabe">kayfabe</a> or <a href="../../../f/a/c/Face_%28professional_wrestling%29.html" title="Face (professional wrestling)">face</a> or <a href="../../../h/e/e/Heel_%28professional_wrestling%29.html" title="Heel (professional wrestling)">heel</a> could come up, but I can't imagine a fair quiz-show expecting the subject of this article as an answer. So on balance, I think this article should go. It also has the scent of OR, which I don't care for, but that's a separate issue. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 18:19, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I for one disagree with the conflation of "recipe book" and cocktails. With mixed drinks, ingredients and amounts need to be listed: that's what distinguishes one from another. That being said, the jury's still out on the cocktail's notability/verifiability. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 01:35, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Google returns a lot of hits from various searching combinations, though it might be hard to tell because kamikaze has other uses. As I've argued, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a recipe book is dubious -- I read that as, "don't say cook at 350 degrees for 30 minutes", not "don't say anything about the food or beverage" -- and not enough reason to delete. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 21:29, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I don't get what the problem is -- it's a very popular drink (it's in every recipe book I've ever used), and it's got pretty standardized ratios. A Google search for "Kamikaze drink recipe" returns 118k hits -- seems pretty notable to me.

<li>Actually, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> says athletes who have competed "at the highest level in mainly amateur sports". In the US, there are many national skating events that are not "at the highest level" (see <a href="../../../f/i/g/Figure_skating_competition.html#Qualifying_competitions_in_the_United_States" title="Figure skating competition">Figure_skating_competition#Qualifying_competitions_in_the_United_States</a> for an overview).

Bulanhagui is not only a US junior medalist, but she has also competed internationally on the <a href="../../../i/s/u/ISU_Junior_Grand_Prix_42e3.html" title="ISU Junior Grand Prix">ISU Junior Grand Prix</a> this fall and placed high enough to qualify for the series final taking place this coming week (see list of qualifiers <a href="http://www.isufs.org/events/jgp2006/jgpsladies.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.isufs.org/events/jgp2006/jgpsladies.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>).

<dd>Well, forgive me for not being very educated in AfD votes, but you do make a good point, and if all possible, I'd vote for a <b>(weak?) merge</b> with <b>The Chronicles of Riddick</b> movie page instead of a keep; like I said, the information is true and found in a official source, but, yeah, most of it <i>at this point in time</i> is really unnecessary, though some of it would "flesh out" the story somewhat; either that or <b>someone create a completely different article for <i>The Chronicles of Riddick novelization</i></b> containing this information. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishopTutu_b088.html" title="User:BishopTutu">BishopTutu</a> 21:42, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> The language-immersion program is offered by many elementary and middle schools in Fairfax County -- 4 kindergartens, 13 elementary schools, and 13 middle schools. The program is notable, but it seems a better idea to have an article about it than to have 30 school articles on the basis of participation in it. Aside from the program, the references show that the school has a business partnership with an organization that helps it purchase supplies and occasionally offers a guest speaker (not unusual), and that the school occasionally brings in guest speakers on occasions such as Read Across America Day (not unusual). Suggest deleting or merging/redirecting the school info to the appropriate locality, and creating an article about the program (which can also list its participant schools). <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 05:20, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Heh, you're right, that is a ridiculous, absurd example. And it doesn't help to advance your case. When someone calls something schoolcruft it is shorthand for "non-notable school"; it is not merely just about calling something cruft. Nobody would ever use the term presidentcruft, nor try to delete George Washington as non-notable. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 04:59, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The concern to me is that the term *Cruft has been used in AfDs even when something is notable by notability standards. Cruft is a term which can be uncivil and it isn't always clear that people actually mean something is non-notable. In any event, "nn school" is shorter and makes that point clear. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:20, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>From an aesthetics standpoint, though, I think people like saying "schoolcruft" more than "nn school".

<li>At the time of nomination the article consisted of one line <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herndon_Elementary_School&amp;diff=91360424&amp;oldid=91359812" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herndon_Elementary_School&amp;diff=91360424&amp;oldid=91359812" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>.

<li>Now we're getting somewhere. I don't care for school articles where there's nothing notable going on, but this looks better. While the French language thing is not that notable, I'm impressed by the business partnership, which looks to me like something worth knowing more about. Let's have a couple of sentences telling us what this is all about.

<li><b>Delete</b>, well that is, unless there's more (sourced!) to say on this subject.

Should be merged into <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_of_Jesus_27f6.html" title="Death of Jesus">Death of Jesus</a>. Also, all the references are to <i>one</i> article in the Watchtower, which to me isn't really good sourcing.

<li><b>Keep</b> While the article is brief, I think it is a correct statement of long held views of the Jehovah's Witnesses. Certainly the view differs from the conventional one, and deserves to appear.

The content is not as described in the title (something about the centennial celebrations in 1934 might have made an interesting article).

With respect, using terms such as 'we don't care' seems an unprofessional opinion given your status, and disrespectful towards someones work, irrespective of how meaningless it is to an individual.

Once your conlang has been noticed and talked about by relevant, independent third parties, an article would be appropriate - but not one created by you. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 00:48, 2 December 2006 (UTC)<br />

<p>The result was a mess.

<li><strike><b>Delete/Merge most</b> I'd keep the Skygrasper article since it is one of the featured air/spacecraft in the series and is pilotted by main characters. The problem with Gundam shows is that the weaponry is at least as important as the main characters and should be treated as such. (Actually, a case could be made that the mecha is more notable than the main characters due to liscensing of models and the industry that revolves around them. There are magazines dedicated to these fictional machines. Japan is a very odd place.) I'd say merge a lot of the other articles into the spacecraft and vehicles articles. Remember, we're supposed to delete as a last resort. Expanding and improving is preferred.</strike> <b>Strong Keep</b> per below. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 12:27, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I <i>have</i> read all of these articles (and contributed to most of them). Mass deletion of a large chunk of articles is non-kosher, anyway. While the articles have problems, a mass deletion is not a good answer, especially when two of the articles targeted for deletion are articles that many of the above could logically be condensed into. It's my opinion that whenever massive groups of articles are targeted for deletion (several <i>hundred</i> Gundam articles have been nominated in the last 48 hours), it's an indication that somebody who has never bothered to acquaint themselves with the subject of those articles has decided that said articles are unimportant. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceberg3k_a804.html" title="User:Iceberg3k">Iceberg3k</a> 14:38, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>ALL of the information in the above articles is unverifiable (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). ALL of these articles are fancruft. ALL of the above articles are apparent original research. There's nothing wrong with a mass nomination of articles that are essentially of the same subject with the exact same concerns for verifiability and encyclopedic nature. The nominator made it clear that one could vote separately upon each article. I haven't, because I have the same concerns with all of them. You assert that one needs to be acquainted with the cartoon to understand the importance of these articles. In my mind, that's a blatant admission that this is pure <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">fancruft</a>. The articles themselves should illustrate their importance; one should not have to be an indoctrinated fan in order to derive benefit from it. <a href="../../../j/g/a/User%7EJGardner_e1b0.html" title="User:JGardner">JGardner</a> 18:14, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>It may not be policy (there's no need to scream, by the way), but it's an excellent essay. These articles are about extreme minutiae and there is little claim to be made that they are suitable for an encyclopedia. As you'll note, <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a> points out that fancruft dumps are rarely <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">suitably referenced</a> and are generally brimming with <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. In the case of the articles under debate today, there is not a single source cited in any article, with the exception of two very dishonestly misrepresented sources (each describes a deity, but the articles cite them for a claim that the fictional vehicles were named for those deities). <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 18:55, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Furthermore, you're deliberately twisting my words. It's not necessary to be acquainted with Gundam for the articles to be useful (though it helps, and there are a several articles here that could stand to be merged, as they don't have enough information for a standalone article). However, there are over 100 articles being blanket-nominated for deletion, and many of those do have enough valid information to stand alone as articles in their own right. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceberg3k_a804.html" title="User:Iceberg3k">Iceberg3k</a> 18:44, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

The spec are from official data, and thus is not unverifiable. This is why I said this is your ignorance and lack of knowledge. I am being civil enough to tell you what is the problem of you claim here. Articles without sources listed in the page does not provide grounds for deletion, it only provide grounds for adding a tag of references needed or citation needed. Viewing everything you do not know as unverifiable is technically ignorance. Since you have ignored there might be, and have, sources. My English is not that good and cannot think of a better word to use. I am against keeping most of the articles, thus I am not defending them at all, I am just stating your opinion of them being needed to delete just because they have no sources listed does not have enough grounds to back up the argument. On the other hand, <a href="../../../i/i/n/WP%7EIINFO_2579.html" title="WP:IINFO">WP:IINFO</a> is, to a certain extend, a strong enough argument. Yet nobody can say what is important and what is not, since it is purely POV, and rubbish of one person can be treasured by many. I have no use in knowing how a specific kind of animal living in a remoted area that I will never go is like, but there are people who would be dying to know the info. There are people who need the infomation on what they are, we can find sources for it, and therefore wiki should provide it, as long as it does not violate copyright. The method of providing the information could be discussed and having a page for each and everyone of them may not be the best solution, but it is how it was done and thus a better method should be proposed. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 17:51, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The existence of a <i>need</i> for this information, which is a dubious claim at best, does not merit inclusion. Beyond that, the existence of verifiable information is not a <i>de facto</i> indicator of notability. My house has a tax record, a building permit, and an address, and thus is verifiable. We can all agree, though, that my house is not a notable building. I support the compromise of merging the less-important items to a list and purging them of original research or non-encyclopedic content, but this all-or-nothing argument that keeps getting dug up doesn't help a damn thing.

From 1~7, only 7 can vaguely be used to say that these articles should not exsist. However, the spec and such are not plot summary, and thus is out of the scope of WP:NOT#IINFO. There are information out there in wiki that is of no use to me, but is useful to a lot of other people, and there must be information that is useful to a lot of fans but not to any others. For example, I do not really need to know the <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasmanian_Devil_ed94.html" title="Tasmanian Devil">Tasmanian Devil</a> can face tumours that prevent them from eating, but it is just interesting to read different articles to learn new things, fictional or not.

The article <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horses_of_Middle-earth_f5a2.html" title="Horses of Middle-earth">Horses of Middle-earth</a> is also another good example of what could be included in wiki. They have no impact on the real world, <i>but they are still there used as an example <b>on wiki policy pages.</b></i> Thus it is concluded that wiki policy(ies) does not state, or encourage the deletion of articles that does not have <b>any</b> impact on the real world.

<dd><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anakin_Skywalker_c92f.html" title="Anakin Skywalker">Anakin Skywalker</a> contains information on how the character impacts the real world from top to bottom, which is why <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> points it out as a good article.

The Anakin article is not a biography of a fictional person and the effect he has on a fictional universe, it is a description of a character and the effect he has on a series of movies. This is the difference between an encyclopedia of the real world, with out-of-universe description of real world things (animals, movies, anime) and an encyclopedia of the fictional world, with in-universe descriptions of fictonal things (spaceships, robots, sith lords).

<dd><b>Addition</b>. I have seen that many only consider TV Series/OVA version as their point of view. Please understand that Gundam SEED (and Destiny) has official novels and mangas, too. Even some details not mentioned in TV series and movies, occurs in novel or manga. I know that some differences do occur, even between the TV series and movies. Some even mentioned that they never got screen time while they are actually do (Such as: Cruisers type vessels (in one with fleet of Takemikazuchi or carrier), Compton class land battleship (operation Angel down) ).

<dd>I believe those model kits were part of a series of Gundam and mecha-related model kits. Once again, this shows that they have elevated importance in Gundam, but because they are part of a series of Gundam-related kits, they have no individual importance.

<dd>I would say go ahead. Some people voted for a straight keep all, but they don't seem to be citing any relivant guidelines. Most are agreeing that a merge is in order.--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 12:28, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I decide to start merging some vessels because, no major changes happened before and since I edited some vessels of cosmic era. See <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Warships_and_Spacecrafts_of_Cosmic_Era_%28Gundam%29_c2ca.html" title="Minor Warships and Spacecrafts of Cosmic Era (Gundam)">Minor Warships and Spacecrafts of Cosmic Era (Gundam)</a>. Though, I am against merging Takemikazuchi and Tarawa into them since IMHO, it is important enough. For others, just wait... I got my hand full... currently. For all <b>keepers</b>, please pray that my boss does not scold me for this... (just joking... -_- ). Any suggestions are welcome. I really need your comment on Takemikazuchi and Tarawa matter. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraconins_da4e.html" title="User:Draconins">Draconins</a> 13:13, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(Added)oops, I also forgot I also against merging Vosgulov and Lesseps. Those need your comment also... <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraconins_da4e.html" title="User:Draconins">Draconins</a> 14:28, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I am kinda against those 2 have separate pages, yet. Even Captain Todaka's page is being evaluated to be deleted(and I am going to support that). Takemikazuchi appeared in, like, 3 episodes? Destiny units are still too new to have any impact on anything, and really, I think I am pretty knowledgeable on the sources, and I cannot find anything about them that is really notable, not even in the series itself. (not even the mechanical files give more than half page worth of them.) <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 13:46, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Same argument. Lesseps, maybe arguable. They appeared in GSA series, too, thus can have maybe an extra line saying the design inspirated the author of GSA. However, I still don't think it is important enough, just yet. Also, most of the plot summary actually should go and will make the whole article shorter, and thus even less desire on keeping it as a separated article. Not going to hurt if it is merged for now, if any more sources pop up to support the Lessep, like having a model kit or appearing in Super Robot Wars or anything like that, I will say split it back out. All the sources now are still too oriented towards Gundam Seed series and there really are not much to tell for now. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 17:07, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>Update</i> due to the discussion being inactive for more than 24 hours after my suggestion, I am going to merge the ones that no one is fighting for a keep.

<dd>Why merge with Slashdot? A simple Google search of <i>"Anonymous Coward" -slashdot</i> returns about 984,000 hits. This is a term deeply rooted in Internet history, and is certainly not exclusive to Slashdot. If the article were less developed, perhaps it would be better in Wiktionary, but as-is, it seems to stand on its own. For what it's worth, you're right. I couldn't find any hits that appeared to be pre-Slashdot to verify my memories, though I still have the old BBS messages archived on 5.25" floppies somewhere.

<dd>Because of the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability policy</a>. The significance of the term "Anonymous Coward" outside the context of Slashdot cannot be verified by the standards of that policy. Other sites use the term, but in apparent reference to Slashdot. This article does not stand on its own. It is a jumble of three subjects: anonymous posts on Slashdot, a list of sites that have borrowed the term from Slashdot, and anonymous posts in general.

<dd>The problem that I am finding while researching this, is that most of the Internet sources refer back to either the <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anonymous_Coward_6d9e.html" title="Anonymous Coward">Anonymous Coward</a> or the <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anonymity.html" title="Anonymity">Anonymity</a> article as their defacto explanation of the term. It seems that many people consider the articles to be excellent references on their own. I realize that contradicts the goals of Wikipedia to only provide citable articles, but what happens when Wikipedia <b>is</b> the primary citation for an Internet term like this? I realize it is not a good reason alone to keep the article, but there will be many broken or potentially confusing inbound links to Wikipedia if either article is deleted, redirected, and/or merged. If merged, the redirect should point as closely as possible to the comparable part of the larger article. Many disussion board software appear to use the "Anonymous Coward" term, so it is definitely <i>not</i> unique to Slashdot. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillscrlt_a1d7.html" title="User:Willscrlt">Willscrlt</a> 01:12, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Kind of interesting but lack of notability; no sources to indicate such. CAFFO is very new so maybe in time it will be an interesting article to recreate? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 13:02, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wavecal22, 'fraid Wiki don't work like that. If the subject of the article is considered insufficiently unencyclopedic - albeit at this point in time - then it will be deleted. If and when CAFFO becomes notable, as proven by independent and reliable sources, then someone can recreate the article. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 17:36, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, but we do create stubs. Should this be a stub?

<p>Even a stub has to refer to a sufficiently notable subject. A stub referring to an insufficiently notable subject would also be AfD'd. And then probably deleted. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 15:21, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree. I've seen countless articles, both stubs and full articles which establish no notability. yet i think they should still exist. We are creating an encyclopedia, which "is a comprehensive written compendium that contains information on all branches of knowledge" Caffo is a branch of knowledge. just because you haven't heard of it doesn't mean no one else has. It is still something in the world that there is knowledge of, so why not include it? I really see no reason to delete this article, other than to save server space, but the amount of space that one small article takes up is insignificant.<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavecal22_9fbb.html" title="User:Wavecal22">Wavecal22</a> 19:44, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I also reread it, and none of the changes address my objections. If there are sources independent of the website, they must be placed <b>in the article itself</b>.

<dd>Not sure why you would feel bitten by the fact that I state that 300 registered users for a game isn't a lot.

<li>I'm not suggesting that these links are the extent of the coverage, just two that I found. I would however suggest reading the 2nd one, as it is probably less trivial than the first including a link to an interview with a developer of the game.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Hey, this is Chris Putnam, the creator of GBStv, and I just want to say I don't really mind if the article is deleted from Wikipedia although we have a decent number of active users and I do feel it's somewhat "notable" for that reason. It is true that there are no real reliable sources and, as such, I am okay with it being deleted. However, I'd really like to know where another useful encylopedia resource is online so people can learn about GBStv's history independent of its own web site. I fail to understand exactly why Wikipedia cannot afford to have more legitimate information archived on its site, especially relating to demonstrably large internet communities. As a side note it doesn't surprise me that the people pushing for this are possibly on the offensive for some drama reason that I have no grasp or part of (the user who is arguing for this the most, Quirex, is not surprisingly a proud SA goon). In fact I have been very busy with other projects for quite some time and have relied on our excellent community to run the site on their own. GBStv was never related to the Something Awful forums, it just required SA membership for the first 5 months of operation. I built it to provide a place for a community of friends to hang out and watch TV (and to showcase their content to one another), and it's still doing that over a year later with nearly 10,000 users. But alas, we have no legitimate notability according to the rules of Wikipedia, so again let me repeat I don't mind us going the way of the axe. I'm just a bit upset at what Wikipedia considers "notable" and "unnotable", and for a significant community like this to be lumped in with vanity articles for 12-year-olds is not just offensive, but it's unfair.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Notability criteria do not equate to "I have heard of it"/"I have never heard of it" or "I think this topic deserves attention"/"I do not think this topic is worthy of attention". These subjective evaluations are irrelevant to the notability of a topic regarding its inclusion in the encyclopedia.</dd>
<dd>Notability is not judged by Wikipedia editors directly. With respect to notability, the inclusion of topics on Wikipedia is a reflection of whether those topics have been included in reliable published works. Other authors, scholars, and journalists have decided whether to give attention to a topic, and in their expertise have researched and checked the information about it. As such, the primary notability criterion does allow Wikipedia editors to determine whether "the world" has judged a subject to be notable, but this is not a consideration of whether a Wikipedian personally thinks a subject is or is not notable.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.219.142.172 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.219.142.172.html" title="User talk:71.219.142.172">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.219.142.172_38a0.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.219.142.172">contribs</a>).</small>

<p><s>Unencyclopediac, non-notable subject, and to a lesser extent, a POV fork. THe page's topical is basically "Things that Catholic Church Leaders have said about Opus Dei"-- the page consists mostly of extended quotations which are mirrored at Wikiquote. I think the other 20-some Opus Dei subarticles probably are sufficient to cover the relationships between Opus Dei and the Catholic Church. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 09:47, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<dd>Well, it's not that it's inappropriate to quote comments by Popes when talking it Opus Dei. It's totally appropriate to a certain extent. We have quotes like these at the main <a href="../../../o/p/u/Opus_Dei_ef15.html" title="Opus Dei">Opus Dei</a> article. And at the <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teachings_of_Opus_Dei_34c7.html" title="Teachings of Opus Dei">Teachings of Opus Dei</a> article. And at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversies_about_Opus_Dei_f39f.html" title="Controversies about Opus Dei">Controversies about Opus Dei</a>, and at <a href="../../../p/r/i/Opus_Dei%7E_Priestly_Society_of_the_Holy_Cross_2242.html" title="Opus Dei: Priestly Society of the Holy Cross">Opus Dei: Priestly Society of the Holy Cross</a> and at <a href="../../../o/p/u/Opus_Dei_in_Spain_78c6.html" title="Opus Dei in Spain">Opus Dei in Spain</a>.

<dd>Wanting to insert some positive quotes from Popes about Opus Dei is fine. But is there any limit to how many?

<dd>Sure. My position on this article, thought, comes from one area: should we have an article on it. If the information is logically worth spreading amongst other articles - or is already in other articles - then we don't lose anything by merging/redirecting. If the information that can exist doesn't really fit anywhere else, we should have this article. I don't know if I'm in a position to make that statement myself, but I don't believe that deletion is the option here, but rather discussion amongst other editors about how to handle the subject. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:16, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>K. You were right. I asked on IRC and was told that AFD is just we want to completely kill the page all together.

<li><b>Cite or Delete</b> The article as it currently exists at least refers to Dickinson biographers who have brought up the issue, which would place this article under the general guidelines of a tertiary guide to an existing scholarly debate. The problem of course is the lack of verifiable footnoting and references beyond the comment that two scholars have discussed this. If this article could be cleaned up and cited appropriately, I can't see any reason it couldn't be kept (or at least merged back into the main Emily Dickinson article). However, lacking that citation this article has to be considered original research per nom. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 15:20, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>. Not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. The references are mentioned in the article's text; if we just contact the author and get him to use Wikipedia style to reference them then I think a shortened version of this would make a good addition to the <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emily_Dickinson_0e72.html" title="Emily Dickinson">Emily Dickinson</a> article. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 16:18, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep or merge</b>. The article, or at least the version I read, does in fact cite sources in-text; the format of those citations is an editing rather than a deleting matter.

<li>Obvious POV fork because it is obvious that the content would not be able to stay in the main article without someone raising an issue with it.

<li><b>Delete</b> Even though I am the user who published this article I only moved it here to a separate article because the entire main article was almost entirely only about Emily Dickinson's sexuality in spite of its complete lack of credible sources. What I did was to simply cut and paste all that material that can be seen on the original publishing of this article to here, and link this article to the main page. I did this so the main Emily Dickinson article would not be filled with the POV content you see here (Which no one would allow me to delete.) In retrospect this may have been a poor decision for which I apologize. I agree that if the content is merged then someone should source the claims to credible sources. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberrex7891_8d32.html" title="User:Cyberrex7891">Cyberrex7891</a> 01:30, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> — I've read through all of the Google links. This bank is so new it's only notability (at least on the Internet) relates to the islamic banking trend (see <a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a>'s entry above). So, it's possible and reasonably likely that this bank could become notable in the near future. However, since <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CRYSTALBALL" title="WP:NOT">wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>, this article should probably disappear until more notable references appear. I nominate a "weak delete" because it seems likely to me that in a year (if the bank indeed expands as it hopes to) this article may be a relevant addition. So, letting it simmer for a while is just possibly a reasonable alternative to deletion. Right now, however, it's pretty clear that it doesn't come close to <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallben_6fdb.html" title="User:Dallben"><font color="blue">Dall</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDallben_fcd0.html" title="User talk:Dallben"><font color="green">ben</font></a> 18:00, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Please note that the terms "exemplary musician" and "renowned musicologist" never referred to the subject of the article, but to another renowned musicologist. Your first comment about the NPOV issue was based on the misconception that the terms were used for the subject of the article, where as in fact, it was not like that. My comment was regarding that only.

<li><b>Dont Delete</b> - I strongly object all the above criticisms by B.Wind and others.. for the following reasons...</li>
</ul>
<p>1) First my name can not be a reason for jumping into a conclusion!lol! It is a childlike arguement!</p>
<p><br />
2. Moreover consider the fact about Google result. She is residing outside the indian subcontinent and she can not have more programs in the western world where she lives. All those google results are simply documenting Carnatic Programs done in India and hence dont get carried away by the number of results. If she would have been living in Chennai then she would have definitly got more programs... more web coverage, more numbers. So kindly consider this simple fact too.</p>
<p><br />
3) Then it is not an ad! Moreover see the last objection by B.Wind. He said that Chithra is mentioned as "exemplary musician" and "renowned musicologist" . But this shows how careless are they!. it is not attributed to her but to her Guru T.V.Gopalakrishnan ... Ask anyone in the carnatic field about T.V.GopalaKrishnan one of the stalwart of carnatic music. I again reproduce here what i have written for all to judge ... " She is currently pursuing her music under the expert tutelage of Shri.T.V.Gopalakrishnan, an exemplary musician and a renowned musicologist.". So please read clearly before pointing fingers. Then if my writing style is mor of an "ad" kindly note that I am a post graduate in Marketing n advertising. help me to change the tone of the article or word usage than jumping from the bench like school boys to VOTE FOR DELETION. Moreover I believe in Kaizen. So this article will be improved and i just requested some time. Dont limit wikipedia only to elite and experienced wikipedians. Even new ppl can contribue and improve slowly .. otherwise the whole concept of WP is meaningless.. Hope you (we) are not in a hurry n partison manner.</p>
<p>4) also note What Bruno has told as comments to Mr Wind.. and in the articles talk page... I am reproducing the same here ...</p>
<ul>
<li>Because of the simple reason that a tamil name can be written in many ways in English, the Google Hits cannot be taken as a factor for asserting notability</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Not all Indian Newspapers have web presence. Not all articles are published in Web. In case of Vernacular papers, they are not searchable as they use hundreds of different fonts</li>
</ul>

<li>Comments like <i>media shill</i> (which mean that the user is "promoting" the subject of the article) are against <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">established norms of Wikipedia</a>.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> (weak argument):It seems more notable than many things we have kept(masts, bus stops, minor members of nobility, short sections of 2 lane state hiways). (stronger argument):It has several thousand Ghits, showing notability at independent websites maintained by scout troops, and it has been written up numerous times in Scouting magazine, a publication of Boy Scouts of America.

<li><b>Keep</b> - but I agree, it needs work. See the article discussion page. THis is an important concept for Islam in Indonesia. Perhaps the term is used differently there compared to this article. For Indonesia the distinction between "Traditionalist" and "Modernist" is not a Sunni vs. 'other' disticntion, but applies to Sunnis - there are traditionalist sunnis and modernist. THe article does discuss features of Indonesian traditionalism (eg the mysticism) that is not part of more "orthodox" modernism. Traditionalism refers to the syncretic fushion on of beliefs that are still common across Indonesia - modernism on the other hand refers to the change towards more orthodox, non syncretic and non mythical Islam. The word traditional in INdonesia's case also refers to its blending with traditional Indonesian (and particularly Javanese) traditions from long before Islam's arrival in Indonesia. This map might help. Note that it only shows religious majorities for an area, also, the light green may seem small in area, but there are 120m people on Java.

<dd>No - that map does not show a Sunni/Shia distribution. The link you provided suggests that Shia's predominate in the <a href="../../../a/c/e/Aceh.html" title="Aceh">Aceh</a> province - right up the top of Sumatra island. it also specifically says that Shia's number around 1 million (Indonesian's total Muslim population is around 200m!).

<dd>i had another look... i think the traditional/modernist complex may be what makes up Sunni Islam (Sunnis constitute 98% of the demography) in Indonesia. still i don't believe it should remain outside of <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunni_Islam_4332.html" title="Sunni Islam">Sunni Islam</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_Indonesia_9f00.html" title="Islam in Indonesia">Islam in Indonesia</a>. the article Traditionalist Islam says absolutely nothing about Indonesia or the distinctions you are making, it is an OR piece about Sunni subsect A vs. Islamists vs. Salafis. i think it is a needless POV fork. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 03:22, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>hhhmmm - well OK. While my vote is still keep (and improve - ie, apparent inaccuracies) because in Indonesia it is an important distinction, I don't have the knowledge to buy into the broader issue outside of Indonesia. It does make me want to develop the coverage in the Indonesian context. We all have to chose our "battles" carefully!!</dd>
<dd>Just as a very general comment on the POV aspects, as long as ideas are expressed to be a POV, and not said to be fact, then isn't it OK?

<li><b>Comment/Question</b> - is Indonesia, and particularly <a href="../../../j/a/v/Java.html" title="Java">Java</a> the only place to have such a syncretic, mystical version of Islam? Although my knowledge of Islam is based on my (considerable) knowledge of Indonesia, I suspect it is not the only place to have such a version of Islam.--<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 02:37, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Traditionalist Islam that is discussed in this article is different from NU-style Islam in Java. <i>Peace</i>. --<b><a href="../../../n/i/e/User%7ENielswik_fd59.html" title="User:Nielswik">Nielswik</a></b><sub><a href="../../../n/i/e/User_talk%7ENielswik_2384.html" title="User talk:Nielswik">(talk)</a></sub> 08:00, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Syncretic forms of Islam are relatively common in parts of West Africa. This was more true before the jihadist (name historians used, I don't meant it as an insult) states of <a href="../../../u/s/m/Usman_dan_Fodio_f4f9.html" title="Usman dan Fodio">Usman dan Fodio</a> and Al-Hajj <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umar_Tall_a1e6.html" title="Umar Tall">Umar Tall</a>. Still even today "syncretic mystical" versions of Islam are relatively common in West Africa. In the context of West Africa "traditional Islam" is sometimes used to mean these syncretic, critics call them "half-pagan", forms of Sunni Islam. These are seen as having a tension with more strictly Qur'anic, not necessarily Salafist, forms of Islam that began rising in the region in the last 150 years or so. This article, however, appears to having nothing to do with that.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 13:19, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm not sure of what specific evidence there may be that this is a POV fork from <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunni_Islam_4332.html" title="Sunni Islam">Sunni Islam</a>, but I fail to see it and the nominator has provided none. The concept of traditionalist Islam, as defined rather clearly in the article, is obviously different from Sunni Islam: the term "Sunni Islam" embraces a quite heterogeneous group and it is possible to be Sunni (in the sense of "non-Shia Muslim") and yet "non-traditionalist", just as it is possible to be Roman Catholic and "non-traditionalist". <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 06:57, 2 December 2006 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi</li>

<dd>Also, the concerns about Indonesia have been taken out of context. The same issue Merbabu spots in Indonesia is true throughout the world: there are both "modernist" and "traditionalist" Sunnis. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 08:21, 2 December 2006 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi

<dd><b>Comment</b>: if we accept for a moment the notion that there are "traditionalist" Sunnis and "modernist" Sunnis, in what way do they not belong as subsections under <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunni_Islam_4332.html" title="Sunni Islam">Sunni Islam</a>? there has been no verifiable evidence provided as to how traditionalism differs from Sunnism, or whether it is a subsect of Sunnism. it's inappropriate to request disproving its (sub)distinction, as that is requesting <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negative_proof.html" title="Negative proof">negative proof</a>. we need to see evidence that explains traditionalism in distinction from Sunnism. the main problem i see is that of verifiability. in fact, the article is about Sunni group A and ascribing that group alone to Sunnism to the exclusion of others. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 16:46, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, are you really saying there aren't in fact modernist Sunnis? Just asking because you may know more about this than me. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 21:16, 2 December 2006 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi</dd>
<dd>The group described in the article are known as traditionalists because they believe in the continuity of the prevailing religious institutions, namely, <a href="../../../m/a/d/Maddhab.html" title="Maddhab">maddhabs</a>, the <a href="../../../i/j/a/Ijazah.html" title="Ijazah">ijazah</a> system, the <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madrasah.html" title="Madrasah">madrasah</a>/<a href="../../../d/a/r/Dars-e-nizami.html" title="Dars-e-nizami">dars-e-nizami</a> system ,etc. And most notably, the authority of their leaders is legitimized primarily by tradition (in the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tripartite_classification_of_authority.html" title="Tripartite classification of authority">Weberian sense</a>. To call them traditionalists is not tantamount calling them the "true Sunnis"... it just means that they view Islam (and life, for that matter) through this traditionalist paradigm. Now, if this terminology is contested, then it can be explained in the article, rather than pretending this divide between Salafists and non-Salafists (i.e. traditionalists, in my opinion) does not exist. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarastert_453a.html" title="User:Barastert">Barastert</a> 09:20, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We don't usually delete articles just because they are unsourced. I know Sunni literally means "tradition" but you keep making what I think is the untenable argument that Sunni Islam is thus coincident to "traditionalist Islam." Sunni Islam now means something much broader than that (for example, it is a status as well as a religion). <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 20:08, 3 December 2006 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi</dd>

<dd>Yes of course the term will be used in academic articles, just as "tradionalist christianity" and "tradionalist judaism" are occasionally used. However passing references to an obscure undefined concept doesn't justify the creation of an article for them. One article which you linked to called Salafis (correctly in my opinion) the traditionalists <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=cache:qd84xwhHZb0J:www.islam-democracy.org/documents/pdf/5th_Annual_Conference-Fattah_paper.pdf+%22traditionalist+islam%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=cache:qd84xwhHZb0J:www.islam-democracy.org/documents/pdf/5th_Annual_Conference-Fattah_paper.pdf+%22traditionalist+islam%22" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipidian_2724.html" title="User:Wikipidian">Wikipidian</a> 17:59, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Original research. It's essentially an essay that would make a cool blog post or whatever, but doesn't belong here.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> but it <i>is</i> rather cool. The article has been around for a while though and it is almost a shame to see it go.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I don't think it's original research more than a lot of other articles, and the dates can be sourced straight out of the movie. I also don't think it's so terribly novel that it can be characterized as "mere supposition" <a href="../../../j/k/a/User%7EJkatzen_b037.html" title="User:Jkatzen">Jkatzen</a> 17:49, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - It's a work of art! Danguyf 18:05, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep and Clean Up</b> - there is no one author of this, and the writers of the film have specifically covered most of this material in commentaries, interviews and a Q&amp;A they did for a fan magazine (the Q&amp;A is online)<a href="http://www.bttf.com/film_faq.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bttf.com/film_faq.htm" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. On top of this, there's the old problem that anything that can be derived from simply reporting what happens in a book or film (e.g. Marty buys Gray's Sports Almanac in 2015) results in someone charging "original research". Yes, it needs to be sourced, with citations from the two Bobs (Zemeckis and Gale) and possibly one or two <i>Starlog</i> articles that were written years ago (and which Zemeckis and Gale talk about in one of the commentaries). I personally would be more than willing to help with this, but I've been busy recently trying to put out similar fires elsewhere, including cites for the main <i><a href="../../../b/a/c/Back_to_the_Future_d4da.html" title="Back to the Future">Back to the Future</a></i> article. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMavarin_8ade.html" title="User talk:Mavarin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mavarin_e910.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mavarin">contribs</a> 18:28, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Other than the movies themselves (which describing and summarizing the events therein is no more original research than describing and summarizing the content of any other work), much of this content has been discussed in several sources related to the movie. Many of these sources cannot be found online as they are copyrighted video and audio commentary, and if I'm not mistaken, some is found in some books and magazines which are now out of print. All that said, what IS the Wikipedia standard and format for referencing sources which cannot be found online in any reputable place? <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELaMenta3_3753.html" title="User:LaMenta3">LaMenta3</a> 21:02, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's not an essential or important topic, but it's not OR and since it's all based on the movies, verification isn't really much of an issue (since, well, we know what the 'references' are from the title). Sometimes a fun trivial article is fine, leave it alone. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 21:31, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I like this; I in fact think it's bloody brilliant. I want this to belong on Wikipedia. I want it to be here. I don't want it deleted. If Wikipedia was a different place, that would be entirely permissible. However, it's <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html#Synthesis_of_published_material_serving_to_advance_a_position" title="Wikipedia:No original research">not supposed to be here</a>, and I can't just vote keep because I like the article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article just made del.icio.us/popular, so we should probably tag this AfD with the usual disclaimer. This doesn't appear to be copyvio--it predates bttf.xylot.net &amp; the page history does demonstrate that it was gradually built up. If I'm mistaken, it should be speedied anyway. While some edits have had OR, this article isn't inherently OR--the references are the movies. We have a lot of plot summaries on here &amp; I don't see how this is different. --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 21:54, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's not original research. All of this stuff is in the movies. Changing the method of presentation&#160;!= original research. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 22:04, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. If this page is deleted then half the pages on wikipedia about movies, comics, and TV shows would also have to be deleted. It's a fine page for an encyclopedia; the movies are very popular and deal with a popular subject (time travel) in a well thought out way. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattgrommes_46a5.html" title="User:Mattgrommes">Mattgrommes</a> 22:47, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Clean up</b> - The article should be limited to the main events of each timeline, not dwell on minute details. Wikipedia is not a collection of interesting trivia (which is what a lot of these details are), and they are a source of OR (for instance, the date the female president was elected). I mentioned this a while ago <a href="../../../b/a/c/Talk%7EBack_to_the_Future_timeline_303e.html#Details" title="Talk:Back to the Future timeline">on the talk page</a>, but got no replies. -- <a href="../../../r/i/t/User%7ERitchy_3c4d.html" title="User:Ritchy">Ritchy</a> 22:56, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> — This article is documented and supported by the three films, commentaries and supplemental information included with the DVDs. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EVal42_2ddd.html" title="User:Val42">Val42</a> 23:19, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> — N:OR is not a legitimate complaint against this article, which should not be considered research in the first place as it does not discover new information or advance a theoretical claim. It is simply an extremely detailed plot summary and explication of the movies' internal logical structure. N:V is not a legitimate complaint either, as the entry can be verified against the movies.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It certainly needs clean up but the article is very interesting and based on the films. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat91_20ff.html" title="User:Nat91">Nat91</a> 23:49, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - It appears to be original research only in the fact that some poor soul took the time to dig through the movies and pull out all this information. The BttF trilogy is very convoluted in its timelines, and this article would be extremely helpful for many people who get confused watching them. I popped in my DVDs and spot checked a few things that were new to me, and it all seems to be there in the movies, so the movies would appear to be the sources. Very cool article. It would be a shame to lose it. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillscrlt_a1d7.html" title="User:Willscrlt">Willscrlt</a> 12:21, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Needs better sourcing in places, but an excellent plot description. VKPS 00:17, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Tough call. Without the sources, this could have been put together as a result of watching the movies over and over, which would be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and should be deleted. On the other hand, if the sources (the scripts, for example) are readily available and put into the article, this would meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and make an article worth keeping. <b>Keep contingent upon sourcing</b> - if the sources don't appear in the article in a reasonable time frame, say a week or two, then we should revisit the AfD for a deletion. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 00:43, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It would not be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> any more than culling through the Internet looking for sources. Original research does not mean taking it upon yourself to research cited information. As an anonymous entry above stated, the entire work is cited within the movie itself. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> would kick in if the person had introduced new ideas or theories, added things not found within the movie, etc. This is clearly <i>not</i> a case of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>--just very good research of a source (the trilogy itself is the source). Putting the scripts into the article would be a copyright violation.

<dd>No, I'm not advocating putting the script in the article, but if the information is found in the script, you can cite the script instead, thus allaying your "bloat" concern, and take care of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 04:10, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> As of this morning when I put it up for AfD, the website was down. <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zumcomics.info" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zumcomics.info" rel="nofollow">Alexa shows no traffic</a> as well, so I imagine it was down for a while.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think they were talking to me - I gave my justification for my opinion in the list above. If it is my use of the word "vote" then I <i>recommend</i> <b>keep</b> for the three reasons I give: it is important, not defunct and if the remaining problem is the tone of the content then that is something to fix by copy editting not deletion. I'm unsure how solid Alexa is - it only shows few people who use their tool bar visit the site. It could be they have had trouble with their server/hosting recently or it may only just have been listed - I note Amazon hasn't assigned a ASIN.

<p>I think the number one question most of our members have is that Wikipedia has several websites listed in its database that are very similar to ours, for example:</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/o/r/Worth1000.html" title="Worth1000">Worth1000</a> <a href="../../../i/s/k/Isketch.html" title="Isketch">Isketch</a> <a href="../../../1/0/e/10eastern.html" title="10eastern">10eastern</a></p>
<p>Even though they are similar in the "creation of art" Doodlebug is very much one of a kind, I have yet to locate a site that mimics it. If you could clarify how our entry differs from the relevence of the other entries we would be glad to make any nessecary changes.</p>

<dd>The discussion on the proposal to delete this article in August, 2006 resulted in <b>no concensus</b>. As a result the bizzare decision was taken to merge the content of this article into the <a href="../../../a/g/a/Aga_Khan_Development_Network_94a3.html" title="Aga Khan Development Network">Aga Khan Development Network</a> article. This was an inappropriate solution - essentially dumping the contents of an unwanted article into a context where it had no place. The new Izhar Hunzai section was deleted from its new location and has since been reinstated. This resulted in the discussion cited below.</dd>
<dd>Izhar Hunzai sounds like a great individual, certainly his father is a well known figure in Northern Pakistan. I have no objection to the existance of an article about him (as long as it is properly maintained). However, the content of this article has no place in the Aga Khan Development Network article. If the Izhar Hunzai content is to be retained it should be done here. If not, simply delete it. Please do not dump it inappropriately on other articles.</dd>

The balance of opinion was that it should be merged into here.

<dd>The inclusion of the Izhar Hunzai section in this article does not make sense. He is one program manager among many in a vast international organization comprising multiple agencies that each run multiple programs. There is nothing remarkable about his personal contribution to the organization that warrants his inclusion in this article. Including a section on his is akin to profiling a particular mid-level employee of Microsoft on their wiki article.</dd>
<dd>If, in the wisdom of the wikipedia community, the Izhar Hunzai content is valuable enough to be preserved it should be done elsewhere - perhaps within its own article. Dumping its content inappropriately on this article is not the solution. I am not sure how this is to be resolved within Wikipedia policy / convention, but placing an <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">AfD</a> on this article is unwarranted.</dd>
<dd>Accordingly, I am moving the Izhar Hunzai back to its own page and I will place an AfD on that article. I will include a copy of this discussion thread to provide context.</dd>

<li><b>Keep &amp; rewrite</b> The term seems to be used in many countries, although I can find no record of its use in British titles.

<li><b>Keep &amp; rewrite</b> "Marshal of ..." seems to have been used in many countries, among them France, so it may have been something they've picked-up there. There certainly is a rank of "Lord/Earl Marshal of England/Irelan/UK", which have existed for a long time, and I guess it's possible that it could have been refered to as "...of the Empire" by some. It's not a military rank per se, but it's possible as the article claim, that it <i>at one time</i> wilded the power of the monarc. "The Lord High Admiral" - a similar royal appointee - would certainly at some time have been able to command the navy with the monarc's authority. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Marshal" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Marshal" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>]</li>
</ul>
<p>My guess is that the title of Napolionic rank has been mixed together with a similar English/British one. It should be cleaned-up; the historical and current power of the rank should be checked (e.g. would it at any time ordered soldiers around in the Kings name); and would it be a rank that could be used in certain situation (e.g. if the UK leads a large multi-nasional force and one of it's general is appointeded Surpreme Commander of Allied Forces; could that person then be given this rank to "promote" him compared to other generals of the same rank (others ranked as Field Marshal or General of the Army) and to emphesize that he wielded the whole of the Queen's power over the British military). --Koppe 22:15, 1 December 2006 (CET)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. In fact, it appears that all the lists in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_publications_in_science_36ea.html" title="Category:Lists of publications in science">Category:Lists of publications in science</a> suffer the same problems. However, as only this is the only one that appears to be nominated, I'll stick to this one. The "criteria" are far too vague or subjective and are all a matter of opinion or a judgment call. We only have the say-so of the editors adding the publication to the list that the publication is "important" No sources are provided to back up the allegation of importance. How do we know a book is a "good" introduction or survey? How do we measure "influence"? What constitutes "most advanced"? There is nothing to verify or support these opinions. Isn't this list better left where it belongs, in a library's catalog listing? There also seems to be no line drawn to keep the list from getting longer and longer. "Importance" diminishes in a crowd. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 22:42, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. The biology article has been brought here twice and kept. It was after the last time that the word "important" was added to all these lists. The chemistry list has a process to debate importance and come to consensus. I recommend that the others do the same. These lists are slowly approaching being lists of publications with a wide appreciation of their importance.

<li>But importance is subjective. It does not MATTER if there's a consensus as to what constitutes importance, since it's still a subjective consensus. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 02:21, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think we often use consensus to decide whether things are notable, important, etc. In the case of the chemistry article there some criteria about what importance means. These lists allow a reader to find a book that is historically or educationally notable within a discipline, so they are important articles. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 02:27, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>If it's being used to list all <i>notable</i> publications, then it should just be renamed to remove "important", but that's not the impression I got. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 02:30, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>As I said when one of these lists came to Afd before, the consensus was to add "important". Now you want to remove it. It just shows that AfD debates are often not consistent. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 02:37, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Surely if these publications are notable in themselves, they are worthy of individual articles. Those can then be listed. Otherwise the criteria for inclusion is very vague and subjective.

<li><b>Comment</b>.

I think we need to determine whether this article meets the criteria set out there and then whether these criteria are proper for Wikipedia. If they are not, then the whole project and its created pages should go. Such a debate might lead to a positive developement rather than just deleting stuff that many editors have contributed to and found usefull. I note that the editor who started this Project - <a href="../../../a/p/h/User%7EAPH_6b7e.html" title="User:APH">User:APH</a> has not contributed to WP since January 2006. I do not know why but last year he was trying to make a positive contribution to WP with this project. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 03:28, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b> There are many such groups, where individual publications are other entities are not notable enough for a separate article, but are as part of an article such as this. We right here frequently end our discussions with consensus on a merge, and that produces such articles. The precedent with other sciences has been established. There are some people who don't like such articles, but there are more who contribute to them. Contributions to such articles tend to com in bursts.<a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 01:46, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b> This list has actually been useful to me in my job (as an academic); just now, I went specifically looking for it &amp; came across this AFD. There may be subjectivity in determining importance, but there are also npov measures -- citation analysis, # of copies sold, historical first mention of a notable topic, etc., that can be applied to lists such as these. Individual articles for people or publications are <b>much</b> less useful; they don't provide the intellectual content of gathering things together, which is the point of this list. Wikipedia shines in computer science; let's keep it that way. -- <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrassratgirl_9ef9.html" title="User:Brassratgirl">phoebe</a> 19:35, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>They don't have to be individual articles. If some breakthrough was a result of 2-3 seminal works, then write a single arricle about a "broken-through" issue and describe the papers there. Right now this eclectic collection is totally useless pile of data. I am surprized how scientists don't understand the importance of proper categorizing of things. "... in computer science", indeed. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 23:40, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"In Computer Science", indeed. There are graduate programs in computer science, there are curricula in computer science, there are overview works about computer science, and there are libraries for computer science. It's a valid category, and such a list,done right, could be useful for all of these situations. I often encounter students who want to know what the seminal works in a field were. If replaced by smaller articles, whether it's an article about a publication or an article about a "breakthrough" discovery, you're still splitting up the collection of important reading in the field. I fully agree that the article needs work; but let's keep it and improve it. Also, if you're referring to me as a scientist, I'm not a scientist; I'm a librarian, so I like to think I know a little bit about organization. -- <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrassratgirl_9ef9.html" title="User:Brassratgirl">phoebe</a> 01:11, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Also, having this list of course doesn't preclude discussing the papers in fuller detail in the appropriate topical or discovery pages, which should be happening anyway; and a list does not preclude having individual articles about the books or papers in question. This list, like most lists, can be partly duplicative; it's another way of viewing the available information. -- <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrassratgirl_9ef9.html" title="User:Brassratgirl">phoebe</a> 01:31, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm torn about this list. The current version gets it partly right, at least in the sense that if a publication is included in the list, it is generally important. However, there is a huge problem: Who gets to decide what's considered important? Clearly it cannot be us, that would be original research. Wikipedia is a tertiary source, our job is to be a meta-meta-publication, if you will, that is, we have to find meta-publications that actually come out and say "publication A is important, publication B is not". The current list fails miserably in that regard: it doesn't cite any sources (which would have to be meta-publications, not those publications that are considered important according to the list). None. Zero. The two external links come closest, but then again who's to decide that "frequently cited" equals "important"? I want to say: <b>start over and do it right</b>. Be diligent, cite sources, use sunscreen, etc. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 21:23, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>comment</b>. Quite a few entries strike me as ridiculous. For example, a number of textbooks. However popular they are, certainly they are not groungdbreaking. Further, "Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty process" labelled as breakthru. Huh? What did it break?

<li>While it's not formally enshrined in policy, AfD <i>precedent</i> has generally favoured keeping articles on municipal mayors, and there hasn't been a population cutoff to determine notability — I'm <i>sure</i> that places no larger than <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Elgin%2C_Ontario_7c13.html" title="Central Elgin, Ontario">Central Elgin</a> have had their mayors' articles kept without being any longer or more detailed than this. I know precedent isn't necessarily binding, and I think maybe there should be an actual policy discussion to formally clarify whether mayors are in, out or "depends on the circumstances" at some point, but a keep wouldn't be unprecedented here. Which doesn't necessarily mean I'm urging that here; this <i>is</i> unquestionably a pretty barebones stub about a person whose notability is uncertain at best. <b>No vote</b>; just $0.02 for the pot. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 23:46, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - As per <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanuman_Das_3020.html" title="User:Hanuman Das">Hanuman Das</a>. The IOT is almost 30 years old, and it was the foundation of the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaos_magic.html" title="Chaos magic">chaos magic</a> movement. I also don't see where you're getting the walled garden idea from. Chaos magic is the exact opposite of that, and anyone can jump into it at any time, from any background, and bring that vitality into the mix. --<a href="../../../t/s/u/User%7ETsuzuki26_002c.html" title="User:Tsuzuki26">Tsuzuki26</a> 01:32, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I believe the reference I have added to the article provides independent verification. If it is a walled garden, it's a pretty big one.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The IOT Pact is a well established group.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> I would generally make coments about this and why it needs to be kept. In this instance I don't think it is needed, it is self explanatory. I just think AfD's are being thrown up too easily by just anyone with no concept of the articles they apply them too.

It's getting rediculous! Wikipedia is here for information and thus for further investigation! Is it that idfficult to comprehend? If an article is deleted it cannot be expanded on ot make it better!

<li><b>keep</b>, but the "walled garden" concern needs to be taken seriously. The articles in question should make very clear when they are reporting self-published material. Hype like "most influential and respected" etc. should be removed on sight. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 11:51, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>del</b> <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walled_garden.html" title="Walled garden">walled garden</a>, indeed. I am a bit slow on this, but even to a beginner, the "verifications" lead to other authors verifying each other. All info within this socalled Pact is secret, we assume? Who is supplying the info? Participants to closed meetings? Any factual information in "clubbish" sites always gets called "vandalism" while other obvious fallacious statements remain protected by a few who seem to have more than a passing interest. see <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starwood.html" title="Starwood">starwood</a> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.219.130.75 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.219.130.75.html" title="User talk:71.219.130.75">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.219.130.75_266a.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.219.130.75">contribs</a>).</small>

<p>Briefly, rather than move this elsewhere, here I will respond. I state that the map region Chaos Magic exists regardless, and wiki should reflect this fact. This will apply to a sub-terrain of factual information regarding organizations, and prominent practitioners, including those who exemplify the various arch. There will always exist variations on the meme-space vis a vis each of our maps; wiki functioning as the meta, leading to disagreements, and then along to thoughtful editing. Here our fact-maps merge, on this we will all agree. Tone down the bad faith nominations, they do not play well with others. Gift some work on content and style. Someone should mention humour. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.219.130.75 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.219.130.75.html" title="User talk:71.219.130.75">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.219.130.75_266a.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.219.130.75">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I'm the professor in this case -- and not a he -- and am operating with the understanding of wikipedia as an encyclopedia, "a comprehensive written compendium that contains information on all branches of knowledge or a particular branch of knowledge," as it says in the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">Encyclopedia</a> entry. The branch of knowledge we are contributing information on is libraries. The entry on David Burt is one of about 20 that my students are each creating or contributing to as part of learning how to be librarians. Each entry is about someone who has influenced or is influencing the direction or the development of libraries. Along the way it's very important for librarians to understand Wikipedia, how to use it and how to contribute to it. The process is in fact also creating Wikipedians. If its a matter of voting, <b>Keep</b>. And if there is any issue with this approach to contributing to Wikipedia, I'm interested in hearing the argument/making any adjustments/learning. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatewill_3e28.html" title="User:Katewill">katewill</a> 03:10, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

David Burt was pretty involved in that, as the article shows, and reliable independent secondary sources have been provided.

<li>'<i>Strong keep</i> but change title as per J.smith., or alternatively (librarian). "former" is POV. Much as I regret it, I do have to admit he is notable within his profession, though in a direction I deplore. And he is now a public figure.

<li><b>Delete</b> - not only fancruft and not notable, but when would this article stop?

<li><b>Strong keep</b> The notion of coherence in science-fiction universes (of which Star Trek and Star Wars are the best known) is a question that has generated much debate and this debate is culturally notable. Among other things, recall the episode of "The Simpsons" where several "nerd" characters interrogate Krusty on the coherence of Itchy and Scratchy (or something like that). There are also many, many videogame articles that address issues far cruftier and less notable than this one (Star Trek has a much larger following than most videogames, for instance) <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 07:11, 2 December 2006 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi

<li><b>Delete</b> None of the inconsistencies are linked back to secondary sources. None of the inconsistencies are verfiable in their current form and I doubt they will be til someone starts their own page about each and everyone. There is no citation in the article other than citing the exact episode something was claimed. You have cite the literature that CLAIMS this is an inconsistency, otherwise this is original research. Is the whole article repeated by those 3 secondary sources? Surely there is a usenet faq which documents every single one of these.

<li><b>Delete</b>. It's not enough that people claim sources exist, there needs to be some indication that they really do exist and will at some point be properly cited in the article.

<dd>As you just now asked me on my talk page, I have taken another look. Yes, high-quality schools will have notable alumni. These alumni will have articles here or mentions elsewhere, and thus can be given as proofs of the school's quality. (You are saying we are high quality because we will have notable alumni, and we be able to prove it some day when we actually have them.) There are only 2 mentioned: one managed to get on a <i>college football team,</i> and one was unfortunate enough to be <i>killed early on in Iraq</i>.

<p>The result was I'm closing this as a <b>keep</b>. After discounting one newbie I get 13 keep to 6 delete votes. I'm further discounting several delete votes. One admits it needs a rewrite, but vote to delete anyway (articles that can be fixed with a rewrite aren't deleted). Another claims that being a CEO at three companies is not notable without explaining why that would be (there's several valid articles about people who are CEO of just one company). The article may using some questionable press release-based sources now, but reliable sources are available as several keep voters have pointed out. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:20, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, I <i>would</i> like some clarification--I'm a bit of a newbie and listed this page because it was flagged as unencyclopedic (See <a href="../../../b/r/y/Talk%7EBryan_Brandenburg_6534.html" title="Talk:Bryan Brandenburg">Talk:Bryan Brandenburg</a>). From my reading of the notability guidelines, this topic clearly fails. I couldn't find any articles actually <i>about</i> him; rather, just articles with short quotes <i>by</i> him answering questions about companies he's worked for. The articles I did find are trivial and seem more like press releases than anything else.</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> states "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person."--I've looked and I just can't find anything like that, so I think it's clear this subject fails this criterion. Looking at the other criteria, I can't see any evidence that this subject "made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in [his] specific field" or that he's "received multiple independent reviews of or awards for [his] work." Walking through all of the tests, I can't see any evidence that this subject is even remotely close to the underlying principles of the WP:BIO guidelines--which is why I posted the article up for discussion.</dd>

<dd>Still, I'm new here, so if I'm way off the mark here I'd like to make sense of it. So, just to clarify, in practice are individuals deemed biographically "notable" by comparing them to existing articles in the encyclopedia? I ask this because that is how I interpret the last comment and I'd like to know about the practical guidelines with respect to notability. To me, the written guideline seems to set a standard (albeit a fuzzy one) which is miles away from "keep articles if they're clearly better than others you've seen." <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallben_6fdb.html" title="User:Dallben"><font color="blue">Dall</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDallben_fcd0.html" title="User talk:Dallben"><font color="green">ben</font></a> 06:50, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> – 71.116.216.221 Thanks for your input! I went through the links that you posted (many of which are listed in the article itself) and <b>did a content analysis</b> on each one—for brevity I've <b>posted the results</b> on the <b><a href="../../../b/r/y/Talk%7EBryan_Brandenburg_6534.html" title="Talk:Bryan Brandenburg">article's talk page</a></b>, so you and others may review it there. Unfortunately, one can't claim that Brandenburg is the <i>primary subject</i> of any of the linked articles, which is one of the main reasons I nominated the article for deletion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the Google test you did, while around 500 hits is comparitively large with respect to most video game programmers, most U.S. university professors yield at least 10,000 Google hits. So, it is hard to claim that "a search for the subject produce[s] a large number of distinguishable hits". Additionally, it's hard to claim that Brandenburg's companies are <i>major</i>, since two are now non-existent and none of them were/are publicly traded.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> – <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallben_6fdb.html" title="User:Dallben">Dallben</a> Actually, <a href="../../../s/c/u/Sculptured_Software_139a.html" title="Sculptured Software">Sculptured Software</a> was acquired by <a href="../../../a/c/c/Acclaim_Entertainment_743f.html" title="Acclaim Entertainment">Acclaim Entertainment</a>, a publicly traded company. <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineering_Animation%2C_Inc._72bf.html" title="Engineering Animation, Inc.">Engineering Animation, Inc.</a> who acquired his second company, was a publically traded company.

<dd><b>Comment</b>—I think I should probably clarify (lest ye accuse me of mudslinging) that I am not stating that Brandenburg is not notable in general—really, every person <i><b>is</b></i> within their realm of friends and associates. Rather, I'm claiming (and I feel the data supports this) that he is not notable <i>with respect to Wikipedia guidelines</i>. My comment on public trading was simply supporting evidence for the claim that this article fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. (As a side note, just being publicly traded doesn't actually make a company notable according to <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>.)</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Anyway, just for you <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinux_monster_0c36.html" title="User:Linux monster">Linux_monster</a> and because I'm a glutton for punishment, I browsed the entire contents of a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22bryan+brandenburg%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22bryan+brandenburg%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google search for Bryan Brandenburg</a> in case I missed some big story about him. In my perusal, I found out that Google's hit estimate was off (there are actually only around 215 distinct pages indexed) and that some of those hits relate to other Bryan Brandenburgs. For example, there is/was a candidate for <a href="http://www.brandenburgforcommissioner.com" class="external text" title="http://www.brandenburgforcommissioner.com" rel="nofollow">county commissioner</a> in Michigan and a <a href="http://www.citea.org/images/hist_archives/citea_photo_archives_document.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.citea.org/images/hist_archives/citea_photo_archives_document.htm" rel="nofollow">Bryan Brandenburg Co.</a> that existed in California in the 1920s. However, in the results there are no significant independent articles about <i>this</i> Brandenburg. In fact, the vast majority of articles that mention him are about <a href="../../../z/y/g/Zygote_Media_Group_406b.html" title="Zygote Media Group">Zygote Media Group</a>, a company whose current websites don't even make historical mention of Brandenburg (As evidenced by <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22bryan+brandenburg%22+site%3Azygote.com+OR+site%3A3dscience.com&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22bryan+brandenburg%22+site%3Azygote.com+OR+site%3A3dscience.com&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">this Google Search</a>—note that although some links appear, Brandenburg's name does not appear in any of the pages). So, if you feel this nomination is in error, please just produce the documents and references necessary to support the notability claim—I've done my best to find some and at this point I am confident that the article has been given an unbiased review. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallben_6fdb.html" title="User:Dallben"><font color="blue">Dall</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDallben_fcd0.html" title="User talk:Dallben"><font color="green">ben</font></a> 15:15, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At any rate, that's my take on the available information. You state at the end of your entry that "Bryan Brandenburg is one of the grandfathers of the Utah game industry", which seems to indicate you're familiar with him and might know more about him. Do you know of any specific articles about Brandenburg or maybe a book (independent from him) that is written about him? If we could produce a set of independent and significant articles about his connection to the game industry, that might be a way to keep the article. The only Web articles I can find don't even mention he had anything to do with the game industry (except for his credit listings in games, of course). <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallben_6fdb.html" title="User:Dallben"><font color="blue">Dall</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDallben_fcd0.html" title="User talk:Dallben"><font color="green">ben</font></a> 07:13, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> (edit conflict, this is in reply to the IP comment), given the amount of research that went into this AfD, and the eminently reasonable discussion of it here, a summary of "really silly" seems a bit cavalier.

But some clarifications are in order: he wasn't CEO of <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineering_Animation%2C_Inc._72bf.html" title="Engineering Animation, Inc.">Engineering Animation, Inc.</a> (EAI). He was CEO of Software Arts International, which was acquired by EAI. At that time, he was made head of the SLC studio of EAI. Certainly a prominent figure of EAI, but not the CEO. Sculptured was a pretty significant <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game_developer.html" title="Video game developer">video game developer</a> and he was a founder of it. But I agree that all those articles that are listed that barely mention him or just Zygote should be removed. The articles he wrote could go in a "Bibliography" section. One last note, I think Brandenburg wrote most of the article himself. Don't know if that really matters, but I had to go back and remove gushing comments from the article from time to time. — <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot">Frecklefoot</a> | <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFrecklefoot_f6c2.html" title="User talk:Frecklefoot">Talk</a> 18:27, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> – Thanks for joining the discussion. I am interested in finding any evidence of Brandenburg's notability as prescribed <s>my</s> by <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">Wikipedia's guidelines</a>—do you have references for any such materials? This would be a great place to bring them up (or, if they're extensive, you could add them to the article itself and then mention the major update here).

<li>Thank you for adding to this discussion. I noticed that the links resulting from the Google News Archive search match up well with those already listed in connection with this nomination.

In addition, can you claim that Brandenburg is the primary subject of any one of these articles? <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallben_6fdb.html" title="User:Dallben"><font color="blue">Dall</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDallben_fcd0.html" title="User talk:Dallben"><font color="green">ben</font></a> 06:51, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thank you for contributing to the discussion. I have done a lot of searching in relation to this article and am curious if you can produce any sources related to Brandenburg's role in gaming (as implied by your opening sentence). The references that I can find are press releases about companies Brandenburg has worked for and I can't find any independent articles about his gaming contributions. In addition, could you specifically identify which of the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines (if any) these links support? I am a fairly new editor and am hoping to gain a better understanding of how accurate the guidelines are.

<li><s><b>Speedy Keep</b></s> <b>Keep</b>First let me start by saying that it is not helpful that the prod was deleted without comment and I concur with <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallben_6fdb.html" title="User:Dallben">Dallben</a> that its one reason for this article to be in AfD. That said, the subject's importance, the extent of reference materials on both him and the ventures he has been involved in, and involvement in the history of gaming and graphics is beyond dispute. One doesn't have to be Sid Meier to qualify for notability. I sense extreme Deletionism gone awry. I strongly disagree with users like <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBCoates_04d2.html" title="User:BCoates">BCoates</a> since founding even one succesful company is notable. <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndless_blue_2cba.html" title="User:Endless blue">Endless blue</a> 00:39, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Thanks for voicing your opinion—it will hopefully help this discussion to come to a resolution. I am sorry if this nomination appears to be <i>Deletionism gone awry</i>—please know that being a deletionist was not my intent; rather, a clearer understanding of the process and the validity of Wikipedia's guidelines. From my perspective, I saw something that was deemed unencylopedic, read the guidelines as carefully as possible, measured this article against those guidelines and found it more than just a couple of standard deviations from the mean.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, this AfD ensued and it's been interesting. Still, I hold to my original reasoning—in fact, the experience in researching has only verified for me my claim that this article does not stand up to the Wikipedia guideline. But, since I'm a newer editor, I'm happy to concede the difference between a concrete guideline and a practical one. If you feel the guideline is wrong, express how and why, that way we all know where you're coming from.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That aside, it <i>is</i> helpful to know which claims fall within the concrete written guidelines and which do not. For example, you state that Brandenburg's "involvement in the history of gaming and graphics is beyond dispute," but I can find no significant references to his involvement in gaming and his <i>verfiable</i> involvement in graphics are press releases from companies in which he's been a prominent figure (and are therefore not independent of him). Given sufficient capital, any company can woo the press into printing something about them. So, since you are so adamant about this article being kept, can you produce references that explicitly fulfill the guideline? If not, what guideline are you actually using to justify notability and which references fulfill it? (Please note that I'm not trying to be contentious or to get you to change your vote—I'm more interested in understanding the foundation and reasoning of your argument).

<dd><b>Comment</b> The subject has been cited in a number of non-trival third party articles, include reliables sources like Forbes and MacWorld. That means that the subject confirms to the guidelines for notability in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The following quotation from said same guidline should explain it:</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.
<ul>
<li>This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, magazine articles, books, scholarly papers, and television documentaries <i>except</i> for the following:
<ul>
<li>Media reprints of the person's autobiography or self-promotional works.</li>
<li>Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that just mention the person in passing, telephone directory listings, or simple records of births and deaths.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndless_blue_2cba.html" title="User:Endless blue">Endless blue</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/d/User_talk%7EEndless_blue_5492.html" title="User talk:Endless blue">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Endless_blue_7bd2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Endless blue">contribs</a>).</small></dd>
<dd><b>Response</b>—It is exactly this guideline, which is clearly not being met (at least, no articles have been reproduced yet). Here's my reasoning: let's dissect this guideline and use it to filter articles from being credible candidates:
<ul>
<li>"The person has been the <i><b>primary subject</b></i>..." — the article in Forbes and the mention of his webcast panel interview (he was interviewed along with two other unrelated individuals) in MacWorld are great news…for Zygote Media Group and DAZ Productions, respectively. That is, the primary subjects of the articles are <i>the companies</i>, not Brandenburg. This is true for all of the cited sources.</li>
<li>"...of multiple non-trivial published works..." — It is true, Forbes and MacWorld are non-trivial, but the articles in which Brandenburg's mentioned are.</li>
<li>"...whose source is independent of the person." — This has probably the greatest effect on the claims. The vast majority of the links available clearly resulted from press releases made by the companies Brandenburg worked for. Therefore, it is unfair to claim these articles make him notable, because the articles are not <i>independent</i> of him.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>That said, I am still awaiting a clear and cogent argument against my reasoning, which is based solely on the guideline. If you disagree with the guideline, then that's a different matter altogether. Since the beginning of this nomination, I've been searching and requesting for citations that really show notability. Give me the link to the Forbes article "Bryan Brandenburg: CEO" or anything like that and I think we'll have some verifiable information about Brandenburg, which we can legitimately include in this article (or even justify having an article with). <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallben_6fdb.html" title="User:Dallben"><font color="blue">Dall</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDallben_fcd0.html" title="User talk:Dallben"><font color="green">ben</font></a> 01:52, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I will grant you that the Forbes article mentions him almost in passing. The MacWorld article definitely mentions him and is focused on his speaking event, so I don't agree there. However, I have a fundamental difference of opinion with you on how much of a distinction you can make between articles written about companies founded by people and articles written just about those people. Based on this logic, Steve Jobs could be considered non-notable since he's rarely mentioned outside of news about Apple or Pixar. Seriously, entrepreneurs are measured by the businesses they found, and its inevitable that those businesses and other ventures will be mentioend alongside their names in articles. I believe your intepretation of "primary" places too high a hurdle for notability. That said, I think my speedy keep vote was a bit over the top and I"ve downgraded it sine the point you make is valid (if exaggerated IMHO). <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndless_blue_2cba.html" title="User:Endless blue">Endless blue</a> 02:38, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, but I think you'll have to agree with me that Steve Jobs is a very poor comparison to Brandenburg. Independent authors have written a myriad of books about Jobs—we're not talking about articles, but entire volumes. Therefore, Jobs <i>clearly</i> fulfills the guideline.</dd>

<dd>In addition, I'm not saying that we eliminate all information about Brandenburg from the encyclopedia—just that there's no need for an article about him. Other editors involved in this discussion have expressed concerns about its verifiability and content. So, if this article <i>should</i> be in the encyclopedia it would necessarily be significantly sparser than it is now; probably just a few sentences and some non-redundant references—in which case, why have it? As I see it, Brandenburg's name <i><b>should</b></i> appear in the articles for the companies he's worked for and all of the salient information about him kept there (i.e., what projects he was involved in, his major contributions, etc). One surprising factoid I learned recently was that Brandenburg worked for Zygote from January 2005 to April 2006<a href="http://www.vmmg.net/news/zygote-media-group.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vmmg.net/news/zygote-media-group.shtml" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>. This is surprising because almost all of the articles we can find about him are as Zygote's CEO. Anyway, I think if you can produce and article specifically about Brandenburg, or perhaps a more equivalent example than Jobs, I might be more inclined to see things your way. Cheers for your input. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallben_6fdb.html" title="User:Dallben"><font color="blue">Dall</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDallben_fcd0.html" title="User talk:Dallben"><font color="green">ben</font></a> 08:53, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b>: I have given my vote above. At this point, I wish to note that the article presently consists of roughly a half-dozen sentences and laundry lists of games the man has worked on, links to Wikipedia articles that do not exist, and a lot of external links of which roughly half seem only tangentially related to the man. So regardless of if the man is notable, the article needs a serious re-write. Recent activity by Stanlys212 has been entirely adding links, which is not what the article needs at this point. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbusch_fe90.html" title="User:Michaelbusch">Michaelbusch</a> 18:50, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Meets primary notability criteria: There exists articles in many reliable sources with this guy as the primary subject. Regardless of <i>what he ever did</i> it is moot. The sources exist to write an article, we can reference them. That is all that is required. In there interest of full disclosure, I was invited here by <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinux_monster_0c36.html" title="User:Linux monster">User:Linux monster</a> to comment. And I am. Looking at the sources cited by the article itself, and by people who have listed them above, there are more than enough good, reliable sources to write a neutral article. The fact that the article, as written, is decidedly NOT NEUTRAL is not a reason to delete. NPOV (like COI) problems are clean-up issues, not delete issues. The subject of this article deserves a Wikipedia article, even if the current one is poorly written. Start it again, clean it up.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>: I strongly feel that Brandenburg is noteworthy enough for a WP article. However, the article (in its current form) needs work. All that we have right now are six sentences, a list of contributions, and then a set of references/links. The article would be far more encyclopedic if the core was fleshed out a bit more to provide more complete background information, with the references inserted as necessary. If that were done, my vote would change to <b>Keep</b>.

<p>I tagged this one with a prod a few months ago, but it was removed with the comment "rm prod. afd this", which would imply that the person who removed the prod agreed that deletion was warranted. The article has had no substantive edits since July. The 3000ish google hits that "Winged Self" receives are mostly Wikipedia mirrors or copies of a poem mentioned in the article. Sources for "The Winged Self" are almost entirely Wikipedia-generated. The sources cited in the article are two devotional pages telling you how to worship the winged self. Whatever the "winged self" is (I'm still not sure from reading the article), if it were an important symbol, it would be mentioned more than just a few places. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 23:42, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, Profound Intent has worked with Scottie Beats and his Night Flight Recording Studio in Forestville, Washington. The group released the single through CdBaby.net and his currently an independent recording group. A performance of their single Time 2 shine did indeed spark rumors of them bashing singer Beyonce Knowles and the death of their producer rather their engineer did spark more rumors. Locally this group was the center of attention. Within the RIAA this group was the center of attention and they also had to answer to the RIAA regarding their single and its release to the public. The group was asked to stop performing the single as well and that's what they've done in compliance with the RIAA.</p>
<p>I think that this article should not be deleted and time should be spared for more persons to add to the article what they know its true in concern of the group. This is rather a impressive article which shows no signs of spamming at all. This is a true article and I as a internet user and a wikipedia user oppose of its deletion.

<li><b>Delete or Speedy Delete:</b> Non-notable nonsense. All the sources are blogs, except the last one (WP) which makes no mention of the band at all, and the article is propping up a dead man to advance their claims. Thus there is zero, zip, zilch independent confirmation of any notability or any association with anyone notable. <strike>It may be some kind of hoax or possibly a paid public relations campaign spamming the web. Google News has zero articles on the band. Google search on "Profound Intent" (in quotes) has pages from PRWEB.COM at positions 2, 5, 6 and 7 (The band's site is at 1, and Wikipedia is at 3. 4 is a bloggish "community" site (think like myspace)).</strike> Delete ASAP. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 15:11, 4 December 2006 (UTC) (strikethrough <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 22:29, 4 December 2006 (UTC) )</li>

<p>What your saying makes no sense, of course a website with the words Profoudn Intent in the form of a phrase will show first because its a domain registered as profoudintent. I think you all are races and shall be sued. But I guess the group will do that on their own. They have been notified of you publically saying that they are FAKE! and have issued a statement at www.profoundintent.com <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 151.200.246.251 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_151.200.246.251_c5ab.html" title="Special:Contributions/151.200.246.251">contribs</a>) 16:04, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<li>Comment: We believe you are real. That is not the issue. We expect an entity's web site to come up number one in searches and that is not the issue either. The issue is that we believe you are <b>not notable</b> enough to warrant an encyclopedia entry. There is also the appearance that Wikipedia is being used for a promotional scheme. It is really sad that when you encounter a little opposition you charge racism. You have no idea of the racial or ethnic backgrounds of people who use IDs or anon IP addresses here. 151.200.246.251 is the first to inject race into this debate which says more about 151.200.246.251 than anybody else. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 17:19, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>PROFOUND INTENT OWNER STATEMENT:</p>
<p>As the proud owner and founder of Profound Intent all is herby forgiven. I personally do not hold WIKIPEDIA.ORG responsible for the allegations posted in concern of Profound Intent's legitimacy and credibility made by members of a free service in which any John Doe can join and edit the sites contents. However; I must defend my establishment against claims that WIKIPEDIA has made saying that the Profound Intent articles was a promotional scheme. In defense I say that my establishment did not create, request or warrant such articles, and we surely do not intend (at any time) to use such a site for promotional purposes. I ask that you refrain from further stating such false and damaging remarks in regards to my establishment. Thank you for your time and attention for it is greatly appreciated. - 151.200.246.251 (LaPret) 21:09 UTC December 04, 2006</p>

<dd>It still looks and reads like a blog ("posted by Dave", with at least 7 spelling and grammar errors). I think all the Profound Intent supporters need to calm down and realize this is a debate about an article and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">not a forum for personal attacks</a>. Personally, I strongly endorse the positive intentions of the members of the group who would like to see music sold on its musicianship and not sensationalism of <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thug.html" title="Thug">thuggery</a> and gangsterism and <a href="../../../p/i/m/Pimp.html" title="Pimp">pimping</a> (which is beating women into prostitution). I think the group has talent and fully expect that with focus and perfection of craft that this band will soon achieve some success and be fully deserving of an article. However, they are not there now. I do wish them success. Work hard at the musicianship and the group will triumph over the naysayers and be back with a dynamite article in jig time. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 08:07, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>PROFOUND INTENT STATEMENT:</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you, for recognizing our purpose and our intentions as musicians and a group We don't dispute that we are 'not there' yet. In fact, we agree; we have a long way to go, and for someone like yourself 'Hu' to be one of the first to perfectly put into words and to recognize what our intentions are, gives us a great deal of encouragement. The "Time 2 Shine" single is about not letting anyone make you feel guilty for being yourself. As a positive group when we reference other artist we have no intentions to destroy or to 'put them on blast'. Our 'profound intent' is to reach that artist and say hey as 'youth' we feel that at some times our fellow youngsters can misinterpret what your saying; and going back on what you've said and what you say in reference to 'youth', we just want to remind that Artist; Hey we (as youth) are listening to every word you say, we hear you when you don't hear yourself sometimes. Today's youth take everything an Artist/Entertainer says for Granted and that's only a problem when what the Artist/Entertainer is saying only benefits the Artist/Entertainer rather then the 'youth'. - (the group) December 05, 2006</p>
<p>-- P.I. recently lost MISTY who left becuz she felt LaPret the founding-member was working soley in his niece Mizz Redz best interest and not the group. But Lil'Ace didn't agree. But anyway the group does have strength with all this debate about an article on WIKIPEDIA and at the same time working on replacing an orginal member. I say delete the article and just wait for the day when they get one based on FACTS known by the entire US and other national markets around the world. Most importantly when they have a WAY BIGGER fan BASE!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I know this isn't much a topic anymore but there's a REAL picture on P.I.'s Official myspace which links from their official website showing LaPret, Mizz Redz, and Misty as Young Crowd three days before they became Profound Intent and Mizz Redz broke her leg and arm and a car accident. It's the three of four members with Kelly Price at the 16th Annual Stone Soul Picnic in Washington, D.C. after they opened up for her!</li>
