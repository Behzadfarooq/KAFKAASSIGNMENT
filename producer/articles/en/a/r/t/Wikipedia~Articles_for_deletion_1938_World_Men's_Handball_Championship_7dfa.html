<dd>You are still not making any sense.

<dd>Copy&amp;pasted from where? And the subject itself is good enough, there are articles for single seasons of college sports teams (eg. <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football_team_79f3.html" title="2005 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team">2005 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team</a>) and a World Championship is usually more notable than that. It's just that in their present state, the articles aren't useful.

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand. These are notable athletic events and should be present. However, each article should indicate (at the very least): medalists, countries participating, standings and the score of the championship game. Other useful information would be venues, MVPs (if awarded) and brackets. <a href="../../../c/a/k/User%7ECaknuck_4acf.html" title="User:Caknuck">Caknuck</a> 14:46, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

The only piece of information each page contains is the country in which the event was held. The main articles contain more information about each event than these individual entries. It also seems unlikely these will be expanded.

<li><b>Redirect</b> per Prolog. If someone wants to write more about them, they can undo the redirect and start a real article that says something. Until then, having an article that's nothing more than a placeholder won't help anyone. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 16:32, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect all</b> for now.

<li><b>Keep all</b>. These are legitimate stubs that ought to be expanded. We do not delete or redirect stubs just because they contain little information at present; it would be counterproductive. Some argue that these articles serve no purpose; if this is the criterion, then what "purpose" will be served by redirects? <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorB_c220.html" title="User:GregorB">GregorB</a> 20:21, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
