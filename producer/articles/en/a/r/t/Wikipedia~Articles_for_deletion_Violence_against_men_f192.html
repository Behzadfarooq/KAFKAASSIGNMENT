<p>The article was created by a copy-paste of <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violence_against_women.html" title="Violence against women">Violence against women</a> with the word "women" in the original changed to "men". Problem is that "violence against women" is a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Term_of_art.html" title="Term of art">term of art</a>, with specific denotative and connotative meaning in common use within at least some segments of the world, a fact reflected in everything from legislation like the <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violence_Against_Women_Act_a3f3.html" title="Violence Against Women Act">Violence Against Women Act</a> to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b/102-8759431-1041729?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=%22violence+against+women%22&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b/102-8759431-1041729?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=%22violence+against+women%22&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go" rel="nofollow">book titles</a> to people and groups who identify themselves as part of a "movement to end violence against women" <a href="http://www.vawnet.org/DomesticViolence/PreventionAndEducation/Campaigns/MenCampaigns.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vawnet.org/DomesticViolence/PreventionAndEducation/Campaigns/MenCampaigns.php" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.edc.org/GLG/end-violence/hypermail/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.edc.org/GLG/end-violence/hypermail/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://www.acalltomen.com/index.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.acalltomen.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, all of which suggest that there is a cohesive idea. "Violence against men," as a topic name for a cohesive idea, has no such evidence for its existence; given the articles on which links to <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violence_against_men.html" title="Violence against men">Violence against men</a> have been added, the manner in which those links were added, and the way in which the article was created, it looks like a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation in the form of a neologism and original research. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 02:19, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This might be sexist of me, but I'd wager the vast amount of violence to males by females is violence to boys rather than men.
