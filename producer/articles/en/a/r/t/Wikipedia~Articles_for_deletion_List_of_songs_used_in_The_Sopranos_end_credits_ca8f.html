<li><b>Comment</b> I was intending to complete the list shortly, and perhaps write a paragraph or two about the important use of popular music on <i>The Sopranos</i> and how each episode is noted for featuring a unique piece of music at the end. I realize that referencing this is difficult, and that me watching all the episodes and figuring out what the song is isn't sufficient. Still, part of the reason I created the list was that I had never seen any comprehensive list of all the end credits themes. Anyway, I'm not really familiar enough with the deletion process to know whether the list should stay or not; I just thought I'd comment to try addressing some of Danski14's remarks. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebogusman_6391.html" title="User:Thebogusman">Thebogusman</a> 21:54, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - While it is true that the music of the Sopranos has been written about, none of the articles' sources mention the end credits musical selection. Two of the sources pick the "top ten musical moments," none of which are from the end credits, and the third is a gripe about the song selection on the soundtrack album with, again, no mention of the end credits. Thus no sources are offered for which the end credits music is the subject. The article does not explain why the music of the end credits specifically has any significance either within the fiction or in the real world. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:26, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Although you're correct that none of the articles focus specifically on the ending music, at least half of the songs cited in both the <i>Star-Ledger</i> and MSNBC were played over the end credits. Also, the Salon article mentions several ending songs. Really, the majority of pop music on the show that's of thematic significance is played at the end credits, though there are plenty of clear exceptions. I do need to find a citation that notes this. I guess the reason I made the article was that the ending music is something of a constant on the show; the viewer comes to expect a song as the screen fades to black. Attempting to catalog every song that's played on the show seems much less feasible, and also less useful, I think. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebogusman_6391.html" title="User:Thebogusman">Thebogusman</a> 03:54, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Another note: the MSNBC article contains the quote, "The producers of this show have, among many other achievements of course, turned the playing of killer tunes over end credits into an art form." <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebogusman_6391.html" title="User:Thebogusman">Thebogusman</a> 04:02, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I have read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> a lot of times, thank you very much. Now I don't think you're ever going to agree with me, but maybe you can at least see my reasoning. I think we've established that music in the Sopranos on the whole is notable - it is indeed been the subject of works in several independent reliable sources. Would we want a list with <i>all</i> songs that are played during the show? No, I don't think so. (correct me if I am wrong here). Hence, let's take the most notable part of it. What is it? Well, the same sources assert that it is probably the music played over the ending credits of each episode. Henceforth, I do believe that the subject for the article is notable enough such that it merits existence. Hope you can see my line of reasoning. I'd love to get more third party input into this discussion though, that would make things more clear. --<a href="../../../g/i/m/User%7EGimlei_9818.html" title="User:Gimlei">Gi<font color="green">m</font>lei</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimlei_6df7.html" title="User talk:Gimlei"><i>(talk to me)</i></a></sup></small> 18:36, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Though the article is actually a review of a Sopranos Soundtrack album, it devotes its first of six paragraphs to highlighting the effectiveness of the show's closing music, and spends much of the rest of it referring to songs that end the show. I don't know if that's sufficient or not. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebogusman_6391.html" title="User:Thebogusman">Thebogusman</a> 18:22, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Perhaps just a Music used in The Sopranos would be the best solution. Copy the end credit info, and add more info about the rest of the music.

<li>I think that's a good idea. I had considered it, but was unsure how to include stuff about other songs while keeping NPOV. Actually I noticed there's already an article titled <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_played_at_the_Bada_Bing_club_f550.html" title="List of songs played at the Bada Bing club">List of songs played at the Bada Bing club</a> that probably has less justification for existence than this one, since it provides minimal citation and justification. Perhaps these could all be merged into one article, where distinctions are drawn between what gets played at the Bada Bing, what Tony listens to in the car, what the kids listen to in their rooms, etc. as well as the significant thematic importance of other, non-incidental music, particularly those songs used in the closing credits. The only problem would be finding outside citations that support all this. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebogusman_6391.html" title="User:Thebogusman">Thebogusman</a> 22:14, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps a rewording of the title, something suggesting only significant or important music is in the article. Sorry I marked it for AfD so early, I saw the 8 minute time lapse and thought it was one of many abandoned personal projects I have seen. I guess I get a little disillusioned sometimes during Newpage patrol. <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr.Z-man_cef0.html" title="User:Mr.Z-man"><font color="maroon">Mr.Z-man</font></a><b><small><a href="../../../m/r/2E/User_talk%7EMr.Z-man_a62d.html" title="User talk:Mr.Z-man">talk</a></small><i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mr.Z-man_8ed1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mr.Z-man"><font color="navy" face="cursive">¢</font></a></i></b> 22:46, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Any suggestions for a title? I'm not great at coming up with those kinds of things.
