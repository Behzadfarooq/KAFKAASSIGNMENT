<li><b>Comment</b>. It appears to me that the reasoning behind the <a href="../../../o/l/y/Wikipedia%7EOlympic_conventions_archive_8e57.html#Medal_counts_should_include_ONLY_medals_and_not_Top-8_placements." title="Wikipedia:Olympic conventions/archive">new policy</a> is essentially that a "medal count" should specifically count medals. However, this page does not claim to be a medal count; it clearly states that it is a diploma count. It looks to be properly-sourced and verifiable. It seems that the real question is whether a page titled "diploma count" should be subjected to a policy which is specifically tailored to pages titled "medal count." Though it should be noted that the diploma count appears to be constructed specifically to flaunt the new policy. - <a href="../../../r/y/n/User%7ERynne_b8d8.html" title="User:Rynne">Rynne</a> 23:30, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I got the impression from that debate that a diploma count would be welcome to a good portion of the users there, so long as it was separate from a medal count. I don't think there was a consensus about whether or not it would be okay to start a new article about it, but it certainly doesn't see to violate policy. I'd like to hear from someone more involved before I make a judgment. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickelShoe_2d9b.html" title="User:NickelShoe">NickelShoe</a> 23:39, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - this states clearly that it's a diploma count, not a medal count, and states exactly why eight (because that's the places that get diplomas). If these are genuinely being handed out by the IOC (which I believe they are), and the standings are readily available and verifiable (which they are), then what exactly is the problem? The previous discussion was specifically about medal tables - this isn't a medal table, so the previous discussion does not necessarily hold. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 23:55, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: By the Olympic Charter, the first, second, and third place medalists recieve both medals and diplomas (<a href="http://www.sport.gov.gr/2/24/243/2431/24314/243144/paper8.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sport.gov.gr/2/24/243/2431/24314/243144/paper8.html" rel="nofollow">source</a>).

<li><b>Keep</b>. After consideration, I think that the page should probably be kept.

<li><b>DELETE</b>. I cannot believe that after a concensus was already reached (see <a href="../../../o/l/y/Wikipedia%7EOlympic_conventions_6e97.html" title="Wikipedia:Olympic conventions">Wikipedia:Olympic conventions</a>) that we are revisiting this issue. Those that support this so-called "diploma count" should have been present at the Olympic conventions debate, which I may add, was well publicized and well marked on Wikipedia for all interested parties to participate in. Most articles on the Olympic Games were marked with a template mentioning this conventions discussion and many participated. As far as I'm concerned and as far as the record is concerned, Wikipedia has already decided upon the appropriate templates for medal counts and this type of count was found inappropriate. Again, I point all interested parties to <a href="../../../o/l/y/Wikipedia%7EOlympic_conventions_6e97.html" title="Wikipedia:Olympic conventions">Wikipedia:Olympic conventions</a> to see the voting process and which conventions were cleared. This is a non-issue...delete this article.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. This was my original post for a vote on top-8 count templates. <i>I noticed that the 2006 Winter Olympics medal count not only has medals won by each national team but also includes "Top-8 placements" (fourth through eighth places). I believe the article is named "medal count" for a reason. These tables are not named "honorable mention count." Medal counts are for medals, period. --Caponer 03:02, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</i>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The issue here is that in regards to the page in question, "diploma counts" are not "medal counts". However, WikiProject Sports Olympics does specify "medal counts" are to be used in general Olympic articles, so this debate would seem to have no influence on any article except this particular one. I don't think anyone is suggesting the guidelines set up in the WikiProject and <a href="../../../o/l/y/Wikipedia%7EOlympic_conventions_6e97.html" title="Wikipedia:Olympic conventions">Wikipedia:Olympic conventions</a> should be changed; we're just trying to figure how they apply to this specific page. - <a href="../../../r/y/n/User%7ERynne_b8d8.html" title="User:Rynne">Rynne</a> 01:53, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

My point is that this table doesn't offer any useful information. This doesn't even give a hint to how high 8th place is in some cases. In the Alpine Skiing article mentioned below, 8th place doesn't look so bad because 60 people were involved. In hockey and curling, 8th place is actually 3rd or 4th from last! To me, this list simply looks like a way to get an olympic mention for Moldova.

<li><b>Comment</b>: so first you compared olympic athletes to blondes with halitosis, and now you're comparing them to a serial killer? take it easy.. i'm just reminding you to be nice, that's all. Anyway, I'd never heard of the concept either until i came across this table.. but that's certainly not justification for deleting it. are you disputing the notability of the table? since the olympics are such a high-profile event, i would think that even <i>qualifying</i> for them is a notable feat.. <a href="../../../m/l/m/User%7EMlm42_1189.html" title="User:Mlm42">Mlm42</a> 14:36, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Come on, are you reading every 3rd word of what I write? In my first statement, I was trying to simply make a point that showing the total of all athletes from Iceland who came in 7th from the Olympics sounds like useless statistic-cruft to me. I wasn't comparing the athletes, I was comparing the usefulness of the data presented (sheesh). Then you accused me of being insulting so my second statement was saying that, not only wasn't I trying to be insulting of the athletes themselves but that, even if I <i>was</i> being insulting, that has nothing to do with notability - i.e. I think you're confusing two separate concepts (sheesh again). If I'm insulting anything, it's how little the data in this table is actually showing. I don't mind the lists that show who came in 48th in Alpine Skiing because you're right, just making the Olympics is noteworthy. But that's not what this list is showing - it's showing a giant total of all of the 7th-place finishers grouped by country. Not interesting. Is there some big study I'm not aware of that's relating the number of 7th-place finishers from Scandinavia to the phases of Jupiter? I don't think a list of people from Hungary whose name begins with J would be very interesting either - that doesn't mean I hate all people from Hungary whose name starts with J. â€”<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 16:07, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>yikes, sorry.. i know you meant no harm; i guess i was just put off by your 'who cares' attitude towards to athletes. no hard feelings.. and i know insults are separate from notability, but that doesn't mean i can't address them. as for notability, a tally of medals for each country is clearly a very notable table; and although a tally of these lesser known diplomas is less notable, i still feel it's enough to stay. but i suppose that's what this vote is supposed to decide. <a href="../../../m/l/m/User%7EMlm42_1189.html" title="User:Mlm42">Mlm42</a> 16:40, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, because those pages are just for information about the specific evnent....at those pages, it is beneficial to have a through 8th place count. but on a main page, it is not necessary to have two or more pages. Can someone give me a valid reason for why 2 or more tables would be productive and benefit the wikipedia viewing community. Its a prepoeterous idea that will cause upset for future olympics if it not settled now.

The supposed "policy" referred to in the nomination has no force, and the WikiProject discussed above, regardless of consensus it might or might not have reached, is at best a suggestion.

On that count, I'm not sure how notable 4-8th place finishes are, but clearly some people keep track of them.

<dd>Jared, I don't understand what you've got against this table.. is it offensive to you in some way? I personally like it because it gives country comparisons more depth - and in particular, if you count fourth place finishes, Canada beats the USA.. being Canadian, this makes me smile; but i can understand an American possibly wanting to gloss over this fact - which probably shouldn't be done on wikipedia.. and i mean, yes, there are two tables.. in fact, the information in one table is entirely contained within the other (which suggests to get rid of the smaller one! but that would be silly).. so although aesthetically it may be nice to have no duplication, i don't see a problem with sacrificing some aesthetic value for knowledge.. this is an encyclopedia, after all. <a href="../../../m/l/m/User%7EMlm42_1189.html" title="User:Mlm42">Mlm42</a> 21:26, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have just looked at all of the comments and we're just about split between keep and delete. I think that the main reason for the Keep votes is because the table is a nice suppliment to the main one; and I agree that is a tad interesting to look at. But what I'm trying to put across is that one table should be enough. People should come to Wikipedia knowing that they will get one type of medal count for each past, present, and future games; this will lessen their confusion. Further, while it would be possible to put up for this and all future games, the diploma count is blatently shown on all pages like <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speed_skating_at_the_2006_Winter_Olympics_-_Men%27s_500_metres_d581.html" title="Speed skating at the 2006 Winter Olympics - Men's 500 metres">Speed_skating_at_the_2006_Winter_Olympics_-_Men's_500_metres</a>, which <i>should</i> be the place for the more specific counts. I hope you realize that I am not opposed to the counts I proposed for deletion, I just don't think they have a place in Wikipedia. Might I suggest a link to a page that shows one of these counts? <a href="../../../j/p/0/User%7EJP06035_fdfe.html" title="User:JP06035">Jared</a> 13:46, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I feel a little strange arguing about this, because what I disagree with most is your philosophy of wikipedia. I think people should come to wikipedia with some question they want answered, and then become pleasantly surprised when they get more than what they asked for. I certainly hope there aren't too many people out there thinking "i hope this article has only the information i'm looking for, and nothing more".. that wouldn't be in the encyclopedic spirit. I mean, it's nice if articles fit together in a beautiful and consistent way, but our primary goal should be providing relevant, quality information. and since you probably won't find a table like this elsewhere, I think wikipedia is <i>exactly</i> the place for it.. it's verifiable content, and as i mentioned, makes country comparisons a lot easier.. say, for example, you wanted a list of all countries that had fourth place finishers; without this table, how would you do it? you'd either have to go through every single country page, or every single sport page - that's a lot of work! a lot of work that is already done for us with this table.. and if that isn't a reason to keep, then i don't know what is.. <a href="../../../m/l/m/User%7EMlm42_1189.html" title="User:Mlm42">Mlm42</a> 16:41, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

To top it all off, who out of all of the people here who voted <i>keep</i> could hold to it right now that they would and could impliment a diploma count for every olympics AND the total counts (total, winter, summer)? I myself would not be willing, nor do I have the time, to do such a thing.
