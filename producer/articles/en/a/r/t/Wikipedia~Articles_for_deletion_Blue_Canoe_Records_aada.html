<li><b>Above editors are incorrect</b> we have 10 artists and it's growing. Joseph was the first on the list that deserved by your guidelines to be considered.

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Your contributions to this enyclopedia are objectionable because you, Ms. Frieske, have the same user name as the record label that you work for. With these contributions, including your repeated insertions of this, Mr. Moore's, and Moore's album into more reputable articles are done in a way that seems to me that you are treating Wikipedia as an advertising service, which it is <b><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">NOT</a></b>. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 03:39, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Can you Help?</b>Not advertising here <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a>...just stating facts which are backed up by your guidelines. Being the exectuive producer, I would know more than most about our record label. I'm not spamming and I'm not using this as a soapbox. I've spent the last 72 two hours pouring over your guidelines, correcting posts, adding links, emailing your editors and in return all i get is negative feedback. It seems to me that you should point out <b>HOW I CAN FIX</b> these opinions so we can have an entry on wikipedia or please simply pull this off. I respect Wikipedia and I respect all the editors who work tirelessly to keep your encyclopedia to a high standard. I only wish that you <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> would provide us with the necessary information to <b>HELP</b> us instead of your own personal negative slant towards us. Blue Canoe Records is a respectable label, I only wish that you would find it in your heart to see this. I speak the truth and I stand by this and everything I've added to this free Wikipedia Encyclpedia. Will you please, reconisder your opionon? <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluecanoe_2160.html" title="User:Bluecanoe">Karen Frieske, Executive Producer of Blue Canoe Records</a>

<li>A large amount of my issues with your contributions that you are pushing your label, its artist(s), and their album(s) as being notable in their areas of interest, which from what I know, is not the truth. A large amount of your edits put Mr. Moore onto lists of other reputable musical artists within articles, listing him along side <a href="../../../g/e/d/Geddy_Lee_0515.html" title="Geddy Lee">Geddy Lee</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Entwistle_c8ff.html" title="John Entwistle">John Entwistle</a>, among others. Your contributions about your label are severely questionable as to assert the notability of those within. I'm afraid that I cannot think of any way to help you to have these articles stay within Wikipedia, and I apologize for that. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 04:09, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> i looked at those pages you cited and I don't see Joseph's name on those pages. You are accusing us of adding things we didn't add. Joseph is a bass guitarist and obviously so is the two gentleman you cited. According to your post above, you are asserting that our contributions are not true and that we are posting false info and our embellishing our own personal opions here. Last time I checked Joseph was a bass player and darn good one at that. He is #25 out of the top #100 as posted by an outside source:<a href="http://www.digitaldreamdoor.com/pages/best_jazz/best_jazzbass.html" class="external free" title="http://www.digitaldreamdoor.com/pages/best_jazz/best_jazzbass.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.digitaldreamdoor.com/pages/best_jazz/best_jazzbass.html</a>
<p>So now you know. For the record...I stand by what I post and by your guidelines set forth in your credible and amazing enclcyopedia.</p>
<p>Thank you for your fair consideration.......................<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluecanoe_2160.html" title="User:Bluecanoe">Karen Frieske, Executive Producer of Blue Canoe Records</a></p>
<ul>
<li>First, stop making your comments headers. They disrupt the AFD logs. Second, sign your comments by placing ~~~~ at the end of your comments. Third, you did not add Joseph's name to the pages for Geddy Lee or John Entwistle, but you added him to lists where they were also listed, such as <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_guitar.html" title="Bass guitar">Bass guitar</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bass_guitarists.html" title="List of bass guitarists">List of bass guitarists</a>, and the alumni list for <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Tennessee_21d3.html" title="University of Tennessee">University of Tennessee</a>. I went through where his article was listed and removed him from these lists because of the dubiousness of his notability, which is still being questioned (I did not remove the listing at U Tennessee, but another editor who felt the same way did, as well). Once again, I have nothing against your company and anyone involved withit, but I do have something against people who feel that they are important enough for mentioning on Wikipedia, which has been lauded by some as an unreliable resource because of editors who wish to do nothing but advertise, which your actions I felt to be as such. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 04:33, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>why are you pulling links on your own accord</b> <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a>, I respectful disagree. I've stated the facts. Joseph is an alumni of UTK and he does play bass guitar. Again all of which are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bluecanoe" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bluecanoe" rel="nofollow">BACKED up and cited on NUMEROUS sites that we've supplied links to (both external and internal).</a> The fact that your pulling things on your own free will out of the encyclopedia that are <b>indeed fact's</b>, really questions the true validity of Wikipedia.

<li>He may be a bassist, but because of his (so far) lack of notability, I had removed him from the various lists and articles where you had inserted him. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 04:48, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>#1 on EMusic.com's Most downloaded Artist in the Jam/Rock Genre for the month of july at the second most digital downloading store (behind itunes):<a href="http://www.emusic.com/charts/ch/b/-dbm/b/0-0/556+1200000404/0.html" class="external free" title="http://www.emusic.com/charts/ch/b/-dbm/b/0-0/556+1200000404/0.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.emusic.com/charts/ch/b/-dbm/b/0-0/556+1200000404/0.html</a><br />
It seems to me for what I know, Geddy Lee and John Entwistle (which you cited above) is also considered Rock/Jam bassists and would fall under this same catagory....<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> <b>Is this a lack of notability?</b><br />
Again, I stand by what I've been saying on the last 30 posts to you...I state the facts here. I'm not spamming nor am I advertising, because we don't need to do this, as we are having success without abusing or spamming credible bodies of work such as wikipedia. I'm simple citing articles of notable artists that met the guidelines of which you have put forth. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluecanoe_2160.html" title="User:Bluecanoe">Karen Frieske, Executive Producer of Blue Canoe Records</a>
<ul>
<li>I have heard of Geddy Lee and John Entwistle, and they are established musical artists. I have never heard of Joseph Patrick Moore until I found him listed on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>. They are internationally renowned bass guitarists. From all standpoints, Mr. Moore is not. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 05:05, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ok , I think <b>I've proved my point</b> about your negative slant and non-helpfulness towards Joseph and Blue Canoe Records <b>as stated by your comments above</b>. <b>You would rather impose your own personal opinion, which seems to go against the very guidelines which you have set forth.</b> It appears that many other people are familiar with Joseph his music and his contributions to both the <a href="http://www.digitaldreamdoor.com/pages/best_jazz/best_jazzbass.html" class="external text" title="http://www.digitaldreamdoor.com/pages/best_jazz/best_jazzbass.html" rel="nofollow">world of bass</a> and beyond.

The fact that he has a CD titled "Decade 1996-2005" should offer some sense of notability, credibility and thoughtfullness as to your guidelines. I regret that you have taken upon yourself to insert your own opinions as opposed to doing what you we're hired to do, which was to fact check and see that the info posted can be verified. Instead <b>you removed links that are credible and could be of value to many wikipedia's visitors</b>. I have made every effort to provide plenty of internal and external links to varify the article.

<li>I am not imposing a personal opinion. If there are others who know about Joseph Patrick Moore and Blue Canoe Records, they are free to edit the encyclopedia as well. It is just that <b>you</b> are the sole contributor to the articles connected to the record label that <b>you</b> work for, and are promoting this artist by placing him elsewhere in the encyclopedia when his notability is in question by others. If he is notable, then yes, he deserves a mention at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bass_guitarists.html" title="List of bass guitarists">List of bass guitarists</a> as well as his alma mater, but he does not need to be mentioned in the actual article for the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_guitar.html" title="Bass guitar">Bass guitar</a> or other various guitars. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 05:28, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
