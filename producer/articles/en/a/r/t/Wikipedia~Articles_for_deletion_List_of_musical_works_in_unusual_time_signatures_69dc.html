<li><b>Keep</b> per Richardcavell. Should be broken up into smaller articles. "Unusual time signature" is a common Western designation for meters not divisible by 2 or 3; the list should be confined to Western music, in the most broadly defined terms (so, for instance, rock music from anywhere in the world would apply, but recordings of West African drumming would not). <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChubbles1212_4175.html" title="User:Chubbles1212">Chubbles1212</a> 02:01, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep this article, it is amazing. It actually has helped me sometimes. that Sufjan Stevens with his wacky time signatures. Seriously though, I actually looked for a list like this. I googled "list of ridiculously bizarre time signatures", and found this page. Actually this is one of my favorite wikipedia pages.

<li><b>Delete</b> in its current form it is unmaintainable. Remember, Telephone Directories are VERY useful, and utility is NOT a criteria for an article at wikipedia. I would have no problem if this article reappeared as individual lists for specific smaller articles, for each specific time signature as a list, which would each be more useful and more manageable. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 04:53, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Reluctantly, I can't see this being anything other than a delete <i>in its current form</i>, which is a shame because I'll admit it is both useful and interesting. A possible compromise might be to <b>split it into separate articles</b> for individual time signatures: though "unusual" may be a POV term, articles such as List of musical works in 5/4 or 5/8 time might at least save some of this in usable, non-POV form, so I'd prefer splitting it into these if possible, though that still may fall foul of deletionist views. FWIW, in its current form it could also get extremely long - I keep a similar list offline myself, and there is very little cvorrelation between the two in terms of what tracks are listed. From this, I suspect that the current list could grow to several times its current size. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 05:45, 23 November 2006 (UTC) (now playing, Pete Shelley, "I generate a feeling" - 13/8 time)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I stressed over this decision, but I think that although the term "unusual" sounds very POV it is still a useful list. I think it could be of use to people interested in the subject, and unlikely to be found anywhere outside wikipedia in this form (unlike information on schools or a phone book for instance). I suggest adding the qualification that to be included in the list the artist or song must have or be worthy of a seperate wikipedia article. Thus all notability criteria would then be followed. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 10:22, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Chubbles' comments above. Its current large state doesn't mean it can't be broken into smaller pieces (per time signature). Therefore the list can be fixed so it's no longer unmaintainable without deletion. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:49, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'd <b>delete</b> - at 89 KB and based on the ambiguity of the criteria for inclusion - anything other than 4/4 and 2/2 could be on it. As Mgm said, I'd also like to see it broken up by time signature - just because it has crappy formatting doesn't mean it's beyond hope. <a href="../../../s/t/4/User%7EST47_d0a2.html" title="User:ST47">ST47</a><small><a href="../../../s/t/4/User_talk%7EST47_ecf4.html" title="User talk:ST47">Talk</a></small> 12:23, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> "Oh no, not again!" What is unusual? Who defines what is unusual with respect to a particular genre? Is there systemic bias in the genres represented? Or the dates? Look how over-represented the last decade is within the list. Do we have reliable sources for the time signatures of the more modern pieces, which are typically not published as sheet music? Far More Blue and Far More Drums are the same piece, essentially, why two entries? What about movements within other works, such as <i>In Freezing Winter Night</i> from Britten's Ceremony of Carols? Is there an objective definition of what constitutes an unusual time signature in the context of a given genre, or is this just an end-run around the removal of articles like the list of songs in triple metre?

<li>That would be an "interesting" choice, since we already deleted articles for "list of songs in <i>foo</i> metre" due to the fact that the selection of an individual metre is arbitrary, the lists are potentially vast, and almost every inclusion from the last couple of decades is straight OR since they are not published in sheet music. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 18:31, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and split</b>: The designation "unusual" is sound enough; it's a better title than "list of pieces in metres that are not 2/4 3/4 or 4/4" or whatever.

Unfortunately, this list was deleted some months later, and I can't find any further debate about it. A pity, since I used that list several times for information... The parallel here is that the longtitle list consisted of "original research" in that the authors had to <i>count the number of words in the song titles</i> rather than use verified sources stating that the titles were long. Here, the authors are <i>counting the number of beats in a measure</i> rather than finding sources that state that the song is in an irregular meter. Surely this isn't reasonably considered original research? <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChubbles1212_4175.html" title="User:Chubbles1212">Chubbles1212</a> 20:02, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Many contemporary composers and song writers do not publish their sheet music.

<li><b>Comment</b> All it is in terms of reaserch is citing a primary rather than a secondary source- a song, rather than someone <i>talking</i> about a song.

<li><b>Keep</b>, though it should probably be split to keep it from being overlong.

<li><b>Obvious Keep</b> - at least one entry is well sourced - pruning of unsourced entries of the list is not a concern for AfD. <b>This article is incomplete, and likely to remain so</b> is a terrible criterion for deletion. It'd result in the deletion of most articles on wikipedia. Nor is <i>maintaining this article is a lot of work</i> a good argument. The article <i>is</i> being maintained - if someone wants to put in the time and effort to create a good article, it's hardly the wiki spirit to say "You're working too hard - stop building such a good encyclopaedia".

<li><b>Keep</b> The list is a useful resource. Change unusual to uncommon and break it into smaller entries if necessary, but the content should remain. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharacter_00da.html" title="User:Character">Character</a> 17:45, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Useful, totally verifiable (you don't need sheet music to be able to tell if a song is in 4/4 time or not!). Would prefer to see it broken down into specific meters, because of the POV connotations of "unusual." | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 20:40, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The purpose of this list would be better would be better served with an article explaining how different time signatures become standardized in different areas and times and why some composers chose to use time signatures out of the norm. <a href="../../../b/j/a/User%7EBjart_97cb.html" title="User:Bjart">Bjart</a> 18:37, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Needs work but not unfixable. <a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBotleySmith_160d.html" title="User:BotleySmith">BotleySmith</a> 20:42, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Although hard to maintain and include each song with an unusual time signature, I ended up stumbling on this page trying to find out what time signature a song was in, so it was at least beneficial to me. kirkio 01:01, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but split, leaving a main page referring to all the sub-pages. Narssarssuaq 04:59, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm a musician who finds uncommon time signatures very interesting and this list has been extremely helpful to me. I think the idea of breaking it up into smaller articles is a good idea. Junta889 06:37, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>; I found it helpful, but just considering the page length, <b>split</b> if necessary. (My first AfD vote... and it's positive! Yay!&#160;:-D) --<b><a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatheMezzaMorphis163_88b7.html" title="User:MatheMezzaMorphis163">3M163</a></b>//<i><b><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatheMezzaMorphis163_3007.html" title="User talk:MatheMezzaMorphis163">Complete Geek</a></b></i> 08:28, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I think it's wonderful Iliff 16:17, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Very helpful, and obviously a massive amount of time and effort was put into this.</li>
