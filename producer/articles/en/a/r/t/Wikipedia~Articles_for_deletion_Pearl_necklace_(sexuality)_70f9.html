<p><s>*<b>Strong delete, no merge</b> Dicdef, probably already at Urban Dictionary where it belongs. Please don't vote "merge," as that is a "keep" vote. Also, I suspect that the young woman in the picture wearing nothing but semen and a smile may be using the article as a forum for exhibitionism of homemade pornography, since she uploaded the picture herself. My suspicions are further supported by the fact that the picture does not, in fact, depict a pearl necklace, but rather a simple "facial." The idea of the "pearl necklace" is not an important topic in sexual activity, and is more of a joke than anything else (cf. the ZZTop song "Pearl Necklace"). Yes, it is possible to ejaculate on women in many different ways, none of which are encyclopedic, in my opinion. Erik the Rude 17:01, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<li>I'm going to agree with Catamorphism below and recommend that it be <b>redirect</b>ed to the article on the facial. Jesus H. Christ, this is a silly discussion!

<li>Hello, Jeff. I'm not surprised that you're here, as this is one of your areas of special interest, sexual slang in Wikipedia. I'll be polite and not dig up your history of time after time defending puerile sexual slang and then wave it in your face as other users do. Indeed, you must have the soul of an appeals attorney who specialises in capital crimes, and I commend you for your due diligence. Maybe there should be a Wiki project that deals more rigourously with sexual slang than does Urban Dictionary. Wikipedia, however, is not that project, nor are we Partridge's Dictionary of English Slang. All I can say is, Wikipedia is not a dictionary, Wikipedia is not a dictionary, and Wikipedia is not a dictionary. Magister Erik the Rude 23:08, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Having done the Hawaiian muscle fuck myself, against my own will, I might add as I was coerced by a kinky girlfriend with 36D's, I can't see how a pearl necklace is the logical end of the act. A dribbler would most likely dribble semen onto the superior sternum, which would then pool at the cricoid region and run superiorly into the carotid sinuses, lateral to the trachea and medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. It's also very possible that the semen would be shot between the breasts, on the belly, or dribble down the belly. A shooter would just blow it all over the chest or face in a blob and spatter pattern. To properly execute a pearl necklace, which I haven't done, one would have to dribble semen at the midline of the neck, superior to the clavicles. I don't think it's that easy to execute properly, it's almost certainly no fun because of the technical skill and control involved, which is why I think it is no more than a joke. Also, the viscosity of the semen would be a possible problem. Some semen is too viscous to "dribble" or "run." I'd be interested in some first-hand reports of successful pearl necklaces. Maybe some research could be conducted at Wikimania 2006, and if this crap doesn't belong in BJAODN, I don't know what does. Maybe merge it all to Deposition of semen during human sexual intercourse.

<li>She was sitting on the floor, reclining against the couch. I was more or less upright, and since it's almost impossible to aim one's dick, I probably would have shot on her belly. She was watching the action in the mirror as I laboured away with no final orgasmic reward. Therefore, I can't vouch for the location of the deposited semen.&#160;:-(. Tittyfucking isn't fun, guys. Don't believe the hype. It's weird as anything, and it's really kinky, but it's just stupid and it makes you feel like a douchebag. Don't even try it on anything smaller than a 36C unless you have <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micropenis.html" title="Micropenis">micropenis</a>. BTW, if anyone wants the name and location of this very busty Filipina-American 3-way girl who loves to do kink, email me. She's a Vice Consul for the U.S. State Dept., and she loves daily sex, so why shouldn't I help her out? Magister Erik the Rude 05:02, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I believe the more traditional position involves the woman lying totally flat on her back, which would cause the material to run up her chest and down the side of her neck.

<dd><a href="../../../t/i/t/Titfuck.html" title="Titfuck">Titfuck</a> is good and should possibly be the primary name of the article if kept. I used "Hawaiian muscle fuck" for cacophemistic humor. However, I still maintain that all the articles on shooting semen on women during sex should be in one place. Folks, it's hard to aim unless you're a professional or you're less than 6 inches from the target. Even porn stars screw up and shoot the lady in the eye. Most of us have seen that many times.

<li><b>Comment</b> Excellent reasoning there, Erik the Rude, but I think the new article should have a shorter name like Ejaculation Deposition maybe? Many possible "targets" could be listed there. I really wish this subject was being discussed in a more erudite and sober manner.
