<li><b>Keep</b> Brunette is dark brown hair. It would be interesting to have an article on black hair and the genetics/cultural signifigance behind it.

<dd>I think the argument is that Jet black hair is too specific, and should become part of a new article called Black hair, which would have more scope <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMammal4_a688.html" title="User:Mammal4">Mammal4</a> 17:23, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Black is brunette in terms of color, but Brunettes have brown hair. Brunettes are considered westerners where there are different hair color. Black hair is Jet black hair, otherwise it's considered brunette and is western. What else would be included in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hair.html" title="Black hair">black hair</a>, brunette's, no, only jet black hair. That's it. 168.253.15.112 17:25, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As a side note, it's generally a bad idea to make major changes (such as a move) during an AfD debate, as it makes it difficult for users to determine exactly what's going on. As far as I can tell from looking at the page histories, <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hair.html" title="Black hair">black hair</a> did not exist prior to this debate, thus it was a <i>move</i> and not a <i>merge</i>, and we need an admin to repair the copy-and-paste move and merge the page histories. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish">Northenglish</a> (<a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a>) -- 21:39, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I didn't say and imply that what I said is a policy. Without mechanical and cyborg answer, I hope I made my point, but you are welcome to disagree though. My main concern and implication is that this article and argument has become so ethnocentric, so blonde loving and worshipping individuals that they forgot to file AfD against the blonde articles, especially the platinum and strawbery blondes, that they are attacking and feeling threatened by black hair color, which is common among non-whites. Just to give you something to think about. You are welcome to give your cyborg answer though. I agree that it should stand on its own, but ethnocentrism is playing huge role in this discussion. I think black hair shouldn't be filed for AfD (some white person filed it), but strawberry and platinum blonde should be filed many years ago (minutes after it was created) and deleted with 100% delete agreement. 168.253.15.112 06:33, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, no I didn't say that. I was just arguing about the strawberry blonde, platinum blonde articles as having a basis for deletion. That's all. Black hair especially jet black is very common. 168.253.15.112 00:11, 10 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I noticed that it was a content fork, except with no sourced content. If it were a topic that didn't get covered elsewhere I'd go with the "worthy of expansion" argument but the editors at <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair_color.html" title="Hair color">hair color</a> (not long on sources in the first place) should get back to the drawing board and create enough <i>sourced</i> content before they should think about forking. As about the other ones, some should definitely go. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 00:26, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It is true that black hair is already mentioned in the <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair_color.html" title="Hair color">hair color</a> article, but each of the other sections there also link to a main article on <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blonde.html" title="Blonde">blonde</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_hair.html" title="Red hair">red hair</a>, and <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brunette.html" title="Brunette">brunette</a>. It is not a content fork--this sort of structure of having a short summary at a main article and then a full article elsewhere is common throughout Wikipedia. Just because it's a stub and needs expansion doesn't mean it should be deleted; it means it should be expanded. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish">Northenglish</a> (<a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a>) -- 02:11, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry, wrong terminology. I didn't mean to imply that <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hair.html" title="Black hair">black hair</a> can't stand on its own as a more detailed discussion of <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair_color.html" title="Hair color">hair color</a>. I meant to say that the article as it is now cannot stand, and unless someone adopts and sources it needs to be folded back into hair color. The content as it is is just random stuff. (<i>Hitler's hair is depicted as jet black</i>??) ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 02:27, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In that case it should be sourced, with the Hitler example. But is generally true though most Westerners will believe it's true. It's pop culture and everyone will agree. 168.253.15.112 06:24, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You are not making any sense. It's "just random stuff," what is the evidence that you claim that it random? Are you being subjective? Ethnocentric? You just can't claim stuff and make it delete it. But the Hitler assumption should be source, but is common sense for people168.253.15.112 06:35, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
