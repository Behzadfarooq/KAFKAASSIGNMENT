<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>no consensus.</b> Vote as I have it is 33 for delete, 22 for merge and 19 for keep. So 52 of 74 votes want it to be deleted in some way. If you discount some of the anon votes, the percentage is higher. The problem is whether to delete or merge. For now, let's wait. I will put a note on the talk page about the vote. Once the target article is made, then we can merge and redirect or just delete the article. We do have similar memorials for 9/11 at [<a href="http://sep11.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Memoriam" class="external autonumber" title="http://sep11.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Memoriam" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]. Wiki could very easily decide to do something similar for Hurricane Katrina, so let's not be so hasty. For now, I'm going to leave things as is. You may rake me over the coals starting...now. I will also rename this article Hardy Jackson as it should be under his real name. <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">Woohookitty</a> 08:33, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>I say keep it.</b> I speedied this article twice, but it was restored twice (once by me). Still, Wikipedia is not a memorial. While I offer my condolences to Mr. Jackson, he needs to be more notable for stuff other than losing his wife in the recent hurricane and going on TV about it. Due to the heavy loses in the hurricane, there will be others going on TV to express their sadness. <s><b>Delete, but a gentle one.</b> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 04:13, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</s></p>

<li><b>Weak delete or transwiki</b>. Wrong project. There's nothing wrong with the content except that it's not encyclopedic, because nobody is going to remember Mr. Jackson in a year or two. The fact that people are voting "keep for the moment" is a perfect indication that this is transitory content: interesting now, but not for long.

<ul>
<li>Point, but Cindy Sheehan practically has a daily column in a number of newpapers and is <u>protesting</u> the death of her son, whereas Harvey Jackson's wife died in a natural disaster, had a 2-minute piece on some television channels, and he's not protesting anything or otherwise doing anything notable except having a wife who died in a hurricane. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcap_a87c.html" title="User:Blackcap">Blackcap</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackcap_5870.html" title="User talk:Blackcap">talk</a> 19:47, September 1, 2005 (UTC)

<li>O.K. He's not doing anything special, so what makes the world's response to this paticular interview special? Why shou;d this interview be mentioned in the response to Hurricane Katrina? Isn't it just another survivor story? As far as I can tell, all that should remain of this article is a sentence in the Effect of Hurricane Katrina article saying something like, "The world feels great sympathy for the sufferers of this hurricane," and have this as a source.

<li>His wife is NOT dead. She is missing. there are over 30,000 still missing and they are not all dead 69.142.21.24 04:24, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>The way the lead was worded when I first saw the article, she was dead. But since there is a chance she could be alive. So, I changed the lead a bit to state that she went missing. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 04:27, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment/vote</b>. In my opinion, this article was listed for deletion too early; we need to keep this listing up for a little while longer as the news story continues to play out. We don't know yet what kind of role he's going to have in the aftermath, if he'll become a famous celebrity, etc. There are people who become famous because they are victims in tragedies (<a href="../../../t/o/d/Todd_Beamer_13e4.html" title="Todd Beamer">Todd Beamer</a>, etc.) or relatives of those who die in wars (<a href="../../../c/i/n/Cindy_Sheehan_da7a.html" title="Cindy Sheehan">Cindy Sheehan</a>, etc.). If Mr. Jackson ever gets this kind of notability, or anything close, I'd say <b>keep and move to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardy_Jackson_dbd9.html" title="Hardy Jackson">Hardy Jackson</a></b> (for crying out loud, that page should be moved <i>now</i>, if his name is not Harvey Jackson, but Hardy Jackson!) Otherwise delete per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a memorial, or transwiki to an appropriate memorial wiki as we do for 9/11 victims.

<li>Well, I am not sure how longer the AFD should last, but the article should be merged. Ecen with all of the Annon votes striken out, it would be a mix between merge and delete. But where should we merge it too, we have to figure that out now. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 21:09, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why not remove the vfd notice from article and leave it until the destination article is written? As of right now, there is no destination article but the consensus is we want to save this material 69.142.21.24 22:08, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps we should postpone this decision until things have settled down; at the time being, it's difficult to keep any article detailing rescues/evacuations in order due to the constantly changing nature of events. I'm guessing that in a couple of weeks, the dust will have settled some and things can take a more coherent order. In any case, by then it'll be easier to understand the notability of Jackson's story in light of other survivors and integrate it into wherever it ends up. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeadsalmon_0aca.html" title="User:Deadsalmon">Deadsalmon</a> 06:12, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
