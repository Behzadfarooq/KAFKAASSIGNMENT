<p>This entry, stated by indefinitely banned trouble-maker <a href="../../../j/j/s/User%7EJJstroker_fe91.html" title="User:JJstroker">JJstroker</a> (<a href="../../../j/j/s/User_talk%7EJJstroker_e88c.html" title="User talk:JJstroker">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JJstroker_c39a.html" title="Special:Contributions/JJstroker">contribs</a>), is inherently problematic. The page will likely attract anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi POV-pushers, who argue that there is some sort of a connection between Communism and Judaism. Moreover, classifying who is a Jew is often a difficult judgment call outside the competence of Wikipedia editors. For example, Karl Marx, who is listed on the page, is a paradigmatic example of the difficulty of determining who is a Jew. Marx’s family converted to <a href="../../../l/u/t/Lutheranism.html" title="Lutheranism">Lutheranism</a>; and, later in life, Marx, like many communists, rejected organized religion. <b>Strong delete</b>. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 04:55, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Active: Could you explain to the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peanut_gallery.html" title="Peanut gallery">peanut gallery</a> <i>exactly how</i> you arrived at the conclusion that <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> belongs on the List of Jewish communists? Since when does <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> = <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communism</a>? I must be missing something, right? Hmm, it must have been the day I missed that <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberation_theology.html" title="Liberation theology">liberation theology</a> lecture on "<a href="../../../k/e/r/Kermit_the_Frog_5361.html" title="Kermit the Frog">Kermit the Frog is a communist</a>" ("frogs of the world unite -- before you croak!") and thus he is a very vulnerable "Jewish" frog. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 10:32, 4 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First, Christ isn't communist in my perception. Nevertheless, (1) the phrase that "Christ was the first communist" is quite a common - whether I like it or not. (2) <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberation_theology.html" title="Liberation theology">Liberation theology</a> is indeed a good argument for adding the name (with some reserve) (3) The term 'communism' is not only used for modern-day <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communism</a> since Karl Marx. For example, there is also <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primitive_communism.html" title="Primitive communism">Primitive communism</a>. (4) The prominent leader <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Kautsky_a48e.html" title="Karl Kautsky">Karl Kautsky</a> wrote a long article on Christianity and compared Christ's ideology to that of communisms. You see, many reasons not to ignore the connection laid down by many people - even though it is not my personal opinion. <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActiveSelective_242a.html" title="User:ActiveSelective">ActiveSelective</a> 10:41, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Active: The problem with all this stuff is that it is <i>not</i> mainstream and until such time as it's accepted by the mainstream churches this type of "information" will always run afoul of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and hardly ever be fit to be <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>. You know, Jesus lived so long ago you can call him anything you like, but that does mean it's valid to do so. Communism is associated with the likes of <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Stalin_46d2.html" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/o/Mao_Tse_Tung_ead6.html" title="Mao Tse Tung">Mao Tse Tung</a> and it is doubtful that Jesus could or should be placed in the company of such modern-day figures. Why is it that there is this desire to connect anything significant to the Jews when the Jews and Judaism utterly reject such connections on their behalf? <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 11:30, 4 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, it's hard for me to defend an opinion that is not mine. But I think the argument goes something like this: the vision of communism is a classless and egalitarian society; communists are for the redistribution of wealth and organizing social security. A particular communist zionist movement organized kibutzim. It is not all that different from a Jesus who chases the rich out of the temple, shares bread and fish, and says the poor will be taken up in heaven and the rich should first share. <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActiveSelective_242a.html" title="User:ActiveSelective">ActiveSelective</a> 15:42, 4 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wow, I think that nails it, it is not more controversial to classify Jesus as a Communist than as a Jew, and it's hard to argue that he was not a Jew... I of course think of Jesus first as a Jewish Pacifist, which is hard to reconcile with Communism on one level because of the call for revolution, but if that revolution can come without bloodshed... //// <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific.html" title="Pacific">Pacific</a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/PanDeist_8c11.html" title="PanDeist">PanDeist</a> <a href="../../../p/a/c/User_talk%7EPacific_PanDeist_8d93.html" title="User talk:Pacific PanDeist">*</a> 08:15, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Example: <b><a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_communism.html" title="Christian communism">Christian communism</a></b> is a form of religious communism centered around Christianity. It is a theological and political theory based upon the view that the teachings of Jesus Christ compel Christians to support communism as the ideal social system. / For more examples, see <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_communism.html" title="Religious communism">Religious communism</a>. <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActiveSelective_242a.html" title="User:ActiveSelective">ActiveSelective</a> 08:57, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - You're very right anti-semites have no business here or anywhere, and therefore your warning is a valuable addition to the pages and talk pages. Not oposing that, the combination of the two subjects (the love-hate-relationship of Communism-and-Judaism and the Jewish communists caught in the middle) remains a very interesting object of study since it is connected to many questions in history and politics; it is just like the similar complicated love-hate-relationship of Judaism-and-Zionism (see <a href="http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com" class="external text" title="http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com" rel="nofollow">Jews against zionism</a>). Why did the people of one of the most backward countries in the world, and certainly the most anti-semite country, chose Trotsky (and other Jews) among their communist leaders? How very different where the personal and political fights of these particular communists against racism from outside, isolation from inside, opposing the zionist racism? Jewish communists have a very interesting history of their own no other Jew or communist has. Rather than deleting this list in order to prevent possible abuse (call it pre-emptive deletion) and thereby also preventing any normal use, I would suggest: (1) to add your warnings to the pages. (2) also to start an article on why it is difficult to determine who is a Jew and who not. How the term "Jew" changed during history from its original religious meaning to a new racial meaning and all the confusion and abuse inbetween? Then a "list of non-Jewish Jews" as illutration? <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActiveSelective_242a.html" title="User:ActiveSelective">ActiveSelective</a> 06:19, 4 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I find the topic somewhat interesting as well, as a historian who is of Jewish background. Still, as <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7ERelevance_46d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Relevance">Wikipedia:Relevance</a> instructs us, just because a topic is interesting does not mean it is encyclopedic. The object of study you describe is beyond the scope of Wikipedia, as it is not Wikipedia's place to decide on the difficult question of who happens to be a Jew. (Religious affiliation is one criterion, but it does not apply to the bulk of 'Jewish' Communists, who, like Karl Marx, did not practice Judaism.) Thus, I cannot imagine this page continuing to exist within the framework of Wikipedia's content guidelines. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 06:55, 4 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(1) Well, I've seen many well written articles on problematic subjects. Atheist authors and believers cooperated on the <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existence_of_god.html" title="Existence of god">Existence of god</a> article, not deciding whether God exists or not, but displaying the whole spectrum of arguments evenly. With similar caution the different interpretations of the word "Jew" can be described. (2) Also, the list of terrorists is about who is 'generally considered' as such, and the list of humanists is about people who 'self-identify' as such - whether they are or not is thereby left out of the question. The perception of them being so is an important real power in itself. Likewise, Karl Marx is generally considered being 'Jewish' even though he wasn't religious. So, it means we should choose our words carefully here, indeed. We must also reference to the article <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_is_a_Jew__a96f.html" title="Who is a Jew?">Who is a Jew?</a>. <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActiveSelective_242a.html" title="User:ActiveSelective">ActiveSelective</a> 08:28, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>This is not just a problematic subject, but a problematic list. Just about every entry on the list would be a POV judgment call.

<li><b>Delete</b>. As mentioned, this 'list' was compiled by a previous troublemaker, and is likely just another <i>joke</i> of his. There are only so many Communists in the world and whether or not they are Jewish or are of Jewish ancestry is entirely irrelevant unless they say otherwise.

<li><b>Delete</b> this <i>very</i> clumsily written list. It's in fact a <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misnomer.html" title="Misnomer">misnomer</a> to say "Jewish communists" as this article implies quite blatantly that it's somehow one's "<a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a>-ness" (implying a connection to <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> as well) that has anything to do with being or becoming a "<i>Jewish</i> communist." This is similar to claims by communists that it is "Jewish capitalists" or "Jewish financiers" who are behind the world's ills. Then there is the claim that there is "Jewish racism" versus the power of "Jewish liberalism". So its "Jewish-this and Jewish-that" and it's all quite meaningless. This madness can go on and on unless it is stopped, and now is as a good a time as any to do so. <i>Perhaps</i> a better title may have been Communists of Jewish descent or The role of Jews in the history of Communism written in a very delicate and professional manner, but as this article stands it is nowhere near that. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 09:47, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>A rename is fine. More info in the article is definitely very very welcome. However, I do not see how the article determines communism to be a Jewish thing.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I would also oppose a list of Catholic fascists. The conceptual frame for both is one that amplifies historic stereotyping while obscuring encyclopedic content. These--and similar diads involving a religion and an object of scorn--need to be enclosed within broader discussions in order to minimize their use by bigots by placing the discussion in a detailed and nuanced context. This is the approach at <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism_and_religion</a> that helped calm down edit wars and exploitation by bigots. In addition, the underlying assumption of the existing entry is that Jews appear to be a biological or genetic concept, rather than a religion and ethnicity with a wide range of forms. Some of the people listed clearly walked away from both the religion and the ethnicity. What is left is the non-existant racial or biological "Jew"--the core concept of Hitler. Wikipedia should avoid taxonomies favored by the Nazis. The page looks just like dozens of others I have studies...on neonazi websites. Same claims. Same list.

<li><b>Comment</b> I took a look at the article and three questions came to mind. (1.) Are there many lists of communists by ethncity and lists of communists by religion and if so for which ethnicities and religions do such lists exist? (2.) Isn't there a lot of tension between communism (as an ideology) and the sectoralism of non-national identities as well as between communism and religion? (3.) If such tension does exist, how well can this be covered in a list? Regards, <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 04:13, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good questions. Let me first say that I didn't start the 'article' (it seems to be done by someone with not so best intentions) but I did try to make it into something more decent yesterday. So I might not be able to answer everything as good:
<ol>
<li>You can type in "american communists" and wikipedia gives you the CPUSA party. You can type in "german communists" and wikipedia gives you SED party. Etcetera. Etcetera. However, when you type in "jewish communists", wikipedia does not give an article about a Jewish communist party. We cannot refer to a <u>Jewish communist party</u> since there existed none (or not for long) in history, so we can and must refer to a list of Jewish individuals (Leon Davidovitsh Bronstein / Leon Trotsky was a very prominent example). <b>(</b>* <b>Comment</b> - Israeli party <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadash.html" title="Hadash">Hadash</a> made up of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_Israel_12ff.html" title="Communist Party of Israel">Communist Party of Israel</a> remnant of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_Palestine_d151.html" title="Communist Party of Palestine">Communist Party of Palestine</a> --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheYmode_df1a.html" title="User:TheYmode">The<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 17pt"><font color="green">Y</font></span>mode</a> 04:10, 8 July 2006 (UTC) <b>)</b></li>
<li>The difficult debate about the <u>definition of "Jew"</u> (religion, ethnicity, race, culture, etc. etc.) is dealt with already in the article <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_is_a_Jew__a96f.html" title="Who is a Jew?">Who is a Jew?</a> Therefore this list starts with: <i>This page is a list of people identified as Jews, either by themselves or by others. "Jewishness" has the meanings both of "adherence to the religion of Judaism" and "membership in the ethnic group 'Jews'. People of both groups are listed here. By other criteria, these people may be listed under other nationalities as well. See: Who is a Jew?</i> This warning is copied from other <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_Jews_93a3.html" title="Lists of Jews">Lists of Jews</a>. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_Nobel_Prize_winners_e504.html" title="List of Jewish Nobel Prize winners">List of Jewish Nobel Prize winners</a>, for example. So Leon Trotsky and Rosa Luxemburg are considered "Jew" because of ancestry.</li>
<li>There are many forms of "communism": it is the vision of an egalitarian society, it is also the communist movement for social change, even distribution of wealth and social security. So communism is not necessarily bad. It is also the good/bad legacy of communist individuals, the party bureaucracy, etc. There are pre-Marx communisms: <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primitive_communism.html" title="Primitive communism">Primitive communism</a>. There are <u>combinations with religion</u>: <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_communism.html" title="Christian communism">Christian communism</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_communism.html" title="Religious communism">Religious communism</a>. So, why would being Jewish (religiously or ethnically) and being communist then be impossible?</li>
<li>Communism has its distinct tactics and strategies against anti-Semitism, through workers unions, and workers revolt, "workers across the world, unite!" etc. However, no other communists but Jewish communists were the direct victims of anti-Semitism. This makes this group especially interesting: 1. no other communist but <i>Jewish</i> communists had the "inside" view of being direct victims, 2. and no other Jew but the <i>communist</i> Jews were trying these communist <u>strategies against anti-Semitism</u>. Their views and position are unique, special, interesting, and valuable. That's why I also added the articles on "The Jewish Question" (the old name for fighting against anti-Semitism) in which they describe their strategies against anti-Semitism. <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActiveSelective_242a.html" title="User:ActiveSelective">ActiveSelective</a> 08:46, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is already an article on Jewish Communism, it's just called by its <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> name...see <a href="../../../k/i/b/Kibbutz.html" title="Kibbutz">kibbutz</a>. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 00:53, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are partly right. The Kibbutz movement was communist, indeed. However, it was only one particular form of communism. The majority of Jewish communists were on odd terms with the Kibbutz commies. They'd rather fight in the country they lived, loved and worked in, than move away into hiding somewhere near Jerusalem. See for example my super hero <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marek_Edelman_a8ba.html" title="Marek Edelman">Marek Edelman</a>: he fought the nazis (<a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw_Ghetto_Rising_3b04.html" title="Warsaw Ghetto Rising">Warsaw Ghetto Rising</a>) and after WWII the Stalinist dictatorship (<a href="../../../s/o/l/Solidarity.html" title="Solidarity">Solidarinosc</a>).

<li><b>Keep</b>. If there are lists of other communists by ethnicity, then Jewish shouldn't be the sole exception. I don't think the subject list refers to Judaiam = Jewish religion, but Jewish ethno-centrism within the larger context of the period, and in that context the anti-Russian, anti-czar activities of early Bolsheviks could be explored, and many of the leaders were indeed of Jewish ethnicity.

<dd>Jewish is an ethnicity and a religion, it cannot be neither. Thanks. The Bolshevik leaders weren't religious, but they were still ethnically Jewish. It wasn't used an an "epithet".<a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukirat_7a93.html" title="User:Yukirat">Yukirat</a> 17:14, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Their leaders weren't religious, to be certain, and they were ethnically Jewish, and I think it's pretty bizarre that no mention of the fact that what caused them to storm out of the Congress where they became dubbed as "mensheviks" was in response to the excessively antisemitic remarks (which would have made Göbbels proud) made by the "bolsheviks" is never mentioned in either <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menshevik.html" title="Menshevik">menshevik</a> or <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolshevik.html" title="Bolshevik">bolshevik</a>... That notwithstanding, there are two things you mention here, both of which are easily refutable wrt the usefulness of this category. (1) "Jewish" is both an ethnicity and a religion, to be sure, but that's not really relevant to anything anyone's said here in arguing against the usefulness of this category... the problem is that there is nothing demonstrable about their Jewishness that makes these Communists' Jewishness notable, as such. If it were "ethnicity" that were important, then <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> should be included as in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Category%7EGerman_communists_07da.html" title="Category:German communists">Category:German communists</a> since his family was originally from Germany, Category:Christian communists and/or Category:Lutheran communists since he was raised as a Lutheran Christian and <a href="../../../e/n/g/Category%7EEnglish_communists_da2b.html" title="Category:English communists">Category:English communists</a> or <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBritish_communists_46a4.html" title="Category:British communists">Category:British communists</a> since he lived most of his life in England and Category:White communists (since he was white).

On the other point (2), the business about "Jewish ethnocentrism" I was referring to, is the indisputable fact that the phrase "Jewish ethnocentrism" is used almost <i>exclusively</i> as an epithet by antisemites. The assertion of "ethnocentrism", vis-à-vis the Jews, generally is tangled up in a grotesquely mangled misperception about the meaning of "<a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews_as_a_chosen_people.html" title="Jews as a chosen people">Jews as a chosen people</a>", which always ends up coming out as an indictment against the Jews of such "crimes" as "exclusivity", "aloofness", "superiority-complex", etc. [which generally describe the claimants of "ethnocentrism" far better than they've ever described Jews...but when these people suffer from a severe inferiority complex coupled with poor education, there's no accounting for the illogic they'll come up with to support their conspiracy theories...] That notwithstanding, the assertion that it was "Jewish ethno-centrism" that made communism attractive or naturally compatible with Judaism as you imply, is a non-sequitur on two fronts...not only did the early communists-who-happened-to-be-Jews not suffer any sort of "Jewish ethno-centrism", they in fact eschewed <i>any <u>signs</u></i> of ethno-centrism (and reserved their most venemous vitriol for observant Jews), but also the idea that they had some sort of "Jewish ethno-centrism" is utterly erroneous since, as you yourself acknowledge, they didn't identify with Judaism at all! The only thing that made them Jewish was their ancestry, and that ancestry played no significant rôle whatsoever in their communist ideology.

<dd><b>&gt;&gt;</b> Yukarit, the supposed "ethnocentrism" is nonsensical and racist. You neither listened to Tomer an TShilo's arguments, nor read anything about / written by these communists. And I don't think the way you'd like to see this article go, is gonna be my way too.</dd>
<dd><b>&gt;&gt;</b> TShilo12, Tomer, Gidonb, et al, even though I think an article on Jewish Communists is legitimate and can be well written, I am very pleased to see the overwhelming number of people voting 'delete' here. It shows that editors are vigilent against any possible anti-Semitism. Although it is blocking the article, the knee-jerk automatism ("Jewish? Communism? Oh no, it <i>must</i> be anti-Semitism!") is a good first reaction. But think about it twice: Yes, the combination 'Jew' and 'Communism' has been abused many times by anti-Semites, but does that mean we need to give in to their nasty POV?</dd>
<dd>Communists were <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proletarian_internationalism.html" title="Proletarian internationalism">internationalists</a> calling for workers of all backgrounds to unite against an economical system of exploitation -- an international workers victory. They were not "anti-Russian", not "Jewish ethnocentrist", nor "anti-Semite". Just like the French non-Jewish communist <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emile_Zola_78bb.html" title="Emile Zola">Emile Zola</a> was one of the few to defend <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Dreyfus_b173.html" title="Alfred Dreyfus">Alfred Dreyfus</a>, so were the Russian communists defending Jewish and Christian minorities against the Tsarist pogroms. In the most anti-Semite country in the world, the Russian communist movement voted (among others) for Jews to lead them.</dd>
<dd>However, communism has a different side too. There is a difficulty with the word 'communism' which is almost analogous to the difficulty of the word 'Jewish'. In history new meanings have been added and now there are several communisms like there are several ways of being considered 'Jewish'. The name has been long abused by <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalinism.html" title="Stalinism">Stalinist</a> powers for the exact opposite: anti-internationalism (because of economic competition with foreign economies), anti-worker (because of exploitation of the working class), anti-Semite (in order to divert attention). To put it plainly: Stalinism is anti-communism. That's why he had <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trotsky.html" title="Trotsky">Trotsky</a>, <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Bolsheviks_c332.html" title="Old Bolsheviks">Old Bolsheviks</a> (of whom many were Jews) and their followers killed in The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Purge_75df.html" title="Great Purge">Great Purge</a> (the Stalinist Counter-Revolution). The whole sharade was wrapped in red banners and portraits of Marx, but Marx, communism and Communist Jews obviously had nothing to do with that kind of 'communism'.</dd>
<dd>Again, what legitimizes an article on Jewish Communists is that they were singled out on many occasions by anti-Semites. Because they were singled out so often and so harshly, they had a unique position as Jews among communists and as communists among Jews. They had unique experiences and strategies of fighting against anti-Semitism. Other communists and Jews did not have both. They have written down their valuable lessons (see List). What makes these valuable is <i>not</i> that they were 'religiously Jewish' (most were not), <i>nor</i> that 'race' should somehow be of importance (it should not!). What makes their lives and lessons valuable is that they were forced by the historical circumstances (by anti-Semitism and by social change) to become the unique combination of experiences and to do something about these circumstances. Not the Jewishness-in-itself played a role in becoming communist, but the being a direct victim of anti-Semitism that was haunting your 'Jewishness' was. (We could name it "List of Communists haunted by anti-Semitism because of their ancestry" but that would be a bit strange). It would be a waste to ignore this in an encyclopidia.</dd>
<dd>Yes, I do also think a longer article "history of Jews and Communism" is better than just a list of individuals and their works. No doubt in my mind this list will be deleted. A massive numbers voted against - that's good and sad at the same time. Still, we have to start somewhere. <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActiveSelective_242a.html" title="User:ActiveSelective">ActiveSelective</a> 11:49, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>ActiveSelective: I think you'll find that pretty much everyone who's voted "delete" would be perfectly content to see an article such as Role of Jews in the history of communism or History of Jews and communism. The problem with this article [<i>i.e.</i>, this "List of..."] is that, as a list, it makes no room for actual discussion of the rôle Jews played in the development of communist ideologies, nor is there any room for coverage of the fate of Jews living under communist régimes. As I mentioned earlier, there is such a thing as "Jewish communism", and it's covered briefly at <a href="../../../k/i/b/Kibbutz.html" title="Kibbutz">kibbutz</a>. As you mention above, Jews (among other groups) suffered horribly under Stalin's "communism"...when you talked about the goal of communism as the deshackling of workers worldwide, that's true, but Stalin's communism wasn't as "anti-communist" as you describe it...instead it was bolshevik philosophy in action (the masses are too dumb to "do communism" themselves), indeed the very philosophy that the mensheviks had so vehemently rejected. Anyways...I think this discussion, if it goes much further, should prolly be moved to the talkpage...

<li><b>Delete</b> per answers of ActiveSelective above. Yes, he does try to make something out of an extremely problematic (if not bashing) list, but, as his answers illustrate, it is a unique list among among non-national ethnicities and religious groups. It seems unique even among nationalities! Perhaps this is not without reason. A list is not the correct form to deal with the deep conflicts between communism, (non-national) ethnicity and religion. Instead I would recommend a history of Jews and communism article, which would include the intellectual and other contributions to communism, the Jewish and Arab-Jewish communist movements in Israel/Palestine and the long history of Soviet policies and practicies with respect to and against Jews and Judaism. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 10:55, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
