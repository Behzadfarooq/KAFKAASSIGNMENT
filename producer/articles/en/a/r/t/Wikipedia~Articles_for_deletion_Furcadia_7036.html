<li><b>Keep</b> <s>Furcadia is one of the furry community's largest well, community online. There are 2500 to 4000 members online at one given time (There are 4600 online right now). It has also been around since <i>1996</i>. It's not as if Furcadia is relatively recent, or even rarely known.</s> I'll help contribute to make the article better, but its more helpful if people HELP and add stuff to the article, than suggest deletion. <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisinclination_d9e1.html" title="User:Disinclination">Disinclination</a> 04:30, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Notability is not based on number of people on the site, or length of time existing. It's based on the presence of multiple reliable secondary sources, which simply do not exist here. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">babble</a></sup> 04:35, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>The issue is not that the article should be rewritten. The issue is that the subject itself is not notable.

<ul>
<li>Honestly, as I am reading the several links given about why this article should be deleted, how it is -not- notiable. Yes, there are several articles about furry and whatnot. And Furcadia is a massive community, not just a website. It is stated under history, and other sections about what makes Furcadia unique and notiable, as far as I can understand. <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisinclination_d9e1.html" title="User:Disinclination">Disinclination</a> 05:12, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> I'm amazed at that the assertion that this is non-notable. <i>This is not a website</i>. It's an MMO that's been running for the last nine years, and which has over 3,000 players online at this very moment. <a href="http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entries2003.php?entry_id=22" class="external text" title="http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entries2003.php?entry_id=22" rel="nofollow">Finalist</a> for the 9th <a href="../../../i/g/d/IGDA_570e.html" title="IGDA">IGDA</a> awards, see <a href="http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/january03/igf2003/Furcadia/index.shtml" class="external text" title="http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/january03/igf2003/Furcadia/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">associated coverage</a> at <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameSpy_a6b5.html" title="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>.

<ul>
<li>I've always heard it wasn't good that basically it had no gameplay aspect at all. Then I looked and saw it had no media references. Greenreaper, those references of awards and interviews should have been in the article. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 07:57, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Gameplay is provided by scripts that execute on objects within the world. I guess the people who you heard that from never went to go and play in one of those areas, or just didn't like them. Like <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Life_f75c.html" title="Second Life">Second Life</a>, it is not exactly a game so much as an online interaction space. People do tend to roleplay there, there's a system called <i>Furre!</i> based on the Pocket Universe RPG rules, and the popular webcomic <a href="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Dan_and_Mab%27s_Furry_Adventures" class="extiw" title="wikifur:Dan_and_Mab's_Furry_Adventures">Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures</a> is based on it. And yes, they should have been in the article, and they weren't, but they can be now. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 16:24, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> An awful lot of furry related articles seemed to be getting nominated today. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobovski_2c2e.html" title="User:Robovski">Robovski</a> 06:00, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Second the comment</b> At any given time there are probably thousands of articles on Wikipedia that could reasonably be reviewed for deletion and it does look highly suspect when several of them from a related subject area get nominated at about the same time, at least when the articles in question have existed for many months (in some cases over a year) and were developed and maintained independently of one another. <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalimu59_7f54.html" title="User:Mwalimu59">Mwalimu59</a> 14:57, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> That's because no one has suggested it before. I did, and people took up on it. Perhaps it's long overdue. Furries aren't super-well known after all. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMiltopia_1488.html" title="User:Miltopia">Miltopia</a> 13:33, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Popculturecruft. An MMO is not inherently notable, and very well may be the opposite. Not encyclopedia content. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 08:46, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> since there appear to be no non-trivial treatments in reliable secondary sources, so we cannot verify the neutrality of the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> Long-running MMO, has been covered per GreenReaper. Needs cleanup, but that is not a valid reason for deletion. Perfectly verifiable. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 10:14, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Not encyclopedia content. Biased sources. The only people that would look it up on Wikipedia are the players themselves because its userbase is so minor. Karozoa 10:43, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I'm seeing plenty of reliable sources. Richard A. Bartle's book "<i>Designing Virtual Worlds</i>" (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0131018167</a>) cites it as being among the first graphical worlds to allow player-created construction. Jeannie Novak's "<i>Game Development Essentials: An Introduction</i>" (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1401862713</a>) shows its community-building features. It even gets a current Google News hit, although that doesn't look promising. I know it's had some magazine coverage as well, being one of the first large graphical free MMORPGs. Definitely notable, definitely verifiable. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 12:51, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, this is one of the remaining MMOs, I agree with Starblind, its verifiable and notable. If this has been nominated for deletion, why not its developer and its chairperson get sent for AFD as well? --<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_Ong_4371.html" title="User:Terence Ong">Ter</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_Ong_4371.html" title="User:Terence Ong">nc</a><a href="../../../t/e/r/User_talk%7ETerence_Ong_215c.html" title="User talk:Terence Ong">e Ong</a> <sub>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Terence_Ong_928d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Terence Ong">C</a> | <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Terence_Ong_2_9033.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Terence Ong 2">R</a>)</sub> 14:08, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It is notable. There is much discussion in the tech world about getting women into designing and gaming. Over half of Furcadia's players are women.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> actually <b>due to</b> it's narrow targetted audience. Activity seems to be comparable to Habbo, if the top commenter is right with his/her numbers.

<li><b><s>Keep.</s> Delete.</b> <s>WP:WEB doesn't apply to this as Furcadia isn't a website.</s> Besides, it's a mildly popular MMO with thousands of users logged on at any given time. Though I do think this article goes into unnecessary detail which would serve a much better purpose at <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:furry:WikiFur_Central" class="extiw" title="wikicities:c:furry:WikiFur_Central">WikiFur</a>. --<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonbert_a4e6.html" title="User:Donbert">Donbert</a> 04:36, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Going back and looking at WP:WEB, I realized it applies to "web-specific content," so it does indeed apply to Furcadia. --<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonbert_a4e6.html" title="User:Donbert">Donbert</a> 04:56, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, it is a website. MMORPGs are still websites. And the number of people who play is irrelevant to whether or not there are multiple reliable secondary sources. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 04:40, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../m/m/o/MMORPG_6790.html" title="MMORPG">MMORPGs</a> are <a href="../../../w/e/b/Website.html" title="Website">websites</a>? MMORPG means "Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game". Simply because a game is online doesn't mean it's web-specific.

<li><b>Keep</b> 1. Debatable whether this is covered under WP:WEB. Note online-games/virtual worlds aren't mentioned as an example, 2. Notability and historical significance has been confirmed by the list of articles/websites/etc. quoted by GreenReaper and Starblind, 3. even <b>if</b> it is considered to be covered under WP:WEB, point 2 verifies its notability. Regardless on what people's views are on "furries", Furcadia is notable and hence the original recommendation to delete, is moot. --<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambutaan_be5a.html" title="User:Rambutaan">Rambutaan</a> 05:23, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Um...

<li><b>Keep</b>. Why would <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> apply to a MMOG that's not web-based? Because it has a website? It seems to me that the people who are citing WP:WEB might not know that Furcadia exists as a standalone client, not on the web. Notability? 60,000+ active players, being one of the early pioneers of the MMOSG genre, lasting 9+ years with no interruption and continuing to grow (no small feat for a video game), and even being a finalist for an award (albiet a minor one) combine to make it seem pretty notable, don't you think? As for verifiability, 3 or 4 good sources and a 3+ more okay sources is quite a bit better than most video game articles. <strike>If you think this article isn't well sourced, take a look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Massively_multiplayer_online_games" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Massively_multiplayer_online_games" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Afd a few dozen video game articles with much fewer sources if it makes you feel good. ...Or, you could actually <i>improve</i> Wikipedia by helping to make articles better.</strike> (strike that, evidently <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Inclusionism" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Inclusionism" rel="nofollow">Inclusionism</a> is taboo) -<a href="../../../k/o/t/User%7EKotra_1751.html" title="User:Kotra">kotra</a> 09:10, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, do we really need a page for every minor bit of "furry culture"? A few offhand mentions in a couple of books, no major awards to speak of, doesn't seem to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and a very loyal, but very small fanbase. Doesn't add up to notability to me. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichelleG_f55b.html" title="User:MichelleG">MichelleG</a> 09:57, 14 November 2006 (UTC).</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per the above commenters. Is there a discrimination taking place against these people? It seems like it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yamaguchi%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yamaguchi%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Yamaguchi先生</a> 22:39, 14 November 2006</li>
