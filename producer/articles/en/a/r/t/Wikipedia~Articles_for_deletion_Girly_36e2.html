<li><b>Keep.</b> If you are going to delete this one, you might as well delete all webcomic wikipedia entries. There are some that are far less as noteworthy as Girly, and their pages aren't considered for deletion at all. Girly has a significant presense in the webcomics community. Here are some links to reviews for the published Girly book, if this counts as 'notablity'. 1. <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/57077/josh_lesnick_webcomic_god.html" class="external free" title="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/57077/josh_lesnick_webcomic_god.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/57077/josh_lesnick_webcomic_god.html</a> 2. <a href="http://www.websnark.com/archives/2006/07/this_has_nothin.html" class="external free" title="http://www.websnark.com/archives/2006/07/this_has_nothin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.websnark.com/archives/2006/07/this_has_nothin.html</a> 3. <a href="http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/news/113954992729164.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/news/113954992729164.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/news/113954992729164.htm</a></li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I don't often find myself voting to keep webcomic articles, but this one does at least have a print edition from a notable publisher (Radio Comix). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 21:25, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>But there's no indication that this print edition meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> notability standards - "Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work", because the article has no reliable sources at all. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 04:56, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm still having trouble ascertaining how notability is judged here, but it seems like significant mainstream attention is now required for all forms of entertainment, and while I sort of understand this, webcomics -- and comic artists in general -- often have trouble getting such sources to recognize them, even if they've done enought to warrant it. Artists will frequently have to settle for doing good things without becoming media darlings. That being said, Girly's a culmination of a lot of years of skill building and ballbreaking endurance in the field of comics, and I honestly don't know if it's actually noteworthy, or if it just feels noteworthy to me due to all the work it took to get here. In any case, it should probably be noted, in case this gets deleted, that this is certainly not a fly-by-night fancomic; it has over 15000 readers and I'm one of the few web artists making a living solely from his comic work. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperHappy_29db.html" title="User:SuperHappy">SuperHappy</a> 22:57, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> (If you're having trouble with discerning notability, please see Uncle G's essay <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">User:Uncle G/On notability</a>.) Comic artists in general? I disagree; with effort, creativity and luck, you can be recognized by mainstream book press; <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Luen_Yang_724a.html" title="Gene Luen Yang">Gene Luen Yang</a> (who doesn't have an article yet)'s <i>American Born Chinese</i> was nominated for the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Book_Award_03c8.html" title="National Book Award">National Book Award</a>, one of the highest literary honours in the US. <a href="../../../k/a/z/Kazu_Kibuishi_aaac.html" title="Kazu Kibuishi">Kazu Kibuishi</a> et al's <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flight_%28comic%29.html" title="Flight (comic)">Flight</a> is published by Ballatine Books, a mainstream publisher, and <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Smith_%28cartoonist%29_1bab.html" title="Jeff Smith (cartoonist)">Jeff Smith</a>'s <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bone_%28comics%29.html" title="Bone (comics)">Bone</a> is published by Scholastic. Does it take skill, talent and luck? Sure. But writers have to go through the same process, and it's just as hard. I don't see how web publishing makes a comic more notable than other self-published efforts, so they should go through the same process (and I realize that you may see this as harsh. I didn't intend this.) We currently have some leniency for online sources (to address your concern that that mainstream press doesn't report on webcomics, even though it does; Megatokyo, When I Am King, Derek Kirk Kim's Same Difference have all been reported on), but they should be recognized as reliable (Gamespot can be a source for games; some comics news sites are used for comics). <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 02:56, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Fair enough, but I've been doing comics long enough to know about the mainstream comics and critical darlings. I hear the names you said repeated often enough and it's always the same names, and I stand by my opinion that the media's focus is extremely narrow. I know it's easy to dismiss this, saying I just feel this way because my own comic doesn't get the attention I feel it deserves, and I completely understand this. I stand by this conviction anyway. I don't see other decidedly notable comics like Scary Go Round and Sam &amp; Fuzzy get talked about much either. Incidentally, this AfD really should get linked to WikiProject:Webcomics, or is that project totally dead now? (it does seem that way) --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperHappy_29db.html" title="User:SuperHappy">SuperHappy</a> 11:03, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I see what you're saying and even agree up to a point, but surely you understand that what the media chooses to cover or not cover is not our fault nor is it within our control. As an encylopedia, all we can do is present verifiable facts culled from reliable sources. It's not an encyclopedia's job to "stand up for the little guy" or give a platform for those who want to get the word out about their cartoons. The alternative is far worse: imagine if our policy read as follows: "<i>Articles on topics within the arts and sciences must be fully referenced using reliable sources, except for webcomics where it's enough to find five people who think your strip kicks ass.</i>" Simply put, if an article about a congressional scandal needs reliable sources, then so does an article on a webcomic. We can't make exceptions. However, don't forget, the reliable-sources policy isn't there primarily to make it tough for cartoonists, it also protects cartoonists (and everyone else) from innacurate and unsourced claims. To remove it would be a libel suit (or two, or thousands) waiting to happen. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 16:12, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I do commend you for having the restraint to not edit the article heavily due to <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>. I, however, disagree with "mainstream" - Gene Yang, Derek Kirk Kim, and Kazu Kibuishi are hardly "mainstream", and they're not even in the "main webcomic culture" (to me that seems to be comprised of Keenspot and its ilk, and Megatokyo + Penny Arcade). <a href="http://webcomicsreview.com/?p=64&amp;page=2" class="external text" title="http://webcomicsreview.com/?p=64&amp;page=2" rel="nofollow">This</a> is a bit of an account of when Derek won his triple crown of comics awards and what that meant for the webcomics community (at least in the opinion of the commentators). <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 22:13, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yang, Kim, Kibushi aren't mainstream, but they're certainly critical darlings, and yes, critics do talk about these same artists over and over. Girly's not exactly a "little guy", as I repeat, it has over 15000 readers. I don't know exactly how many other webcomics can claim this, but it's certainly a small percentage of the tens of thousands of webcomics out there. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperHappy_29db.html" title="User:SuperHappy">SuperHappy</a> 20:39, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Wonderful detail in the article; I wish that editors could put that kind of loving attention into notable articles. The comic was just published in June. It hasn't had time for notability. Why are people in such a hurry to rush things into the Wikipedia? Maybe there should be a 24 month rule on current events. Anyway this is not notable, however nice it is. <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Crumb_275a.html" title="Robert Crumb">R. Crumb</a> was not mainstream, but he was notable. Comeback in five years and we can see if <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girly.html" title="Girly">Girly</a> has acquired any notability by then.
