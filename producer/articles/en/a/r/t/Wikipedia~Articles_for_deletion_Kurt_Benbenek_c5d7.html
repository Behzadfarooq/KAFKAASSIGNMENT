<li><b>COMMENT</b> So, suddenly Wikipedia is all about "notability"...or maybe it's just a kind of high-tech, open-source popularity contest? Not that many people in the obscure-est reaches of Arkansas or Mt Everest know who Einstein was (or what he did) yet Einstein is in Wikipedia. There are thousands of entries in Wikipedia that ARE NOT of a "notable" nature. How unfair is it to discredit a simple entry on the basis of "notability" - this type of "notability-based" stamp-of-approvalocity is unfair and narrow-minded and should not be tolerated. It's interesting to see that four or five guys (always guys...) with little sense of the "real" world can make or break a Wikipedia entry. All the negative criticism of this entry is based on spurious INTERNET data. Has anyone called The Swedenborg Society or East Village Arts District for verification of these Benbenek entry claims? Nah, I doubt it.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Otis Fodder (<a href="../../../o/t/i/User_talk%7EOtis_Fodder_15b5.html" title="User talk:Otis Fodder">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Otis_Fodder_6518.html" title="Special:Contributions/Otis Fodder">contribs</a>).</small></li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, Benbenek does not appear to live up to Wikipedia's standards of notability:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>His name gets just over 500 hits on Google, not a good start.</li>
<li>His personal website, <a href="http://www.houseplantpicturestudio.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.houseplantpicturestudio.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, has an Alexa ranking of over 1.6 million. Thus, the claim "<i>Over the past 10 years, Benbenek has posted literally hundreds of unique and artistic web pages, making Houseplant Picture Studio one of the most popular arts-oriented sites on the internet.</i>" a total falsehood.</li>
<li>"<i>In the early 1990s,Benbenek was a member of the rock band The Shatners</i>"; the band's website is hosted on Geocities, not good. Also, in the less than 1,000 google hits for this band, I cannot find a relevant and reliable source that mentions Benbenek's name. Moreover, the band's albums are on Archive.org, so they appear to be unsigned.</li>
<li>"<i>In 1996, Benbenek relocated to London, England where he was Assistant Secretary at The Swedenborg Society</i>" - the only sources I can find to verify this claim are from Wikipedia and the Answers.com and About.com mirrors of this page, and his Blogspot page.</li>
<li>"<i>Between 1997 and 2005 Benbenek collaborated with and produced five albums for the Woolwich punk band The Plumstead Common</i>" - this band gets even fewer hits than Benbenek's own name (164 according to Google), has not been signed, and so on, and so forth.</li>
<li>"<i>In 2005, Benbenek also co-produced the critically acclaimed album Haymarket Revival by The Magnesium Pie</i> " - this would be easier to believe if the review that was added to support this claim actually loaded, but the site appears to be down. Of course, it doesn't help that the band's name only gets 95 hits on Google, and no verifiable sources among them.</li>
<li>His solo album, "Third Toga Party from the Sun", gets only 179 google hits and no credible or reliable sources/reviews/mentions that I can find.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>So, the article's claims to notability appear to be completely unfounded. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveydweeb_22a2.html" title="User:Daveydweeb">Daveydw</a><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveydweeb_Esperanza_c934.html" title="User:Daveydweeb/Esperanza"><font color="green">ee</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveydweeb_22a2.html" title="User:Daveydweeb">b</a> (<small><sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDaveydweeb_17bd.html" title="User talk:Daveydweeb"><b>chat</b></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Daveydweeb_2_22db.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Daveydweeb 2"><b>review!</b></a></sub></small>) 07:04, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As the dissenter, isn't the onus at least partially on you to point everyone to some of these "knowledge bases beyond the internet"? Also, since a substantial portion of the subject's claims to notability are based on his Web site, using Web-based research techniques isn't entirely out of place. I tend to agree that WP is <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">somewhat biased toward first-world Google-at-my-fingertips research methods</a>, but it's not like the subject in question works entirely outside of that realm, so it's reasonable to expect him to have left a mark there.

<p>The problem with Wikipedia and it's users is that it (and they) assume everything of importance is web-based and can be found through Google, etc. It isn't and never will be. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Otis Fodder (<a href="../../../o/t/i/User_talk%7EOtis_Fodder_15b5.html" title="User talk:Otis Fodder">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Otis_Fodder_6518.html" title="Special:Contributions/Otis Fodder">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The Internet is kind of like a meta-resource. If something is picked up by any medium (books, magazines, news reports, etc.), it will show up on the Internet. Almost every newspaper in the country is indexed by Google news, for instance. I'm trying to think of a possible exception to all of this, but I'm having trouble.

<p><b>COMMENT</b> - - I don't know what you mean by "meta-resource" - sounds like questionable and vague Wikipedia-speak to me. Just because some cultural thing is "on the internet" (or can be quantified via often shady and/or meaningless internet statistics) doesn't mean it's "notable" (whatever "notable" means!) - some of the least notable things in the world started and died quick deaths on the internet. Where EXACTLY is it written that Google statistics are absolute LAW? For example, how is a website's (or person's or thing's) popularity or "success" or "notability" calculated on the internet? Is it calculated by number of VISITORS, PAGE VIEWS or ADVERTISEMENT REVENUE(s) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Otis Fodder (<a href="../../../o/t/i/User_talk%7EOtis_Fodder_15b5.html" title="User talk:Otis Fodder">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Otis_Fodder_6518.html" title="Special:Contributions/Otis Fodder">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>reply to User:Otis Fodder.</b> At issue here is that any information we put into an article about Kurt Benbenek must be cross-referenced to a print or internet source outside of wikipedia, and also not written by Kurt Benbenek. It is real simple. If you can provide print or internet references, not written by Kurt Benbenek or anyone connected to him, that appear in any source that undergoes editorial process (newspapers(like New York Times), magazines(like Rolling Stone), edited websites(Like Salon.com), trade journals(like Variety), books, etc.) the article gets kept. Its that simple. This isn't a popularity contest, and it isn;t biased. Your calling it so does not make it so. Let me repeat what I said before. PROVIDE REFERENCES THAT TALK ABOUT KURT BENBENEK AND YOU KEEP THE ARTICLE. No one has done that yet. We don't want blogs, we don't want chat forums, we don't want phone numbers. We want references that someone has written, an editor has reviewed, and a publisher has published. Such requirements are for every article, and the standard is applied here and everywhere else without prejudice. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 05:04, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>COMMENT</b> - When you say "we" ("We don't want blogs, we don't want chat forums.."), do you mean that you're paid by Wikipedia and you speak for them and all involved with Wikipedia? If you're NOT being paid to debate and investigate articles (such as this BENBENEK article), why do you do it and why do you use the word "we"? Are you speaking for Wikipedia as a thing or as an internet corporate entity? Or is the "we" referring to only you? This will help me respond to your immediately-previous comment...because I worry when single individuals start throwing the "we" word around. Plus I'm a little new to Wikipedia as an open-source text phenomenon. Plus I'm too lazy to hunt down your "Wikipedia User Profile" and see if you're part of official Wikapedia management. I figure you're probably just eager to respond to just about anything any body throws on these ever-changing and well-formatted pages. My other guess is that you're a BOT, but Wikipedia BOTs are probably out on Thanksgiving weekend vacation.</p>

<dd>Otis Fodder, I think we can say that the authority of Wikipedia editors or the Internet isn't up for review here. All that's needed is for you or someone else to provide some real and accessible sources to back up the notability of Mr. Benbenek. That's all! And in response to your above question, a "meta-resource" is by definition a resource of resources. -- <a href="../../../t/d/o/User%7ETdowling_0b42.html" title="User:Tdowling">Tim D</a> 06:15, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>My dear mom (who was somehow born in the 20s in Missouri without the use of Wikipedic means of childbirth) always taught me to watch out for ***GROUP THINK*** and when some anonymous guy on the internet tells me to "follow the blue links" I think I better start worrying. Guy...guys...if you all really have raging hard-ons for deleting my nice, little BENBENEK article, then by all means cite Wikipedia authority and direct people to your blue links until you're blue in the face and get on with it.

<li>Speaking of Wikipedia (and don't we all...) my biggest worry is that if all the knowledge in the world is sucked and uglified into Wikipedia, THEN if the worldwide electricity grid ever (somehow) goes out or is compromised by aliens from Neptune (one day in the bleak, Bradburyan future) then we're all up a wet knowledge creek with no brain paddles...because by then (as the Scriptures say) Google will have scanned and destroyed all our books including real encyclopedias and dictionaries, etc - therefore, putting everything on the internet is not totally good OR wise! Those that somehow think they are ***The Master Internet Scribes of Wikipedia*** should maybe give the whole smelly deal a better think-through...and also maybe should possibly be suspicious of cyber-movements of masses of lonely like-minded and self-proclaimed editors of The Almighty Wiki(pedia) into ONE MIND SET.
