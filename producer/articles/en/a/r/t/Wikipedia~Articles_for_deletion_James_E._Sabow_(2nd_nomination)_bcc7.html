<li>The first source is not a blog, usenet post or the like. It's a publication from an unrelated company. Sure, this isn't the kind of sourcing I'd want to take into a featured article nomination, but they bring it up to the minimum standard of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, nevermind bringing him past the notability criterion of "multiple published coverages" of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<li>No, it's not a blog... it is a PDF of the forensics report compiled by an outside consultant that they apparently made available on the web. personally I think it is a bit of a stretch to consider that towards <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>... "multiple published coverages". That is close to saying anyone who has had an article written about themselves and then dies and gets an obit would meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 00:39, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Obits are typically trivial or nearly trivial coverage, of ~1 paragraph, whereas the publication on his death from the Meixa Tech is 30 pages long - I would be hard pressed to see how that could be called <i>Trivial</i>. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 15:08, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I didn't say it was trivial; I just fail to see how the fact that the forensics lab decided to post the PDF on their website meets the spirit of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>'s "multiple published coverage".

<li>Well, that's one instance of a independant published source in which he's the focus and which is nontrivial. The OC Weekly article is a second such item. So there are multiple published coverages - I guessed you were deriding it as trivial because I can't imagine any other argument one could hope to plausibly make ... <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:14, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not sure you can make a plausible argument to that effect. Even simple dictionary definitions will show that it's published coverage. Since I'm not sure how you can deny this (in that I can't guess any rational) I'm not sure what policy or guideline to point you to. The essay <a href="../../../h/o/r/WP%7EHORSE_7e36.html" title="WP:HORSE">WP:HORSE</a> may be applicable, but it's a fairly inscrutable argument you're making, so I'm very likely wrong. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:46, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> There is one undoubtable reference, the one cited at "NCBI" above, which turns out to be an article in the peer-reviewed. J Forensic Sci. 1991 Nov;36(6):1745-52. Most murders do not get covered by pathology journals. That makes this one N, and the other sources add the context. I was about to vote delete until I stopped and looked at this article. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 06:16, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There is a saying that says, "Sometimes you have to call a spade a big F*&amp;^ing shovel." Why do we give people with crazy conspiracy theories a voice on Wikipedia for fear that might we offend someone. Read this guys userpage. He is pretty clear on his intentions and what this article is here to accomplish. Officiallty Colonel Sabow committed suicide and no one on this site is in a position to contest the findings.... pretty simple. So can I assume that any suicide that is contested rates it's own wikipedia article? I mean anyone who complains loud enough will eventually get a mention somewhere. How about keeping this in the trashcan where it belongs until something actually notable becomes of it.--<a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELooper5920_0b5b.html" title="User:Looper5920">Looper5920</a> 06:33, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
