<li><b>Keep</b> because there's a new version coming (WIP since 2003!), featuring the most outstanding GUI for any emulator ever and an incredible amount of features and options. Also I was about to contribute some info as soon I'll have a free minute =P Last but not least, this emu uses a unique way to draw the graphics. The software rendering has been completly rewritten for the Dreamcast's PowerVR2 hardware. You can see the result in the 2004 demo release called 'GenesisPlusDC PVR Preview Version 3'.</li>

<li>What I was implying was not debating the general topic's "cultural value", but the cultural importance, which affects whether WP should give it one brief article, or three, or dozens. This is a matter of <i>amount of</i> encyclopedic value. If a few fansites pop up for three children's TV shows and a movie from one producer, does that mean that WP should devote megabytes of disk space and many hours of contributors' time to it? And I asked the question (in terms of widespread impact) rather than denigrating the content by claiming it's not worthy. If a hundred million people bought Buffy toys and a great Buffy-Art movement was inspired, then we probably should have such deep and broad coverage as this list implies. If not, we probably shouldn't. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 14:39, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Maybe the article didn't deserve the nomination, but so what? I believe it was made in good faith, and the AfD process doesn't delete articles that should be kept (not that it's infallible).

<dd>Mary poppins wonce said "In every job that must be done, there is an element of fun. You find the fun and - SNAP - the job's a game" and further more, as within Mary Popins Movie... I decided I'll do it myself. The dialogue with my fictional meandering character in my mind went something like this:
<ul>
<li>CyclePat: I'll do it myself.</li>
<li>Mary Poppins: Do what?</li>

<dd>To clarify, the reason I dislike that particular comment ("offensive" was an exaggeration I guess) is that if people are afraid of doing anything but minor edits then we won't be getting anywhere. I'm not sure how quite to explain it but it gives off a vibe something to the opposite of the "be bold" mantra. I feel that this kind of attitude is intimidating.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that many editors aren't familiar with <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a>; when I was talking about "good faith" I meant that the nominator had good intentions of trying to help the project. By your comments I thought your opinion was that the nomination was made with bad intentions; I'm sorry, I now understand you were just saying that the nominator didn't know the guidelines, which is a fair thing to say.</dd>

<dd>I don't understand these Marry Poppins references (never seen it), in case you wonder why I don't reply to something you're saying with them.

<li><b>Comment</b>: If the consensus is not to delete the article, I'm fine with that. Certainly it's greatly expanded since I nominated it, and everyone who has since contributed to it deserves credit. I appreciate CyclePat's contrubution and his enthusiasm for the subject. I am not at all offended by his comment, which I take in the friendly spirit I'm sure he indended. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 14:13, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> IMHO it was a reasonable nomination. Nominations are an invitation to discussion. That's why we have discussions and a five-day review period. There's nothing terrible about nominating a borderline article. Nominations <i>should not be interpreted as</i> antipathy; nominating "bicycle mechanic" for deletion does not mean "I hate bicycle mechanics" or "I hate cyclists." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:33, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Consider</b> - While the information on this article may not verifiable through Google, I'd like to remind you that many things are not, yet they are still fact. Specifically, matters that pertain to a group of older ethnic people, who are not particularly internet savvy, go unpublished in cyberspace. The religous leaders in Amritsar, for instance, do not publish their "hukams" (orders) on the Web, yet they are a very real occurrence which can be vouched for by most Sikhs. The concept of Baba of Toronto is by no means contrived, and although it is a scarcely discussed topic, it is a well known to many Canadians specifically in Toronto -- largely thanks to a video of the Baba delivering his sermons. Deletion of this page should be reconsidered as it would be eliminating factual information simply because Google did not reveal information on the topic. --Torontowala 19:44, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Weak keep</b> if cleaned up</s>. I'm not sure how to judge notability for newgroups. Google groups gives about as many entries for alt.tv.real-world as the least-notable newsgroups with articles listed at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_newsgroups.html" title="List of newsgroups">List of newsgroups</a>. For example, compare 27,000 posts in alt.zines <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.zines" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.zines" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> to 31,000 posts in alt.tv.real-world <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.tv.real-world" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.tv.real-world" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_16.html" title="January 16">01-16</a>&#160;06:56<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></i></span>
<ul>
<li>One way to judge notability is to look for <i>multiple non-trivial published works about the newsgroup</i>, such as FAQs on <a href="http://faqs.org./" class="external free" title="http://faqs.org./" rel="nofollow">http://faqs.org./</a> for example. (This newsgroup has no FAQ there.) Counting posts is not a metric that is in any way reliable. In addition to the reason described below, consider the fact that raw article counts do not exclude Usenet spam. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:34, 16 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> since no published works about the newsgroup that I can find. FAQ for Alt.tv and other sources all still lists it as about the TV show rather than what the article describes, so the claims are unverifiable. Thanks Uncle G. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_17.html" title="January 17">01-17</a>&#160;02:05<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></i></span>
<ul>
<li>Nonsense, I'm afraid. Of course the FAQ will show the newsgroup to be about the TV show; it's an outdated FAQ from before the transformation of the group into a hub for off-topic comedy and trolling. The new users of the group are not likely to be inclined to write and publish FAQs on their own activities, nor are the conventional FAQ anthologies on the Web likely to accept such FAQs. The "claims" would be easily verifiable using Google Groups, if only the author had bothered to include some links (a strike against him, unfortunately).
<ul>
<li>I'm not predispositioned to delete (as you could tell from my vote changing); just couldn't verify the claims. Since you say it is indeed easily verifiable could you tell us, and tell the article, where to find reputable references? <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_18.html" title="January 18">01-18</a>&#160;01:07<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></i></span>
<ul>
<li>Read what I wrote again, please. I didn't say "is easily verifiable," I said "would be easily verifiable" if the author (who surely possesses this information, if it exists) had taken the time to include some links to relevant articles in Google's Usenet archive. If the author, or an author, can do this, there will be your evidence in favor of keeping. If not, delete.
<ul>
<li>Okay, I see what you mean. However, I'm not sure that three or four links to posts would qualify as evidence that the newsgroup has permanently gone off-topic. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> 18:41, 19 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I thought you were looking for evidence of notability, not evidence that the newsgroup had gone permanently off-topic. The former could, as I said, be demonstrated with some links to the Google archive; the latter would not be so easy to establish with links of any kind (one would have to present some kind of overview of recent activity, with the number of off-topic posts compared to the number of on-topic posts, if any).
<ul>
<li>I suppose it's no consolation that I was in the process of updating the article, in which I was citing the historical significance of the group, and intended to include many links to the Google archives supporting these claims? Because, that was, in fact, what I was doing. I hadn't uploaded anything yet, because I didn't want to put it out there unfinished. So that's how it's going to be in the annals of history: "non-notable." Goodbye forever, I guess.169.155.33.1 23:23, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Note: Is a post-count really an indication of the notoriety of a newsgroup? Trade groups and utility groups get hundreds of posts a day, but that doesn't mean they've made any historical changes or contributions to the Internet community. alt.tv.real-world, along with other groups (alt.fan.karl-malden.nose, alt.alien.vampire.flonk.flonk.flonk, etc.) changed the face of Usenet.

<li>I was using post-count to argue in your favor&#160;:) Feel free to provide some evidence of notability other than post count to convince others that the article should be kept. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_16.html" title="January 16">01-16</a>&#160;07:47<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></i></span></li>

Although article titles should be in the Latin alphabet, it's OK and harmless to have a redirect in a non-Latin alphabet, although not common (see <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28use_English%29_65c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)</a>). I'm closing this Afd, since it is for a Kirgiz-language article, and if desired any new Afd could be applied to the English-language article instead. Note, as a general rule, non-English articles don't go through Afd... either they get translated within a certain delay (after posting a "notenglish" notice) or they get speedied. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 05:14, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, with the above view point, is <a href="../../../p/l/u/PlusNet_d972.html" title="PlusNet">PlusNet</a> a "major corporation"&#160;? My interpretation of a "major corporation" are organisations like <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>. Zen is of a much smaller variety but has been trading for a over a decade which presents a core reason for it to be "encyclopedic" (Larkymarky 13:15, 16 January 2006 (UTC))

<li><b>Comment</b>, I would say that PlusNet is not a major corporation and would vote delete if it were nominated.

<p>What we have here seems to be a guy who shot a couple of videos which were shown at a few festivals. No distribution and no reported box office gross. "Expiration" was released on DVD, but as far as I can tell Hefferman released it himself, making it the equivalent of a vanity press book. Doesn't seem to be at amazon anyway. I'd call this article vanity or self promotion, but if Hefferman wrote it I'd expect he'd have more to say than this. Anyway, <b>delete</b> this as another guy with a video camera trying to get a start in the film industry.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I seem to disagree on the definition of "large". According to the festival's website, it lasts four days (in 2005, from April 7 to 10); only 10 feature films are involved - this year, Ivan Reitman's "Meatballs" will be shown, evidently hours-concours; it has no tradition either: the first edition took place last year, when the winner was Hefferman. I'm sorry, but IMHO more than this award is required to make someone notable. <a href="../../../v/m/v/User%7EVmv_bc84.html" title="User:Vmv"><font color="#0000C0">Vlad</font><font color="#989ACC">M</font><font color="#0000C0">V</font></a> <font color="#6F078D">٭</font> <sup><a href="../../../v/m/v/User_talk%7EVmv_5a55.html" title="User talk:Vmv"><font color="#0000C0">talk</font></a></sup> 18:51, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I was wondering, in general should not self-financed undistributed movies be treated much the same as vanity published books? I don't see a huge difference, except perhaps that a movie made along these lines is more likely to be purchased by a distributor than a self-published book is likely to be purchased by a publisher. Given that I'm not sure that's true, and that until such a movie <i>is</i> purchased the matter in inconsequential, I'm tempted to think movies like this, and the people who make them need to be held to some standard beyond some award at a small festival. Even the winners at Sundance and the like are basically significant only because the award guarantees them a commercial release. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:18, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not really. While the commercial aspect of cinema clearly is quite important, you'll find that there's a vast amount of interest in the art in general. For instance, google the indy in question, Gavin Heffernan, and you'll find quite a lot of hits, with many reviews of his commercially undistributed movies. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel11_f217.html" title="User:Daniel11">Daniel11</a> 00:29, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>These are short stubs on non-notable characters in the game <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zork.html" title="Zork">Zork</a>. There is already a parent page, <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kings_of_Quendor_1c1a.html" title="Kings of Quendor">Kings of Quendor</a> which already contains nearly all of this information. I cannot imagine a need for an article for each of these characters nor any of the articles becoming more than a stub.</p>
<p>The reason I don't just merge it all to the existing parent page is that I see no need to have these redirects. I suggest that any non-duplicate information is <b>merged</b> across to <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kings_of_Quendor_1c1a.html" title="Kings of Quendor">Kings of Quendor</a> then <s><b>delete all</b> of these articles. --<a href="../../../q/i/r/User%7EQirex_bef6.html" title="User:Qirex">Qirex</a> 04:40, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</s> <b>delete most</b> of these articles, but <b>keep</b> <a href="../../../d/u/n/Duncanthrax_the_Bellicose_7d84.html" title="Duncanthrax the Bellicose">Duncanthrax the Bellicose</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimwit_Flathead_b7c6.html" title="Dimwit Flathead">Dimwit Flathead</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mir_Yannick_5fcc.html" title="Mir Yannick">Mir Yannick</a>, and <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucy_Flathead_38f4.html" title="Lucy Flathead">Lucy Flathead</a>. --<a href="../../../q/i/r/User%7EQirex_bef6.html" title="User:Qirex">Qirex</a> 09:30, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Keep</b>: Please give me some time to finish these. There is ample information on these characters in the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_Frobozzica_c74a.html" title="Encyclopedia Frobozzica">Encyclopedia Frobozzica</a> and scattered throughout all the games in the series. There is an article for every single <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kings_of_Gondor_20df.html" title="Kings of Gondor">King of Gondor</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kings_of_Numenor_0e59.html" title="Kings of Numenor">King of Numenor</a> etc. from <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_Rings_293e.html" title="Lord of the Rings">Lord of the Rings</a>, even through virtually none of these characters are involved in the plot and are only referenced in the appendices. I feel that this is an analogous situation. Wikipedia is not paper after all. Merging the content will very quickly create a prohibitively long and unusable article. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 04:53, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</s>

<dd>Zork isn't quite comparable to Lord of the Rings, but anyway, I would support the deletion of those articles too; none of this belongs in an encyclopedia. Yes, there is a lot in here that doesn't belong, but that is not a justification for adding more stuff that doesn't belong. --<a href="../../../q/i/r/User%7EQirex_bef6.html" title="User:Qirex">Qirex</a> 05:04, 16 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><s>They are extremely comparable in that they both have cult followings of fans. My point wasn't that we should delete those articles too but the fact that none of them have even been nominated for deletion in the hundreds of editors who have undoubtedly seen them implies that there is some kind of consensus for having articles about things that are in fictional universes especially when the fan base is so large as it is for Zork and Lord of the Rings.<a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 05:10, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</s></dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> - Originator should merge these into a single article and turn the rest of these into redirects. Wikipedia really doesn't need this <i>very</i> specialized knowledge spread out amongst so many different articles. <b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <a href="../../../t/w/o/Wikipedia%7ETwo-millionth_topic_pool_6995.html" title="Wikipedia:Two-millionth topic pool"><font style="background: #000000" face="Impact" color="#00A5FF">2M-VOTE</font></a> 05:22, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Merge</b></s> its usual to merge fictional stubs, many of the Lord of the Rings king articles include some information on the king rather than just stating when/who they were -- <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrokey44_a15f.html" title="User:Astrokey44">Astrokey44</a><small>|<a href="../../../a/s/t/User_talk%7EAstrokey44_2cf4.html" title="User talk:Astrokey44">talk</a></small> 05:55, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Having slept on it I decided that the mergists are probably right. I've already taking the liberty of merging most of these articles. However, I suggest that the following four articles be kept: <a href="../../../d/u/n/Duncanthrax_the_Bellicose_7d84.html" title="Duncanthrax the Bellicose">Duncanthrax the Bellicose</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimwit_Flathead_b7c6.html" title="Dimwit Flathead">Dimwit Flathead</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mir_Yannick_5fcc.html" title="Mir Yannick">Mir Yannick</a>, and <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucy_Flathead_38f4.html" title="Lucy Flathead">Lucy Flathead</a>. The first two are described in detail in a varity of literature related two Zorks 1-3 and Zork Zero and the second two are the main characters of Zork Grand Inquisitor. Thus, all four of them have signficance to the Zork Universe far beyond just being a King of Quendor. Those four articles could easily be extended to a lenght that I believe most people would feel warrants an article. Is this solution amenable to anyone as a compromise? <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 21:27, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Do not Delete</b> There is a typo. The game was created January 1, 2004. At LEAST 5000 people know about this game. The game was learned about and spread through a local school card tournament. The game was played through a series of eliminations. 300 people took part in the game with at least 1000 surveyours, and even more people who knw the game and rules. This should be notable enough to not be deleted. I can include the history of the game once it is off the deletion list.Tifroc

<li><b>Comment:</b> I've just supplied screenshots of almost 9,000 people on the site at once, and of the iTunes 'Top 100' podcasts, showing GamersDaily ahead of Ziff-Davis's "1Up.com" show and Kevin Rose's "Systm" show. The only gaming-related shows ahead of GamersDaily are "G4/TechTV Videocast" and the "PC Gamer Official Podcast," both of which are run by multi-million-dollar corporations. That is quite an accomplishment -- I don't see how this can be considered podcruft.

<p>Hi there,<br />
The word "Haketsi" is not Georgian, I never even heared that Georgia is called so... You can ask Armenians about thi term, they might provide more information about it.<br />

<dd>I am researching an English-language article for the free on-line</dd>
<dd>encyclopedia en.wikipedia.org</dd>
<dd>The article says that "Haketsi" was the Armenian name of Georgia in ancient</dd>
<dd>times (before 800).</dd>
<dd>Can you confirm whether that is true or false?</dd>
<dd>Thanks!</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> A search of google reveals only hits that are from pages which pull from wikipedia. In other words, I'm voting for deletion based on it being unverifiable, and most likely a hoax. (If it were true, you think <i>someone</i> would have mentioned it). Great job on the part of the nominator. --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBachrach44_302c.html" title="User:Bachrach44">Bachrach44</a> 03:08, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Reason why the page should be kept Keep!!!!! this is no trivial matter people!!!!!!!!!!!!1</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>It's documentation of an Internet Meme of late 2005/ early 2006. Deleting the page won't make that fact go away. (<i>This anonymous comment added from IP address</i>) -- 70.24.118.158</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>I see no reason to delete this. It's 100% credible and indeed documents a real, if not terribly widely known, Internet phenomenon. It's perhaps the first interesting issue raised from public personal photography sites such as webshots, and I could easily see this phenomenon repeating itself. If it does, Wenk will be counted among the first to generate unintentional popularity in this way (<i>by user 24.211.155.113</i>).</li>

<li>OK, Technobangman is somewhat different from what was deleted but recognisably the same organisation. There were not many votes on its AfD though. Liam burbridge was speedied. So it is reasonable to complete this process in respect of Burbridge, and at least defensible to leave Technobangman for now.

The user concerned repeatedly vandalised the AfD page, made personal and general attacks against the voters and used multiple accounts so as to deter detection of their vandalism.

<p>Dont you think nuking us over a website would be a bit silly. Did'nt you learn anything from Hiroshima. Anyway you need a war decleration and in most cases, a nuclear attack would waarant an approval from the UN. And you'd probably just end up affecting yourself. Gaylord. Think before you nuke, thats what i always say. And btw, Liam CB is not skillman100, I am skillman 100. Why is it not plausible that he can have a friend with the same sense of humour? As for attacks on individuals, id like to make it clear that we never made the first move.

<p>i think that you should maybe get out more. btw the facists were not you, the facists were very strong men oppressing people of ethnic origin. and i overcame them single handedly. do not sully my triumph! i am a reformed man and, as i said to robert mugabe when i looked him straight in the eye, IGNORANCE LEADS TO FEAR, FEAR LEADS TO ANGER, ANGER LEADS TO HATE, HATE LEADS TO SUFFERING. if this has the same effect on you than it did on bobby m you will be crying in shame now. to clarify, i am not a sad person who sits alone on the internet creating people and masturbating over bestiality. i am an ARTIST. thank you,<br />

Well, well, well, how arrogant, since our article on reggaeton specifically declares the origin of reggaeton to be uncertain ("The birthplace of the music genre is a subject of debate between those who believe it was started in Panama and those who believe it originated in Puerto Rico").

<li>I agree. However, Playero is indeed one of the biggest pioneers in the reggaeton genre in Puerto Rico, back in the 90s.

<dd>What's the criteria to determine who's notable and who isn't? Obviously, Playero is not an international artist, but you can ask anyone in Puerto Rico (and perhaps even Latin America) who's one of the pioneers of reggaeton and lots will tell you "Playero". Most of his recordings were underground tapes that weren't sold on stores because the genre wasn't mainstream yet. That's why they even called it "underground rap". And, like I said in the article, lots of today's artists (even <a href="../../../d/a/d/Daddy_Yankee_b6fa.html" title="Daddy Yankee">Daddy Yankee</a>) started their careers with Playero. Truth is that Playero is (along with <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vico_C_35b1.html" title="Vico C">Vico C</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_General_16af.html" title="El General">El General</a>, and others) one of the first to bring reggaeton music to the surface.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't know how odd or jokey this article seems to you. AFAIK Animal Friendship is an emotion and represents a significant category of people. There are societies ands clubs for animal friends. How is the thing that <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigitte_Bardot_ae2c.html" title="Brigitte Bardot">Brigitte Bardot</a> and so many other people advocate, but not necessarily activistic? Shouldn't be an article for it? I don't know about other countries, but my country there is a special word for it (zoophilia). I was surprised that there was no mention to this in wikipedia, except some vague articles about animal rights and <a href="../../../z/o/o/Zoophilia.html" title="Zoophilia">zoophilia</a> as a pervertion... and now it's considered a candidate for deletion.

<li>I'm new here so just quick question, is it true that concerns about verification are addressed in the talk page? I'm involved in another request for delete and I keep hearing "verification" as an excuse for delete. I'm just strugging to see if there is any common application of the rules here. I'm guessing there isn't but is that "just the way it operates". I'm also involved in another delete where the nominator (and admin) has come out and said he'll ignore consensus and delete an entry if it isn't cleaned up by the end of the vote. It seems to me the delete process is highly political. true&#160;??? --<a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinar_66e3.html" title="User:Ginar">Ginar</a> 20:40, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Yet the article is not on the Daily Illini, which has an article <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Illini_58ea.html" title="Daily Illini">(click here)</a> and deserves more attention. The article is about an author and musician who receives 484 hits for diverse activities, many of them the hoax but also on her theories regarding the fashion industry and her music preformance. This is a lot of hits. She also won a journalism prize. It proves that students can get noted.

<li>I'm from the US as well. I checked out the Canada article and there turns out to be a whole panoply of articles for over a hundred years. Is this true for any other country? I stand by my statement that Wikipedia should not isolate these chronologies by country since, no matter what the country, there is almost always going to be some influence to or from another country. Also, each of the dates, e.g., <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, has its own universal chronology. The Canada articles disturb me, however. I would be extremely reluctant to AfD all of them since so much effort has clearly gone into their production. By the same token, I think someone should have AfDed the first Canada article when it appeared. My suggested resolution at this point would be to leave the Canada articles alone, but not let any others be developed and get similarly out of hand. I realize this is a half-assed resolution, but it is the most equitable I can think of. <a href="../../../j/t/m/User%7EJtmichcock_d337.html" title="User:Jtmichcock">Jtmichcock</a> 13:21, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> both - When Wikipedia comes close to its goal of "containing all human knowledge", year articles will need to be subdivided quite finely. Scope is the determinant of relevance; the election of a mayor is significant locally but not state-wide; state assembly action has no national meaning but is important locally; U.S. internal goings-on frequently have no impact beyond its borders. We already acknowledge that many types of information belong in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_sports.html" title="2005 in sports">2005 in sports</a> (or whatever category) but not <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, but some events transcend to a higher importance and should be listed on the main year article.

It's and interview process; is it just becuase it's Microsoft that it gets its own page? People should be fairly familiar with the interview process.

<li><b>Delete</b>, and if it's substantially the same as the last one, <b>speedy delete</b>. I'm not sure it is - of course I can't see the original, but one of the sentences was quoted in the AfD - I searched the article for part of it ('development manager') and found nothing, so it's probably not completely identical. Its only purpose is still basically as a how-to, which violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 17:28, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There are numerous new users who's pages are delted. Some are even wrost than AfD, and in this case, I mean Speedy. This article seems to blatantly advertise Microsoft's interview, and Wikipedia is <b>not</b> a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">how-to</a>. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilo-Lima_bc04.html" title="User:Kilo-Lima"><sup>KILO</sup>-<sub>LIMA</sub></a> 20:06, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> I think my article should at least be merged with the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> entry. Microsoft was one of the first, if not the first company to develop this unique style of interviewing. Since other companies like <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> and <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahoo.html" title="Yahoo">Yahoo</a> also use this type of interview, it is becoming more commonplace, so I can see why people might want to merge my article with Microsoft. I did spend a good deal of time crafting the article and you can find that the content is factual and well-written. I only decided to write this page after reading the Microsoft entry and seeing that "Microsoft Interview" was not linked to a Wiki page. I think that those who are more familiar with the more traditional behavioral interviews will learn something about how technical interviews are conducted. -- Suvablee0506 18:21, 16 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can't see what makes the interview process unusual, personally. The procedure and the questions all seem pretty standard. This may be because, if the article does have a purpose, it's hidden in all the stuff that frankly, doesn't belong in an encyclopaedia entry. We don't need to know, for example, Microsoft's current job postings, or that they pay for your accomodation, or their <i>expense claims procedure</i> (which is, btw, identical to every other expense claims procedure). Or rather, we would if we were applying for a job at Microsoft, but no-one who isn't could possibly find that information interesting; that means it's not suitable for an encyclopaedia. If it's a unique style of interviewing, then tell us about it and remove all the other stuff, because I honestly can't see it in this article. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 18:37, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I do see your point. Perhaps I can incorporate some of what I have written in "The Second Round Technical Interview" and and "Interview Questions" into the "Business culture" section of the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> entry and delete the separate entry for "Microsoft Interview"? - Suvablee0506 18:45, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Me too. Perhaps merging would be better. But no large amount of detail should be added. It is only a process as to whether someone should ge a job at Microsoft, or not. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilo-Lima_bc04.html" title="User:Kilo-Lima"><sup>KILO</sup>-<sub>LIMA</sub></a> 18:50, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. There is neither anything notable nor encyclopedic about this entry.Microsoft's interview process is not particularly different than the interview process for other similar companies. I think it borders on advertising, to be honest. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 18:53, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Back in the 80s and 90s, the Microsoft interview procedure was influential and innovative. I don't diasagree that the article needs to be cleaned-up, though. The talk page suggests there was a far more interesting version previously available, but I don't see it in the history. Can it be resurrected? -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 19:05, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd><b>Comment.</b> If that's true, then I think the article can be rewritten with that fact as its focus, and less detail on all the steps of the interview process, many of which are common to every job interview in every field, dating long before the 1980s. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 00:32, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It was no intention of mine at all to create an entry that would cause controversy. I was just reading the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> entry and found the wiki-link to "Microsoft Interview" with an unwritten article. I was totally unaware that it had been deleted before. I understand everyone's concern about the entry. Perhaps an addition to the <a href="../../../j/o/b/Job_interview.html" title="Job interview">Job interview</a> entry could include a description of a technical interview using the Microsoft interview process as an example. Obviously, only parts of the current article would be used. I myself am leaning towards deleting the "Microsoft Interview" entry and merging parts of it with possibly <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/b/Job_interview.html" title="Job interview">Job interview</a> because that type of interview is becoming more commonplace. I am however against deleting it outright before at least some of it is used somewhere because I did do genuine research and put forth an honest effort. Any thoughts? - Suvablee0506 23:27, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Don't worry too much about the controversy, honestly. We try to assume good faith and I'm sure there's a way we can use some of your material.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Unencyclopedic, the pracice will surely change over years. As an anectode: I know about one guy who got hired by Microsoft (as a tester) w/o any interview at all (a student who finished university, not someone with big name). He was recommended by a friend (who even didn;'t worked in MS) and got in without being asked <i>anything</i> at all. So the article isn't even correctly describing reality. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 22:05, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Would everyone be okay with just using some part of the entry and merging it with <a href="../../../j/o/b/Job_interview.html" title="Job interview">Job interview</a> to describe a technical interview using Microsoft as just one example? The <a href="../../../j/o/b/Job_interview.html" title="Job interview">Job interview</a> entry has a section on behavioral interviews but not technical interviews. Again, I am not against deleting the entry but not before some of it is used somewhere.- Suvablee0506 17:26, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> As has been noted above, the subject of the article is particularly noteworthy because of its originality and subsequent effect on many companies, especially in the 80's and 90's. However, the article itself is not spectacular. It should be condensed, refocused, and placed either on the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> page or the <a href="../../../j/o/b/Job_interview.html" title="Job interview">Job interview</a> page, the other with a note and a link. <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERexmorgan_3f09.html" title="User:Rexmorgan">Rexmorgan</a> 03:16, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Adam Hauner is very active on Czech Wiki (hence the few supporting votes above - such AfD also runs on Czech Wiki) and sometimes helps on English Wiki (thanks). While he may be known by fellow designers in Czech Republic (who form most of Czech Wikipedia crew) there's no indication he is also known outside this relatively small and quite fluid circle.

<li>I'm fairly certain that, when we want to engage in an evaluation of notability, we can't deal in "probably." Apparently Wikipedia does have standards. Do you have evidence that "between the book and the ministry" McGowan is "known well beyond his own congregation?" What is "known well?" Is it enough to merit an encyclopedia article and, if so, why?

<p>Comment: I have added more citations with more to come. I do think Canters made a significant contribution to philosophy - I intend to give a summary of her thinking. Her work has just been published so it will take some time for there to be critical reviews of her ideas - so perhaps give the entry some time. It is an interesting question as to how many books make a person notable - and surely there is a very subjective element in the judgement of who is notable and who is not - and how this is measured. Certainly, Canters made a verifable contribution to human knowledge whatever on thinks of the subject matter itself. Also the book was co written with Grace Jantzen who herself has clearly made advances in the feminist philosophy of religion and contributions to developing the work of French feminist thought in the English speaking world.

<li><b>Delete</b> The article needs to be completely re-written. It is not accurate at any point. It is <i><b>not</b></i> a Reformed doctrine, as distinct from others - on the contrary, it is <i>terminology</i> that is used by certain deviant forms of Calvinism to describe their opponents. It is not hyper-calvinism; on the contrary, it is held by just about anybody who isn't a hyper-calvinist - and denial of it is a mark of a form of hyper-calvinism. Furthermore, this is quirky language that has limited use in reference to a particular controversy. — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> 22:14, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>With such a high profile for spam this page will stay cleaner than much of the Wiki IMHO. Take the lack of a V7N link as a for-instance.

<li><b>Keep</b> I wholly disagree that the subject of this article is "not encyclopedic". The definition of encyclopedia decribes it as a "compendium of knowledge, either general (attempting to cover all fields)or specialized (aiming to be comprehensive in a particular field)". The goal of Wikipedia is surely the former is it not? If this is the case then inclusion of an article that is highly significant to the "field" of Search Engine Optimization (as well as historically significant) must be considered valid, noteable, and most of all, encyclopedic.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't Wiki. But I will say hold off on a decision. As it appears right now the V7ndotcom_Elursrebme contest is not just a major event in the SEO world, but in internationaally, in blogging circles and perhaps in 'net itself. As it stands today, the contest is in its 4th day and already bigger than the nigritude ultramarine contest of 2004. It has produced newsworthy oddities, as noted by <a href="http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/060116-162523" class="external text" title="http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/060116-162523" rel="nofollow">Danny Sullivan</a> and others.

<p>Not notable enough for an encyclopedia, even though Oscar Wilde stayed there. Arniep 20:18, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>As far as I can tell, the hotel <i>may</i> well be notable, and I think it is wrong to assert otherwise without good arguments. A hotel of that age in a city like Paris is quite likely, for instance, to figure in film or literature. But the article doesn't <i>explain</i> any notability the hotel may have, beyond the fact that <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> lived there his last days (it actually seems that he even <i>died</i> at the hotel<a href="http://www.irishwriters-online.com/oscarwilde.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.irishwriters-online.com/oscarwilde.html" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>, but "lived his last days" probably works better in marketing). This is not a bad start, but the article doesn't currently say anything that isn't already in the article on Wilde. <s><b>Weak delete</b></s>. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 10:28, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<p><strike><b>Delete</b>.</strike> The so-called M96 motorway isn't a motorway at all - it's a non-noteworthy piece of tarmac that isn't open to the public and is only used for training simulations as part of the UK Fire Service College. The information in the article is largely taken from <a href="http://www.pathetic.org.uk/motorways/m96.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.pathetic.org.uk/motorways/m96.shtml" rel="nofollow">this article on psuedo-humourous UK roads site <i>Pathetic Motorways</i></a>. However, since it has this name, it keeps on appearing in motorway lists and is getting confused for a real, functioning motorway. A move to <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_Fire_Service_College_5b2f.html" title="UK Fire Service College">UK Fire Service College</a> could be an option, but that facility must consist of greatly more than just a road traffic accident simulator and this would make a poor article for that title. <a href="../../../e/r/a/User%7EErath_3567.html" title="User:Erath">Erath</a> 20:27, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>As I understand it, personal websites shouldn't be used as primary sources (see <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>), so even that might not do, unless there were some independent corroboration that this is a proposal that someone or some organisation, that is notable, has made. I'm hoping that this material really DOES have a verifiable source because it's neat/interesting, but <i>neatness</i> does not count. (take that, Mrs Schwartz, and other third grade teachers everywhere). It has to be both interesting and important. This applies whether the material is merged in or kept separate, IMHO. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 01:02, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

I will be done editing in a realtively short time. The previuous version drew rather too closely on some published accounts of Fr. John Corapi's life, was IMO rather PoV, and said more about his life before becommign a priest than about his preaching afterwards, which is what he is IMO notable for.

<li>Saying that he preaches is not notable, sayign that he has regular radio and television appearences, and that recordings of his work are widely sold is not. Far from every ordained priest or minister can verifiably say those things, I think. -DES 01:14, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>My argument is that he is considerably more notable than your comments imply. He seems to have in effect become somethign of a Catholic televangelist -- at any rate a very popular lecturere and speaker, in paerson, in recordings, and on both radio and television broadcasts, as well as a popular writer, at least within a certian Catholic niche. That is far more than simply saing that he "preaches". He has had at least some mainstream news coverage, and easily passes the google test. I wish that I had found an outside assesment/review of his work by soemone who did not sound so much like a partisan -- I suspect one is out there, but it wasn't in the first few pages of google hits. The article still needs work, but it is now much less PoV and IMO pretty clearly establishes at least basic notability. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:02, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>The point being that in an article on a preacher it is superfluous to say that he preaches, it kind of goes with the job and in context looks rather desperate, as if there is nothing more that can be said about him. - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_AfD_78f4.html" title="User:JzG/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 12:20, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>CHANGING "STRONG KEEP" TO REDIRECT. I am the author of the article.</b> I expanded the intro to show why this is useful and belongs on Wikipedia.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I created the article only shortly after first using Wikipedia. I have thought about it some more since putting the other comments below and it seems this information does belong in "List of state legislatures". I will be merging the information into that article. That will keep the information and put it in one place.</dd>
<dd><b><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickReinckens_8aaa.html" title="User:RickReinckens">RickReinckens</a> 05:23, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>Frankly, the reason I created the article is that I research the law of multiple states on a regular basis and I have links to a lot of the state legislatures on my computer. I get tired of having to search around every time I need to find a state's law. WestLaw costs us several hundred dollars per month and does not have a way to download entire chapters. FindLaw and all the other "sources" have the same problem.</p>
<p>After almost a <b>decade</b> of Internet research, I <i>accidentally</i> ran across the National Conference of State Legislatures, whose website has a Java application that pulls up legislature links (in far more detail). That is the <b>only</b> site I have ever found with a "central repository" of legislature links. (The "source" I listed is actually one of my websites. I added that page after creating the Wikipedia article in case somebody wanted to complain about "no sources identified".)</p>
<p>Obviously, none of the "delete" people do this type of multi-state statutory research or you would realize why the list is helpful to those of us who do.</p>
<p>I was going to just add an URL shortcut link on my computer and I decided, "You know, it will be only a little more work to put a list of the sites on Wikipedia, and then everyone can use them."</p>
<p>Yes, users <i>could</i> use WikiPedia's Category: U.S. Legislatures to go to the WikiPedia article for each legislature and then search for a link to the legislature.</p>
<ul>
<li>But, a lot of Wiki users don't know that much about how to use it. I didn't.</li>
<li>A lot of them won't get into it enough to figure that out. They just won't use it.</li>
<li>Navigating around Categories often is pretty confusing and annoying. I have several articles for which I have been trying to find categories and I keep winding up in the wrong places.</li>
<li>The Categories approach relies on 50 different authors maintaining the links on 50 different articles, with the link in a different location on each article.</li>
<li>Instead of one central location, the Categories approach requires jumping through several steps—for each legislature's website. Pretty annoying.</li>
<li>It's not like bandwidth isn't a problem with Wikipedia. With the List of Legislatures' Websites, the user pulls up one Wikipedia page and clicks on external links. With the Categories approach the user pulls up 51 articles and has to scour through each one to get to where he really wants to go.</li>
<li>Other than <b>my</b> webpage added after the Wiki article was created, there is no place on the Web that conveniently <b>lists</b> both the name of the state and the URL of the legislature. I didn't just put links, I deliberately put the URLs too. Again, for researchers, because they might want to print that information without having to do massive reformatting manually. If the article is deleted from Wikipedia, I have no real reason to keep it on <i>my</i> site. Which means the info won't be available <b>anywhere</b>. (Try the Java app at National Conference of State Legislatures to see what a pain it is compared to the list in the article.)</li>
<li>I deliberately broke up the article into sections with labels, to make it easier to find. Originally it was one large table but I found it more convenient for the user the other way--unlike the List of State Legislatures article.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another option is merging the List of Websites article into the List of Legislatures article. I am ambivalent about that one for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>People looking for "website" information probably won't care about any of the other information.</li>
<li>The "Legislatures" article is already pretty long.</li>
<li>Regarding adding an additional cell to each line of the table in the other article, the table is pretty wide already.</li>
<li>The articles really have significantly different goals and content. The Legislatures article is about <b>the legislatures</b>--their composition, location, etc. The Websites article is strictly a convenient way to get to the legislature and a list of URLs, for those who want to publish the information (e.g., in a list of Sources consulted.)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Not notable, only a link to a record label and their site, and a 'band of the week' article that doesn't qualify it for a page by itself. Tokakeke 01:35, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>, touring for bands like this consists of getting in a van, driving a bit, playing at some small clubs for small crowds, and losing money on the entire venture. Not anything like a nationwide tour that the guidelines indicate, and not <i>too</i> much above a guy with an acoustic guitar playing coffee houses in a variety of cities. Wait til they release a real album, then reconsider. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 03:57, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Meh. <b>Weak keep</b>. While I'm still not impressed with bands that tour with no albums released (they can't have any fans if no one has heard them; the people going to their shows are either going to see another band or are the sort of people who go to all such shows in their local scene), the fact they have at least one member who is just famous enough, and that solitary EP, I guess does it. Would be happier if they had at least one full album. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:51, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Their international tour covered most countries in Europe, every day of November 2005, with no breaks. It included at least 3 European Ladyfest events, and they played 2 shows some days. Partyline's frontwoman Allison Wolfe was one of the organisers of the first ever Ladyfest, and if that's not enough, she was there at the start of the Riot Grrl movement in 1991 with her first band Bratmobile. Fellow bandmembers Angela and Crystal are no coffee-house losers either. --Dublinkid 16:55, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
