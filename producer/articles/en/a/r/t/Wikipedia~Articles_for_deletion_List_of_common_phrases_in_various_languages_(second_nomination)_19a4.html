<p>Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wp%7Enot.html" title="Wp:not">not</a> a place for instruction manuals, nor user and travel guides.

In addition, the scope of the article is so large as to be virtually indiscriminate. The article is nearly 160kb long and there is nothing about its scope that would limit it from growing.

<dd>Thanks. Well, the only argument for keeping offered other than "gee it's already so long, it sure would be a shame..." or "I think it's neat" is that is has some value in the study of linguistics, which I consider a dubious claim at best, and I think it was well responded to. People need to realize that Wikipedia is not a repository for "interesting stuff" - how interesting something is is definitely not a criterion for inclusion.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This isn't an encyclopedia article, so it doesn't belong in Wikipedia. Transwikiing to Wikibooks or Wiktionary (or transferring to Wikitravel) would be feasible only if the information were verifiable. As it is, I've found some mistakes in languages I know, so who knows what other mistakes there might be?

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm new to Wikipedia, and not sure I understand all nuances; but similar sort of material might have been found in an old-fashion 'dead tree' encyclopaedia. The old encyclopedists were not against including articles you could learn from; and I think the phrases main function is to illustrate language similarities and differences. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoergenB_358a.html" title="User:JoergenB">JoergenB</a> 12:32, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The suggestion to group members of particular language families together in tables (thereby showing the similarities with greater ease) was made in October 2005 but no one was willing to make the appropriate changes. Showing phonological similarities between languages is best done with individual words and showing syntactic or morphological similarities is best with phrases that aren't necessarily "common." The scope of hypothetical nameless "old-fashioned" encyclopaedias is not really relevant unless one wishes to change Wikipedia's consensus-forged policies.<a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">AEuSoes1</a> 02:03, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that organising by 'language groups' is superior for displaying the similarities and differences. (There is some controversy about grouping, and indeed about the whole classical tree model for language relations; but (naively??) I don't expect much controversy in this case.) I am quite willing to undertake a reorganisation along these lines myself. However, I fear I do not understand all of your policies (even if I've read some recommended guidelines and have browsed some talk sides and histories, trying to understand 'what really goes on'). Is it OK and normal to do a drastic re-organisation of a page, while a discussion on its deletion goes on? Will this influence the voting process in some way? I'm not so happy about the idea of doing the work to-day and finding out that it's all been deleted to-morrow, without letting people viewing the result and possibly reconsidering their votes.</dd>
<dd>I also would like to know if there is some simple way to make a manual index of a page (apart from the automatic one). If I reorganise by language branch, I think it would be useful to complement this with an alphabetic index. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoergenB_358a.html" title="User:JoergenB">JoergenB</a> 12:41, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I recommend that you wait until the discussion is closed. If it's deleted then create something like comparitive syntax of language family members or something like that. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">AEuSoes1</a> 23:30, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>"Enforcement", in a word, is what's gone wonky with AfD these days. It seems that at least some editors are prepared to discount "keeps" because they are not stated in terms of rules lawyering. Observing that a page is useful and informative, or that it has been here from very early in the project and has thousands of edits from many different hands, is for some reason <i>not good enough</i>. If the "rules" lead to this page being deleted, there's something wrong with the rules. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 12:00, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Inclusion in Wikipedia is not per se a mark of quality (or most fancruft would've been deleted and hopefully forgotten by now) and neither is it an insult to the contributors that the content they have amassed over the years is moved where it actually belongs. All wikiprojects have their own role as reliable sources of information, and I think you should reconsider your view of them as mere scrapyards where content not accepted in Wikipedia is sent to wither and die of neglect. / <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Isotalo_5ad2.html" title="User:Peter Isotalo">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/e/t/User_talk%7EPeter_Isotalo_e370.html" title="User talk:Peter Isotalo">Isotalo</a></sup> 14:54, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>While I don't agree with Peter's discounting of votes, I do find this discussion to be a largely one-sided one intellectually. None of the keep votes have been followed by any serious rebuttal to the claims in the nomination.

<dd>I hate to cite vacuous clichés here, but "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_map_is_not_the_territory.html" title="The map is not the territory">the map is not the territory</a>." Every word of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> has value <i><b>only</b></i> to the extent that it is an attempt to synthesize prior consensus; it is not a law to set boundaries to consensus. This page has been around in one form or another since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_common_phrases_in_various_languages&amp;oldid=243827" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_common_phrases_in_various_languages&amp;oldid=243827" rel="nofollow">Dec. 24, 2001</a>. It is valuable and useful, and frankly the obliteration of its history for average users would shock my conscience. To expect arguments founded upon policy rather than the opinions of users as to what belongs here makes policy a <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_calf.html" title="Golden calf">golden calf</a>. This debate is one-sided for only one reason: one side refuses to listen to arguments that aren't framed in their terms. As a debating ploy, this is a fairly good "I win" button, but it has nothing to do with consensus. This is what riles me: not that the page has been once again proposed for deletion, but rather that the rules have taken on such a <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankenstein.html" title="Frankenstein">Frankensteinian</a> life of their own that some people feel cowed to say that "while yes, the page is valuable, the rules say it should go; so it is written, so let it be done." Again, this suggests not that the page should be deleted, but that the rules have turned into something they never should have been allowed to become. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 05:20, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've given some of them. It isn't a "usage guide" or a "slang and idiom guide;" certainly not within the meaning of these phrases, which by my understanding were intended to exclude every new neologism that appears in <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rap_music.html" title="Rap music">rap music</a> to have an encyclopedia article, not this. It has an almost six year history of being at Wikipedia, with thousands of edits by more than a hundred editors. All of that vanishes if the last text is simply transwikied. I tend to think of it more as being in the tradition of a <i><a href="../../../m/i/t/Mithridates_VI_of_Pontus_8994.html" title="Mithridates VI of Pontus">Mithridates</a></i>, a classic reference book containing samples of many different languages. We could re-start it with other widely available texts in translation such the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord%27s_Prayer_8f51.html" title="Lord's Prayer">Lord's Prayer</a>, but that would raise POV issues and may occasion sectarian strife. The current selection of texts add usefulness to the samples. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 03:51, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This article does not look like a travel guide to me.

Being useful to travellers doesn't make something a travel guide in the spirit of the WP:NOT policy.

<dd>I agree that this list is not a tool for serious linguistic comparison, however it is wonderful for more informal comparisons. E.g. it's something of a revelation to monolingual English speakers that a language could have three ways to say "please." Examples are also really the only way to get a sense of how the language sounds.</dd>
<dd>As AdiJapan points out below, the introduction is a problem. However the rest of the content seems perfectly encyclopedic to me. Some articles on individual languages (e.g. <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek.html" title="Greek">Greek</a>) have a short list of phrases in the language, which is what this article mostly consists of. So perhaps there is a problem of <b>organization</b>, which can be resolved by splitting this article into smaller articles and linking them through an index page or category, but the <b>content</b> itself should be improved, not deleted.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia is not a dictionary. However, examples are of great educational value for the general reader. We're talking about a small number of examples per language, not a phrasebook. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayoquot_bbe3.html" title="User:Clayoquot">Kla'quot</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/l/a/User_talk%7EClayoquot_80b5.html" title="User talk:Clayoquot">Sound</a></sup>
<dl>
<dd>"Informal comparisons" sounds like trivia to me. Having language samples is never frowned upon, but if you want to get the feel for how a language sounds you should use excerpts from literature or lists of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minimal_pair.html" title="Minimal pair">minimal pairs</a> instead of tourist phrases. No recent language FAs have these kinds of lists because they're considered too trivial for serious encyclopedic articles. / <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Isotalo_5ad2.html" title="User:Peter Isotalo">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/e/t/User_talk%7EPeter_Isotalo_e370.html" title="User talk:Peter Isotalo">Isotalo</a></sup> 08:43, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, I see your point. Looking over these comments, I get the sense that this AfD debate tends to split along "serious linguistics" versus "populist" lines. Are 15-20 examples of phrases per language, along the lines of, "How do you do?", too trivial for inclusion? I would argue that the general reader does not think so. Wikipedia has room for both literary and popular examples. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayoquot_bbe3.html" title="User:Clayoquot">Kla'quot</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/l/a/User_talk%7EClayoquot_80b5.html" title="User talk:Clayoquot">Sound</a></sup> 16:33, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
