<dd>Comment: This is a hard call, so I'm exercisigin my judgement. Several said the entry to be kept only if changed to some titles. For instance current title (about "standard classes") has a HUGE <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">systemic bias</a>. The titles as "known by many" are way ambiguous, etc... There's also a majority of delete votes (almost twice as keeps) but I concur with several math fellows here that this list is not the proper approach. However there are some interesting ideas (an entry about NAMED formulas, etc.... and I want to chip one more: how about an entry about trig formulas, one about calc formulas, etc so you can put them in context and explain the relationships between them (as they relate to the same topic) so to avoid the list gathering for the sake of gathering (and then using a category to group those themed lists)?</dd>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I have no objection to a list of well-known articles. I could sort of enjoy a list with Euler's formula, de Moivre's formula, Pythagoras'. But a+b=c?

<li><b>Comment</b> Ewok Slayer has done some good work and the list is less trivial now. But it's still a grab-bag of things thrown together for no obvious reason.

<li><b>Delete</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b> The list might possibly make sense under a title like List of formulas taught in standard mathematics classes, and I suggest that this is possibly the original intent. A title like that would provide some sort of logical rationale for the choice of the results presented. The intro could specify that it's talking about classes presented in a standard sequence, meaning up to basic calculus.

<li><b>Delete</b>. We don't need yet another poorly written, unmaintainable, impossible list. It could be useful if it was split up by category, and referenced real articles. Editorial energies would be much better expended by improving the articles in <a href="../../../e/l/e/Category%7EElementary_mathematics_e910.html" title="Category:Elementary mathematics">Category:Elementary mathematics</a>, most of which cover the topics in this list.

<li><b>Weak keep.</b> I'm not sure this is encyclopedic, but it's at least handbookic. I have before me Pocket Ref, Thomas J. Glover, 1999, Sequoia and it's full of stuff like "Formulas for electricity: 1) Ohm's law, 2) Resistors in series, 3) Resistors in parallel," etc. CRC Standard Math Tables (does anyone still use those?) has its tables of derivatives, integrals, mensuration, etc. An argument for something like this is that if you know there is a formula but you don't know what it's called, you might not be able to find it by name, but you be able to find it in an article like this. On the other hand... well... it's listcruft. I agree with <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> that I suspect this of being the sort of thing you'd bring in as a "cheat sheet" for an examination that allows it... <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:16, 20 November 2005 (UTC) <b>But only if it is moved to List of well known mathematical formulae</b> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:17, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Abstain</b>. CRC Standard Math Tables are still used, as are other handbooks with mathematical formulas. The problem is that these are complete books, so we need to be extremely selective if we want to keep the list within a reasonable length for an article.

<dd>The difficulty is that it is not at all clear what belongs in this list, even with the new title. To me, it sounds too much like list of well known English phrases. You could include "the cat sat on the mat" and "<a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_in_our_time.html" title="Peace in our time">peace in our time</a>" and "these aren't the droids we're looking for" and "<a href="../../../i/_/t/I_think_therefore_I_am_b6fc.html" title="I think therefore I am">I think therefore I am</a>", but where do you stop?

<li><b>KEEP</b>. On the condition that its title is changed to something more specific, such as "formulas commonly known by many." With the current tile, it could be interpreted as: "okay, who are these forulas most well iknown to?" Now, I know it refers to those that are commonly known, but it needs to be specific. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Wookieepedian_b64c.html" title="User:The Wookieepedian">The Wookieepedian</a> 19:03, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> under any of the names so far proposed. (Is continually redirecting the article appropriate while it's under AfD?) Cannot be encyclopedic. Could be appropriate for wikibooks, if the title is established. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 22:45, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, I see no use or purpose. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredrik_8a6d.html" title="User:Fredrik">Fredrik</a> | <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFredrik_61e6.html" title="User talk:Fredrik">t</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fredrik_fb54.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fredrik">c</a> 06:01, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> as it is, the article lists rather lame formulas, not notable in their own right. I think an article which lists "named" formulas (like <a href="../../../e/u/l/Euler%27s_formula.html" title="Euler's formula">Euler's formula</a> and so on) might be a good idea, but this is just a collection of trivial school stuff. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 17:36, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Half-cooked, unencyclopedic, and not helpful. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 20:29, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the updated list. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 06:30, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. It seems this page was created for the purpose of listing high school algebra/trig formulae, calculus formulae, etc. I note that most of the supporters of this page seem to have this idea also. There may be nothing wrong with a page entitled "list of common trigonometric formulae" etc., but the current title (and all redirects so far) are misleading. I recommend deletion and that people interested in creating lists of trig formulae,etc., do so under an appropriate heading. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 22:36, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
