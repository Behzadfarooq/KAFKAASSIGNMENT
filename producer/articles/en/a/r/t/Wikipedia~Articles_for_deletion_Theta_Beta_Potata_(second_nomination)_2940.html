<li><b>Keep</b> as a potentially notable example of a punk house which is a subject, which, at this point, has <i>no established criteria for notability</i>. When a criteria is established for notability, then we can determine if this is a notable or non-notable article. However, in the meantime, lets KEEP the article and use it as a motivation to improve the <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_house.html" title="Punk house">punk house</a> article, come to an agreement on the criteria for punk house notability, and overall build more interest and discussion concerning all <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">punk rock</a> related articles. The main venue for these discussions could be <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Punk_music_8200.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Punk music">WikiProject Punk music</a>, which though a really good beginning, needs much more attention until it is on par with related WikiProjects such as <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_hip_hop_fbb3.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject hip hop">WikiProject hip hop</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>, "potentially notable" is not a valid keep criterion.

<li><b>Comment</b>Zoe, and others, by what criteria are you basing notability on? is there any chance that a punk house might require a different criteria for notability or have "we" at wikipedia already established criteria for all articles regardless of topic? <a href="../../../x/s/x/User%7EXsxex_c215.html" title="User:Xsxex">Xsxex</a> 23:12, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Move to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitravel.html" title="Wikitravel">Wikitravel</a></b> and <b>Delete</b>. While I found no established consensus or precedent specifically concerning articles about pseudo-fraternal, counter-culture music venue/flophouses (I looked in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html#Cities_and_shops" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents#Cities_and_shops</a>), this does not preclude us from coming to consensus and setting new precedent here. I believe the subject of the article is not notable enough because it is just a local music venue. Maybe some acts that eventually made it big came through the venue, but the same can be said of many other venues, like Okayz Corral in Madison, Wisconsin, which hosted such bands as <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana.html" title="Nirvana">Nirvana</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barenaked_Ladies_3f0b.html" title="Barenaked Ladies">Barenaked Ladies</a>. Are we going to have articles about all of these local venues just because some eventually famous bands once played there? True, some local venues like <a href="../../../c/b/g/CBGB_7cf7.html" title="CBGB">CBGB</a> have become legendary on a national scale, but I see no evidence of this for TBP. The first source in the article, a local publication, even refers to TBP as just a place for "mid-grade" acts. If even the local media regard the venue as being of "mid-grade" importance, why should Wikipedia regard it as important enough to merit its own article? I think it ought to be moved to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitravel.html" title="Wikitravel">Wikitravel</a> per <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html#Cities_and_shops" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">precedent regarding touristic information</a> <a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohirok_454f.html" title="User:Rohirok">Rohirok</a> 00:27, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

First, I'm somewhat amused by the armflapping triggered by the absence of notability standards. Notability, regardless of what class the subject falls into, is established by evidence that the subject has been noted. Despite the number of links in the article I'm not convinced that this place has. The Daily Iowan and Iowa State Daily links are passing mentions, others are just simply listings, and Newsbank does not provide anything either (two passing mentions). So absent a <i>portrait</i> of the place in a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> it should receive at best a passing mention in the <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_house.html" title="Punk house">punk house</a> article, which itself needs some serious sourcing. I like the idea about inclusion into Wikitravel though, as long as it meets their guidelines. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 03:44, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Please keep the debate open for a few more days. Also I am interested in this Wikitravel idea. What does it entail? Do they have a listing for <a href="../../../i/o/w/Iowa_City_c43d.html" title="Iowa City">Iowa City</a> already? Also since the venue is longer functioning, what would be the purpose of the article? <a href="../../../x/s/x/User%7EXsxex_c215.html" title="User:Xsxex">Xsxex</a> 06:42, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think the debate closes around Sept 2 or 3. There a listing for <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Iowa_City" class="external text" title="http://wikitravel.org/en/Iowa_City" rel="nofollow">Iowa City</a>, yes, but I missed the fact that the house doesn't exist anymore.

I have no ideas what notability would say about this, but notability isn't even Wikipedia policy. The fact that many of the bands who played there are notable enough to have their own pages points to the institute itself being notable. The fact that it has survived in multiple incarnations is also interesting. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonnyChance_46f0.html" title="User:JonnyChance">JonnyChance</a> 21:16, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Notability is an extension of <i><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an indiscriminate collection of information</i>, and is frequently used to decide AFD's.

<li><b>Neutral</b> - According to the article the building had notable guests. Now if this guests are indeed notable (Im clueless about punk) then I would be very much be leaning towards <i>keep</i>. Im suggesting this should be investigated. I do not believe that we should have a article on every building where something happens but this seems notable to me due to the fact that it appears the building was host to <i>notable</i> people. Also I would like to say if very little information is available about the building itself (which I would bet is true) then maybe this would be better off in a list since many lists host information when there is little available to make a fair length article on each list item. <a href="../../../t/u/t/User%7ETutmosis_35ea.html" title="User:Tutmosis"><small>- Tutmosis</small></a> 00:19, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
