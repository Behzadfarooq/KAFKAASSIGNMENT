<p>This article remains completely unverified. At the last AFD (which was "no consensus") some felt there hadn't been enough opportunity for verification. Some votes were conditioned on verifiability. All agree verification is required. So, hopefully there will be consensus this time. I am hoping we can keep the discussion to the topic of verifiability, as that's something everybody agrees is required (no point in a rehash of the usual school debate).

<li>Comment: It's probably not necessary, but I'll recap the history, and issues:
<ul>
<li>The article was created on September 3, 2005</li>
<li>The article was first AFD'd on January 3, 2006. This was also the first day is was tagged as "unverified", making some feel there was no proper attempt at verification. However, there's been ample time since then.</li>
<li>Only two sources exist to show the school exists: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/geniushomeschool/" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/geniushomeschool/" rel="nofollow">the school's own web site</a>, which is a free web host; and <a href="http://www.deshijobs.com/view_emp_job2.php?userid=6307&amp;PHPSESSID=8fdfafbbf150daa25500092f59b43fed" class="external text" title="http://www.deshijobs.com/view_emp_job2.php?userid=6307&amp;PHPSESSID=8fdfafbbf150daa25500092f59b43fed" rel="nofollow">a couple job adds like this</a>, on a site which anybody can make an add themselves.</li>
<li>The school's own web site gives contradictory info on what grades they teach. It's not clear if they teach up to grade or eight, or wish to do so.</li>
<li>The creator of the article has a user name, that's remarkably similiar to own of the school's owners names, suggesting self promotion.</li>
<li>The creator of the article was asked two weeks ago to provide verification, and has not responded.</li>
<li>Finally, there is not even a claim this school is licensed, and could be a fly-by-night operation. There's no truly independent verificaiton of existence. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 03:06, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't see how this can be considered unverifiable. The article states: "Genius Home Collegiate School is a website that claims to be for a school which opened in 2005 in the Mirpur-10 Senpara Parbota Area of Dhaka, Bangladesh.". If you go to the website linked, you can see for yourself that that is indeed exactly what it claims to be. Now, as to whether or not that claim is correct is open to question--however, the article does not make the claim that the website's claim is correct; it simply states that the website makes that claim. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 22:59, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The article isn't about a school; it's about a website that claims to be for a school. There's a difference. Please get your facts straight. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 23:05, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In which case, wouldn't this then fall under the realm of the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guidelines, which it would also appear to fail?. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> - The <a href="../../../z/o/i/Zoids.html" title="Zoids"><font color="blue">Zoids</font></a> Expansion Project 23:08, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Everything that exists is worthy of inclusion; everything for which verifiable information is present should have an article. It's clear that this website exists; it's also clear that verifiable information about the website is available (all you have to do is go to the website itself); therefore, it should have an article. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 23:23, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Would you then support putting all their claims about themselves back in, so long as it was still qualified with "They claim" (or to be more accurate, "someone claiming to be on the staff of this self-proclaimed school claims")? Because an article that does nothing but repeat the subject's claims about itself is called an 'advert'. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 23:35, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I certainly would, and your last sentence is incorrect. It is only an advertisement if it is done with the purpose of promoting the subject--the key thing here being "purpose". <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 00:19, 18 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No doubt they're <i>accidentally</i> promoting themselves. So we have an article, which once we've pared away the non-verifiable, simply repeats what's on a webpage -- meaning that the article is a webpage repeating another webpage. Congratulations, you've once again mistaken the map for the territory:
<ul>
<li><i>In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography</i> - "On Exactitude in Science" by <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jorge_Luis_Borges_2dc9.html" title="Jorge Luis Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a> --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 02:36, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't believe this falls under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> as they are claiming to be a school originally, someone modified it to the current wording.

<li>Comment: This is a school article, not a web site article. Let's keep in mind the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Genius_Home_Collegiate_School&amp;oldid=28396168" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Genius_Home_Collegiate_School&amp;oldid=28396168" rel="nofollow">original version</a>. Now, a couple editors (including me) removed as much unverifiable information as was possible. This wasn't done to save the article, but to avoid wantonly/knowingly spreading misinformation. I'm frankly a little PO'd that my good-faith attempt to avoid lies being spread, has been twisted into attempts to keep this article. This was actually used to justify the last "no consensus (keep)" result. Editors should be able to remove unverified claims, without it causing bogus articles to be kept. Core policy of Wikipedia demands this article be deleted. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 01:06, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comments</b>. With due respect to all who have taken great pain to read the page or visited the school site and put their comments to keep or delete. I'll not put any request. However, I'd like to add that whatever was written in the school page was true - no less, no more. It's true that the school is not famous or very old. However, the school committee is trying to develop it as a low cost sustainable model for better education to the local cummunity. The school is not set to make big money. Besides academic activities, the school have successfully arranged several rounds of polio imunization and health check-ups for students and all the members of their families (all free of charge) and several fairs in its second year. This has been appreciated by all the people living in the community. In recognition to this, this school was placed in record by Prothom Alo, the most popular daily in Bangladesh, as one of the mentinable institutes of Mirpur, Dhaka (please see Prothom Alo <a href="http://www.prothom-alo.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.prothom-alo.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, in Noksha, 25 July 2006). I'm really sorry if I have done a big upset to wikipedia. I'd rather suggest other renowned schools of Bangladesh to come forward and put information about their institutions. 09:07, 04 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
