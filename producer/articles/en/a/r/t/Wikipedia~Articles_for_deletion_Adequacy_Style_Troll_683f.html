<li><b>Keep</b>. Resisting the urge to say "It's a <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kuro5hin.html" title="Kuro5hin">Kuro5hin</a> thing... you wouldn't understand." This is without a doubt <a href="../../../o/s/t/Image%7EOstans.jpg_140d.html" title="Image:Ostans.jpg">webforumcruft</a>, but it's all true and it's all verifiable.

While much of the article is only of interest to <a href="../../../r/m/s/Image%7ERms.jpg_d3f5.html" title="Image:Rms.jpg">K5/Slashdot/Adequacy weenies</a>, I think we could all benefit from a good study of the psychology of well-executed trolling. It is possible to hold a good-faith opinion on both sides of the deletionism/inclusionism debate. Certain items undoubtedly do not belong on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>. As Americans of faith, we should oppose attempts to infiltrate this encyclopedia with the witchcraft and homoeroticism of <a href="../../../p/o/t/Pottery.html" title="Pottery">Harry Potter</a>, for example. How do we objectively decide what to delete and what to keep? "Erring on the side of caution" dictates that we keep an article in the absence of a compelling argument for deletion (such as godlessness). With that heuristic in mind, I see no reason to delete the article in question. FYI, Localroger has also written an excellent treatise on post-singularity zombie rape <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/prime-intellect" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kuro5hin.org/prime-intellect" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<li>I realize you are an administrator and I show deference to that fact, but you may want to step back a bit from this.

<li>Actually, don't show deference to the fact that I am an admin (really!). If you feel I've been rude or obnoxious, say so. There is no excuse for any admin behaving badly... if I am having a bad day (whatever), then I should take a wikibreak and come back later. I realise I've been a bit short with people lately (dealing with too many controversial articles does that to you), and will most likely take a short wikibreak soon.

If an article covers a subject which has never been written about in published sources, or which has only been written about in sources of doubtful credibility, it is difficult to verify the information. To do so would require original research, and it has been agreed that Wikipedia is not a place to publish original research.

<li><b>Keep</b> Why on earth would you delete this article, unless it were to supress the concept? Dozens of folks worked hard on <a href="http://adequacy.org" class="external text" title="http://adequacy.org" rel="nofollow">Adequacy</a>, and thousands of users contributed to the site for several years! The AST is a very specific variant of the generalized concept of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">Internet troll</a> phenomenon. If this article actually sees deletion, I will know that wikipedia is shamefully biased through this process and doubly so for crowing about principled behavior as a selling point for contributions.

<li><b>Comment</b> If AST is a "very specific" variant, there has been no evidence shown of its specificity except to say that, as a trolling practice, it's more involved than just calling people faggots. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 13:29, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> with the Adequacy or Internet troll article. This needs massive cleanup; a lot of what it talks about is not specific at all and applies to any troll, then you've got portions that are how-tos and/or original research and would belong at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikibooks.html" title="Wikibooks">Wikibooks</a>.
