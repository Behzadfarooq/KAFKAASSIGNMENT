<p>Unnecessary article with almost no content. It is POV to single out Islam for this aspect of its dietary law when Judaism and other religious groups and cultures prohibit the consumption of pork as well. <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_dietary_laws.html" title="Islamic dietary laws">Islamic dietary laws</a> already exists, and even that is unnecessary considering the existence of the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halal.html" title="Halal">halal</a> articles. In general, I have noticed a tendency on Wikipedia to single out Islam for such things, even when they are not unique to Islam. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 11:38, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>There's also the fact that it simply isn't an article - just a couple of bits of gossip and lots of requests for people to write an article on the subject.

<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_restrictions_on_the_consumption_of_pork.html" title="Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork">Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork</a>; there tends to be a bit of attention paid in the United States to this particular facet of Islam -- read the links on the page -- and I was trying to give a voice to that, but as an article, I think this would be better developed in a large topic about dietary restrictions. --<a href="../../../c/r/t/User%7ECrtrue_53e0.html" title="User:Crtrue">User:Crtrue</a> 12:34, 23 March 2007 (EST)</li>

<dd>Uh-oh, this is bad. Turns out that the appropriate section in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_dietary_laws.html" title="Islamic dietary laws">Islamic dietary laws</a> simply directs us to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_restrictions_on_the_consumption_of_pork.html" title="Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork">Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork</a>, which in turn directs us here to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_and_pork.html" title="Islam and pork">Islam and pork</a>. I have to rescind my previous&#160;!vote and change it to a <b>merge</b>, as we can't have a redirect that references itself, and a simple delete would leave redlinks where information ought to be. Therefore I would propose merging any useful and verifiable information to the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_restrictions_on_the_consumption_of_pork.html" title="Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork">Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork</a> article, as the first references it. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:58, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
