So: what is special about <i>Canadian</i> CMS systems? Are they offered for sale only in Canada? Not as it turns out. Are they notable for being Canadian? No, they are redlinks, so they would appear nto to be notable at all. There are lots of lists of software products of various types, they are watched b y many and purged of spam all the time; this will not be on many watchlists. I think it's a problem.

<dd>Nat Krause, I'm reporting you to Wikipedia for the following "... undoing other people's edits without discussing them first. This is considered impolite and unproductive. If you continue, you may be <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blocked.html" title="Blocked">blocked</a> from editing Wikipedia under the three-revert rule, which states that nobody may <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revert.html" title="Revert">revert</a> an article to a previous version more than three times in 24 hours. (Note: this also means editing the page to reinsert an old edit. If the effect of your actions is to revert back, it qualifies as a revert. That is what you did when you outrightly deleted 20 kilobytes of page at Jonang-Kalachakra Controversy see History&#160;: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonang-Kalachakra_Controversy&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonang-Kalachakra_Controversy&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></dd>
<dd>A pattern of wrongful deleting and of incorrect assumptions so as to create problems somewhat akin to vandalism is appearing with your assertion here that Gyalpo and Jalpo were not found on Google which is blatlantly a lie in view of the plethora of that. Add in gto your previous deleting manner, I found it right to warn Wikipedia of your deeds. I'm also filing for undeletion of Jalpo as your charges are unfounded here. <a href="../../../g/e/i/User%7EGeir_Smith_99d9.html" title="User:Geir Smith">Geir Smith</a> 14:03, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No, article for keep. The Googling probably didn't work out right but I have references to Gyalpo-Jalpo all over the net. Just it's tough to see, because Gyalpo is also an ordinary name of persons like John or George in English. Here's one reference. I'll give more of such; and for good measure I'll also provide them on the page. It's not a hoax or other things that I've seen it here described as. I'm afraid I've not clearly understood what people read into the page. Corrected here with Google research. This is a case of msitaken identity. Jalpo is not at all what you suspect it of being&#160;: either inidentifiable, unverifiable or original research. None of that at all. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:kotyBgHyUrYJ:www.garchen.net/library/texts/smokeofferingr.phuntsog.pdf+%27Gyalpo+Sum%27+-+the+Three+King+Spirits&amp;hl=fr&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=12&amp;ie=UTF-8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:kotyBgHyUrYJ:www.garchen.net/library/texts/smokeofferingr.phuntsog.pdf+%27Gyalpo+Sum%27+-+the+Three+King+Spirits&amp;hl=fr&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=12&amp;ie=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="../../../g/e/i/User%7EGeir_Smith_99d9.html" title="User:Geir Smith">Geir Smith</a> 10:54, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No one in their sane mind can keep on claiming that these spirits don't exist in the Tibetan Tantric Buddhist pantheon. I'm surprised that no one found these references on Google but I'm giving them here so it doesn't matter. But at least the error can be fixed. But undeleting is imperative. Making errors is OK but on condition of fixing them and not leaving unverifable things on the net. The person (Nat Krause) who said Jalpo-Gyalpo is not on Google said this but it's unverifable because I found a lot of Gyalpo Jalpos on it. So, he stands corrected. So, sorry, it's a mistaken identity there for you but I've helped out with references. There *is* a gyalpo-Jalpo on Google all over it really, in fact. There are tons on Google so if needed, I'll just give some more. Thanks. <a href="../../../g/e/i/User%7EGeir_Smith_99d9.html" title="User:Geir Smith">Geir Smith</a> 11:29, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Original objections that Jalpo is not on Google have been rectified so undelete in order. Then objections that neither Gyalpo nor Jalpo were there either also corrected. So, again undelete is in order. The two original objections disowned now; so undelete for all later delete votes that were added in order. Jalpo is a fact on Google and an important part of Tibetan culture and religion. No contest on that one. False case. No merit. People who can't find it by Googling doesn't mean one can't Google it. I've Googled it, came up with 185 hits and posted about a dozen here now. What part of this don't people understand&#160;? How can someone honestly come and say there are no hits when they can just click the host of links I provided here like a takeaway meal&#160;? <a href="../../../g/e/i/User%7EGeir_Smith_99d9.html" title="User:Geir Smith">Geir Smith</a> 22:47, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the weak delete Aza Toth. The hoax claim is unfounded&#160;: the Gyalpo-Jalpo references are all over Internet and it's not a fiction nor a hoax. I think the page should have it's chance to get up some reference written on it concerning the nature of the Jalpo spirits in Tibetan culture. I didn't think of putting them there earlier, thinking the people reading it would all be Buddhists. But for the general public, the page needs just a few references to be written out...and needs a few days for that so weak delete is good if it can just have a few days to improve. Thus putting off a deleting agenda a few days to redo some references is good. Saying it's Original Research, I don't agree with, as I've put up other external links that support the phases of what I say on the page. While I do the new references gleaned from the links I've just given here newly (above), I'll look at the OR issue meanwhile. But the verifiability issue on Google has already been cleared up because evidence is to be found on search-engines. So, with these new links coming on and improvement on the way, a weak delete is proper, if not to say "just a beginning" of getting the page undeleted. Thanks though for this. <a href="../../../g/e/i/User%7EGeir_Smith_99d9.html" title="User:Geir Smith">Geir Smith</a> 19:33, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Also, I think that the university references that abound in my references links are very good, on the contrary. <a href="../../../g/e/i/User%7EGeir_Smith_99d9.html" title="User:Geir Smith">Geir Smith</a> 11:09, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Remove Delete tag</b></s> on Jalpo page. The objections of the two first nominations for deletion by ZoFreX and Nat Krause have been lifted as I've found, produced, and posted about a dozen links to Gyalpo-Jalpos from the web (even if it is just on this deletion-page). Thank you for obliging... as no proof of their claims exist. Given ample proof the onus is on the prosecution to answer. No one is considered guilty until proven to be so. False accusations must be dealt with without weakness. Wikipedia policy. It is against Wikipedia policy to let false accusations stay on Wikipedia and this page is proof of the facts that are put forth for the record. No doubt is thus left in this matter. <a href="../../../g/e/i/User%7EGeir_Smith_99d9.html" title="User:Geir Smith">Geir Smith</a> 15:34, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>J. Smith, Hi, I've changed the self-referencing links</li>
</ul>
<p>on the page at Jalpo and the Wiki referencing links have been backed up by non-WIki ones. I think this adresses your concerns and also opens up for the pages being brought into WIki policy constraints. Please keep it's vote. Go from a weak delete to keep. I'll also include shortly, in the references, the "Pehar Gyalpo" reference that you provided above; and the people.freenet.de one (Gruschke) from Leiden University that I think are both perfectly acceptable. Given the three other references from Wiki and E-Sangha; the one from Sussex University; that of sacred-texts.com (one to two million hits a day) that are all perfectly acceptable as references (I think), that makes eight *grounded* and researched references. I've excluded other site-references although they are perfectly clearly appearing on Google, and that may also well be perfectly authentified sources for all that. We're thus looking at a total throve of at least ten to twelve potential references boiled down to a conservative selected number of eight of them. So, as I say, keep it, it's right. <a href="../../../g/e/i/User%7EGeir_Smith_99d9.html" title="User:Geir Smith">Geir Smith</a> 09:20, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Thousands and thousands of words, and I still don't know what it is. This stinks of hoax or OR. If it is not a hoax or OR, I would still support a delete, or removal of all material and reversion to substub since current content is incoherent after more than enough time. <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAKAF_4851.html" title="User:AKAF">AKAF</a> 17:20, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Wait</b> I'm working on widening and making easy the search for people verifying the information and trying to make Tibetan language terms easy to scroll down by explaining the names and word meanings involved. I think I've done a good job on some of the links I added to the page today because they're trustworthy reliable sources and easy to understand (or see).

<li>Someone to vote a <b>Keep</b> now&#160;? Time needed to streamline/outline article; so need some time to do that.

<li><b>Comment</b> Engadget gets one because it's in the top 1000 most visited websites according to Alexa. The article was started by common users of the website, not by the creators of the website. Usually a Wikipedia article is considered "important enough" if enough editors with no personal connections to the subject come together and decide to start an article about it. Frankly, it's not enough to have just the creator of a website say that their own website is important. Also, "protect" means that after an administrator deletes this article they can make it so that the article cannot be recreated by anyone other than another administrator. The reason this has been nominated to be protected is because it's been deleted multiple times before. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheKoG_0143.html" title="User:TheKoG">TheKoG</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheKoG_b161.html" title="User talk:TheKoG">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TheKoG_e45e.html" title="Special:Contributions/TheKoG">contribs</a>) 18:35, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>So, it's interesting. Notability is the criteria? Is Google notability the only criterion for a quality company? Sure. Delete.

<li><b>Super-Weak Keep</b> - Provides historical context, which explains why pay-per-view events are relevant. I think it needs to be reworked into an article about pay-per-view events for WWE, because it really isn't what the title describes, but I think that it's of encyclopedic value.

<li><b>Keep</b> WWE is a notable company, and its PPV schedule is something to note. Plus, it already has a brief discription of the history in there.

<li><b>Keep</b> The idea that it exists to promote WWE is absurd at face value because that would also imply every wrestler who works for WWE would have to have their profiles deleted too as that "promotes their business."

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The chronological order in which these pay-per-view events have been broadcast is extremely useful information; there are those who have spent time overseas and may not have had access to WWE pay-per-view events.

<dd><b>Weak keep</b> Although I've argued here largely that articles that are horribly deficient or otherwise unsalvagable should be deleted and, if on subjects that merit articles, added to <a href="../../../r/a/_/WP%7ERA_a7f5.html" title="WP:RA">WP:RA</a>, this article doesn't seem so poorly written as to be altogether without hope. On the subject of notability, a Google search takes one to the <a href="http://www.sfmutants.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.sfmutants.com/" rel="nofollow">the band's site</a>, where one learns that they have recently played with three bands for whom articles exist (most prominently, <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Kennedys_1621.html" title="Dead Kennedys">Dead Kennedys</a>). Other returns from the search lead me to think that they are notable, although surely the article does not establish notability at this time. Thus, I think perhaps the best course of action is to tag for sourcing and cleanup, although I would certainly revisit a "delete" vote in the future were the article not improved (such lack of improvement would, I think, demonstrate non-notability). If the same user has recreated the article in the same fashion as that which previously has been deleted, I would think it would be appropriate to suggest to the user on his/her user page that such recreations are disfavored where the resulting articles don't represent improvements over articles that have already failed to survive AfD. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:00, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think the article makes a decent case for minimal notability, and the "99.9% of notable bands already have articles" is spuriously self-proving -- it justifies rejecting any band. And it's pretty clearly wrong -- there was a writeup on lesser-known Grammy nominees in the NYTimes recently, and several of them didn't have articles, even though a Grammy nomination clearly establishes notability in the field. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 14:55, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

I was involved in the San Francisco punk scene in the early 1980s and remember The Mutants as a notable band, within a milieu that's now considered historically important. The statement by Delete voters that the band is "not yet important" is in error - the band is historically important, though less well-known today. The article itself needs work. -- <s>I do feel, however, that unless there's another notable band in another city called "The Mutants" that the name of this article should be "The Mutants (band)" rather than "The Mutants (San Francisco)".

<dd>I checked up on other bands using the name The Mutants. It turns out that there is a Detroit band called The Mutants, active in the same era as the SF Mutants. The Detroit Mutants have an album and a website and are somewhat notable. Anyway, to avoid confusion, the title "The Mutants (San Francisco)" should be kept. Some sort of disambiguation should be written into the beginning of the article stating that The Mutants from San Francisco are different from The Mutants from Detroit. -- <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 04:23, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The Mutuants were one of the most important punk rock bands of the late 70s and early 80s They were kind of a west coast B52s. They palyed along with the Nuns, Avenges, Dils, and many of the art punk bands of the early punk rock scene in Northern California. They are in the Louder Faster Shorter video and numerours articles had been written about them. Their influance has been felt by a generations of bands. —This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by User:69.226.108.63</li>

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> This definitely could be speedied as lacking any real content (perhaps we should have an article on Oreo stacking, inasmuch, IIRC, as the company does sponsor stacking competitions at various grocery stores, but surely this page isn't it).

<li>There are many things that I wish people would publish commentary on so that I could summarize that coverage on Wikipedia. But we don't get all our wishes, do we?

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>, but only under the condition of replacing with a list that actually has some relevance to the series in question. The current list is more of a random nitpicking of spells used in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charmed.html" title="Charmed">Charmed</a>. It would be useful to have a short article on the spells of Charmed <b>that have relevance to the show's plot</b> (ie. the spell that ignites the storyline, the truth spell that many times advances the plot, etc.). It is useless to just have a normal list. I am strongly against inserting this into the main Charmed article as we've spent a couple of months just trimming it down to the size it is now. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamDobay_1d3b.html" title="User:AdamDobay">AdamDobay</a> 20:02, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am the author of this article. This article is not a hoax. The last edit may have included a bit of frustration on my part with the comments left by the first critic. I can see by your comments that an article only has merit if it receives a certain minimum number of hits on Google. Very scholarly approach. The rest seem to be knee-jerk reactions to the posts of others. The same scholarly search conducted using "gang forward" would produce a significant number of hits. I am a Stirling. The proper usage has been passed down through my family for generations. We are multi-lingual and we are not confined to an understanding of the world limited to Americanized English.Tijuca 08:41, 22 March 2006 (UTC)]</li>

<dd>This is all true, and I do feel bad about judging this article so quickly in light of your comment. But even with all that it's just a stub about a phrase. Maybe you could recommend an article it could be merged to, such as some sort of list of sayings or phrases. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 09:02, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I am sorry, but you misunderstand my nomination. The article must not go because it does not receive a certain minimum number of hits on Google. It must go because it is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unsourced</a>. Being invisible on Google is just a quick-and-dirty indication for made-up stuff (of which Wikipedia unfortunately receives a lot). Consequently, as per Weregerbil <i>infra</i>, I would oppose a <i>merge</i> as well unless it is verified that "Gangfurd" indeed means "gang forward" and is the Scots version of the Stirling motto. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 18:16, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep Somewhere</b> I agree with the below <small>[above]</small> comment: "WTF makes something "notable" to YOUR standards?" One advantage of Wikipedia is the ability to contain many times more articles than other forms of encyclopediae. Each article could have a "non-notable" flag, and viewer's could set a preference to filter these out (which could be the default). There's still discrimination in this case, but it's just categorization &amp; not censorship. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.19.246.232 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.19.246.232.html" title="User talk:69.19.246.232">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.19.246.232_755e.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.19.246.232">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Perhaps there is merit in this proposal from an anon editor (although of course there are practical concerns), but surely this AfD is not the place at which to have the discussion.

<dd>While I make every attempt to include external links, the vast majority of contributions have almost no online references. I don't believe Wikipedia policy establishes notibility based on Google hits (which, in my own opinion, seems questionable particluarly when credible sources are included). However, I have added additional sources and clarified the subjects notibility. Although I do understand your consern, the vast majority of my contributions recieve minimal Google hits and it would certainly seem a shame to delete the countless articles I've compiled based on that fact. Unfortunatly, several of my articles have been nominated for deletion from time to time on the same grounds. I have proposed the <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadMax_Organized_crime_94ff.html" title="User:MadMax/Organized crime">WikiProject Organized crime</a> in an attempt for more knowlegable Wikipedians to determine the notibility of what is at times an otherwise disputed subject, although it hasn't had much support. If there is anyway I can more clearly establish his notibility I would certainly appreciate any suggestions. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadMax_566e.html" title="User:MadMax">MadMax</a> 21:56, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>question</b>:hi, dear editors, your comment about 'nn company' is absolutely true. my original thinking is to explain this term first created and used as a company name. i thought that wikipedia, as an encylopedia, will be interested in capturing any new term created and where it's used. that is the reason i've created the page. it is not my intention to create it as a company page. but since i'm a first time user, i'm not sure what is the policy regarding to the original intention i have. is it allowed to do this? if yes, do you have any suggestion about how to modify the page to make it to conform with your policy? if not, i appologized for this and i'll happily remove it immediately to conform with your policy. pls note that i'm not looking for debating on this but just seeking some guidelines and feedbacks. thanks for the help. best regards, --<a href="../../../s/o/f/User%7ESoftasking_2ad0.html" title="User:Softasking">Softasking</a> 15:48, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This appears to be a vanity article. The only edits to the article have been by a user Prestonmcafee of the same name as the article (except a recent bot AWB edit) during December 17-18. The initial edit even has the summary "a self-description". The content of the article reads like a resume or autobiography. The user has also only made edits to Wikipedia during those two days. I left a message on the user's talk page two months ago about this article and have not received any response.

<li><b>Keep</b>!! I am very familiar with McAfee's work... I read the article thoroughly and if anything it errs on the modest side. The PCS spectrum auction netted billions of dollars, etc., but none of this is mentioned in self-aggrandizement.

<li><b>Comment</b>, I reworded the article to emphasise that the drink was <i>reported</i> to have had popularity in the 1950s in the particular reference.

<li>I'm not sure that's necessary, and it strikes me as POV for the article to doubt its own sources!

<p>Wikipedia editors are not supposed to make the news. This term is a very non-notable neologism, and the contents of the article only a matter of speculation among Wikipedia users about an ongoing demonstration in Minsk following the March 19 <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belarusian_presidential_election%2C_2006.html" title="Belarusian presidential election, 2006">Belarusian presidential election</a>. As far as I can tell, the term traces its way back to an article by <i>Independent</i> reporter Andrew Osborn. <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article350098.ece" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article350098.ece" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> The speculation of a single reporter, and perhaps a handful of other commentators, however, does not make an encyclopedia topic.

<li><b>Keeep</b> I am sorry to comment that this time normally very knwoledgeable <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">user:172</a> is mistaken. The term is in use in Russian language since October 2005. It is not a "single reporter". I added russian language names. Unfortunately I have no time to do proper research and write a decent text. However please let me note that the very fact that Belarus President <a href="../../../l/u/k/Lukashenko.html" title="Lukashenko">Lukashenko</a> himself used the term (BEFORE the elections and recent demonstrations) makes it notable.

<li><b>Delete</b> Belarus election riots gets many thousands of ghits, this gets about 500. It looks very much as if either the term has not yet made it into the English language media, or it's a localised neologism. No dispute that the riots took place, but we have not yet seen much in the way of credible evidence that this is what they are generally called. Articles which are "useful to counter speculation" almost invariably violate <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (a soapbox).

<li>You are not reading carefully. The term is not confined to "these events", if you mean the post-election rallies. In fact, this part of the article must be severely trimmed (done). Also you are forgetting that English language does not rule the whole world. this term is notable locally in Belarus; even Belarus President uses it in his speeches bashing the opposition. Wikipedia is not only for American <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porn_star.html" title="Porn star">porn stars</a>, you know.

<li>Wikipedia is not a forum for human rights groups and other advocacy groups, even if the cause is a good one. No matter how much some Wikipedia users want to promote a "Jeans Revolution," the term is still a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a>. A good standard for determining whether a term is a neologism or a real movement recognized by the zeitgeist of the English-speaking world is checking to see whether or not the <i>New York Times</i> has mentioned the term. So far, the <i>Times</i>, along with just about all other major media outlets in the English-speaking world, has not used the term. <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?query=%22jeans%20revolution%22&amp;date_select=full&amp;srchst=nyt" class="external autonumber" title="http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?query=%22jeans%20revolution%22&amp;date_select=full&amp;srchst=nyt" rel="nofollow">[54]</a> Let's please resist the temptation to make the news. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 08:26, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

Notable HR groups as Amnesty International or HRW are also simply sources for notability of such a term, just like you cite the Times. For arguments sake, if the term is widely used in German, Polish, Belarusian and Russian media, but not in English media, would it be notable enough? My answer would be hell yes.

<li>When it comes to naming, the English-speaking world is indeed the benchmark for naming of articles on the <i>English</i> Wikipedia. <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a> lays out a set of guidelines under which "article naming should give priority to what the majority of English speakers would most easily recognize, with a reasonable minimum of ambiguity, while at the same time making linking to those articles easy and second nature." Thus, I would still prefer to redirect the article to a page like 2006 Belarusian post-election protest while the term "Jeans Revolution" is establishing itself in the English-language media. Regarding your point on human rights groups, I think that overall news agencies striving for objectivity are better guides for naming than activist groups, although material from human rights groups certainly ought to be cited. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 13:19, 23 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your mixing up two questions. Question one is whether this subject should have its own article. My answer would be yes. Question two is what this article should be called. Jeans revolution seems uncommon as of yet in English media (though not elsewhere). We could rename it to say, Jeans Campaign (as used in <a href="http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/rm/62999.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/rm/62999.htm" rel="nofollow">this Commission hearing</a>). Still, the term may be much more neutral, but is used even less in both English and non-English sources, so I'm not sure if its a good idea. Still, just because the name may not be notable, does not mean the topic is not notable.

<li><b>Another comment</b> As Mikka points out, since the Belarusian, Russian and Polish press all using the term to a certain extent, I am downgrading my opposition to this article. Nevertheless, I still hope that this AfD nomination serves to provide a caution to Wikipedia editors that the subject is a neologism, and clearly not at this stage a topic that, say, a historian can classify as a real "revolution." <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 08:50, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As any historian will tell you, the naming of events is central to the interpretation of the events being named. And naming is often very political. Americans, for example, are very familiar with the dispute over the naming of the American Civil War (aka the "War of Northern Agression" or the "War Between the States"). Regarding the topic of this article, while no one can deny that there is currently a demonstration in Minsk against the outcome of the election, the idea of a "Jeans Revolution" may be a mere slogan, and not a real "revolution." Currently there are only around 700 demonstrators in Minsk. The protest has been dwindling since Sunday. <i>Since then, each evening has seen a progressively smaller gathering -- 5,000 on Monday, 3,000 to 4,000 on Tuesday. The hardcore group spending the whole night outside however rose from 300 to 1,000 on Tuesday.</i> <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060323/ts_afp/belarusvote_060323111428" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060323/ts_afp/belarusvote_060323111428" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> So Lukashenko might be able to ride this protest out. (Personally, I hope not. But I'd bet on that.)

<li>I'm tempering my opposition to the article. Nevertheless, there are still some real concerns here. Reporting a current event is not the problem per se.

<li>172, you and me are on the same wave here. Let me repeat that it was me who nominated the previous version of this article for deletion, because it was really preposterious in 2005: it was not at all sure that this neologism would survive. Please pay attention: the term is not about a single "current event": the word "revolution" is kind of misleading here. Initially this guy with denim shirt in the air suggested the term <b>"jeans resistance"</b>, which would have been more correct. But the "peer pressure" (to say it politely) replaced it by "revolution", which is definitely way above the heads of belarussian opposition. Still, after the recent events the term generated enough buzz to warrant an article. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 18:23, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm unfamiliar with that "clause." I guess someone could argue that it is a corollary of "ignore all rules" and "Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy," which are established policies. At any rate, I'll let other editors hash out that debate. Nightstallion is correct that the nomination doesn't have "a snowball's chance." Nevertheless, in this case, the discussion stemming from the AfD discussion here is helpful and relevant. While I've started to agree with Mikka's point that the term has "generated enough buzz to warrant an article," the boundaries of the subject in an article on a neologism are often very murky.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Students in the US have been participating in this jeans revolution as a show of solidarity with Belarusian students. Someone in Washington organized the making of a giant denim flag to send to Minsk, and students at Wartburg College in Waverly, Iowa, painted squares of denim which were added to this flag. Today (25 March) we have asked the entire student body to wear jeans and join us in carrying a large white-red-white flag around the city. We have also participated in the candle memorials on the 16th of the month--please see <a href="http://www.svaboda.org/articlesprograms/diaspora/2006/3/d1809d59-78ba-4ef9-a6eb-6ba07bb4af6a.html" class="external free" title="http://www.svaboda.org/articlesprograms/diaspora/2006/3/d1809d59-78ba-4ef9-a6eb-6ba07bb4af6a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.svaboda.org/articlesprograms/diaspora/2006/3/d1809d59-78ba-4ef9-a6eb-6ba07bb4af6a.html</a> and scroll down.

<p>This denim movement is definitely present, and it is not isolated to Belarus.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Yes, this is what the revolution in Belarus is being called (though it was Cornflower before the elections). With the mounting protests in belarus taking place now, I have no doubt that this revolution attempt will go on for a little while. Plus, this is also notable, since this could be one of the first failed attempts of a color revolution after what happened in Georgia, Ukraine, Krygzistan. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 22:02, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I've often seen this argued, but it isn't true. The SI system has seven "base units" and a system of prefixes to create further units from them. The base unit of length is the metre. The centi- is one of the standard SI prefixes, just as the milli- and kilo- are. So the centimetre is a perfectly valid SI unit.

<li><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../m/e/t/Meter.html" title="Meter">meter</a> is a redirect to <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metre.html" title="Metre">metre</a>. So is <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centimetre.html" title="Centimetre">centimetre</a>. <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilometre.html" title="Kilometre">Kilometre</a> has its own article, though, and <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilometer.html" title="Kilometer">Kilometer</a> redirects there. The convention is to use the European spelling in all these - understandably, given that it is the <i>Système International d'Unités</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Friends, what we have here is murkier than it looks. A Long Time Ago there were articles on centimetre and centimeter. Both were redirected to metre; <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centimetre.html" title="Centimetre">centimetre</a> was the older by a few monoths, but content was usually simila and was merged into <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metre.html" title="Metre">metre</a> before redirecting in June 2005 (if not before, if I fish around too much in the history I think I'll lose the wil to live). Both have been sporadically resurrected since, and the content of both is pretty similar. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooking563_efe1.html" title="User:Booking563">Booking563</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBooking563_1a46.html" title="User talk:Booking563">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Booking563_696a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Booking563">contribs</a>) and <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.192.107.242.html" title="User:64.192.107.242">64.192.107.242</a> (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.192.107.242.html" title="User talk:64.192.107.242">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.192.107.242_2d66.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.192.107.242">contribs</a>) seem to be working on undoing the redirect this time. Part of what is going on seems to be some kind of low-level campaign to Americanise the spelling (which is odd, since the US mainly uses Imperial measures of distance).

<ol>
<li>Redirect to <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centimetre.html" title="Centimetre">centimetre</a> and resurrect the last non-redirect version of centimetre, which was not markedly different from what is here now</li>
<li>Redirect to <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metre.html" title="Metre">metre</a> as <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centimetre.html" title="Centimetre">centimetre</a> currently does and this did until recently.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I am an active editor and I use the Wikipedia as my first source for extraneous imformation. I see this term being referenced, search for it and the article doesn't exist. The search interface doesn't send you to the Wiktionary. I suspect that many people are looking for the meaning of this acronym at the moment as it is in heavy use at Eschaton and firedoglake, among many other places. When you try to find a term that doesn't exist in the Wikipedia the SUGGESTION is to START THE ARTICLE FOR IT YOURSELF. Done. Wouldn't we rather have a page come up where there was none?

<li><b>Keep</b>. You can't get rid of a whole movement, and the associated controversy, by just slapping an AfD on it.

<li><b>Speedy keep and cleanup</b>, POV warring is not a justification for deletion, no matter how severe.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I marked this as PROD because there's no evidence even named in the article of an organisation.

<li>If you <b>DELETE</b> this article, you need to DELETE the METRICATION article also... Otherwise you are DEFINITELY biased in your POV. This article keeps being being re-written in a pro-metric biased POV (EXAMPLE: <i>"because of <b>perceived</b> flaws in the metric system"</i>, tell me that's not biased! When the flaw exists in the Imperial system it's a flaw... When it exists in the metric system, it's <b>perceived</b>!?!?!) The fact of the matter is, any article dealing with this subject is going to be controversial and if Wikipedia deletes all controversial articles, then it's a pretty lame source of information. And it that's the case, I want to see Metric System, SI, and Metrication deleted also because they are all extremely biased! <a href="../../../a/r/f/User%7EArfon_0c76.html" title="User:Arfon">arfon</a> 17:35, 22 March 2006 (UTC) - <b>KEEP</b> - This whole argument is Assinine! This is an article descibing the Anti-metrifcation movement and it's reasons. It's assinine to <b>expect anything BUT A anti-metric POV on it</b>!

<li><b>Delete</b>, no sources cited; pure OR. It started off being biased original research: why a few editors think anti-metrication is silly. Then it became truly absurd original research: why one editor thinks anti-metrication is our only saviour against the Devil's Units. There <i>is</i> the potential for a good article here, if we had, say, a well-sourced description of the history of metrication and those silly people who opposed it — but this isn't it, and in any case there's no reason why it needs to be <i>here</i> and not as part of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrication.html" title="Metrication">Metrication</a> or, if necessary, a better-named spinoff. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 17:48, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> obviously needs several tags (cleanup, sources, POV etc.) but this article does capture a genuine set of arguments that those against metrification use. I wouldn't call it a "movement" because there is (AFAIK) no organized group with this agenda.

<li>It is <i>not</i> 100% factual, and it is not completely sourced. The stuff about French wine, for example, reads like you've made it up ("could only be explained by"), as does "unit confusion" (a case of "many people believe" = "I believe", or <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">WP:WEASEL</a>). The sources themselves are very sad indeed; one of the best is an ABC Radio interview with an English teacher (!) who rattled off a few "facts" he heard somewhere. The vast majority of sources (certainly every one I looked at) came from someone who was not themselves an expert, and who cited no sources of their own.

<li>The article states that the fact that French wine wasn't immediately switched from 720mL bottles to 1L bottles "can only be explained by" popular resistance to the Metric system (that the English once had a measure of a similar size is apparently relevant, although the article hints but won't say why). It <i>also</i> says that the bottles were later increased to 750mL, and includes all this "information" in a section about how Metrication inevitably causes traders to try to rip-off their customers ... by <i>reducing</i> the size of their measures.

<li><b>Delete</b> This article seems to have difficulty deciding whether metrication (or is that 'metrification'?) is a Good Thing or a Bad Thing. It wallows like a rowboat in a typhoon, and laughable POVs such as "Another significant effect of metrication is that, on its introduction, it divides generations from each other, creating mutual incomprehension between children and their parents. This could obviously assist the sort of cultural revolutions which accompany invasion, subjugation, the fall of monarchies or the breaking of ties with former colonial powers" suggest a full rewrite is necessary. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green">☯</font></a> 01:42, 24 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's really not unfair, considering that <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrication.html" title="Metrication">Metrication</a> has a section on opposition, and no one is advocating removing that. We don't have to have an article on anti-everything--it's usually more sensible to cover opposition in the main article, unless it's just too long. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickelShoe_2d9b.html" title="User:NickelShoe">NickelShoe</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickelShoe_8b97.html" title="User talk:NickelShoe">Talk</a>) 05:21, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I second what Nickel Shoe says. Metrication is a significant process with enormous cultural, historical, scientific, technological, etc. importance. It therefore deserves an article. The opposition to it is also significant. The question is whether there is room in the main article to cover this opposition. It seems that there is not. <i>Thus</i> we have the article <i><a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-metrication.html" title="Anti-metrication">Anti-metrication</a></i> (which, as I mention, would be better renamed). It's not a question of fairness because neither article should be taking sides. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> 15:40, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Many notable professors are not "full professors." By that comment I assume you to mean a "tenured professor." The academic market being so full of political and economic pressures has limited the number of tenured positions for professors. Also, it should be noted that Shah Hanifi's expertise is on Afghanistan and South Asian history, a subject for which there are only a handfull of American scholars. He was a student of professor <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan_Cole_474e.html" title="Juan Cole">Juan Cole</a> at the University of Michigan. He serves on the executive board of the American Institute of Afghanistan Studies centered at Duke University. For his ground-breaking work on inter-regional trade and colonial state formation in Afghanistan he won the 2004 E-Gutenberg Prize from the American Historical Association. The award is funded by the <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_W._Mellon_Foundation_0a39.html" title="Andrew W. Mellon Foundation">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>. Dr. Hanifi is also the Principal Investigator and Project Director for The Afghan Diaspora Remittance Project. Hanifi was selected for this prestigious position by <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_Development_Bank_fe11.html" title="Asian Development Bank">Asian Development Bank</a>. The project was developed to estimate the amount and forms of human and material capital infusions from the Afghan diaspora to Afghanistan, and propose mechanisms to more efficiently and effectively attach that capital to development opportunities in Afghanistan. This project is aiding in the development of not only the economic stability of Afghanistan but in reducing the funding of terrorist activities in that state. <a href="http://www.jhfc.duke.edu/aias/board.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jhfc.duke.edu/aias/board.html" rel="nofollow">[62]</a> <a href="http://www.historians.org/prizes/gutenberg/2004wins.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.historians.org/prizes/gutenberg/2004wins.cfm" rel="nofollow">[63]</a> <a href="http://web.jmu.edu/history/index_fachonors.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.jmu.edu/history/index_fachonors.htm" rel="nofollow">[64]</a>--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 21:49, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The Wikiepdia "<a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">professor test</a>" is not directly linked to whether the person is tenured or not.

<p>Gwernol - Check the Honors and Awards section. Instead of immediately deleting a page, perhaps you should check it out on your own time to determine if it is bunk. It is obvious that Dr. Hanifi is important to his academic field as he is virtually the ONLY person who discusses Afghanistan. *Warnerhw</p>

<dd>Ah, I see now. That is a good arguement but I don't feel that the professor is notable for only one connection to his work (the dissertation and the resulting award). His work, both academic and professional, is notable.
<dl>
<dd>I have changed my assertation to <b>merge</b> to reflect the recent changes to the article. I don't believe that the gentleman is notable enough to warrant his own article at this time, but information about him would be good to have in an article related to his area of expertise. The text could also use some more work to bring it towards NPOV, which I would like to help with if it is merged or kept. --<a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakeel_bd6a.html" title="User:Takeel">Takeel</a> 15:47, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This is entirely appropriate, and represents a positive contribution to the project. He should be applauded. You, on the other hand, slapped a deletion tag on article on an article whose main flaw was an imperfect assertion of notability, making no apparent effort to check on the accuracy of your non-notability claim or the verifiability of the assertion of notability. Now you're complaining because he's convinced other editors that you were wrong, and has brought together a consensus on the issue. Why do you think there's something wrong with that?

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Thank you Monicasdude for coming to my defense on this issue. I intended no such action of "vote stacking." The article was updated according to the criteria set forth in the discussion and I asked an editor to review their previous decision in light of new developments. No ill intentions were in that action and there nothing improper about it. I do not appreciate subtle personal attacks such as those being perpetrated by Schuminweb. As Monicasdude stated, there was little to no reason to put a deletion tag on this article in the first place. The proper action would have been to attempt to improve the article or request others to do further work on the article before attempting to delete it. I have elaborated on these points and Schuminweb's unwelcoming nature toward users attempting to contribute, in good gaith, to Wikipedia at <a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">User_talk:Schuminweb</a>. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 03:47, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>No Vote</b> but placing in AfD as NN bio. The article seemed to indicate that the subject is notable at first glance, but in looking closer, I questioned the subject's notability. First <i>"Fresh out of college, Bill was a statistical analyst in New York with <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Greenspan_c1c0.html" title="Alan Greenspan">Alan Greenspan</a>, now Chairman of the Federal Reserve."</i>--Does that mean they worked in the same building? Mr. Greenspan is obviously notable, but does working with him "fresh out of college" make the subject notable? Secondly, <i>"He later worked as a news reporter and editorial researcher for the publisher of Barron 's."</i>...not <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barron%27s.html" title="Barron's">Barron's</a> itself, but the publisher of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barron%27s.html" title="Barron's">Barron's</a>. I have also created the AfD nomination for Bill Good Marketing, which currently seems to indicate that the business itself is non-notable, so being the CEO of a non-notable company should not make the subject notable. I don't want to give the impression that I have an agenda with this, which is why I am not voting here, just putting this one up for debate. <a href="../../../b/u/g/User%7EBugwit_0cfa.html" title="User:Bugwit">Bugwit</a> <small><a href="../../../b/u/g/User_talk%7EBugwit_0602.html" title="User talk:Bugwit">grunt</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_bugwit_4152.html" title="Special:Contributions/bugwit">scribbles</a></small> 17:06, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Obvious Keep,</b> conspicuously notable as published author; a book that goes through six printings from Scribners (hardly an obscure publishing house) obviously meets the applicable notability criterion (typically even a single Scribners printing would); and a nine-year-old book with even a modestly high Amazon rank also indicates notability. I happen to think telemarketers should be slowly beaten to death with spiny objects, with periodic breaks for immersion in salt water and caustic liquids, but even those who hold less moderate views than mine would, I expect, agree that one of the founders of the field is a notable evildoer. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 20:03, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Dear people wishing to delete this article. I decided to look at the Category <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Internet_forums" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Internet_forums" rel="nofollow">Internet Forums</a> to see exactly what was considered "notable" by your standards. And after reviewing that list of forums I have to say NGR is much more notable than half of those forums on that list, yet none of them are up for deletion. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarknecro_f645.html" title="User:Darknecro">Necro</a> 23:06, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Permanent Delete</b> I come to Wikipedia to read about interesting things, not a list of people that post on an internet forum. --Bulgogi 23:10, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To bulgogi*. Wikipedia is full of tons of interesting things. Did you know that in the year 2078 Soham murders killer Ian Huntley eligible for parole in this year. <a href="../../../2/0/4/2042.html" title="2042">1</a> Or how about the fact that Fahrenheit is a Thai rock band featuring a female lead vocalist <a href="../../../f/a/h/Fahrenheit_%28band%29.html" title="Fahrenheit (band)">2</a> Interesting, right? Wikipedia is full of plenty uninteresting things. And iff you dont find it interesting all you have to do is <b>NOT GO TO IT</b> it's not that hard. Apparently this article is interesting to some people, or else it wouldnt be up.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Keep it:</b> As Lucavious said here and Darknecro said in the article's discussion page, in a few days, the vandalism will be over and serious editers can be given a chance to add to it. I'm sure luca and Necro will be more than happy to contribute to the article. And if this is deleted, I suggest that the two keep any reincarnation of the page in the future a secret so that the douches from the board don't vandalize it to Hell.</p>
<p>In addition, Club-Siemens is an Internet forum with literally nothing important about it, but its marked as an article needing importance. Why not delete that than this, the home of the Brian Peppers Internetwide meme? <a href="../../../o/v/e/User%7EOverlordChris_fb94.html" title="User:OverlordChris">OverlordChris</a> 00:03, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep as is</b>: Whether the reason for deletion is vandalism or non-notability, I believe this is worth keeping. As stated, many other pages for forums aren't as notable as EGM NGR, including low amounts of Google hits and not Alexa rankings, so if this were to be deleted, they should all be wiped clean as well. As for vandalism, once the Wikipedia article is established, the idea to deface it will lose appeal to members of the board, I know this for fact. Please also know that some users that dislike EGM NGR but post there to annoy are attempting to have this article removed for irritation factor to the board members who wish to develop a serious article, specifically Bulgogi <a href="http://boards.1up.com/zd/board/message?board.id=egmofftop&amp;message.id=769128#M769128" class="external autonumber" title="http://boards.1up.com/zd/board/message?board.id=egmofftop&amp;message.id=769128#M769128" rel="nofollow">[66]</a>, as well as another user who we don't know the Wiki username who is upset he was left off the suer list. -- <a href="../../../v/i/e/User%7EViewdrix_e10c.html" title="User:Viewdrix">Viewdrix</a> 00:15, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>There is probably an interesting, deep history of this board to be told, but it is COMPLETELY non-encyclopedic! I suggest a member of the 1up EGM Messageboards installs <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki" class="external text" title="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki" rel="nofollow">MediaWiki</a> on his/her website so this community can revel in its localized in-jokes, references, and trends, because the content of this article has no relevance to anyone else beyond the tiny community. I should also note that I am a member of the 1up community, albeit a one who rarely posts. As for other forums with wikis that are as or less notable than this one, they should be deleted too -- <b>point them out, and we'll get rid of them</b>. THe only forum with a wiki article I can think of is the Gaming Age Forums, which receives far more posts, visitors, and respect; it has a number of notable industry and media posters and regularly influences the videogaming media. If the 1up EGM NGR (Non gaming related, ahem) rival other forums, with wiki articles, in terms of influence, visitors, and prominence in the online community, I would not want this article deleted.</li>

<p>edit: perhaps the EGM boards could receive mention in the main EGM article as a sub-entry. It's a stretch, but that's as close to wikipedia as I'd want them coming.</p>
<p>edit2: EGM NGR already has a place for their history and other self-important articles: <a href="http://egmngr.com/" class="external free" title="http://egmngr.com/" rel="nofollow">http://egmngr.com/</a>. There's absolutely no reason for this article to exist.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: That's not a fair statement at all. Just because a website has a History section, does that mean it automatically should be deleted from Wikipedia? No. The WEB pages of Wikipedia aren't reserved solely for websites that don't have their own History pages or such for visitors. -- <a href="../../../v/i/e/User%7EViewdrix_e10c.html" title="User:Viewdrix">Viewdrix</a> 18:10, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Sorry if I wasn't clear, but earlier in my post I suggested they create their own website built on the wikipedia software since this wasn't encyclopedia-worthy, although I could see how the history of their small board could mean something to them (everything to them, nothing to us). When I discovered that they already did have a place for vanity articles, I wondered aloud why this page existed in the first place.

<dd>I've been quite nice, I think.

But the point isn't that the article is biased. It's that your company isn't notable enough, in my opinion, for an article at an encyclopedia, making it basically advertising, which isn't appropriate here. That's all. Of course, others may disagree -- that's the great thing about the Wikipedia community.

<p>I am new to Wikipedia so I hope I make no errors of etiquette. However, I am concerned about the debate here. Are all of the authors aware that Netsuite have patented the Enterprise Dashboard concept? I am a great fan of Netsuite, love it in fact as I am a massive advocate of SAAS, but do not think this is appropriate to list their (rather crazy - how can you patent teh dashboard???) patent here.</p>

Lastly, I happen to be a Harvard student myself, and the person who started the article in the first place is most likely a friend of his given the internal university directory information. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 00:38, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The pictures of the two F-4 Phantoms were the exact planes as described in "US Navy F-4 Phantom II MiG Killers 1972-1973", by Brad Elward and Peter Davies, 2002 by Osprey Publishing Limited. A portion of the narrative used under the ready room picture and the text to the right of it are excerpts from the book, as well. I have permission to use these from the authors. The MiGs WERE the only two MiG-19 North Vietnamese Aircraft downed by Navy pilots in the war. The MiG-19 engagement is one of the most written up of the war. . A quick look at the quote underneath the ready room picture "...celebrate downing the Navy's only MiG-19 kills of the Vietnam War..." The crew to whom you refer is Mugs McKeown and Jack Ensch, who downed two MiG-17s five days later on 23 MAY 1972. <a href="../../../t/o/p/User%7ETopgun0272_4aa7.html" title="User:Topgun0272">Topgun0272</a> 21:14, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>:Since there is no date on that picture it's possible that it was out of date. Again, the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation says <i>"23 May 1972: Two of the squadron’s aircraft, while flying MiG Combat Air Patrol for a strike in the Haiphong area, were vectored toward Kep Airfield and sighted 4 MiG-17s and 2 MiG-19s. VF-161’s aircraft proceeded to engage the MiGs even though they were outnumbered 3 to 1. In the ensuing battle Lieutenant Commander Ronald E. McKeown and his RIO, Lieutenant John C. Ensch, shot down a MiG-17 and a <b>MiG-19</b> with Sidewinders.</i> <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightindaman_4aa3.html" title="User:Fightindaman">Fightindaman</a> 01:25, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I did this as a legacy for my children and grandchildren. I am the pilot referenced and all of this is true. The authors I cited above received my permission to interview me and print the description of the migshoot that included Oran, Pat, Taco and myself between our two F-4Bs and the MiG-19s. Fightindamian, there is NO mistaking the dates.How could there be? Mugs and Jack shot down two MiG-17s. That dictionary is wrong. You need only read any other source or look at our squadron aircraft which sits on the flight deck of the USS Midway in San Diego Harbor (the San Diego Aircraft Carrier Museum). Actually, it's kind of funny because this is the first time that there has been any doubt in anyone's mind over the last 34 years!Mugsy's retired and Jack, a retired Capt., is Director of Military Marketing for the San Diego Padres and both would be interested to know that they were credited with a MiG-19. Jack's time spent in the Hanoi Hilton might have been a little different had the NVA known as well.As for reformatting the scrapbook, I can do that when I have a better idea of what would look better. Other than that, I really thought that something like this would be helpful to future generations in their research of that period in our nation's history.Bart Bartholomay, LT USNRRet.<a href="../../../t/o/p/User%7ETopgun0272_4aa7.html" title="User:Topgun0272">Topgun0272</a> 21:33, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>: While I'm at work right now (which will explain the IP address as a sig), I actually have photos of the aircraft mentioned above from a recent visit to the Midway.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Fightindamian, the source you use is wrong and, interestingly enough, it's the ONLY source I've ever seen that indicates Mugs and Jack shot down a MiG-19. They would be proud. But even the North Vietnamese teach the correct version in their own school system. I have facts to back that statement up, too. However, because one of you were nice enough to reformat the article so that it looks good and in keeping with other wikis (thanks, BTW!!), here's a few links that confirm what I have said.The right intake of our bird that sits on the flight deck of the USS Midway (a military vessel now the San Diego Aircraft Carrier Museum), as mentioned above, and has all of our squadron's MiG kills during 1972. They are even on the superstructure as evidenced by the last link below. There are three MiG-17s - McKeown/Ensch(2), Kovaleski/Wise(1), two MiG-19s - Bartholomay/Brown and Arwood/Bell. Surely, it can't be wrong.The other MiG-17s were from a previous cruise much earlier in the war.If anyone thinks that a more indepth account of my own recollections of the dogfight, especially mentioned here in the wiki article, would be appropriate I can do that, but so much has already been written that it seemed redundant.<a href="http://home.sprynet.com/~anneled/usvictor.html" class="external text" title="http://home.sprynet.com/~anneled/usvictor.html" rel="nofollow">US Air-to-Air Victories in the Vietnam War</a><a href="http://www.history.navy.mil/avh-1910/APP33.PDF" class="external text" title="http://www.history.navy.mil/avh-1910/APP33.PDF" rel="nofollow">AIRCRAFT SHOT DOWN DURING THE VIETNAM WAR BY USN/USMC PILOTS - see link as military link</a><a href="http://www.midwaysailor.com/midway/shootdowns.html" class="external text" title="http://www.midwaysailor.com/midway/shootdowns.html" rel="nofollow">From the MidwaySailor site</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>:Well, as far as your sources go, they seem to confirm that the two kills in question were the only two MiG-19s downed by the Navy. Not the only two downed in total. Your first sources lists many Air Force MiG-19 kills, the other two are only for the Navy/USS Midway. So it comes to this being about a pilot who downed one of two MiG-19s shot down by the Navy, 10 in total. This still doesn't seem notable. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightindaman_4aa3.html" title="User:Fightindaman">Fightindaman</a> 00:13, 24 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: It would seem notable enough that the aircraft used for it is preserved as part of a naval museum, and a fairly significant part of the program there.

<dd>Sure they can be however this proposal if it suceeds will gurantee them to stay underdeveloped. For example Norway class has only been seen once with little info (even the designers computer files were corrupted). Yet it has developed into a full article over time. There are lots of usable semi-cannon resources for the ships. I for one do not claim to know all star trek and feel articles should be left alone for a while so they can develop. Articles that dont have enough information to stay on their own are called stubs which are welcomed on wikipedia. They are certainly much more usefull than what you propose: tens of redirects leading to one page quite hard to follow.</dd>

After I removed the prod, commenting on the fact that the nominator had made no effort to verify his absurd claim of non-notability, he posted a rude personal attack on my talk page. And the article rather prominently asserts notability, saying the subject's work has "benefitted" several academic disciplines and created a new area of research/work in sociolinguistics.

<li>Response. You still haven't explained why you still want to delete an article about an obviously notable subject, other than your extreme pique. If the current text bothers you that much, fix it.

I'm not altogether sure that the nomination was made in good faith, but I certainly don't approve of Monicasdude's imputation of malign motive to Bug (and I agree certainly with him that the creator of an article should make every effort to demonstrate the subject's notability straightaway). Similarly, I don't think Monicasdude's "would it kill you" comment is wholly gauche or untoward and surely doesn't merit a reference to <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">WP:DICK</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Maybe redirect to fart detector. When you boys say this is "non-notable humour", are you saying that humorous things are not notable by definition or that so far as humorous things go, this thing is not notable? How are you judging that exactly? When would a humorous thing be notable? Who would you require to note it? How do we know whether it is more or less notable than a particular Pokemon or an episode of the Simpsons? Yuckfoo has shown that www.prankplace.com has noted the "fart detector".

<li><i>Apples and oranges. If anything, comparison should be made to something similar</i>. Man, are you not getting it! Look, my point is that what's notable depends who's doing the noting and what the thing being noted is. It's not an objective standard. So you can't just say "it's not notable". Because we're saying Pokemons are notable, Simpsons episodes are notable, but fart gags are not notable? How? What's your standard?

Interestingly, I was the first person to write about this landowning Auberon Herbert on Wikipedia, in an attempt to clarify the confusion caused by the wrong birth and death dates given for the philosopher <a href="../../../a/u/b/Auberon_Herbert_ce29.html" title="Auberon Herbert">Auberon Herbert</a>. However, it would probably be better to just make a quick note of the potential for confusion in the latter article, if at all. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>)</sup> 22:22, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Dear Readers: Thank you for your interest in this article. We have read every single comment and we're doing all we can to make this article better. The birth year will be added since I did not know it before. The feedback is very, very valuable and we most certainly appreciate it. The comments left by all of you can only aid in making this article much better. As noted for Elite Soiree, its success is attributed to it's founder due to her tenacity and dedication to her work, even at a young age (born 1980; she's 26 by the way), which has garnered her awards, TV opportunities, books and some of the most noted celebrities today. The story of Taylor Lea Thomas is commendable which is why it is written here. Elite Soiree was started without any partners or investors yet she has managed to accomplish the aforementioned on her own. For a woman in business at her age, her accomplishments are therefore notable, as others would agree. It is in no way an advertisement and nothing more than a mere blurb about the company. Rest assured, however, that we will make this article, as well as the others, better and more informative. We therefore kindly request help in doing so since we're inexperienced here on Wikipedia. In time and with your help, we aspire to make this article one that readers enjoy reading. Most importantly, it is not intended as a sales tool or press release and should be understood as such. Again, thank you for the constructive criticism and we most certainly look forward to working with you to make it better in lieu of simply deleting it. Also, we apologize for deleting the previous tag since we were unaware of this discussion page. Thank you for your participation in this matter. Peter Sanders 11:55, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, it's not puppetry, the site is well known and has been covered numerous times in the gaming media. There are a large number of *different* people posting here, however they are all from the site's forum which is an absolute trainwreck. If anything the site deserves credit and yes, there will be people researching it. But these people want it noticed for entirely the wrong reasons. Snobbery from both the forum regulars and signed in Wikipedia members has become extremely irritating in this debate - all your perspectives are skewed and I'm just trying to be an impartial observer here.<small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 219.188.179.186 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_219.188.179.186_6c47.html" title="Special:Contributions/219.188.179.186">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is not some minor fansite, it's been around for years and has been copied endlessly by other sites listed in wikipedia, it's the original and quite possibly the best. The forum shouldn't even be mentioned as it's not really relevant to the main site. This article is extremely poorly written and should be redone from scratch, maybe by someone who's actually bothered to 'read' the site. Wikipedia is supposed to be an encyclopaedia, the influence of UK:R is undoubtable - Thus it should have an entry. --220.240.72.131 05:00, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge and Purge</b> all subpages except "Characters." It needs to adhere to encyclopedic standards and cover the main elements only. There are salvageable elements to all subpages but most of the content is dreck. I question the motivation of the nom given the comment above, but he has a point. Atlas Shrugged is significant as political statement, not as a literary piece (honestly, I think it's literary drivel - go see my user page if you think that's a bad faith comment). Were it a comprehensive literary universe like some other series, you could argue it. But having subpages on the literary nuances is overkill for this one work.

Well, no, not really. How many directors would then need to have one-line stub? It would be very difficult to find more bio info on these guys, even if they were notable.

<li><b>comment</b> Monicasdude is probably right, but it's hard to tell fomr these articles.

<li>Harro, those were my proposed deletions. Thank you for submitting them for re-consideration here. I can see Monicasdude's point, but in my mind these people don't reach notability, despite the fact that they guide a very large corporation. Corporate boards usually have 12-15 members and can be populated by relatively famous figures, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Schultz_c77b.html" title="George Schultz">George Schultz</a> comes to mind, and maybe CEOs and CFOs of other corporations, and maybe people who have operational expertise but are unknown outside their own organizations. IMO corporate board membership does not by itself make a person notable or influential. One source I found (<a href="http://www.boardmember.com/member_directory/dbase_brochure.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.boardmember.com/member_directory/dbase_brochure.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.boardmember.com/member_directory/dbase_brochure.pdf</a>) suggests that, if you count up the board members of major publically-traded companies you get 53,000 names, and these names change all the time. The fact that the membership of these boards interlock and comprise a government-educational-corporate sort of ruling class is a significant, but separate, issue. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChadlupkes_29d5.html" title="User:Chadlupkes">User:Chadlupkes</a> will want to know, since he's been filling in a lot of these names. My vote is <b>Delete</b> but this deserves further discussion here. If we do delete these three, then other <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_International_Group_dded.html" title="American International Group">American International Group</a> board members should go with them, if they are listed only because of their board membership: <a href="../../../m/2E/_/M._Bernard_Aidinoff_1023.html" title="M.

<li>Thanks for bringing me into the discussion. I'll vote for <b>keep</b>, because I have a particular interest in developing these sorts of lists for research purposes, but I'll understand if the community disagrees. The cross-board membership of so many people is of personal interest to a lot of people I know, and Wikipedia seemed to be the best way to keep track of this sort of information. There are a few other wiki sites out there open to collect it outside of Wikipedia. 53,000 is a pretty large number, although I've mostly been concentrating on the DOW30. Is there an article related to the subject of board members being part of multiple boards? <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChadlupkes_29d5.html" title="User:Chadlupkes">Chadlupkes</a> 14:42, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Honestly, it's been very difficult to find bio information that doesn't come directly from the corporate websites, and I've been scolded for that.

<li>Hey, guys, look: I've gotten emails about this the last day or so, and I'm flattered that Zeppelin thinks I'm noteworthy enough for a Wiki article. When she first told me she'd done it I was upset that she hadn't asked first, and also bothered because it's become just another place where anonymous jerks can cast their insults at me because they can't deal with me directly or straight. I can even appreciate that she's passionate about what she thinks is right and that other people feel the same about their own convictions here. I like Wiki myself even though I'm not a regular visitor.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the fact is, life's too short to be arguing over nonsense like whether or not a website article is "worthy" or something like that. Just take a break, go pet a cat, go visit friends. I know personally that none of this matters in the long run, okay? Take a cue and just go find things worth arguing about.</p>
<p>Zeppelin, calm down please, okay? If people want to attack me that's just them wasting their time on useless stuff, don't get caught up in it thinking you're somehow protecting some vital national resource. I'm just not that important.</p>
<p>I gave you the picture and the sources because you said you wanted to validate the article and improve it and I'm not going to say no to someone wanting to write about my work, and I stand by that work for the same reasons you've gone on about here. But I didn't give you the info or the picture or anything else to contribute to some vandal-defender war and abuse this site, all right?</p>
<p>Don't take it personally, it's just a website reference, okay? I've done what work I can in the time I've got and if I produce more or manage to get a bit more notice, fine and dandy. But this isn't the place to push such things and there are obviously people here already looking after the integrity of the site and its contents. Thanks. And Zep, thanks for letting me have some editorial say on the article, but as of now I'm done with it. --Ron Horsley</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Seems like a serious author and/or artist of nascent popularity. He has published and been paid for his works so I think that qualifies as notable and verifiable.

<ul>
<li>If published and paid for works isn't the standard, then why did you mention at all that the one book Mr. Horsley *edited* was a "vanity" press? Shouldn't that be inconsequential then, if we're discussing the "overall" merit of someone to have a Wiki article about them? Unlike some authors here, there isn't even a link to his site or any promoting/sales sites for his works. The only time it came up was when I (in error) did so to try and defend against the vandalism that occurred on the article (which, in fact, it was the vandals who first made any mention or link to his site). So if the sources are now provided for the claims, and the works have appeared in not just POD but legitimately-recognized publications, what exactly are you claiming as your source for merit? How many books or stories it was? What organizations a person is or isn't a member of? What authors they're friends or? If you can clarify exactly what your barometer is, I think it would help clear up what is your issue with nominating this for deletion some months after it was already on the Wiki system. And if you have some clear guidelines for your vote, then perhaps we could take those and see if there's any other article on Wiki that you've nominated (or maybe just overlooked) that come under the same guidelines. Wiki has to be treated with some consistency, even when we have case-by-case issues, or else its integrity would be compromised. If you're just ultimately saying "nobody's heard of him," then we could again go through Wiki, even just the writers' sections, and see if anybody's commonly heard of a number of authors in those areas.--Zeppelin85

<li>As for why "vanity" press, see the rules on notable on wikipedia. I quoted from that directly. By the way, who are you and what's your name? You know mine, and yet you've accused me of being a fake person. Who are you and what do you do? (Are you Ron?) --<a href="../../../k/y/n/User%7EKynn_59bb.html" title="User:Kynn">Kynn</a> 06:36, 24 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>My name is Mary Lennell, and I am not a professional author but a fan of the horror fiction field. No, I am not Ron, as I've already said. I believe in his work because it attracted my attention when another author I like, Gary Braunbeck, began to mention his work on his site and through having Mr. Horsley design some of the book covers for his collections. As for what I do professionally, I don't see why you're supposed to have so much more information on me, I'm not more 'anonymous' than any other registered member of the site, merely a newer one. I had some interest in maybe writing fiction and started writing to Mr. Horsley about a year ago when he started promoting his availability to read and give honest reviews for people's work. I work in a customer service office, a floor supervisor for a medical supplies company. And lastly: you are still misunderstanding what I originally said when I had doubts about your motivation. I have *never* said you were 'anonymous,' I have never said you were anyone but who you say you are. The only time I mentioned anyone's 'anonymity' was with respect to the vandals who kept vandalizing the page for their own reasons. All I've ever mentioned doubting about you is your truer motivations behind asking this article be deleted months after it was created, and especially now that I've added the sources to verify its claims to legitimacy. You don't seem to be having any votes for deletion towards many other author articles with even less reason to be on Wiki and no verification sources cited. Go through what I wrote. I never once said anything about you being somebody else.</li>

</li>
<li>I wrote this article for Mr. Horsley as he is a correspondent and writing friend of mine and I thought his work merited note just like many contemporaries of his that are also on Wiki. He did not write it himself. He is aware of the article but the vandals who have edited in the past with inflammatory remarks are to be blamed, not him.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only time prior to my most recent edit that his website was even linked on his article was when vandals were attempting to draw further attention to him for purposes of defamation. They also posted links to another author's site, and those were similarly removed. I didn't put the page up to promote any product of his, only to show that he has worked to contribute to writing and book cover art design.</p>
<p>Many books by other authors on Wiki are POD releases or small-press releases. It's debated, but not any official recognition that these are the same thing.</p>
<p>I doubt many "vanity" press releases got noticed by the Stoker Awards or are given honorable mention by the Year's Best Fantasy &amp; Horror for that year. Also, Gauntlet Press is releasing Masques V, which contains Mr. Horsley's last story, and it is not considered a 'vanity' press.' Nor are the other publications where Mr. Horsley has appeared. The book mentioned the Midnighters Club was edited by Horsley, not attributed as one of his novels or short stories. Other authors are recognized in the same article I wrote, and this article recognizes their contribution to that collection as well.</p>
<p>Wiki's own rules state: "An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous. There is currently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia (although consensus exists regarding particular kinds of article, for instance see Template:IncGuide). Borderline cases are frequently nominated for deletion and discussed on WP:AFD. Lack of fame is not the same as vanity."</p>
<p>"The key rule is to not write about yourself, nor about the things you've done or created. If they are encyclopedic, somebody else will notice them and write an article about them."</p>
<p>I know of Mr. Horsley through both personal correspondence and professional appreciation of what he's done the last few years in his field. That was why I wrote the article, and I felt it deserved recognition and accurate record (which Wiki prides itself on being and which I agree with). <a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZeppelin85_7546.html" title="User:Zeppelin85">User: Zeppelin85</a></p>

<li>
<ul>
<li>One last thing...just in randomly going through US writers stubs like the one I wrote, there are a number of authors with little or not information about any major accomplishments or clarification of their importance, either. Are all of those subject to deletion then? and I don't mean to sound like I'm casting aspersions, but I have to question motivation on this nomination in the first place. it's been on Wiki for some months now, and the first name I see here, "Kynn," is not listed as a registered user of Wiki, and when I did a search the only search result that came up was <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Mamatas_715d.html" title="Nick Mamatas">Nick Mamatas</a>, an author who is one of the main critics of Horsley lately. Doesn't seem like a very objective, encyclopedic motive for someone asking an article be deleted for relevancy or vandalism, I'm sorry. If "Kynn" is voting for its deletion on realistic grounds, that's fine and open to discussion as it is here...but it doesn't seem like that's really the motivation behind this request, or else maybe Kynn should've been saying something when I first contributed the article. --Zeppelin85
<ul>

<p>The Midnighters Club was "published" by infinitypublishing.com, a vanity publishing service. It is the only book Horsley has produced. Incidentally, the Bram Stoker award process is open to any sort of work, even vanity published work. This is a matter of some controversy within the Horror Writers Association, and receiving Stoker recommendations (one or more members voting for a short story or other item) in itself proves nothing about the status of a vanity press. A vanity press is a press where the author or editor pays the service to produce the book, and the service then owns the book. Infinity Press, the "publisher" of Horsley's only book, undoubtedly qualifies.</p>
<p>The HWA, which administrates the Bram Stoker award, has this to say, re: the importance of Stoker recommendations (<a href="http://www.horror.org/stoker-etiquette.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.horror.org/stoker-etiquette.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.horror.org/stoker-etiquette.htm</a>):</p>
<p>You may mention that your work has appeared on the Stoker Awards preliminary or final ballot. However, you may not promote your work at all as "Stoker Recommended." See point 6 below. And you may not refer to your work as a "Stoker Nominee" unless it has appeared on the FINAL ballot.</p>
<p>You may not promote your work as "Stoker Recommended." Receiving a handful of Stoker recommendations is a far cry from winning the award or even from being listed on the preliminary ballot. It devalues the Stokers to have their name attached to works whose only defining characteristic may be that one or two HWA members liked them.</p>
<p><br />
A "recommendation" is nothing more than a bookkeeping formality. It takes a large number of recommendations to achieve the preliminary ballot, and then the preliminary ballot is voted on by Active HWA members to create the final ballot. "Stoker recommended" can thus mean that only a single HWA member, including a beginning Affiliate member, enjoyed a story. It is not in any way a sign of superior quality or virtuous publication.</p>
<p>The same can be said for receiving an "Honorable Mention" in the Years Best Fantasy and Horror. Literally hundreds of stories per year receive "HMs", as they are known in the field. The back matter of ann annual YBFH will have dozens of pages listing honorably mentioned stories in a tiny font. It isn't unusual for an author to gain four-six HMs in a single year. Receiving an HM is of virtually no value.</p>

<li>MY apologies, Kynn. When I last clicked on your name entry, it didn't come up with your account. Today it does. For some reason, though, when I did searched on the user name via the search field, the only article that kept popping up was the Mamatas entry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And for the record, I never said you WERE that author, merely that that's the article that came up when your name was searched through that option. It did seem to make it suspect that you were asking for the article's deletion on top of having that reference result to your name.</p>
<p>And I might add that Wiki itself recognizes print-on-demand publishing for what it specifically is (here, just to help clarify, is the Wiki article <a href="../../../p/r/i/Print_on_demand.html" title="Print on demand">Print on demand</a>). Just to help clear this up once and for all, the DEFINING difference between a vanity press and a print-on-demand service is that a vanity press claims to be a publisher while charging fees from the writers. A print-on-demand publisher is up-front about charging fees to writers so that they have the facilities to self-publish their works for release (such as promotional books for copy, as well as small-press books that don't have their own resources to print). Several of the small-press groups in the horror field right now have utilized or are utilizing sub-contracted printing options such as this. It doesn't automatically make them 'vanity' press. A vanity press is often used to describe the scam groups that are trying to wholly masquerade as 'publishers' and actively solicit writers to get their money. Infinity has a website and a storefront; from what I see, they're not on any lists for soliciting or spamming anybody.</p>
<p>In fact, if you google them, Infinity looks to be one of those few POD publishers who are NOT pulling off scams and bad-quality print deals with the people who go to them.</p>
<p>I realize it's a fine distinction sometimes, what is vanity and what is POD, but it seems to me the biggest difference is who is printing books and who is just after people's money without producing anything. But again, even on Wiki's entry for "vanity Publishing," it says specifically:</p>
<p>"On the other hand, many reputable companies offer printing (and perhaps limited distribution) for a fee. If honest, such companies will explain their fees, what they do offer and do not offer, and how their service differs from that of a traditional commercial publisher. Such services can be a viable way for an author to self-publish without owning printing equipment."</p>
<p>I think that clarifies that at least for purposes of argument here, there IS a very clear difference still in existence between a POD service and a vanity press. If you honestly think Mr. Horsley only commissioned the book to be printed for his own amusement, perhaps you should contact any of the authors from that collection and ask if they were paid royalties from any copies sold, or if they were paid only partial fees for their stories. You won't necessarily hear about payment or royalties from some other supposedly-legitimate presses, and some of those aren't even still in business as the POD printers are.</p>
<p>And by the way, regarding the rules of etiquette on the HWA you refer to...these rules are with respect to promoting a specific work with the intention of helping its sales or award-recogntion, particularly during that period in which the work is still within the awards period.</p>
<p>It says nothing about being permitted to mention that a work is Stoker-recommended WHEN IT WAS in fact so recommended, as a matter of record. That's like saying we can't ever refer to a book as having been published if it didn't sell 'x' number of minimum copies.</p>
<p>The mention of the recommendations is a matter of fact, and I put that in because it is, in fact, true about the work and the stories that were recommended in it. It's only of the reasons I made to mention Darren Godfrey, Edmund Plante, and William Gagliani, all of whom had stories that got critical recognition thanks to their appearing in this book.</p>
<p>If you read that section as thoroughly as I did, you'd see that in the very first heading of explanation, it even says</p>
<p>"To clarify what's acceptable and what's not when promoting a work for the Stokers, HWA's Officers and Trustees have formulated the following guidelines."</p>
<p>I think you're missing the words "when promoting a work for the Stokers." It says nothing whatsoever anywhere in the etiquette about the mention of the work in perpetuity, in other contexts, with respect to its recommendation.</p>
<p>Wiki articles are meant to convey accuracy even if it's one that some people seem to find for some reason of their own undesirable to have recorded, and yes I have not written or edited many articles...for someone as familiar as you seem to be with policy, maybe you should also refresh the point about how it's not about how many articles one user has or hasn't contributed to.</p>
<p>I appreciate your argument, but I think it's based on popular misconception and not necesarily on any real desire to make sure that 'inaccuracies' are removed from Wiki. The article now has verification sources for its claims which should be sufficient to verify that it is accurate insofar as his work in book designs and publishing, only ONE credit of which is related to this POD/vanity debate at all.</p>
<p>John Kennedy Toole only wrote two books in his life, but the main one, "A Confederacy of Dunces," considered now a classic, even though it wasn't recognized until twenty years after he died. Would you like his entry removed because he didn't write more, or because his one book was only published because his mother solicited people to please publish it after he died? Or that we can't mention the Pulitzer it won because it's not Pulitzer committee etiquette to mention any such wins, nominations, or recommendations that the novel received?</p>
<p>Not to make a really absurd point, but nobody seems to mind Oprah's 'recommendation' being slapped onto the printing of a book cover today, and that's not even an award, it's just a celebrity thinking everybody should read a particular book.--Zeppelin85</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I wish that Zeppelin85 could figure out who exactly it is responding to (hint: I only wrote the parts I signed), and I think the comparison of Ron Horsley to John Kennedy Toole is a pretty lame argument. But I've made my vote and made my case, so I don't see much point in continuing to argue. --<a href="../../../k/y/n/User%7EKynn_59bb.html" title="User:Kynn">Kynn</a> 06:31, 24 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was answering all the points that had been brought up since last participating, Kynn, not just your own, sorry for your confusion. And I was not comparing the two men in terms of literary merit or influence. Once again, you're mixing up one aspect of the argument for another in order to not get the point. If you read my comments with respect to Toole, what I meant was to compare that the man is recognized for having literary and social significance even though his body of work was small and was only initially published at the urging of his mother after his death, not by his own promotional effort or a publisher being willing to undertake his work, but perhaps more from the motivation that his mother seemed to impress on those who later saw the book as viable. Even I'll agree that Horsley isn't Toole, please try to keep the idea of what's being specifically addressed straight.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And since you've made your case and stand by it, I think that's fine. As it stands, there are already votes sufficient to keep the article and sources cited to verify its claims, and all literary or Wiki issues regarding it meeting standards of non-vanity article are satisfied. I appreciate your effort to help keep Wiki truthful and accurate, but I think in this case the issue has been clarified enough. You might not agree that Mr. Horsley is worthy of note, but if that's the case then you and I could easily cooperate in clearing out a lot more articles that are currently uncontested on Wiki, and perhaps either way the standards will improve. --Zeppelin85</p>

If Wikipedia defines the difference between vanity and POD as stated above, then the vanity press article needs correction. The distinction between vanity and self-publication is not chicanery on the part of vanity presses (Vantage, for example, self-identifies as a vanity press and is honest about the fate of most of its titles), but on who owns the books once they are produced. If the author who has contracted with the printer owns the units, the author has self-published. If the "publisher" owns the books, and pays the author royalties based on sales, and offers the author an "author's discount" for purchasing units at a price above the costs of production, overhead, and the profit received as a printer, then the author has vanity published the book. This is the case with Infinitypublishing.com. The Midnighters Club is vanity published. It is the only book Horsley has produced. If individual short stories were sufficient for a wikipedia entry, there would be hundreds of thousands more of "authors" eligible for listing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>You make a solid point about differentiating the two types of press, however again I have to bring up that Wikipedia's own article still states that vanity presses can be considered legitimate forms of publishing for authors and writers who do not wish to go through the traditional and costly methods of publication/distribution. Also you state that a difference is whether or not the author receives payment or royalties. Mr. Horsley isn't the author, he's the editor of the piece. He chose the stories that went into the collection and made the arrangements for the publication they were to appear in. The funds sent to him, as I understand it, were then paid out as royalties due to the authors whenever copies were sold. If we're going solely by publisher definition, then it's still a fine line. If we're going on relationship from publisher to author, instead of just publisher to editor as middle-man in the relationship, then in this case the authors were paid royalties by the editor, via funds sent by the publisher to be so distributed. In the office I work in, such distinctions are fine but they're important in determining the definition of a given relationship. The original printing service may function to its direct author-contractors as a vanity press, but to the authors whose work was contributed to the majority of the book, it was a small-press publication via a POD relationship. Their work sells and they get royalties from the editor as the book is sold to a customer. Perhaps some clarification needs to be explored in the vanity press and POD articles, but it still seems like a strong difference to me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The main reason POD has so quickly become associated with vanity press is not just the mechanism of distribution being similar, but because vanity press by its frequent abuse is already a lumped-in category of scam-artists and bad product. The fact is, POD is still a relatively new method of taking advantage of electronic advances in publishing. It doesn't mean it's to be immediately and forever discounted. If that's the case, then we can go ahead and say that websites and the internet in total are completely ridiculous and not serious avenues of commerce (which we all agree is long-since established not to be the case). The internet, even eBay, has been used for scams and bad management. So to has POD and small-press publishing. But you don't autoamtically say that eBay is a fraud, or that every website that goes up to sell something is automatically something to be laughed off. The dot-coms were a tremendous, public failure, just as many bad POD's and vanity presses have failed. It doesn't mean we write off the whole concept or say that it's forever second-rate. A lot of physical book chains laughed off Amazon.com when it started, too.</p>
<p>And again...if you're going to say that short stories are somehow not valid publishing credentials...then you're going by a discrimination against a single form of art and still allowing numerous others. In terms of content, you can't argue it:H.G. Wells was known for many short stories and essays, not just novels. In terms of literary recognition, go to any school English class and open the text: most of the material printed for education purposes are short stories. In terms of length, you can't argue: poems, haikus, and "flash" fiction are all far shorter, and still recognized as valid even here on Wiki (we have articles for Edna St.Vincent Millay, Robert Browning, etc.).</p>
<p>In fact, in going through some of those same articles today in response to your comments, I found an interesting bit in Browning's Wiki article:</p>
<p>"In May 1833, Browning's Pauline: A Fragment of a Confession was published anonymously by Saunders and Otley, <b>in many ways a vanity publication financed by his family,</b> and this marked the beginning of his career as a poet. "</p>
<p>Just because we've got the hindsight of the future to say it's valid because it's Robert Browning, doesn't make the commentary of this definition of his very beginning work as a significant poet any less of merit with respect to your argument.</p>
<p>If Mr. Browning can have his first major publication as poet discounted under your standard, and if the rest of his work can be discounted because it's poetry and therefore physically of less length than the average short story...and if we go further with your logic that it's the notoriety of a given subject that warrants note (look in the same article; it says clearly that in his first several works Browning received little if any public response to his efforts), then every argument here suggests that we should consider discounting at least about half of Browning's work, so that it's in keeping with a Wiki ideal of not recognizing anything but lengthy works that sold a lot of copies and were only novels in nature, not any short genre fiction.</p>
<p>I think if you can appreciate it'd be silly to discount someone like Robert Browning, then it would be similarly silly to start making unwritten rules that short fiction can't be noted for an author's record or their merit to be recorded. And as for the idea that we'd have that many more short-fiction authors listed on Wiki....are we running out of room here, necessarily? I realize there are server and bandwidth limitations, but are we really in peril to Wiki being "too big" with reference information about any and all viable subjects? --Zeppelin85</p>
<p><br /></p>

<ul>
<li>Just for further reference on what we're debating here, you might want to look at these articles:</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Schickler_f523.html" title="David Schickler">David Schickler</a> <a href="../../../a/n/a/Ana_Castillo_7340.html" title="Ana Castillo">Ana Castillo</a> <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breece_D%27J_Pancake_89ce.html" title="Breece D'J Pancake">Breece D'J Pancake</a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Byers_6157.html" title="Michael Byers">Michael Byers</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_J._Schow_ec50.html" title="David J. Schow">David J. Schow</a> <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah_Cicero_6caf.html" title="Noah Cicero">Noah Cicero</a></p>
<p>All of these, by the way, were found specifically in the Wiki section for American short story writers. So we can't discriminate against an author for being noted as a short story author. Some of these authors are little-known, some of them are only known for very little bodies of work, some are known only by having written short stories, while still others have had publications that have appeared thanks to less-traditional methods of publication or "vanity" press systems, still others amongst this list were people who are noted for having received awards, scholarships, fellowships, etc., from highly specialized and not-widely-known sources.</p>
<p>All of them are being, I presume, uncontested entries here on Wiki as valid records of valid literary contributors of one stature or another. (I list David Schow because he is a prolific and highly-regarded author, but even he has had his work appear in small-press publishers such as Subterranean Press). And Noah Cicero is noted as having his work "extensively published on the Internet" as a majority of his cited writing credit.</p>
<p>I think Wiki's big enough to list a lot more writers, big small and of all types of genre of writing. If we're going to start policing it based on certain arbitrary measurements, then we're not saving its integrity. We'll just be cutting subjects out that have merit in being part of public record. --Zeppelin85</p>

<p>The result of the debate was delete. When looking at this and the previous AfD, there seems to be only the issue of when a neologism crosses then line. The comparison presented in the (combined) discussion is that to "metrosexual". If we compare the profiles of these words, it becomes apparent that there are several orders of magnitude between them, but more importantly it's easy to find metrosexual <i>in use</i> in multiple <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Determining the "notability" of a neologism directly by looking at how many people are using it on livejournal, as most of the evidence provided asks us to do, is borderline <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. We're thus left with the testimony of several editors and a single link to a review, a thin gruel with wich to feed the beast of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification requirements</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This word, while of recent online coinage has penetrated to the real world -- as can be attested to by I, and others who voted on the previous AfD, that first heard this word offline. As to online penetration, some 500 users on Livejournal list it in their interests, along with at a glance about 50 users on the popular dating site OKCupid and almost 150 members of the sapiosexual "tribe" on tribe.net. Obviously, a small but growing population of people is using this word, far beyond those connected to the original LiveJournal post.

<li><b>Keep</b> as per Todfox. Obviously it is more than just a "neologism created by a blogger"—the article has citations of its use by others. Making the reason more accurate by saying, "Neologism created by a blogger and adopted by others" would actually make an argument for keeping. Whether it's <i>non-notable</i> is debatable (and I come down on the "notable" side, clearly), but the original nominator's reason is inapplicable and so is insufficient reason to delete. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 23:25, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Note: I have just edited the article to place the concept as the subject of the first sentence, rather than the neologism. (I believe that an article whose title can refer to both a concept and a term should be about the <i>concept</i>, since mere terminology is less notable than actual real ideas.) Obviously the article needs more about the concept to balance all the information on the <i>term</i> as a neologism. (This is me making sure I'm up-front and not appearing to "sneak" the changes in during the AfD.) — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 23:41, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Agree with Saxifrage (who also just made some excellent improvements to the article we are voting on here). Blogs have reached the point where they affect politics and culture on a large scale, spreading memes, ideas, or philosophies and even creating new ones and breaking stories.

<dd>Considering that they are the primary sources for the topic, it's not really possible for them to fact-check anything.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, for several reasons: As <a href="../../../v/a/m/User%7EVampWillow_af3c.html" title="User:VampWillow">VampWillow</a> said, it's a word in current usage, and there shouldn't be second AFD that fast. For the origin, <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERock808_2034.html" title="User:Rock808">Rock808</a> pointed out in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sapiosexual_6141.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sapiosexual">first nomination</a>: <i>„Blogs ARE the new media. More paper news print will be replaced with news blogs and RSS. Just because you see something on a blog doesn't mean it should be discounted. The validity should be based on amount of use/acceptance.“</i> And with lacking a substitute for "sapiosexual" and its popularity rising, I think the article's relevance is not only given now, but will also increase in the near future. — <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShantris_Te%27Amdoraja_4973.html" title="User:Shantris Te'Amdoraja">Shantris Te'Amdoraja</a> 21:39, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The policy of verifiability is necessary because <i>„it is this fact-checking process that Wikipedia is not in a position to provide.“</i> However, the controversial subject is not whether the article is making unproven statements, but the relevance. And it is reasonable to measure the relevance by looking at the usage. Therefore it is not important if the word was coined in a blog or not, and it doesn’t matter if it is used in blogs or in real life, too. I cited User Rock808 because the reason for deletion (“Neologism created by a blogger”) reads as if the word would be something of minor value due to the origin. - <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShantris_Te%27Amdoraja_4973.html" title="User:Shantris Te'Amdoraja">Shantris Te'Amdoraja</a> 06:37, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>he top news Web sites--msnbc.com, cnn.com, nytimes.com, abcnews.com, usatoday.com--command from 3 million to 10 million visitors per month, according to Jupiter Media Metrix. Contrast that with New York-based OnlineTV Inc., one of the few independent sites that provided Webcast footage of the World Trade Center attack rather than TV news clips. OnlineTV, which usually offers entertainment fare, got only 334,000 hits that day, says CEO Rick Siegel. His company is barely making it on the $4.95 monthly fee its 31,000 registered users pay. Big media companies "will dominatethrough their ability to fund," says Siegel. "It's impossible to compete with them."</dd>

<p>To censor this page is a classic case of censoring honest debate. This is a huge issue of debate, that is growing every day, yet there is no public forum availabe in the mainstream. Should we delete and censor pages about border watch, or the war in Iraq?</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Censorship is different than POV. I cant help your lack of skills in google, or your laziness in following links. The best I can do is add the links to the awards, media coverage, etc. Since the "media" is part of the problems this movie exposes it is not impossible to get them to incriminate themselves. Instead people do it themselves. It has the awards in less than 3 months from when it was released. It has already been shown with Dr. Griffin presentations as well as shown in Salt Lake City Library, Utah for a huge public gathering and at Palatine High School for an assembly of students and parents. For a grass roots film it is moving like wildfire. April 10 Mr. Siegel goes on national radio on Coast to Coast, next week on Republic Radio. The documentary is massive. 911 Eyewitness does not need this as a webhost or platform. This entry is here because the 911 Eyewitness is real, it is here in this world, it is reality. As a piece of history that is gathering momentum, you would be wise to not be censoring it because you disagree with what it may show. The only thing such deletion will show is that Wikipedia is just *<a href="http://www.911eyewitness.com/truth/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=30" class="external text" title="http://www.911eyewitness.com/truth/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=30" rel="nofollow">Agents trying to remove 911 Eyewitness</a> because it exposes too much about the frauds.

<p>--If this issue were not important then there would not be this much debate. Obviously the firestorm over the content in Wikipdeia on this subject, at the very least, is enough to include this information as a growing portaion of our population are interested. The subject of 9/11 is ambiguous to some and set in stone to others so we must make our best effort to offer both sides of the story with the hope that a general concensus can be found. This, however, does not mean one will be found and since this site can be edited by its users we must make sure that each side is given the chance to present their own compilation of information while informing the readers of the nature of the information.</p>

<p>CENSORING A REAL 9/11 EYEWITNESS AND HIS HISTORIC FOOTAGE SHOWING CONTROLLED DEMOLITION AT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER is clearly against the design of Wikipedia as a historic information source.

This would put it on par with a lesser internet meme, which probably wouldn't be notable enough for inclusion. The snarky comments and sock/meatpuppet votes are also really annoying.

<li><b>Keep</b> (after severe cleanup). While I do see how this is a clear violation of advertising and other policies, there is some amount of information that should be included as part of Wikipedia, and if this is not enough for an article without the advertising junk then it should be merged with 9/11 conspirancies. IMHO comments such as <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a>'s above are not constructive... The issue is not whether or not this film is credible or, in your eyes, based on crackpot theories. The issue is whether or not this <i>article</i> merits inclusion on Wikipedia. If this many people care so strongly about its existance, then it probably deserves some kind of presence here. Someone mentioned <a href="../../../f/a/h/FahrenHype_9_11_c4fa.html" title="FahrenHype 9/11">FahrenHype 9/11</a> above. I think that article is appropriately formatted for Wikipedia, free of POV, and of an appropriate length considering its importance. We should do the same for this article, regardless of how its creator is behaving, because others who aren't behaving inappropriately agree that it should remain in some form. If you want to ban or censure the creator, do that, but there's no reason to take down an article that could potentially be cleaned up and provide information about a documentary that DOES exist.-- <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMac4drew_13fb.html" title="User:Mac4drew">Mac4drew</a> 04:45, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Or is there an Underlying reason why this specific item is under review where many other entries of documentaries are VERY Similar in presentation, IF this goes so should all other entries on documentaries under the rules which govern the whys of wiki as each and one of them would be violating the same rules that this supposedly does.

<dd>Since a lot of people are screaming about First Amendment rights in regard to this AFD, I thought I'd quote the First Amendment here:</dd>

<dd>Nowhere in this text does it say anything about Wikipedia, or what it can decide to keep or delete. For that matter, the First Amendment doesn't force newspapers, radio programs, or TV shows to publish everything that someone has to say. A newspaper editor or a TV program producer decides what's published based on standards of newsworthiness and noteworthiness. (And advertising popularity, unfortunately.) So why would the First Amendment application to Wikipedia be any different? --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_Esperanza_be6e.html" title="User:Elkman/Esperanza"><font color="green">E</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">lkman</a> - <sup><a href="../../../e/l/k/User_talk%7EElkman_bf81.html" title="User talk:Elkman">(talk)</a></sup> 18:48, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Quote from Wikipedia's page on Fasiscm: "Fascism is also typified by totalitarian attempts to impose state control over all aspects of life: political, social, cultural, and economic. The fascist state regulates and controls (as opposed to nationalizing) the means of production. Fascism exalts the nation, state, or race as superior to the individuals, institutions, or groups composing it. Fascism uses explicit populist rhetoric; calls for a heroic mass effort to restore past greatness; and demands loyalty to a single leader, often to the point of a cult of personality."</p>
<p>Quote from Wikipedia's page on Propaganda: "Propaganda is a specific type of message presentation directly aimed at influencing the opinions of people, rather than impartially providing information. In some cultures the term is neutral or even positive, while in others the term has acquired a strong negative connotation. Its connotations can also vary over time. For instance, in English, "propaganda" was originally a neutral term used to describe the dissemination of information in favor of a certain cause. Over time, however, the term acquired the negative connotation of disseminating false or misleading information in favor of a certain cause. Strictly speaking, a message does not have to be untrue to qualify as propaganda, but it may omit so many pertinent truths that it becomes highly misleading."</p>

<p>Wikipedia is an international site; the constitution of any single country does not apply here.
