<li><b>comment</b> He was not deleted i think you mean expelled on <i>reasonable grounds</i> being expelled for being gay is not reasonable its ignorant and prejudiced, he was expelled from a high school not a college and whether people get expelled for not being home on time is irrelevant, he meets the requirements for notability and the fact that his webpage's article may likely be deleted is irrelevant, it may not be notable, but he is.
<ul>
<li>As I se in the article he was expelled not for <b>being gay</b>, which is his private life, but for "immoral behavior and supporting an immoral cause [through his website]", i.e., for making it public <b>it a private schhol</b> which has all rights to set and execute their policies as they wish. The whole fuss is biased representation of the case. The guy violated rules or traditions or whatever. Period. Not big deal. Not national tragedy as some want to represent. Not nearly close to French forbidding Muslim girls wearing headscarf in public schools. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 16:42, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't know what country you live in, but in America private schools do <b>NOT</b> have the right to set any polycy they wish. Whether or not its a national tragedy is irrelevant, so is the veil issue, which is a good thing in my view, the matter of fact is that he is notable per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>:</li>

<dd>and FYI immoral behavior was used as a euphanism for being gay, furthermore read the articles, he never made it public, the school made it public after a nosey student informed them without his consent, and then to top it off the school told his conservative parents, which then put the poor boy on lockdown and nearly kicked him out since he lives in an oppressive conservative town.Cholga 17:31, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> I sympathize with the student, but this is one incident of which there must be hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions in recent history. If this incident led to a new law, or a new encyclopedically notable organization, or became iconic in the history of gay rights struggles or had some other wider lasting substantive societal effect, that would be encyclopedically notable. There is not indication of this happening so far, as far as I can tell. And for the umpteenth time, media coverage - yes, even if it's Larry King Live or the New York Times - is <i>not</i> in itself an sufficient condition for article retention.

<li><b>Don't delete</b> per newsworthiness. However my prefered solution would be a merge or a move that would put this content in the proper context. In particular I'd argue that while the individual is himself of little interest, his case is. What do we expect a biography entry to become ideally? Certainly not a 10 line text like this one is doomed to remain. Who cares when this guy was born, who cares where he works. The article is not about the individual, it's about the incident. Why not merge, for instance, as a section of <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_Christian_Academy_db6f.html" title="Trinity Christian Academy">Trinity Christian Academy</a>? I think this would make Wikipedia better as a whole since the content would not be lost, you'd still have a redirect if anyone looks for or links to James Barnett and the whole thing would be in proper context. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 02:17, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>It seems to be picked up purely by the gay media as an example of anti-gay discrimination/victimisation.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think the fact that it was picked up by <u>the media</u> is relevant, and it is not relevant that it was or was not the gay press - a term which appears to me to be pejorative in this context. It was a news item about a homosexual young man and thus likely to be picked up more by gay than str8 press. (If he were a yachtsman doing boaty things he would only have been picked up by the yachting press). I think we have to look very much at the principle, here, not the individual. I don't care about the individual or the story, except to feel sorry for him. I'd never heard of him before thsi AfD, and I never expect to hear of him again. But I interpret <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> to say that he is notable. This means that, whether any of us have actually heard of the kid, or the incident, his 15 minutes of fame qualify him for a place here. We have the space, and he qualifies for it. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 07:22, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> yes it is! And its not special interest websites dude, thats homophobic at best. With your logic ESPN has a special interest too, Gay.com and the PlanetOut network are mainstream press as much as Reuters and the Associated Press are, its what YahooNews! uses for all their gay stories. He has also been brough up by the Point Foundation and Human Rights Campaign.

<li>Please, Cholga, let us not turn this into a homophobia argument/discussion, and please reflect that your message borders on infringing <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civility</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> because of its directness. Correcting <a href="../../../h/a/a/User%7EHaakon_f760.html" title="User:Haakon">Haakon</a>'s (or anyone's) statements where you think they are incorrect with care and restrained depersonalised words is important here. We need to look at the <u>article</u> and the notability within Wikipedia's guidelines. Certainly the websites you mention are themselves notable media, and naturallythe story's media appeal is in the gay media rather than global media. And I agree with you that notable media stories about Barnett make him notable. He is of limited interest, and he may never rais ehis head above any parapet again, but his 15 minutes of fame merits a freestanding, albeit brief, article. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 17:54, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
