<dd><b>Comment</b> I think most people agree that the claims from this group (Cornish political prisoners, occupying forces in Wales etc) are farcical, however if these are the views of the group then it <i>is</i> acceptable to report them, but this should be done in a neutral style, which this article does not (i.e statistics for murders in Cornwall by loyalist death squads (0) with a reference) Any intelligent person reading it can then make up their own mind what type of group this is. <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMammal4_a688.html" title="User:Mammal4">Mammal4</a> 08:28, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just because we have thousands of other small, non-notable clubs and societies with articles doesn't mean they pass notability; nor does their existence mean that the Celtic Alliance of America passes notability.

</li>
<li><s><b>Neutral</b>.</s> I certainly can't think of a reason why Wikipedia should have this article; the group's non-notable and may well have begun this article to increase its visibility and Google hit count. On the other hand, I don't see that we gain much by deleting it. As long as the article's written so as to be NPOV, it seems harmless to me. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuartierLatin1968_0d61.html" title="User:QuartierLatin1968">Q·L·</a><i><a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuartierLatin1968_3a4e.html" title="User talk:QuartierLatin1968">1968</a></i> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_QuartierLatin1968_1419.html" title="Special:Contributions/QuartierLatin1968">☿</a> 17:43, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The reason we shouldn't have it is that this encyclopedia has notability guidelines. If the article fails notability, as you agree, then why shouldn't it be deleted?

<dd>Mmmyes... Okay, the CAA is (as far as anyone can verify) a website and a discussion forum with a few dozen members. So it falls within the ambit of our <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">notability guideline for web content</a>, none of whose criteria the CAA meets (as far as I can tell).

<li><b>Keep</b> The terminology used by the Celtic Alliance of America might be expressed somewhat in strong terms but essentially Cornwall is in effect a National Minority held as a subdued nation by the UK government. For those interested in respect of Cornwall a case has been presented to the European Court of Human Rights by members of the Cornish Stannary Parliament in respect of alleged violations of the European Convention of Human Rights and on the April, 13 2006 the Court acknowledged receipt thereof.Jowan99 13:26, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Thats all well and good and I don't necessarily disagree with your sentiment, but the article does not talk about Cornwall as a subdued national minority, but uses phrases such as "loyalist death squads" and "political prisoners" with respect to Cornwall. Where are these political prisoners? I also don't remember any loyalist death squads when I was growing up, although Penzance can resemble a war torn state on a Saturday night&#160;;) <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMammal4_a688.html" title="User:Mammal4">Mammal4</a> 15:07, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have visited the site in question and do not read the points you raise as you quote them, or specifically applying to Cornwall, but only if such a case were to exist that the CAA would highlight such actions. The ongoing contention over Cornwall within these pages does point to something being seriously wrong and depending upon which side of the fence one sits as to whether this is seen as pure evil [my position] or a nonsence [the Imperial view] -- TGG 16:37, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><i>"The CAA state that they are against "loyalist death squads", "racist neo-nazi groups", and what they refer to as "occupying British and French forces within Ireland, Scotland, Cornwall, Brittany, and Wales"</i> quoted from the article itself but also simmilar wording on the website - I can't really see how this can be read any other way. If what you say is true then its just the wording that is wrong and not the sentiment.<a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMammal4_a688.html" title="User:Mammal4">Mammal4</a> 06:48, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> It presents another external view that potentially brings the iniquitous position of our Cornish Duchy into focus for the Cornish worldwide and anyone else genuinely interested in our Rights. The fact that Cornwall <b>is</b> included represents just another facet of what Philip Payton sub-titles his book "The making of modern Cornwall" as, Historical Experience and the Persistence of "Difference". It seems that the page needs to be rewritten to remove the cut &amp; paste feel and, possibly, the organisation needs to be approached on that basis? -- TGG 16:37, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So, do you think that it is notable, or do you just like the group's point of view? I can't tell from your comment. Could you clarify? <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon9288</a> 18:30, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I feel, personally, that the notable aspect rests in its particular focus of a <b>Celtic Alliance</b> at a time when we are being actively 'encouraged' to believe that the Celts are a myth! It is however, possibly, too early to judge whether or not it may achieve notability through successful activity -- TGG 19:51, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>An even bigger problem than notability is verifiability. There is no source for the existence of this group other than its own website, and a few posts on web forums and bulletin boards. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 20:30, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Precisely. But notability ties right in with that fact; if it isn't known beyond its own website and a few web forums, how can it possibly be notable enough for an encyclopedia article?

<dd><b>Comment</b>: If an organization creates an article about itself on Wikipedia, and if the Wikipedia article is copied onto the many mirrors and spin-offs that use Wikipedia's content, then the organization's visibility and Google search ranking will rise. It's giving those organizations an unfair advantage, and frankly advertising isn't what Wikipedia is for. I'm not saying that's what's happened here, because I don't know for certain; but it wouldn't surprise me that the CAA has gained a higher profile since this article's been on WP. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuartierLatin1968_0d61.html" title="User:QuartierLatin1968">Q·L·</a><i><a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuartierLatin1968_3a4e.html" title="User talk:QuartierLatin1968">1968</a></i> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_QuartierLatin1968_1419.html" title="Special:Contributions/QuartierLatin1968">☿</a> 23:47, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
