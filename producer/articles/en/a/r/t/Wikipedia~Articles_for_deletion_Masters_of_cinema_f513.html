<li><b>Keep.</b> A site doesn't have to be popular to be important (and the converse is true: popularity does not necessarily mean a site is important). Masters of cinema is well known within the cross-section of two groups: (1) film aficionados and scholars and (2) the web-savvy. Try googling on it and clicking on various links amongst the results. In addition, they now have a series of DVDs that they collaborate on with Eureka (an indiciation of how seriously their site is taken), which, while not exactly rivalling <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Criterion_Collection_4163.html" title="The Criterion Collection">The Criterion Collection</a> in popularity, do rival them in how seriously they are taken amongs collectors of both obscure and canonical artefacts of cinematic history. <a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJun-Dai_fdd3.html" title="User:Jun-Dai">Jun-Dai</a> 15:47, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment:</b> While that is an impressively sized list of links, when looking for <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to build an article from it is necessary to locate sources that talk about the article subject instead of merely provide a mention of the subject. Source statements such as "<a href="http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/sources.html" class="external text" title="http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/sources.html" rel="nofollow">Seminal site devoted to world cinema on DVD"</a>, "<a href="http://www.barnard.columbia.edu/library/guides/film.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.barnard.columbia.edu/library/guides/film.htm" rel="nofollow">focuses on - but not limited to - the world's major directors</a>", "<a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/innis/library/cinemaother.html" class="external text" title="http://www.utoronto.ca/innis/library/cinemaother.html" rel="nofollow">A non-academic site with some excellent links, in particular to information about directors</a>", or being listed among a group of <a href="http://apps.carleton.edu/curricular/cams/resources/research/" class="external text" title="http://apps.carleton.edu/curricular/cams/resources/research/" rel="nofollow">favorite blogs</a> do not typically provide the type of information needed to build an encyclopedic article.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> However, the whole point is that MoC is <i>not</i> merely an "impressive sized list of links". Look in the top right hand corner of the <a href="http://www.mastersofcinema.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.mastersofcinema.org/" rel="nofollow">MoC site</a>. They have (in addition to their own <i>cinephile</i> DVD Series) four distinctive branch sites (painstakingly crafted over the last 8 years by the MoC creators themselves) all of which contain unique (i.e., not found anywhere else — where else can you find a decent photo of the reclusive <a href="http://www.nostalghia.com/ThePhotos/T20.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.nostalghia.com/ThePhotos/T20.jpg" rel="nofollow">Chris Marker</a>?) content. The four sites are well-known to cinephiles world-wide: <a href="http://www.nostalghia.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.nostalghia.com/" rel="nofollow">The MoC Tarkovsky Site</a>, <a href="http://www.mastersofcinema.org/bresson/" class="external text" title="http://www.mastersofcinema.org/bresson/" rel="nofollow">The MoC Bresson Site</a>, <a href="http://www.ozuyasujiro.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.ozuyasujiro.com/" rel="nofollow">The MoC Ozu Site</a>, and the <a href="http://www.carldreyer.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.carldreyer.com/" rel="nofollow">MoC Dreyer Site</a>. These all have original content written by, among others, family and close friends of these four filmmakers, and they consistitute an invaluable resource to researchers (i.e., users of wikipedia). I think most of the drive-by shootings in this debate (does not apply to author Allen3) stem from a lack of (or a mere cursory) understanding of the whole MoC concept. The MoC Wikipedia page will obviously need to clarify things better, once it becomes a proper stub.--Stalker63 03:14, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>KEEP.</b> This is one of the most valuable sources for cinema on the web. It offers not only intelligent, thoughtful analysis of great directors (such as Tarkovsky, Dreyer, Ozu, and Bresson), but also is a invaluable source of DVD information. This site talks about discs from all around the globe, not just releases in North America. As cited before, Bright Lights Film Journal and the Chicago Reader have linked this website because of its very well researched information. I really don't understand why this website is scheduled for deletion. It's a real website that has been in existence for years, dedicated to those who take film/cinema seriously. I think that Wikipedia can save itself a lot of time by leaving this page alone, when there are much more egregious violations out there. I was at a comedy club recently, and a comic told a story about how he created his own page here (which, Wikipedia decided to delete). The Masters of Cinema website contributes a great deal to the world of film. If people really wish for things to delete, perhaps they should delete people like <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Hung_60a2.html" title="William Hung">William Hung</a>, the godawful <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Idol_ef58.html" title="American Idol">American Idol</a> contestant who has no artistic value whatsoever, and has made no contribution to society at all. Or delete <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian__Kato__Kaelin_80c6.html" title="Brian &quot;Kato&quot; Kaelin">Brian "Kato" Kaelin</a>, <a href="../../../o/2E/j/O.J._Simpson_76f9.html" title="O.J.

<li><b>KEEP.</b> This site has, over the years, been an integral part of my own education in art cinema. The Masters of Cinema (MoC) section on <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrei_Tarkovsky_8361.html" title="Andrei Tarkovsky">Andrei Tarkovsky</a> <a href="http://www.nostalghia.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nostalghia.com" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> is second to none and has been acknowledged in the foreword (or acknowledgment sections) of every recent scholarly work on Andrei Tarkovsky, just two examples being Robert Bird's excellent <i>Andrei Rublev</i> (British Film Institute, 2005 <a href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/booksvideo/books/catalogue/details.php?bookid=500" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bfi.org.uk/booksvideo/books/catalogue/details.php?bookid=500" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>), and Sean Martin's <i>Andrei Tarkovsky</i> (Pocket Essentials, 2006 <a href="http://www.pocketessentials.co.uk/film/1904048498andreitarkovsky/index.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pocketessentials.co.uk/film/1904048498andreitarkovsky/index.php" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>). Chicago Sun-Times resident film critic <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Ebert_1ae7.html" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> (of <i>Siskel &amp; Ebert</i> fame) has also provided fascinating input especially written for this MoC site (see their Topics' section). The Masters of Cinema main site as well as their "micro-sites" ("micro" being somewhat of a misnomer) on Ozu, Dreyer, Tarkovsky, and Bresson are prominently featured in the latest edition of the acclaimed <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Out_dcb6.html" title="Time Out">Time Out</a> Film Guide: They write: <i>What <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Criterion_Collection_4163.html" title="The Criterion Collection">The Criterion Collection</a> is to DVD Publishing, Masters of Cinema is to online DVD coverage</i> (this was written just before MoC got into DVD publishing as well).

Surely there are better things you people could be doing than going around and trying to get every article under some arbitrary alexa rating deleted?

<dd>Well, it seems to me that the citations listed above and below already qualify it under those criteria. At the very least, nobody has really tried to counter them. Given that everyone seems to be ignoring them, I wonder what the point in continuing further is? In any case, given that we have at least four distinct people supporting the article's continuing existence, what happens next? Do we delete it because we could fail to build a consensus for keeping it, or do we keep it because the <s>delete-happy</s> users <b>in favor of deleting</b> failed to drum up enough support against the article? I've never involved myself this much in the deletion process, so I'm curious to see where it goes. <a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJun-Dai_fdd3.html" title="User:Jun-Dai">Jun-Dai</a> 00:11, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>, for sake of clarity, let me just state I'm not an administrator here or anything and I'm merely stating my own opinion. If you are refering to the list of links Msbailey provided, <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllen3_f7ae.html" title="User:Allen3">Allen3</a> basically answered why that does not meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. The first criteria of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> states <i>"the content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself."</i> a link to a site, or including the site in a list of seminal sites does not meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Stalker63 also provided some links, but these were largely either links to sections of the Masters of Cinema site, or were external links to articles where Masters of Cinema were mentioned in passing, but the articles were not about Masters of Cinema. There has also been a claim made that MoC meets <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, but again meeting <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> requires <i>"multiple non-trivial published works</i>" and I only see one external cite provided that has non-trivial coverage of one of their products. Where this goes from here depends on the closing admin. This is not a numerical vote, so the closing admin has to decide if there is consensus to keep, delete, or no consensus either way (no consensus defaults to keep). Generally, newly registered users and those who render opinions from IPs without creating a user have their opinions weighed less unless they make an actual argument based on the accepted guidelines and policies at Wikipedia. Basically, the admin is looking for a consensus, though I've seen cases where numerically the consensus was split, but the result was either outright keep or delete because one side did not make a compelling argument. Usually the whole process takes roughly 5 days from nomination. Hope that clears it up. Also <a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJun-Dai_fdd3.html" title="User:Jun-Dai">Jun-Dai</a>, please read <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. Calling Wikipedia editors who disagree with your position "delete-happy users" doesn't really add much to the debate on the content and, speaking personally, doesn't really entice me to continue take the time to try and explain the process to those unfamiliar with it...--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 12:28, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Keep.</b></s> Thank you, Isotope23, that does help. If one looks at MoC as a DVD label (not just as a website), one will see that they are, in fact, highly notable.

<li><b>Apology</b> - I forgot in my haste to click the "sign it" button on my last entry, as I was responding directly to a response to my already signed entry. I was not aware that there is a limit of one "keep" per person. If "this is not a vote" (as stated in the box at the top), why was my "keep" overstricken, as if it was a vote? I believe, personally, that the <i>discussion itself</i> has established that there is no justifiable reason to delete the page from the encyclopaedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>, It's a courtesy consideration.

<li><b>KEEP</b> Agreed with Stalker63. Looking at all the comments on this page, it strikes me how sad it is that the Wiki-ites cannot <i>quickly</i> see the worth of both the Masters of Cinema Series of DVDs and this entry at Wikipedia from the information provided.

<li><b>Comment</b>, saying there are other DVD labels that justify inclusion of this one is a straw-man argument. Those DVD labels either meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> criteria, or they too should be nominated for deletion. The presence of articles about similar items or entities does not condone inclusion of a specific item or entity. Each article has to stand on it's own, meet accepted policies, and be subject to accepted guidelines. The question isn't whether or not "Masters of Cinema" has "worth"; it is whether or not it meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. There are tons of websites out there that to me personally (and a like-minded group of enthusiasts) have an immense amount of worth... but if I saw an article written about them on Wikipedia, I would sadly have to opine deletion becuase they cannot be proven to meet Wikipedia's accepted guidelines for having an article about the topic.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 12:56, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

The site's growing library of recent articles on international cinema is evident on the right side of the home page; there are links to articles and a list of more than 100 directors also included with links to at least a biographical essay and, at most, a Web site devoted to that director. This section also offers useful links to dealers in everything from DVDs and video to film posters; critical reviews; online writing support for budding screenwriters; and film publications. The particular appeal of this site is its commitment to world cinema-there is a good balance of international film and US movies, with overall emphasis on the achievements of the filmmakers and the films themselves.

<p><b>KEEP</b> I WOULD vote with my feet to keep this site. It is non-commercial in nature, maintained by the devotees of the Art known as Cinema and thus belongs to the general treasure of knowledge, rightfully here in wikipedia. I personally have seen entries in this encyclopedia with infinitely less content and shallow essence, so why the heck not a professional site (one of its kind) entirely devoted to the true masters of Cinema? IMO it would be a big loss to Wikipedia if you delete this article. Please consider keeping it. Thank u in advance.Eenspaaier 02:33, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
