<li><b>Keep</b> - Notability is in the eye of the beholder - there are thousands of articles about places many have never heard of. Furthermore, as for sources, give it a week and it should pick up. Even so, if not having sources in an article automatically meant deletion, half of the articles today would be gone in a heartbeat, even "notable" ones. Hit the random article button a few times, and you'll see what I mean. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Jay_e6f4.html" title="User:Master Jay"><font style="background:black"><b><font color="white">Jay</font></b></font></a><b><font style="background:gold">(<a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Jay_a66f.html" title="User talk:Master Jay">Reply</a>)</font></b> 20:51, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't mean to sound over-the-top here, but someone has taken the time to write this article, fairly well I must say, and the deletionist attitude being presented here is not justified by naming guidelines all over the alphabet. I don't see the harm in leaving the article on Wikipedia. There are stubs that don't even approach the detail of this article, and yet they are left alone, with no calls to delete them. Yes, there are lines that must be <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">upheld</a>, however, this article is well within bounds. Furthermore, this article is not on a controversial issue, and to put it under the same scrutiny as a more controversial article is ludicrous. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Jay_e6f4.html" title="User:Master Jay"><font style="background:black"><b><font color="white">Jay</font></b></font></a><b><font style="background:gold">(<a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Jay_a66f.html" title="User talk:Master Jay">Reply</a>)</font></b> 23:18, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Now, Jay, you're an <i>admin</i>, you know this just isn't true. Lots of long articles about school, churches, etc. that aren't controversial, get deleted all the time, on exactly the basis I brought up. I also would really rather not see <i>this</i> AfD get run up the flagpole when someone else wants to keep an article that can't pass the notability criteria. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 23:42, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I would like to draw attention to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Category%7ECity_and_Gospel_Rescue_Missions_b96d.html" title="Category:City and Gospel Rescue Missions">this category</a>, which highlights several articles on the same topic. You are not suggesting that we go ahead and delete those to, are you? --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Jay_e6f4.html" title="User:Master Jay"><font style="background:black"><b><font color="white">Jay</font></b></font></a><b><font style="background:gold">(<a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Jay_a66f.html" title="User talk:Master Jay">Reply</a>)</font></b> 23:31, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I take it you've read <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a>? Also, that's like 12 rescue missions out of , what, <i>thousands</i>? (BTW, <a href="http://www.pgm.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.pgm.org/" rel="nofollow">Pacific Garden Mission</a> probably ought to have an article, coming up with at least a dozen media cites for that should be a snap). "Keep it, it doesn't hurt anything" - I'll try to maintain civility here, and not comment other than to say that argument gets ignored about a dozen times a day. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 00:57, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Here's one for you: <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>. Rescue mission out of a thousand you say? Big deal, I wouldn't mind having an article on every one. As for the Pacific Garden Mission, make an article for itâ€”no one is stopping you; the "this topic doesn't have an article" argument is probably just as ignored. Has it ever occurred to you that WP has grown to 1.5+M articles because small topics (such as this) have articles written about them? I'll also try to maintain civility here by simply saying perhaps you could use a break from AfD. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Jay_e6f4.html" title="User:Master Jay"><font style="background:black"><b><font color="white">Jay</font></b></font></a><b><font style="background:gold">(<a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Jay_a66f.html" title="User talk:Master Jay">Reply</a>)</font></b> 04:00, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Here's one for you, sound familiar? <i>For clarification, I won't generally break any rules. If a job needs to get done, there is a way it can be done without breaking the rules, if it is a legit job.</i> I don't see any extraordinary circumstances here demanding IAR, if there are any, what are they? AAMOF, I think PGM does deserve an article, although I'm not much on writing articles on religous stuff, if no one beats me to it, I will do it at some point (after all, it's in Chicago) I just happened to mention PGM tangentially as something that needs an article, not as an argument for or against deletion of this one. <i>You</i> might like an article on every rescue mission in the country, but at this point, the notability guidelines don't support that, and (Jesus, tautology) as I pointed out before, similar non-notable religious organizations are getting zapped - sometimes <i>en masse</i> - now you want to suggest that a whole <i>series</i> of articles on <i>rescue missions</i> would be apropo for WP? Yeah, I could use a break from AfD's.. OTOH, God made many different kinds of Wikipedians, some like discussing AfD's, others want to create in-depth Pokemon articles. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 07:30, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"I will do it..." is the same good intention that the new user had when writing this article; unfortunately, they had to get a taste of the good ol' wikiprocess. All I will say is that no one is stopping you from creating any article; <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">go ahead</a> (hopefully you won't find yourself here&#160;;). As for my mentioning of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">IAR</a>, it was to illustrate a point that any essay, guideline, etc. that can be brought up as "case law" in this matter can easily be contradicted by another policy or guideline (and I really don't see what you're trying to get at by quoting my RfA - <i>administrator rules</i> are very different from <i>article guidelines</i>â€”the subject of this debate.) I am deeply concerned that you have made this debate a personal matter. If you would like to discuss any more ideologies etc, there is more than enough room on my <a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Jay_a66f.html" title="User talk:Master Jay">talk page</a>.

<li>Have you <i>looked</i> at the article recently?

<ul>
<li>You said that there were no sources, and well, look, there are. There is still time to re-adjust your position. I imagine that if you came across the article, you wouldn't have taken the time to go through all this wiki-process to have it deleted. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Jay_e6f4.html" title="User:Master Jay"><font style="background:black"><b><font color="white">Jay</font></b></font></a><b><font style="background:gold">(<a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Jay_a66f.html" title="User talk:Master Jay">Reply</a>)</font></b> 23:34, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would have. But are you suggesting that "not worth the process" is a reason to <i>keep</i>? -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 23:51, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Remember now, the process can yield two different results. What I meant by my comment was that this isn't the grand-slam delete case, like most of the articles listed here. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Jay_e6f4.html" title="User:Master Jay"><font style="background:black"><b><font color="white">Jay</font></b></font></a><b><font style="background:gold">(<a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Jay_a66f.html" title="User talk:Master Jay">Reply</a>)</font></b> 00:05, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually, it's pretty close to a slam-dunk speedy, very little notability is being asserted. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 00:57, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Articles" title="WP:CSD">CSD A7</a>; not even close. You are mistaking <i>notability</i> for <i>popularity</i> - two different things. If this article were to say simply, "LMR gives food to the homeless", I would have speedied it when I originally came across it. However, the article clearly mentions how LMR is involved with <a href="../../../l/i/m/Lima%2C_Ohio_59f5.html" title="Lima, Ohio">Lima, Ohio</a>, and furthermore, how it is apart of the global city mission movementâ€”that is what makes it notable. The fact that it has never been on CNN or that it doesn't have 500,000 search engine results (indicative of <i>popularity</i>) does not mean that the subject is not notable. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Jay_e6f4.html" title="User:Master Jay"><font style="background:black"><b><font color="white">Jay</font></b></font></a><b><font style="background:gold">(<a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Jay_a66f.html" title="User talk:Master Jay">Reply</a>)</font></b> 04:15, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The notability guidelines are pretty clear. The subject of <i>this</i> article doesn't even assert a claim to meeting even one of them. If it <i>did</i>, I'm sure you'd have brought it up by now. So tagged. 07:30, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The sub-argument here is on whether or not the article should have been removed per CSDâ€”it shouldn't have, and this was addressed in my previous comment (further upheld by LS). You have solid points on everything else in this debate (which ironically is much longer than the article in question), however, your CSD claim should be put to rest. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Jay_e6f4.html" title="User:Master Jay"><font style="background:black"><b><font color="white">Jay</font></b></font></a><b><font style="background:gold">(<a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Jay_a66f.html" title="User talk:Master Jay">Reply</a>)</font></b> 15:59, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Why do you have such an issue with <i>this</i> article? After you tagged you noted "No notability asserted, just another rescue mission". Why don't you go tag other rescue mission articles then? Some of them don't even list any references at all, and they all contain similar information to this article. So why aren't those being disputed? 208.10.0.114 08:36, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Some may find that information to be notable, while I am sure others will still take issue. Aaron01 03:38, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's too large to merge, and per <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a>, "Eventually, as the article becomes overly large due to more verifiable information being added, information on individual places can be broken out into individual articles. This process should begin with those places which have the most verifiable information on them, and therefore have the strongest case for a stand-alone article. See below for suggestions on how to do this." This justifies the existence of this article. --<a href="../../../r/o/r/User_talk%7ERory096_912b.html" title="User talk:Rory096">Rory096</a> 00:54, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> Any organization that's existed for 100 years gets a sort of "special attention," from me. We can obviously verify that this group exists, and that it has had an impact on its community. I see here that the AfD regulars seem to be leaning to delete -- I can sort've see both sides of the picture, personally, but I do worry that sometimes we get too "jaded" (after deleting 100 articles under prod, I know I get a bit deletionist). A7 certainly wouldn't be appropriate, for this one, and even AfD, I'm not so sure. I notice this one hasn't been closed, yet -- it's a <i>very</i> close call to make, and I'd encourage the closing admin to think it over carefully. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 01:10, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
