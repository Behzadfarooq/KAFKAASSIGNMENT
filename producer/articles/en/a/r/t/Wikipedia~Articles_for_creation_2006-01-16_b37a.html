<p>Suriname is a multi religous and multi ethnic country in South America. Islam first appeared in the Caribbean nations by African slaves brought by Europeans but unfortunately were wiped out. The next set of Muslims came as Indentured Labourers in the 1800's when slavery was ablolished. These labourers mainly came from South Asia and Indonesia with few coming from Portugal and China.</p>
<p>Muslims form a quarter the population of Suriname, the highest percentage per country in the whole western hemisphere. They are mostly Sunnis consisting of Indian and Javanese decent. There are hundreds of Mosques in Suriname.</p>
<p>There are some Ahmadiyyas in Suriname but they are not considered Muslim.</p>

<p>This song appears in the musical once Christina awakes. She sings of her memory of what has happened and then she unmasks the Phantom. The lyrics for I Remember are as follows: I remember there was mist, swirling mist upon a vast glossy lake, there were candles all around, and on the lake there was a boat, and in the boat there was a man. Who was that shape in the shadows? Who's was that face in the mask?</p>

<p>An-Nafi' was a great scholar among the first generation of Muslims who came after the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Companions_of_the_Prophet_1990.html" title="Companions of the Prophet">Companions of the Prophet</a> (saw). An-Nafi' was the freed servant of <a href="../../../27/a/b/%27Abdullah_Ibn_%27Umar_c5f2.html" title="'Abdullah Ibn 'Umar">'Abdullah Ibn 'Umar</a>. He served 'Abdullah Ibn 'Umar for thirty years.</p>
<p>The style of recitation or qiraa'ah which an-Nafi' transmitted, is considered by many scholars to be the best example of the recitation of the Qur'an. An-Nafi' recited to seventy of the taabi'een, the most notable being Abu Ja'far Al-Qa'qaa'.</p>
<p>The recitation of an-Nafi' is divided into two branches - the first branch is known as Qaloon. This is named after an-Nafi's student 'Eesaa bin Meenaa, who was nicknamed 'Qaloon' by an-Nafi' himself because of Qaloon's pleasant and smooth recitation. The word 'qaloon' means 'good' or 'pleasant'.</p>
<p>The second branch of an-Nafi' is known as <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsh.html" title="Warsh">Warsh</a>. This is named after another of an-Nafi's students, Abu Sa'eed 'Uthmaan bin Sa'eed Al-Misree. Qaloon nicknamed him 'Warsh' because of his strong white color.</p>
<p>As well as learning <i>ahadith</i> from Ibn 'Umar, he also learned <i>ahadith</i> from 'Aa'ishah, <a href="../../../u/m/m/Umm_Salamah_52eb.html" title="Umm Salamah">Umm Salamah</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Hurairah_d38f.html" title="Abu Hurairah">Abu Hurairah</a> and Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri. Among his students were <a href="../../../i/m/a/Imam_Malik_4410.html" title="Imam Malik">Imam Malik</a>, <a href="../../../a/z/-/Az-Zuhri_6d94.html" title="Az-Zuhri">az-Zuhri</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Awza%27i_9f6b.html" title="Al-Awza'i">al-Awza'i</a>, Ayyub Sikhtiani and <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Jarir_5007.html" title="Ibn Jarir">Ibn Jarir</a>. Imam Malik was so proud of his teacher that he used to say that whenever he heard an-Nafi' narrate a <i>hadith</i> on the authority of Ibn 'Umar, he never bothered to verify it with anyone else. The chain of narration of Imam Malik from an-Nafi', as passed on by Ibn 'Umar, is so strong that it is famously known as 'The Golden Chain'.</p>

The Chestnut-Fronted or Severe Macaw (Ara Severa) is one of the largest of the mini-macaws. It reaches a size of around 45 centimetres (18 inches) of which around half is the length of the tail. This is the only mini-macaw to have feathers on the bare patches on its face which makes it look like the larger macaws.</p>
<p>The Severe Macaw is mostly green in colour with patches of red and blue on the wings. The head has a Chestnut brown patch just above the beak. The beak is black and the patches around the eyes are white with lines of small black feathers.</p>
<p>They can be found over a large part of Northern South America from Panama south into Brazil.</p>
<p>Their lifespan is listed as anything from 30 to 80 years of age.</p>
<p>Like most other Parrots Severe Macaws can be "nippy" or "beaky". This should not be encouraged. They can learn to speak and will readily learn a reasonable vocabulary.</p>

The Mile Road System, and its most famous road, 8 Mile Road, came about largely as a result of the Land Ordinance of 1785, which established basis for the Public Land Survey System in which land throughout the Northwest Territory was surveyed and divided into survey townships by reference to a baseline (east-west line) and meridian (north-south line). In Southeast Michigan, many roads would be developed parallel to the base line and the meridian, and many of the east-west roads would be incorporated into the Mile Road System.</p>
<p>The Mile Road System extended easterly into Detroit, but is interrupted, because much of Detroit's early settlements and farms were based on early French land grants that were aligned with frontage along the Detroit River and on later development along roads running into downtown Detroit in a star pattern, such as Woodward , Jefferson, Grand River , Gratiot, and Michigan Avenues. As Detroit grew, several Mile Roads were given new names within the city borders, while some roads incorporated as part of the Mile Road System have traditionally been known by their non-mile names. It is unclear if they ever bore mile numbers formally.</p>
<p>The baseline used in the survey of Michigan lands runs along 8 Mile Road, which is approximately eight miles directly north of the junction of Woodward Avenue and Michigan Avenue in downtown Detroit. As a result, the direct east-west portion of Michigan Avenue, and M-153 (Ford Road) west of Wyoming Avenue, forms the Zero Mile baseline for the Mile Road System.</p>

<p>Chyluria is an important and common medical conditions especially affecting the people of africa and indian subcontinent, where filariasis is endemic even today. It literally means passing of "chyle" in urine. the causative parasite is Wuchereria bancrofti, an organism which also causes other conditions like Elephantiasis of the lower limbs, Tropical eosinophilia, filarial Epididymo-orchitis etc. the persons affected are infected by the parasite and it lodges in the lymph channels draining chyle (digested food absorbed as a milky solution into the blood). once the channels are blocked, one of the channels may open into the kidney hilum or ureter or sometimes into the bladder and chyle can leak into the urinary tract resulting in passage of milky white urine, which is frightening at the first sight. sometimes even blood can mix with the urine resulting in haemato-chyluria. The treatment consists of using anti-filarial drugs and modifying the diet to reduce the formation of chylomicrons (reduction of fat in food). Usually the condition is self limiting and sometimes can lead onto complications.</p>

<p>PULLOUT SYNOPSIS: Over the course of one long, hot summer, filmmaker Jyllian Gunther showed up on the doorsteps of her most significant Ex’s to pose the question: What went wrong? From New York to San Francisco to Paris, PULLOUT pulls out all the stops—what happens along the way includes a rekindled romance, tattooing, rejection, a stakeout, tarantulas, sex, accusations, indifference, and a nostalgia that climaxes with the realization that the past is subjective and memory is selective.</p>
<p><br />
“On the surface, PULLOUT is a simplistic documentary where director/writer Jyllian Gunther revisits old boyfriends to find out what went wrong with their relationships. She also interviews her father for his thoughts on the matter…Dig deeper, however, and you encounter a wonderfully deep and rich film about the motivations of people and their actions. It also looks at responsibility and destiny, and is quite possibly one of the most introspective documentaries of the year...”</p>

<p>DANAS Daily newspaper Established in June 1997, Danas (Today) is one of the youngest daily newspapers in Serbia. However, the experience of its founders is impressive, especially when it comes to fighting pressure and oppression in the country during the Milosevic years. The founders of Danas have been real pioneers of independent journalism--not only in the former Yugoslavia, but in the whole of Central and Eastern Europe. They are the editors and journalists who led the independent newspaper Borba in the late 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s (before it was taken over by the regime in December 1994) and who created the daily Nasa Borba in 1995.</p>
<p>These journalists were persecuted, threatened, banned, expelled from newsrooms, fined, sentenced, imprisoned (Miroslav Filipovic, a Danas correspondent in Kraljevo, spent about five months in military jail), and some were even killed (Slavko Curuvija worked for several years for Borba before founding Dnevni telegraf). And yet they did not stop.</p>
<p>Danas was founded by journalists who wanted to offer an alternative on the local market: a political, independent, and reliable newspaper that did not belong to any political party, group, or ideology, but that followed professional standards. Danas preserved its independent position in the period after the changes in October 2000 and was one of the rare media voices to criticize the new Serbian and Yugoslav authorities.</p>
<p>Danas is a liberal, pro-European newspaper that stands for the highest levels of tolerance and is strongly dedicated to the principles and values of democracy and civility. It strives for pluralism and dialogue and for the protection of human rights and the rights of all minorities--national, religious, cultural, and other. Danas strives to objectively cover the events in the whole region of the former Yugoslavia with the aim of opening up communication between citizens.</p>
<p>Danas has a daily circulation of 30,000 and is distributed throughout Serbia, Vojvodina, Montenegro, and parts of Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p>The group of professional journalists (now 15 people in total) fully owns Danas, which is published by the Dan Graf company.</p>
<p>On 12 May 2002, during the International Press Institute (IPI) World Congress in Ljubljana, the IPI, in cooperation with the Freedom Forum, presented its 2002 Free Media Pioneer Award to Danas. This award was established to honor individuals or organizations that have fought against great odds to ensure freer and more independent media in their country. It was presented to Danas for managing to provide an accurate, impartial view of events in the region while standing up to constant pressure from the Serbian authorities.</p>
<p>"Being determined not to make peace with the past, nor to push new dirt under the carpet, we are aware our task now is just as tough and challenging as in the pre-October days," Radomir Licina, Danas chairman of the board, said on the occasion.</p>

<p>It's Remy's last summer at home, where she and her brother have always been close to their mother, a successful writer of romance novels, who is now in her fourth marriage. Because of the endless failures of love Remy has witnessed, including her own first sexual encounters in high school, she feels she has no illusions about love. The lullaby of the title is a song written by her father, who never was able to love his children, but a song that Remy returns to again and again. Lines in the song say, "even if I let you down/this lullaby plays on." So this is the story of how Remy comes to understand that love, even flawed love, is worth experiencing; that she would rather open herself to life and love than to be so self-protective as to deny herself the experience. Oddly enough, it is her mother, even in the midst of a failing new marriage, who helps her to understand this truth. She also learns about loving from meeting Dexter, a musician who makes her laugh and loosen up a bit. Their relationship defies all the rules Remy usually follows to maintain control of her feelings. And she doesn't sleep with him either, even though that is usually her pattern. Their stumbling, bumbling love affair hardly gets going in the first weeks of summer, as both of them are working hard, busy with friends, planning on futures—Remy at Stanford; Dexter dreaming of his band signing a contract with a music company. Remy knows on some level that her feelings for Dexter are different and that she is in danger of falling in love with him. So she tries to keep the relationship contained to avoid hurt, even breaking up with him to pursue a "safer" situation with another guy—safer in the sense she can enjoy hiscompany and know it won't hurt when they leave each other. With Dexter, she isn't so sure, which is why readers will appreciate the final chapter that takes place in November when Remy is at Stanford and Dexter sends her a package that reveals where their relationship is heading. What is good about this book is the humor mixed with reality, with the honest portrayal of smart, articulate teenagers struggling to make sense of a world of nonsensical expectations. Remy, Dexter and their friends and "families" are exasperating, funny, smart, and quite interesting.</p>

<p>IACS stands for International Annealed Copper Standard. It is often used as a unit of electrical conductivity for metals and alloys, expressed as a percentage of the conductivity of pure copper at 20°C. (Room temperature)</p>
<p>100% IACS is 581,000 Siemens/cm or 17.21 nΩ·m</p>
<p>For example, pure Silver is 103% IACS, and the only metal with IACS greater than 100% Steel is about 25% IACS and copper alloys can range from 30-80% IACS.</p>

<p>Hi, I would to draw your attention to the fact that Ismail Shammout is actually a painter, not a film director as indicated on the already existing list of palestenians. I think it is worth creating an article about him as he is known as the painter of intifada, and one of the very famous artists of the modern arab world. You can refer to his website www.shammout.com Thank you.</p>

<p>shared vision</p>
<p>According to Senge, shared vision is not a corporate mission statement, but shared goals developed from the grassroots of a company and shared throughout the organisation. He said: 'Companies need to build a shared vision so that they can build a common commitment to long-term results and achievement. But the creative process should also be the domain of all managers, all practitioners, all professionals. Ultimately, people in any organisation are deeply interested in what they can make happen.'</p>
<p>Senge maintains that good leaders can inspire their teams through driving commitment to a shared vision, rather than dictating the mission statement and hoping employees will buy in.</p>
<p>He added: 'Leaders energise through generating and sustaining creative tension, through fostering commitment to realising a dream. If the vision remains constant, creative tension can be resolved only when reality moves toward the vision.'</p>
<p>Abdulqader al Khaja, CEO of the organisers knowledgenetwork (knet), explained that if companies subscribe to Senge's theories, then the corporate vision is one that must be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Khaja said: 'Vision without an understanding of current reality in an organisation is more likely to foster cynicism than creativity.'</p>
<p>The seminar is entitled The Learning Organisation, and according to Khaja, Senge is the authority to speak on the subject, having been named as one of the 25 individuals to have had the greatest influence on business strategy over the last 100 years.</p>
<p>The seminar will be held under the patronage of His Excellency Sheikh Nahayan Mabarak Al Nahayan, Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research.</p>
<p>It has already attracted leading names as sponsors, including: DUBAL; Shell; Dubai Municipality; Emirates Bank; Dubai Ports, Customs and Free Zone Corporation; and Dubai Islamic Bank. In addition, Saudi Aramco - the only regional member of the Society for Organisational Learning - is also sponsoring the event.</p>

<p>Lord and Lady Birkbeck were residents of Horstead Hall, Norfolk. House was built 1835 and demolished Mid 20th Century. Birkbeck of Horstead Hall: Baronetage in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. Created 1886 for Sir Edward Birkbeck (b. 11 Oct 1838), Conservative MP for Norfolk North 1879-1885 and Norfolk East 1885-1892. Became extinct on his death in 1907. Lady Birkbeck latterly lived at Mill House, Buxton. Horstead Hall was inherited by a collateral branch of the family.</p>
<p>Horstead Hall was rebuilt in the tudor style 1835, a seventeeth-century house having stood on the site previously. The house was demolished in the 1950s, the family having moved to Rippon Hall, outside Buxton. A pipe organ from the hall may be found in the church at Ashby St. Mary. Substantial outbuildings survive of Hostead Hall, including an Italiante watertower and fragments of the domestic offices. I am told that a part of the hall survives, but so far it has been impossible to verify, as the land is private property. Part of the estate is now being quarried for gravel.</p>

<p>John Labus took the radio industry by storm in the early 21st century. His signature tone and timbre fast became recognizable by listeners in the greater Harrisburg (PA) media market, when he was named as Morning Anchor on then struggling WHP Talkradio 580. The addition of Labus quickly grabbed the attention of Clear Channel executives, as WHP soared from bridesmaid status to marketshare sweetheart within weeks. Labus' contributions were recognized by radio executives across the country, and internationally, in markets like Nairobi, Tokyo, and Houston, TX. Labus was courted by each, but found solace in Houston with news giant KTRH. His signature delivery continues to be enjoyed daily by millions in the nation's 7th ranked media market. Labus is long rumored to be one of Clear Channel's many "shadow agents," working in entry level positions, but secretly holding one of the company's highest level management positions.</p>

<p>Presumably the followers of the Deacon Nicolas of Antioch, from the second century AD. A father of the early Christian church, Iranaeus, identified the followers of Nicolas in his treatise "Against Heresies" in the same period of time. However there is no concrete evidence that this Nicolas was actually the leader of the group which bears his name.</p>
<p>The root of Nicolaitan comes from Greek "nikao", which means to conquer, and "laos", meaning common people, and from which the word laity stems.</p>
