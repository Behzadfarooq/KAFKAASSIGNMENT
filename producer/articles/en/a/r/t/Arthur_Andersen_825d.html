<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Andersen_825d.html" title="Edit section: Founding">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Founding</span></h3>
<p>The firm of Arthur Andersen was founded in 1913 by Arthur Andersen and Clarence DeLany as Andersen, DeLany &amp; Co. The firm changed its name to Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. in 1918. Arthur Andersen's first client was the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schlitz.html" title="Schlitz">Schlitz</a> <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer.html" title="Beer">beer</a> company of <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milwaukee.html" title="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>.</p>
<p>The son of a <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norwegian_people.html" title="Norwegian people">Norwegian</a> <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immigrant.html" title="Immigrant">immigrant</a>, Andersen was left on his own at the age of 16 after the death of his parents. He worked during the day as a mailboy and attended school at night. Eventually he was hired as the assistant to the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controller.html" title="Controller">controller</a> of Allis-Chalmers in Chicago where he became intrigued with the work of independent public accountants. He received a degree as a <a href="../../../c/e/r/Certified_public_accountant.html" title="Certified public accountant">certified public accountant</a> at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign_5af2.html" title="University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign">University of Illinois</a> in 1908; at age 23 he was the youngest CPA in Illinois. In 1917, after attending courses at night while working full time, he graduated from the <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kellogg_School_dd08.html" title="Kellogg School">Kellogg School</a> at <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northwestern_University_b7d7.html" title="Northwestern University">Northwestern University</a> with a bachelor's degree in business.</p>
<p>He worked for an accounting firm in Chicago and as a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controller.html" title="Controller">controller</a> for the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schlitz.html" title="Schlitz">Schlitz</a> Brewing Co. in Milwaukee. In 1913 at the age of 28, he entered into business for himself under the firm name of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. In 1915, due to his many contacts there, the Milwaukee office was opened as the firm's second office. From 1912-22, he was a professor of accounting at <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northwestern_University_b7d7.html" title="Northwestern University">Northwestern University</a> where he was the first to design courses that forced accounting students to deal with practical operating problems of business organizations.</p>
<p>Andersen had an unwavering faith in education as the basis upon which the new profession of <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accounting.html" title="Accounting">accounting</a> should be developed. He created the profession's first centralized training program and believed in training during normal working hours. He was generous in his commitment to aiding educational, civic and charitable organizations. In 1927, he was elected to the Board of Trustees of Northwestern University and served as its president from 1930 to 1932. He was also chairman of the board of certified public accountant examiners of Illinois.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Andersen_825d.html" title="Edit section: Reputation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Reputation</span></h3>
<p>Andersen, who headed the firm until his death in 1947, was a zealous supporter of high standards in the <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accounting.html" title="Accounting">accounting</a> industry. A stickler for honesty, he argued that accountants' responsibility was to investors, not their clients. During the early years, it is reputed that Andersen was approached by an executive from a local rail utility to sign off on accounts which contained flawed accounting, or face the loss of a major client. Andersen refused in no uncertain terms, replying that he would not sign the accounts "for all the money in America". Leonard Spacek, who succeeded Andersen at the founder's death, continued this emphasis on honesty. For many years, Andersen's motto was "Think straight, talk straight."</p>
<p>Andersen also led the way in a number of areas of accounting standards. Being among the first to identify a possible sub-prime bust, Andersen dissociated itself from a number of clients in the 1970s. Later, with the emergence of <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stock_options.html" title="Stock options">stock options</a> as a form of compensation (which became particularly prevalent in the late-1990s), Andersen was the first of the major accountancy firms to propose to the <a href="../../../f/a/s/FASB_007d.html" title="FASB">FASB</a> that stock options should be expensed, thus impacting on net profit just as cash compensation would.</p>
<p>By the 1980s, standards throughout the industry fell as accountancy firms struggled to balance their commitment to audit independence against the desire to grow their burgeoning consultancy practices. Having established a reputation for IT consultancy in the 1980s, Andersen was no exception. The firm rapidly expanded its consultancy practice to the point where the bulk of its revenues were derived from such engagements, while audit partners were continually encouraged to seek out opportunities for consulting fees from existing audit clients. By the late-1990s, Andersen had succeeded in tripling the per-share revenues of its partners.</p>
<p>Predictibly, Andersen struggled to balance the need to maintain its faithfulness to accounting standards with its clients' desire to maximise profits, particularly in the era of quarterly earnings reports. Andersen has been alleged to have been involved in the fraudulent accounting and auditing of <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunbeam_Products_5be5.html" title="Sunbeam Products">Sunbeam Products</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/s/Waste_Management%2C_Inc._40b3.html" title="Waste Management, Inc.">Waste Management, Inc.</a>, Asia Pulp and Paper, and the Baptist Foundation of Arizona, as well as the infamous <a href="../../../e/n/r/Enron.html" title="Enron">Enron</a> case, among others.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Andersen_825d.html" title="Edit section: Recent History of the Firm">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Recent History of the Firm</span></h3>
<p>The consulting wing of the firm became increasingly important during the 1970s and 1980s, growing at a much faster rate than the more established accounting, auditing, and tax practice. This disproportionate growth, and the consulting division partners' belief that they were not garnering their fair share of firm profits, created increasing friction between the two divisions.</p>
<p>In 1989, Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting became separate units of <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andersen_Worldwide_e042.html" title="Andersen Worldwide">Andersen Worldwide</a>. Andersen increased its use of accounting services as a springboard to sign up clients for Andersen Consulting's more lucrative business.</p>
<p>The two businesses spent most of the 1990s in a bitter dispute. Andersen Consulting saw a huge surge in profits during the decade. However, the consultants continued to resent transfer payments they were required to make to Arthur Andersen. In August <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> the conclusion of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Chamber_of_Commerce_3c55.html" title="International Chamber of Commerce">International Chamber of Commerce</a> granted Andersen Consulting its independence from Arthur Andersen, but awarded the $1.2 billion in past payments (held in escrow pending the ruling) to Arthur Andersen, and declared that Andersen Consulting could no longer use the Andersen name. As a result Andersen Consulting changed its name to <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accenture.html" title="Accenture">Accenture</a> on <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Year%27s_Day_a3c7.html" title="New Year's Day">New Year's Day</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps most telling about who had "won" the decision was that four hours after the arbitrator made his ruling, Arthur Andersen CEO Jim Wadia suddenly resigned. Industry analysts and business school professors alike viewed the event as a total and complete victory for Andersen Consulting.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Jim Wadia would provide insight on his resignation years later at a Harvard Business school case activity about the split. It turned out that the Arthur Andersen board passed a resolution saying he had to resign if he didn't get at least an incremental $4 billion (either through negotiation or via the arbitrator decision) for the consulting practice to split off, hence his quick resignation once the decision was announced.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Accounts vary on why the split occurred — executives on both sides of the split cite greed and arrogance on the part of the other side, and executives on the Andersen Consulting side maintained breach of contract when Arthur Andersen created a second consulting group, AABC (Arthur Andersen Business Consulting) which began to compete directly with Andersen Consulting in the marketplace. Many of the AABC firms were bought out by other consulting companies in 2002, most notably, <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitachi%2C_Ltd._0160.html" title="Hitachi, Ltd.">Hitachi Consulting</a> and KPMG Consulting, which later changed its name to <a href="../../../b/e/a/BearingPoint_a2b7.html" title="BearingPoint">BearingPoint</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Andersen_825d.html" title="Edit section: Involvement in accounting scandals">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Involvement in accounting scandals</span></h2>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_15.html" title="June 15">June 15</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, Andersen was convicted of obstruction of justice for shredding documents related to its audit of <a href="../../../e/n/r/Enron.html" title="Enron">Enron</a>. <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nancy_Temple_6a74.html" title="Nancy Temple">Nancy Temple</a> (Andersen Legal Dept.) and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Duncan_7894.html" title="David Duncan">David Duncan</a> (Lead Partner for the Enron account) were cited as the responsible managers in this scandal as they had given the order to shred relevant documents. Since the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission_95a6.html" title="U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a> does not allow convicted felons to audit public companies, the firm agreed to surrender its licenses and its right to practice before the SEC on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_31.html" title="August 31">August 31</a> 2002. This effectively ended the company's operations.</p>
<p>The Andersen indictment also put a spotlight on its faulty accounting of other companies, most notably <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunbeam_Products_5be5.html" title="Sunbeam Products">Sunbeam</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/r/WorldCom_b73e.html" title="WorldCom">WorldCom</a>. The subsequent <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankruptcy.html" title="Bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a> of WorldCom, which quickly surpassed Enron as the biggest bankruptcy in history, then led to a domino effect of accounting and other corporate scandals that continues to tarnish American business practices.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_31.html" title="May 31">May 31</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States_b835.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> unanimously overturned Andersen's conviction due to flaws in the jury instructions. In the court's view, the instructions allowed the jury to convict Andersen without proving that the firm knew it had broken the law or that there had been a link to any official proceeding that prohibited the destruction of documents. The opinion was also highly skeptical of the government's definition of "corrupt persuasion" — persuasion with an improper purpose even without knowing an act is unlawful.</p>
<p>Despite this ruling, it is highly unlikely Andersen will ever return as a viable business. The firm lost nearly all of its clients when it was indicted, and there are over 100 civil suits pending against the firm related to its audits of Enron and other companies. It began winding down its American operations after the indictment. From a high of 28,000 employees in the US and 85,000 worldwide, the firm is now down to around 200 based primarily in Chicago. Most of their attention is on handling the lawsuits and presiding over the orderly dissolution of the company. Arthur Andersen, LLP has not been formally dissolved nor has it declared bankruptcy. Ownership of the partnership has been ceded to four limited liability corporations named Omega Management I through IV.</p>
