<li><i>It contains one sentence on etymology and then the link.</i> — And that's the same hyperlink to the same article as here, as I (quite accurately) said. <i>cultural/historical subjects like this.</i> — That's a fallacious argument. There is no cultural/historical subject being dealt with by this article. It's an article about the word <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gyp" class="extiw" title="wikt:gyp">gyp</a>, plain and simple. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:51, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. Discussions of alternative and disputed etymologies of words belong in the etymology sections of the articles on those words in the dictionary. Wiktionary is not paper. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:27, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm switching to just <b>keep</b>. It might not be doing it now, but a history of this word and of its use could have value. I've heard of entire papers on this word. I think there are words and phrases that can merit an article rather than just a dictionary entry. And although Wiktionary is not paper, Wikipedia isn't paper either. Looking at <a href="../../../s/l/a/Category%7ESlang_a752.html" title="Category:Slang">Category:Slang</a> many words that less deserve an article have one. For example <a href="../../../h/u/z/Huzzah.html" title="Huzzah">Huzzah</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cowabunga.html" title="Cowabunga">Cowabunga</a>. I think this should be given time to become a real article.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 10:59, 24 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A "history of this word" belongs in the dictionary, in the etymology section of the dictionary article about the word. Wiktionary is not paper. <i>Wiktionary has "real articles" too!</i> You are conflating "short" with "dictionary article". That's wrong. The two are not synonymous. Please do not support the waste of time and effort that is the creation of dictionary articles in the encyclopaedia. Wikipedia is the encyclopaedia, and Wiktionary is the dictionary. Please do dictionary work in the project that has the goal of creating a dictionary. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:16, 24 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Don't lecture me, especially as you don't do it very well. A long page on the use, history, and controversy over this word would not belong in a dictionary or wiktionary. I don't want to write that article at 5:25 AM Central Standard Time, but I'm sure I can write it at some point. We have articles on all kinds of words, something you failed to acknowledge or respond to. So tell me why issues concerning this word merit an article less than the other words in <a href="../../../s/l/a/Category%7ESlang_a752.html" title="Category:Slang">Category:Slang</a>. If you can't do that, don't bother lecturing me again.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 11:28, 24 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>A long page on the use, history, and controversy over this word would not belong in a dictionary or wiktionary.</i> — Rubbish. Articles on words that discuss their etymologies and their usages are <i>exactly</i> what Wiktionary is for and explicitly <i>wants</i>. Yet again, you are conflating "dictionary article" and "short". Wiktionary is not paper, and welcomes long discussions of etymologies. Furthermore: I've already told you about <a href="../../../s/l/a/Category%7ESlang_a752.html" title="Category:Slang">Category:Slang</a>, its mis-use, and the Wiktionary category where dictionary articles on slang words properly belong, below. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:51, 24 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I still think you are being a snot, but I'm no longer as certain this belongs in Wikipedia. In an Encyclopedia perhaps it would, in Wikipedia perhaps not. Whether you like it or not there are cases of issues/history concerning words being of historical enough importance to merit an encyclopedic article. You can whine and pout against that all you want, but it doesn't really change that. Or change that there are numerous such word/articles already. I think this word does merit that, but admittedly just barely. This is a case though of Wiki versus reality. In this case "What Wikipedians can do or find interesting" maybe does make this invalid.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<li><s>Misleading. It's one sentence and then a link. Wiktionary is a dictionary. It's not set up to deal with issues concerning the political/history controversies over words. Why should it be? Granted this has been around for months without much expansion, but this isn't necessarily meaningful. This article doesn't concern computers, slang common to under 30 year olds, or the religious/political groups that are common here.

<ul>
<li>I see now that this was tagged since September. Well possibly no one who can deal with this subject is going to appear. I've appeared, but I'm not sure I'm qualified. Still my objections mostly stand.

<li><i>Wiktionary is a dictionary. It's not set up to deal with issues concerning the political/history controversies over words.</i> — Rubbish. Wiktionary is quite able to deal with discussing disputed usages and disputed etymologies, and for some words already goes into detail about such things.

<li>And now that I've read it I can say your objections don't apply. This article isn't and doesn't have to be about how to use this word or its definition. Added to that what you site mentions articles on words so they are acceptable. It also isn't geneology, etc. Like I said it's too late for me to write a good article on this word, one at the level of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_giver.html" title="Indian giver">Indian giver</a> can possibly be done in time, but still it can be done at some point.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li>This article is <i>exactly</i> about the word and how to use it.

<li>I'm aware of what it is, but it has potential to be more than that. As you can't deal with what I say on related word/articles you mostly just repeat the same plattitudes.

<li>Definition, etymology, usage, more etymology. Zero encyclopedic content. Belongs in Wiktionary. <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gyp" class="extiw" title="wikt:gyp">Already there</a>. Why is this contentious? <b>Delete</b> unless someone rewrites it into an encyclopedia article, which I don't think is possible; certainly none of the content currently here will help in doing so. —<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptic_b72b.html" title="User:Cryptic">Cryptic</a> <a href="../../../c/r/y/User_talk%7ECryptic_d8a7.html" title="User talk:Cryptic">(talk)</a> 12:58, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - note that we do have similar articles - for example, <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">Nigger</a>. However, an article about the word ought to be included if there are significant debates centered on the word - whether it is offensive, how people ought to react to it, etc. In this case, however, it seems like there is just not enough encyclopedic content to fill an article. --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierremenard_b03f.html" title="User:Pierremenard">Pierremenard</a> 14:42, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Merge the useful bits into Wiktionary (if any). <b>Delete</b> this leftover. It is a good dictionary definition but nothing more. I see little possibility that it can be expanded past the lexical content. The fact that we have not yet cleaned up other inappriate articles about words does not convince me that we should perpetuate the mistake here. By the way, I have no objection to the replacement of this page with a redirect to the Wiktionary entry. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 15:54, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
