Assuming the list is the same as that used at <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._John%27s_College%2C_Annapolis_9061.html" title="St. John's College, Annapolis">St. John's College, Annapolis</a>, merge there, as it is the original campus. The use of direct source texts of the "<a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Books_dfc4.html" title="Great Books">great books</a>" is a fairly interesting educational philosophy. Notice that this is not just a recommended reading list, these are (supposedly) <i>the</i> books used as the textbooks. I don't think there are many colleges other than St. Johns that do this, so it is a notable curriculum, not just any old typical liberal arts curriculum. It might be worthwhile to try to coordinate and refactor the articles on the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Classics_6fb7.html" title="Harvard Classics">Harvard Classics</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Books_dfc4.html" title="Great Books">Great Books</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Books_of_the_Western_World_93ac.html" title="Great Books of the Western World">Great Books of the Western World</a>, the two St. John's College articles, the St. John's book list, and, I dunno, maybe <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stringfellow_Barr_352b.html" title="Stringfellow Barr">Stringfellow Barr</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortimer_Adler_468f.html" title="Mortimer Adler">Mortimer Snerd</a> (sorry, couldn't resist), <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_W._Eliot_4a05.html" title="Charles W. Eliot">Charles W. Eliot</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Hutchins_3c45.html" title="Robert Hutchins">Robert Hutchins</a>, etc. since these all bear on the same idea. I've always wondered how the teaching at St. John's is actually done; I'll bet the professors have developed elaborate methods of subtle cheating to insure that students don't end up believing that combustion is caused by phlogiston and that light waves are caused by vibrations in the aether. Maybe the Great Books are the only <b>official</b> texts but the students smuggle in current textbooks and hide them inside copies of Playboy so they won't get caught? Maybe the upperclassmen trade lists of the books you <i>really</i> need to read in order to ace the tests? Just wondering... Seriously, this list is a keeper, but not as a separate article. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:16, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. For once, it is a coherent list that illustrates the notable and unusual curriculum of a college. I'd comment, by the way, that at a lot of the more demanding colleges the humanities undergraduates will read a substantial percentage of these books in their entirety and even more of them in part. Plus, they will read a great deal more besides. Depending on how much depth they go into, if this is the entire 4 year reading list, it seems a bit light. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 23:54, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, there have been far less notable, trivial lists that have been kept on Wikipedia. Perhaps the article could de with a bit more explaining on why those books are chosen. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 00:50, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - a book list is totally useless and does not convey anything. If this curriculum is important or unique than it should be written and expalined in the article. Otherwise it would open the floodgates for people putting down curriculum lists in wikipedia for the thousands of courses. <a href="../../../k/a/a/User%7EKaal_8f50.html" title="User:Kaal">kaal</a> 01:25, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>So, what would you think about "merge into <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._John%27s_College%2C_Annapolis_9061.html" title="St. John's College, Annapolis">St. John's College, Annapolis</a> and delete?" The article(s) on St. John's do "explain the curriculum." BTW, I've done a bit of Googling on "perennialism" in various combinations, and so far St. John's is frequently mentioned as an example of a college using that philosophy, and I have yet to see a mention of <i>any</i> other college using such a philosophy or curriculum, so St. John's curriculum is notable as one of the few actual examples of such a curriculum in actual use. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 10:45, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: If there's agreement (which there currently isn't), I'm prepared to do the kind of merge-and-delete that merges histories, keeping things GFDL-kosher. I was thinking of just doing the merge right away, but the history shows contributions by too many editors to just put a simple note on the Talk page. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 11:34, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment: Copyvio?</b> The article was contributed in almost its present form by User:Desert Pyrate on 28 October. Three edits to this article are his only contributions. The article is essentially the same text as <a href="http://www.sjcsf.edu/asp/main.aspx?page=1302" class="external text" title="http://www.sjcsf.edu/asp/main.aspx?page=1302" rel="nofollow">this list from the St. John's website</a>. Since then, there have been <i>scores</i> of edits by several editors, but virtually all of the edits consist of linking or fixing links in the names of the works and their authors. Since I want to keep the list, I'd like to think that there isn't a copyvio, but I dunno. An anthology of public domain work certainly can have a compilation copyright, but is its table of contents copyrightable? Is this just a list of names like a telephone directory, or does the creative act of selecting them make it copyrightable? Could St. John's sue me successfully if I were to start my own college and use their booklist as the curriculum? I'm probably losing the argument to keep this information anyway so it probably doesn't matter, but... whom to ask? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:32, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> .. although I think it should be merged with the Annapolis campus book list. St.Johns is a very unique school, and this list is very helpful for those wishing to study the Great Books. If you have never heard of St.Johns or the great books program I could understand why it might seem non noteworthy. In any case if this does get deleted, please let me know first so I can copy this down somewhere for my own personal reference! --<a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 22:52, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not notable in any possible way. What this boils down to is a list of books that in the opinion of this college are the most important in western literature. In that sense, one could even argue that the article is inherently POV, though I admit that could be stretching it. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 20:24, Feb 10, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, it's not inherently POV to report that "X said Q" or that "Group Y believes J" or "Institution Z holds core principles K," and such statements are encyclopedic <b>if</b> X, Y, or Z are important and notable. The issue is really whether St. Johns and/or its curriculum is a) notable, and b) notable enough to be worth including this level of specific detail. I think they are, since this is all part of the Great Books movement, and <i>which</i> books are considered "great" is important in understanding the movement. The article on the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Classics_6fb7.html" title="Harvard Classics">Harvard Classics</a> lists the actual contents of the volumes, and that makes it a better article than it would be without the list. <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Books_dfc4.html" title="Great Books">Great Books</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/u/Educational_perennialism.html" title="Educational perennialism">Educational perennialism</a> are significant, and St. John's is notable as a <i>reasonably</i> well-known, successful, well-regarded institution that actually puts these ideas into practice. I don't think the detailed curriculum of any old "good small liberal-arts school" like <a href="../../../h/a/v/Haverford_College_1d5b.html" title="Haverford College">Haverford College</a> or <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reed_College_ce98.html" title="Reed College">Reed College</a> would be notable, and I don't think St. John's would be notable if there were a hundred schools that followed the same curriculum—but there aren't. (I've recently learned of two more: <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Aquinas_College_f0db.html" title="Thomas Aquinas College">Thomas Aquinas College</a>, <a href="http://www.thomasaquinas.edu/" class="external free" title="http://www.thomasaquinas.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thomasaquinas.edu/</a>, in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Paula%2C_California_d16a.html" title="Santa Paula, California">Santa Paula, California</a>, and <a href="../../../g/u/t/Gutenberg_College_dd34.html" title="Gutenberg College">Gutenberg College</a> in <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene%2C_Oregon_1214.html" title="Eugene, Oregon">Eugene, Oregon</a>, which are respectively Catholic and Protestant Christian schools with a Great Books curriculum). By the way, I think it's clear from my flippant remarks above that I am not personally thrilled by the Great Books idea; it's not <b>my</b> POV. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 21:27, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> or merge. St John's and the Great Books movement are a significant, although non-mainstrean, educational philosophy. Probably this should be merged into the main article on the origianl St John's, or else one on the Great Books movement as a whole.
