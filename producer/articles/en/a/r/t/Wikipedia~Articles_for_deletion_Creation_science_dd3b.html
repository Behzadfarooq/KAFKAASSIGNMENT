<ul>
<li>Not encyclopedic material - refer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT" rel="nofollow">WP:NOT</a> paragraph 1.3: "Wikipedia is not a soapbox".

<li>Creation science hasn't been published in peer-reviewed scientific publications, and therefore constitutes <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>.</li>
<li>Falls broadly under the category of "advertisement or other spam" - there's allready a page dedicated to the topic of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a>, the term "Creation science" is inherently biased.</li>
<li>Completely idiosyncratic non-topic - only creationists think of creationism as a science.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Such a minor branch of a subject that it doesn't deserve an article.</li>

<p>Proposed action:</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The creation science movement is an important movement within creationism and has significance to both theology and the cultural acceptance of science. Creationism is not creation science. Young Earth creationism is not creation science, though creation science is a subset of creationism and strongly connected to YECism. But YECism isn't creation science either (see <a href="../../../o/m/p/Omphalos.html" title="Omphalos">omphalos</a>, Ussher-Lightfoot calendar). It's very transparent <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>, that's why it is in <a href="../../../p/s/e/Category%7EPseudoscience_c4dd.html" title="Category:Pseudoscience">category:pseudoscience</a>. But pseudoscience is culturally significant yet scientifically insignificant. Creationism may seem like a blunt instrument, but is also very subtle, and explaining this subtlety should be of use to those opposed to it, and they should reach a better understanding of it and write better articles. (Though I do think the philosophy section may have been "untgssed"). btw, if this goes, <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flood_geology.html" title="Flood geology">flood geology</a> should go too. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 22:55, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Furthermore, there have been several very popular books written on the subject (start with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Genesis_Flood_3b2d.html" title="The Genesis Flood">The Genesis Flood</a>), despite it being unpeer-reviewed, an NPOV reflection of unpeer-reviewed ideas is encyclopedic. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 23:01, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Though I disagree with the reasons given by the nominator for listing it for deletion, I do think this might well be <b>merged</b> with <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a> as one of the ways in which that religious view represents itself. As I have argued on previous occasions, there are quite a few too many articles covering various aspects of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a>. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 23:05, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I would not merge with Creationism as they are separete concepts. Not all creationists are creation scientists. If you look at the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Talk%7ECreation_science_a4d4.html#Creationism_is_not_science" title="Talk:Creation science">talk</a> page, you'll see that I have been defending this page for the last 3 days. My arguments for keeping are well represented there. Furthermore, this does not fall under the definition of original research, advertisement or patent nonesence. This nomination was not made from a NPOV. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">DaveTheRed</a> 23:29, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> and redirect to <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a>. Creation science is an ideologically and politically motivated propaganda tool and a neologism whose only purpose is to promote the creationist agenda in society. The term "creation science" was chosen to purposely blur the distinction between science and religion, thereby underservedly legitimizing creationism by association to science. Further more it is my believe that if wikipedians don't make a firm and clear stand against such use of propaganda in wikipedia, then the whole project looses credibility. The main asumption of wikipedia is thats its user will autoregulate the content. If we fail to do so in this instance then I fear that the assumption is incorrect and thus credibility will only be gained by revising policies and their implementations. --<a href="../../../l/e/x/User%7ELexCorp_892c.html" title="User:LexCorp">LexCorp</a> 23:52, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- the article is slightly POV but does a sufficiently good job of justifying its opinions that it's forgiveable.

In fact, if it was merged with <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a> I'd think the appropriate thing to do would be to break it out again.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Creation science is an oxymoron and a steaming pile of velociraptor droppings, but the phenomenon of people working to back up Genesis through science (or an approximation thereof) does exist, under this name. Notable and sufficiently distinct from <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a> and should be kept. Assuming it can be kept NPOV. At the moment the article is seriously lacking as it suggests that for most of the Creationism movement creation scientists have supported a young earth theory. It has nothing on day-Age creationism etc. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_6181.html" title="User:Sabine's Sunbird">Sabine's Sunbird</a> 05:57, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, but the article needs to deal with the problem that the term "creation science" is itself POV. (I agree with <a href="../../../l/e/x/User%7ELexCorp_892c.html" title="User:LexCorp">LexCorp</a> that the term is "a neologism whose only purpose is to promote the creationist agenda in society.")

<li><b>Keep and do not merge</b>. This is a very commonly used phrase and is precisely the sort of thing that people would come to wikipedia for. It is also very distinct from creationism, which makes no attempt to phrase its arguments in scientific sounding lingo. I have heard dinosaur bones explained away by creationists (but not creation scientists) as placed in the ground by the devil to tempt believers. The creation scientist will carefully refute the results of radioactive decay due to groundwater contamination, the stratigraphic layers as elevation-based community structure, the fossilization in sedimentary rock as occurring in the Noahic flood, and the mass extinction as a result of inbreeding depression and bottlenecks just following the flood (because two of every land animal got on the boat). The article makes an attempt at NPOV, but I still think it's a bit pro. That's really tough to call on something like this, though, because it's hard to find someone without an opinion on the initial topic. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranae_c7be.html" title="User:Aranae">Aranae</a> 09:02, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>. Better suited as a sub-section of creationism. Creationism will benefit from a discussion on its relation to science and how it has tried to bring about a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> to fight back the attacks from the scientific community. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskewmind_0461.html" title="User:Askewmind"><b>Askew</b>mind</a> | (<a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskewmind_dc9f.html" title="User talk:Askewmind">Talk</a>) 09:44, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Title is an inherent contradiction. <b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a> if any content is salvageable. This topic is totally overrepresented on the English Wikipedia anyway. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartg76_fbde.html" title="User:Martg76">Martg76</a> 20:40, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Articles should never be deleted just because we don't agree with the concept they concern. And how can a topic be "overrepresented"? Write the other stuff needed to balance it! <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 03:03, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This movement has had social impact and should not be brushed under the rug .. despite the fact I think the beliefs are ... hogwash is still a word, right? As Dr. Zen said "Articles should <b>never</b> (my emphasis) be deleted just because we don't agree with the concept." That should be written into policy somewhere, carved into stone, etc. <a href="../../../c/e/y/User%7ECeyockey_fb55.html" title="User:Ceyockey">Courtland</a> 04:46, 2005 Mar 10 (UTC)</li>
<li>strong <b>Keep</b>. While as a Christian and a science fan, I disagree with Creation science, it's a major, major topic. 186,000 Google hits! I could ask most knowledgable people what this was, and they'd know. There've been articles in the mainstream media describing this movement. Compared with some of the minor topics we have, this is <i>vastly</i> important. It's a different thing than creationism, and definitely long enough to be it's own article. Yes, it's an oxymoron: that's established in the second paragraph. It's not propoganda: there's a pretty major section of criticism. It should probably also have some refinement, and a note on Christian criticism of the whole idea, but it definitely should be kept. -<a href="../../../l/t/n/User%7ELtNOWIS_fcfd.html" title="User:LtNOWIS">LtNOWIS</a> 16:28, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge/redirect</b> to <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a>. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 18:43, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. We should have a decent article on this. (We probably <i>won't</i>, but we <i>should</i>.) -<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_6303.html" title="User:Aranel">Aranel</a> ("<font color="#BA0000"><u>Sarah</u></font>") 02:49, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Real phenomenon. Every bit as valid a <i>topic</i> as <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Science_5b54.html" title="Christian Science">Christian Science</a> (and equally scientific) (&lt;--- note: last previous parenthetical remark is ironic). "We live on the inside of a hollow earth" is unencyclopedic. "<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cleves_Symmes_Jr_39d0.html" title="John Cleves Symmes Jr">John Cleves Symmes Jr</a> said we live on the inside of a <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollow_earth.html" title="Hollow earth">hollow earth</a> is encyclopedic. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:33, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There are a lot of pages describing different aspects of creationist thinking on Wikipedia, and however weird some of it is, lumping it all in one article will not made it go away. --<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">Henrygb</a> 20:48, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. "Creation science" is <i>one type</i> of Creationism, and the reasons cited for nominating it seem to purposefully misinterpret VfD criteria. As it stands, the article could use some NPOV editing, but that's not criteria for deletion by itself. An article on the development of "Creation science" and "Scientific Creationism" as a strategy in the evolution/creationism debate could be quite interesting (I am sure that Ronald L. Number's <i>The Creationists: The Evolution of Scientific Creationism</i>, Harvard University Press, 1992, would be invaluable in this). --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 23:02, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
