<li><b>DELETE</b> - No longer notable, also it is well covered in the Air America Radio, and Gloria Wise articles. Nearly all the sources on this page are extremely biased (right wing newspapers and blogs), and a quick Google reveals that very few unbised and factual sources can be found for this story. Now that this issue is past, a summary on the AAR page is warranted, but not a seperate article. I realize that this links to a lot of pages, but that is due to a "related articles" link in the Air America template. In October of 05, some reasons to keep were that it was "a subject that it seems a few people want to discuss" Now we know it is basically a deflated conspiracy theory and it is simply not much of an issue anymore. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENut-meg_ecbc.html" title="User:Nut-meg">nut-meg</a> 07:34, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> We know that <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot.html" title="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a> is a hoax, but it's a Zeitgiest thing - an issue which somebody may wish to know the history of, even if it's all resolved. If it were drastically rewritten, it might fit in either Air America Radio or Gloria Wise - but as it stands, it's relatively chunky and would probably read like a tangent. --Action Jackson IV 08:17, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, purely because the nominator seems to have a major misunderstanding of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">WP:NOTABLE</a>. As shown by the first words in the nomination of: "<i>No longer notable</i>".

<dd>Perhaps you should read the rest of the nomination. Do we have to have a seperate article for every hyped up "controversy"? The initial reason to keep it was "people want to discuss". Is wikipedia a blog? I thought it was an encyclopedia. Plus there are few reliable and unbiased sources cited. Factual information is hard to come by on this.<a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENut-meg_ecbc.html" title="User:Nut-meg">nut-meg</a> 16:38, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> As others have already mentioned, notability doesn't "disappear" when the subject falls off the news or blog radars. Also, a separate article can do better justice in covering the subject then a very brief summary in another article.

<dd>Getaway, I am <b>very</b> concerned that we would be creating an article, as you argue, because editors in another article do not permit that material.

<dl>
<dd>Dhartung, Im not sure what he's talking about, because until recently I don't believe I have edited the Air America article at all. But I had initially pared down the section on Gloria Wise in the Air America artlcle, as it had terrible NPOV problems and a lot of false or misleading information. If the decision is to merge, then any notable and reliable details should be added back into the Air America article. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENut-meg_ecbc.html" title="User:Nut-meg">nut-meg</a> 06:10, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> into Air America Radio article after boiling it down to a few well referenced points. This is too much writing about a legal squabble over an $800,000 loan. A big law firm will have a number of cases at any instant which are far bigger than this and just as non-encyclopedic. Most of the references are to partisan newspapers only a cut above the National Enquirer. The one reliable source, the New York Times, just says Franken talked about the matter. As for a notable subject not being able to become non-notable, a better analysis is that it was never really notable in the first place, with the application of 20-20 hindsight. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 23:13, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> (or at most, <i>merge</i> per Dhartung and Inkpaduta above). It seems to me that if an article needs to include "incident" or "controversy" in its title, odds are that article usually cannot stand on its own and is better off included in the parent article. A succinct summary in the parent article does not have to mean that the sub-topic cannot be done "justice". This is not wikinews or similar. Only very rarely is it necessary to break-off a single event into a separate article. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 01:05, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Besides <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">Notability being permanent</a>, there is way too much subject-specific information here to be merged to the already-long Air America article. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 08:24, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
