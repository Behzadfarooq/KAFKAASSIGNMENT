<p>The <b><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_mathematics_articles_%28A%29_7e39.html" title="List of mathematics articles (A)">list for the letter A</a></b> alone is larger than all the lists I've built combined!!! And then there's the mathematics topic lists and the list of mathematicians (which is 166 kilobytes long!). That food shouldn't be afforded similar treatment doesn't make any sense, especially considering the central role it plays in all of our lives. If the approach is okay to take on the far broader subjects of Mathematics, Philosophy, Biology, etc., then why isn't it appropriate for the narrower subject of food? Your stance doesn't make any sense. Please explain. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETranshumanist_3b06.html" title="User:Transhumanist">Transhumanist</a> 20:21, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What I think is unmaintainable is that there are way too many food-related topics, because one could include list of foods, food agencies, meal types, etc. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_caterpillar_5cd0.html" title="User:Green caterpillar">Green caterpillar</a> 21:05, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Why do you think that is too many articles? And what is unmaintainable about it having that many articles? What difficulty in managing the page does that present? As pointed out above, Math is far larger, and those guys maintain it just fine. What makes you think that this list will not be any easier to maintain than the huge multi-scope list of mathematics articles? The Math articles list contains thousands upon thousands of links. So how can you conclude that the food list will be too large, when it won't be anywhere near the size of Math? --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETranshumanist_3b06.html" title="User:Transhumanist">Transhumanist</a> 22:20, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, someone could distantly relate almost any article to food, and there would be a lot of disagreement on what should be on that list. For example, users might debate whether articles like <a href="../../../f/e/c/Feces.html" title="Feces">feces</a> should be on the list. I predict there would be a lot of confusion and edit wars too.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, I am thinking of a solution. If we were to make this a category, and make sub-categories, such as "List of fruit-related articles" and "List of Spanish foods related articles", an agreement might be reached. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_caterpillar_5cd0.html" title="User:Green caterpillar">Green caterpillar</a> 22:35, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's much more clearly defined what a mathematics article is than what a food topic is. A mathematics article is an article that is mainly about math. What is a food topic? Does it include farming related articles? Does it include articles about every plant or amimal you can eat? Does it include every dish that has it's own article? I'm if we start to include all all those it's easy to make a list that is longer than the mathematics list within a few days.</dd>
<dd>Moreover, the mathematics list is partially used in the development of better mathematics articles, the food topics list isn't (at the moment). -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 00:24, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you're referring to "food topics", no, I don't think there is one category for it.
