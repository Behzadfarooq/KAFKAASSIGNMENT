<p>This is a one episode character from the Simpsons. He has no real notability besides the one episode, his arguably notable death, and a few cameos(by family and grave).

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Explain to me where this article fails inclusion criteria. He's a notable character from a very notable episode and notability shouldn't be dicatated by his number of appearances. There are entire chapters of books (ie. <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planet_Simpson_9dc8.html" title="Planet Simpson">Planet Simpson</a>) devoted to his one appearance. I'd say that he is more important to the series than half of the characters that have pages and I have no idea why people keep going after this page when there are much less notable Simpsons characters with pages. And, the afd system is being misused. It shouldn't be used with the sole intention of getting an article merged. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 00:19, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I just saw that it was a problem article, so I decided to put it here. I really don't see how any of that earns him a page. That should be what places him apart from nameless characters. Even then, the bulk of the page is a plot summary and trivial cameos, basically the same thing as a list entry linking to the episode article. <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 00:33, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So? Then you slap a clean up tag on it, you don't nominate it for deletion. I think The Simpsons WikiProect has pretty good about merging character pages (there are about 80 right now and I have plans to merge another 10), but I really do think that Grimes is a standout. It also isn't easy to merge pages considering that we're supposed to keep the one-time and recurring character lists short, but they fill up fast. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 00:46, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>There have already been 4 merge attempts on the article and each one has been defeated, so I think people figured that nominating it for afd would be the way to get the job done. Isn't there some sort of policy against using an afd when the nominator just wants to get the page mered? -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 03:45, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I don't know that there is a policy, but I find it the inappropriate thing to do. If people aren't convinced to merge though, maybe that should be a point to consider in not even proposing for deletion. Personally, I was thinking it'd be fine as a merge, but then I looked at the article and said "Hmm, ok, I can accept keeping that" . <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 04:27, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Because there's no functional difference between articles, thus you might as well ask why Homer Simpson is on the same level as the president of the United States. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:33, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>No, I shouldn't. This is a one-time character who is popular among fans and the writers/animators/etc. That does not constitute notability. The problem is that there is a weak criteria for notability, and none of the members of the Simpsons WikiProject are interested in increasing the standard. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 15:13, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li>Well, as I see it, I think your evaluation is based on a faulty premise. An article's existence is a minimal question. There is no level between individual articles in and of themselves, whether it be Frank Grimes, Sideshow Bob, Homer Simpson or Abe Lincoln. One individual article? Means little. The length of the article, now that can mean a lot, or the existence of other articles about aspects of the subject, even a category in some cases. So, I really don't think your complaint makes a difference. Almost everybody could be said to have an article. If that's all you look at, then I'd say your perspective was myopic. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:35, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, although I'm not removing my Keep, if it does end up being merged (like above) then I wouldn't complain.

<dd><b>Comment</b> If Leno goes 'jaywalking' and asks about Damocles, most people won't know. If they do know, they probably know <i>because</i> of <i>The Simpsons</i>. Ask them about Frank Grimes, and you'll get more correct answers than asking for Damocles. So no, at no point will they even be in the same situation. Grimes is much better known by the American proletariat than Damocles will ever hope to be. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromulent_Kwyjibo_1af7.html" title="User:Cromulent Kwyjibo">Cromulent Kwyjibo</a> 23:50, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If they know who Frank Grimes is, yes. The fact of the matter is that even despite that, Damocles deserves an article much more. The only arguments for Frank Grimes are popularity and "I like it", while those against it have redundancy to the episode's article combined with lack of a significant role in the series. Major popularity, minor importance. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 01:01, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Notability is not dictated by the length or number of appearances. Frank Grimes, although he made only one appearance, is a notable character on his own because, as I have said, he has been the subject of many different analysises, such as in Planet Simpson. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 03:14, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Popularity and notability are two entirely different things. The only reason that this AfD won't pass is both because someone posted that it was being AfDing on the Simpsons Project (which is really in bad form, since it looks more like a call to arms than trying to get specific editors involved) and because people use the "I like it" argument. But regardless, the closing admin should take into consideration that the AfD was skewered by the Simpsons cabal being called to arms to defend the article. And by the way, do you have any coverage by a source other than the creators, fans, or a fan site? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 03:34, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Actually, I would say the reason this AfD won't pass is because the argument for deletion is unconvincing. Now that said, the person making the nomination really should have consulted with the project before this action anyway. Not saying whatever their opinion might have been would have forbidden this, but that would have been a better way to go about the process. However, since it was nominated, getting the involvement of editors interested in the subject of the Simpsons is very important, which is why I did add it to the main page. Adding it to the talk page? Bit redundant, but I don't see too much of a difference. Now if somebody is going out and soliciting individuals, that would be more inappropriate. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 06:39, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Excuse me if all WikiProjects can't be as diligent as the video games project when it comes to merging character pages, but when I first joined the project, there were 120 Simpsons character pages and I think we've been doing a good job at getting rid of some while still keeping the recurring and one-timers lists relatively short.

There are Simpsons characters out there with pages who have made even less of an appearance (Hank Scorpio, Fall Out Boy, Happy Little Elves, Worker and Parasite), all of which you've never gone after.

<li>Quick question, is it Grimes being discussed, or Homer's Enemy? For those to really show Grimes as notable, they should have little to no mention of the episode. Also, if these books do truly define his notability, why are they only used to source things that happened in the episode? And ALTTP, I believe those count as secondary sources. They're written by people that study the Simpson's effect on culture(as far as I can tell), which seems to match it's definition.<a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 16:23, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yes, but that is something in the episode. The point of bringing up the books is to say that Grimes is a notable figure beyond the episode, that he isn't bound to it.

<li>I thought that sentence was something that would be original research if not attributed, are you saying the episode says he represents the real world? That the books talk about him is what establishes notability, it's dissecting his appearance in the episode.

<li>Not true, being in multiple episodes doesn't establish notability, and being in one episode doesn't preclude it.

<li>How can you say "per Augurr"? That's not even a legitimate reason to keep. Hell, if I was being a Frank Grimes, I would be in the right - if I'm being Frank Grimes, I would be realistic. So logically, to be a Frank Grimes is to be realistic, so to keep this article would be a Homer Simpson (unrealistic). - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 17:15, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Huh? Who cares!? That's the main premises for your argument in the second half of this AFD! Since you seem to equate "independent of the subject" with "about a completely different topic", I'm not even sure what sources you're referring to. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:21, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The main defense in keeping the article is that Grimes is notable. So far, only the epsisode has been notable. Grimes is always mentioned with the episode. That asserts no notability. <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 20:26, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>What you added basically equates to trivia. A random comparison asserts no notability. <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 20:26, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>If you want him to be notable actually get something that makes him notable. Apparently, you have three books that make Grimes an important part of our culture. Use those. <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 20:34, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>His relevancy outside of that episode is. All sources talking about notability discuss the episode's.

<li>For formatting reasons, I think a seperate article is better. When someone clicks on Homer's Enemy, they should find an article about the episode, not an article half about the episode, and half about FG. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine_Fisher_e4db.html" title="User:Peregrine Fisher">Peregrine Fisher</a> 04:26, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The only thing in the article actually about Grimes(the first two paragraphs in orgins) isn't unique to the article. It can easily be reworded slightly to fit in the production section of HE.
