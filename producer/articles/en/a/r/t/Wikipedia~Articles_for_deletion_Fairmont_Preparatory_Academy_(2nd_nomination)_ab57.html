<li><b>Weak Delete</b> A brief search through the Gale and Proquest peridocial databases yields about 13 newspaper mentions. All seem to be about individual students rather than the school itself. There are two articles (in local paper, the <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_County_Register_1dde.html" title="Orange County Register">Orange County Register</a>) about stellar performance in nationwide high school science comeptitions. There were a couple articles about students who did some humanitarian projects, again from local paper. LA Times has an article profiling a student who "Easily Jumps Language Barrier, Keeps Going; With an awesome 5.1 grade-point average, Oanh Nguyen has earned a spot at USC's medical school" I don't know if this confers notability. I'm leaning towards no becuase none of the articles had the school as a subject, thus failing <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECopysan_6de1.html" title="User:Copysan">Copysan</a> 06:18, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>5.1 GPA is hardly an honor. I had over a 5.1 (just take a couple APs and Honors), yet I didn't have any articles written about me. In any case, GPA is a relative measurement, based on how hard a schools' teachers grade. (See <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grade_inflation.html" title="Grade inflation">Grade_inflation</a>) We should not be basing a school's notability off of a <i>single person</i> (or even multiple people) with a high GPA. I'd even hold off on basing school notability on average standardized test score (ie SATs). (However, if a school was identified as a high performing school and parents adamantly try to get their kids into it, like what happened in some <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> schools this past year, then I'd say that is notable) <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECopysan_6de1.html" title="User:Copysan">Copysan</a> 11:22, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's not a notability critera...

<dd>Well, yes, but we just don't <i>do</i> notability-by-association. Ever.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> First the article, then the process: The school has been recognized by the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Ribbon_Schools_Program_4a5b.html" title="Blue Ribbon Schools Program">Blue Ribbon Schools Program</a> the highest honor granted to a school in the United States. We seem to have consensus at both <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> that selcetion for a national honor by the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Ribbon_Schools_Program_4a5b.html" title="Blue Ribbon Schools Program">Blue Ribbon Schools Program</a> is an extremely strong claim of notability. The article will still benefit from expansion but it seems that some are too intent on destroying articles to allow that. This AfD seems to be yet another extremely bad faith nomination made just hours after the school survived a DRV, showing that there was a broad consensus among Wikipedians that the previous AfD process was contaminated by bias. Without allowing any opportunity to improve the article after the end of the DRV, this AfD seems to be further proof that there is no intention to improve Wikipedia, but a concerted effort to impose a narrow deletionist view in the face of an overwhelming consensus to the contrary. Couldn't you have waited a few more hours -- maybe even a few days -- before you started your attacks again? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 21:03, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> You (continue to) wrongly assume that a claim to notability automatically implies notability. It does not. Yes, Fairmont has a claim to notability -- being a Blue Ribbon school -- indicating that non-trivial outside coverage is <i>possible</i>. However, <i>actual</i> notability is shown by <i>actually finding</i> such coverage, which we can use to write a good Wikipedia article. Yet the only non-trivial outside source that anybody has found in the 10 days of the first AFD and the DRV is the 255-word write-up in (the local edition of) the LA Times. This is not enough to build a Wikipedia article on. You say this article will "benefit from expansion," but you provide no evidence that this can be done. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:00, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Fwiw, Alansohn, the renomination was standard procedure since the call to restore at DRV was just a slight majority. On "can't impove", the article was userfied in your userspace during the DRV, so neither of your claims are anywhere near factual, and I would recommend you re-read <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom and previous AfD. I fail to see the "very hard to deny" argument by Alansohn: do you mean the old argument for many (school) AfD's that the article will somehow improve in the future, although no one really says how it will improve and what sources will be used to do that? The Blue Ribbon is not giving any notability, as indicated by the lack of press coverage and in-depth articles the award has generated, and the International Baccalaureate program is even worse in that regard (the schools pay to become one: not really an award, isn't it?). This school is not notable, and those wanting to keep it have had more than enough time to demonstrate the oppposite, but have failed to do so.<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 06:22, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Subject is still notable as an International Baccalaureate school, part of the Blue Ribbon Schools Program, and for being the largest and oldest non-sectarian private school in the area. Wikipedia has no shortage of those who are in denial, but this is not a valid reason for deletion, the article clearly and concisely demonstrates notability and meets <i>all</i> relevant inclusion policies. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 07:35, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
