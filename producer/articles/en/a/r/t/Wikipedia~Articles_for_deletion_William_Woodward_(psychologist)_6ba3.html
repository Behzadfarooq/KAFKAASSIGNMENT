<p>Completely non-notable academic. Only claim of notability is that he teaches that 9/11 is a US conspiracy in his psych classes.

<dd><b>Comment</b> This point ought to be explained clearly somewhere for future reference. I often read the argument "this prof is notable because he edited a book". Now, as people familiar with academic circles can all confirm, this is very much commonplace and definitely not a sign of notability. Tons of conference proceedings or books gathering a series of articles on a given topic are published every year and all have two or three editors whose job is to run the peer-review process. This is an important task but it is a technical one and I have personally attended conferences in which the cited editors include students who were generous enough to help with that job. Bottom line is: being the <i>author</i> of a book published by a prestigious academic press is indication of notability, being the <i>editor</i> means that there are other academics who are grateful you volunteered for the job. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 20:46, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Academic achievements seem to be well under the bar for notability, but when you add in the controversy, can he squeak in? According to the article, he was singled out for fairly harsh criticism by the state's governor. IMO this debate should probably focus on whether the amount of controversy is notable, and not just on whether he's a notable academic (he's not). <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> 18:09, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

I don't see adequate evidence that he meets <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> without that sentence. The relevant part of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person. (Multiple similar stories describing a single day's news event only count as one coverage.)" While we have two reliable independent sources, they appear to be a single day's news event.

<li><b>Delete</b> Fails <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>. Not a notable academic by Wikipedia standards. Number of citations on Google Scholar is low, and includes books he edited. And as Pascal Tesson points out above, editing a book is a far cry from writing a book (and there's no citations of authored books for Woodward here). Class controversy is not quite a storm in a teacup but is certainly not encyclopedically notable to justify an article on Woodward. Brief mention in the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholars_for_9_11_Truth_0d0c.html" title="Scholars for 9/11 Truth">Scholars for 9/11 Truth</a> article would be ok. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 01:47, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I apologize if my nomination of this article came across as being in bad faith, but that was not my intention. If you look at the 9/11 "Truth" Movement articles on wikipedia you'll see a gazillion stubs of people and books who are not notable. For example, books that are owned by fewer than forty libraries in the world, films that are released only on the web to almost no press coverage, individuals who have no claim to notability other than a few one sentence quotes in newspaper articles, etc. How could any of these articles ever become encyclopedic and NPOV? It is entirely reasonable for a user browsing this section of wikipedia to feel like we're promoting, legitimizing and popularizing complete nobodies who have a viewpoint many find offensive. I have no problem with Striver personally - his contributions to articles pertaining to Shi'a Islam seem to have been highly praised - but I don't want wikipedia to become a soapbox for every self-promoting nobody with an idea.</dd>
<dd>As for this specific article, please remember that we're talking about an academic who fails the "professor test" (i:e is not any more notable than the average professor). The only way this article might be encyclopedic is if the controversy is encyclopedic, but will anyone remember it a few months from now? Although it just started a week ago, a google news search for "William Woodward" reveals only 35 unique articles related to the controversy, with a number of these being very brief mentions, blog posts and letters to the editor. Nobody will remember this guy in a month. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 23:32, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I've had to put a bit more thought into this afd, than some of the other nn 9/11 truth articles. I was the one that came up with most of the first paragraph, taking it from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Woodward_%28psychologist%29&amp;oldid=73238653" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Woodward_%28psychologist%29&amp;oldid=73238653" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Woodward_%28psychologist%29&amp;oldid=73245937" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Woodward_%28psychologist%29&amp;oldid=73245937" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Pretty much the most notable thing I found was "In the Fall 2006 semester, he wants to teach a class that explores 9/11 "in psychological terms". With this AFD, I've done more searching to try and find out what's come of this class he wants to teach? But, it seems the news headlines have died down since then (despite the 9/11 coming up soon). This is evidenced by searching the Union Leader (NH) website <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22william+woodward%22+site:unionleader.com&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22william+woodward%22+site:unionleader.com&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. I also tried to find out this information by searching the UNH website, also to no avail. Given the lack of sources following up on this story, I don't find this 9/11 controversy notable enough and as a prof, he doesn't meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or the proposed <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> criteria. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AudeVivere_35a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/AudeVivere">contribs</a> <a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_Contributions_4e83.html" title="User:AudeVivere/Contributions">as tagcloud</a>)</small> 01:00, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
