<p>Photographer whose main (perhaps only?) claim to notability is tastefully photographing his improbably curvacious girlfriend (who also has a WP article: <a href="../../../b/i/a/Bianca_Beauchamp_cd39.html" title="Bianca Beauchamp">Bianca Beauchamp</a>) in latex or bikinis or whatever for magazines of the kinds that I suppose come sealed in cellophane (no evidence supplied) and websites. Mentions of and links to the latter abound. No independent verification is supplied (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) for anything but the websites, there's no hint of notability per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and the article (the interests of whose contributors seem limited to Perreault and Beauchamp) has a whiff of promotion about it. <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 02:36, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>REPLY TO THE ABOVE: This profile is as valid as any other. The above statement is pure discrimination against the work that I do.</p>
<p>My credentials can be easily verified online. A simple search on Google with my name will show articles about my work (notably from eros-zine online) and more searches will show LOTS about model Bianca Beauchamp, who is internationally known. Evidence is supplied many times, on both profiles. Googling any of the two names will provide anyone with more than enough information on the validity of these profiles. Further more, a list of all publications I have done can be found here: <a href="http://www.martinperreault.com/magazines.html" class="external free" title="http://www.martinperreault.com/magazines.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.martinperreault.com/magazines.html</a> . Each editor can be contacted to verify my credentials. Yes, I do shoot my "curvacious girlfriend". An article about someone should not be deleted on the simple fact that a viewer dislikes the art produced by the artist(s). A forum full of people who know about my work can be found here: <a href="http://forum.biancabeauchamp.com" class="external free" title="http://forum.biancabeauchamp.com" rel="nofollow">http://forum.biancabeauchamp.com</a> . This profile is not about self promotion. Fans started this page and I help them fix it with correct details. The same aplpies for profile Bianca Beauchamp, to which I only started contributing lightly very recently, even though her profile has existed for over 2 years. My involvement to both profiles is only to make sure of the validity of the information posted. For example, images users have posted on these two profiles were deleted due to copyright infringement; but by posting the same pictures myself, and by adding the information that I shot them, it makes them legit. The simple fact that my username on Wikipedia is the same as my real name shows that I do not hide behind a false name, like others might do to self promote. My involvement is to make sure the information posted is accurate. I can be contacted on my website www.martinperreault.com or on model BiancaBeauchamp.com website. I invite anyone here to contact the editors of the following magazines to verify the above information: Bizarre Magazine (UK) www.bizarremag.com to which I shot their covers 5 times in 2 years; Skin Two Magazine (UK) www.skintwo.com to which I shot their cover 2 times and featured in them many times. Marquis Magazine (www.marquis.de) for which I shot their cover 2 times in two years, _ many features. Penthouse Australia for which I shot their cover feature last year. Playboy Enterprise (www.playboyse.com) for which I shot a feature in Playboy SE in 2006 with model Bianca Beauchamp (who appeared many times in Playboy SE and on their cover of the Lingerie Edition). I think this should be more than enough to prove the validity of this profile. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinperreault_8633.html" title="User:Martinperreault">Martin Perreault - www.martinperreault.com</a> 04:05, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article doesn't assert as to why he's notable, and appears to be somewhat autobiographical - possible POV issues, as it were. Excellent photography, though - but as has been demonstrated so many times, <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">I like it</a> is not a good reason to keep. Note to Martin, please remember to be <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a> in this discussion, and feel free to ask questions. My advice: change our minds. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 04:22, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment/response</b>: <i>An article about someone should not be deleted on the simple fact that a viewer dislikes the art produced by the artist(s).</i> Strong agreement! And two comments. First, the visual evidence presented here shows that Perreault has a fine sense of light and how to use it; he seems to be an excellent photographer and my guess, fwiw, is that he'll go far. I hope he does. Secondly, while latex doesn't happen to be my thing, I've nothing against photos of pneumatic girls in bikinis, especially when the bikinis are much too small. So as it happens I don't dislike the art. ¶ However, this doesn't (yet) add up to notability or verifiability. It's unusual, to say the least, to say that verification can and should be sought by direct appeal to publishers. For other photographers, the verification is out there on independent, credible websites, in published books, etc. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 04:30, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> These aren't "profiles" but "articles", and if there are perceptions that this is anything like myspace or the like than that is certainly incorrect. That being said, while the sources stated <i>may</i> be able to provide validation (although we'll need to cite sources that are accessible to a reader though, as far as I know); I don't believe those are enough to provide notability? Simply being the fact that you were a part of these things doesn't mean you are notable, and while you can personally verify a lot of information, it needs to be verifiable through <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable 3rd party sources</a>. I haven't looked enough at the topic to know if that is possible, but if it is, and it is accomplished, I would have no objection to the article, as it is now, it needs to assert notability and verifiably prove statements. 66.159.174.217 05:38, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Martin Perreault might not be (yet) a worldwide celebrity, but he’s definitely a world known and one of the most appreciated photographers in a certain (fetish) subculture. To address the issues mentioned above:<br />
<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable 3rd party sources</a>:With time I believe Wikipedia have grown from a pure scientific encyclopedia to something bigger. There are many articles about politics, art and other fields of human existence, where a reliable source is not as clearly defined as in the guideline targeting mainly science. Still the mentioned magazines and e-magazines – repeated publishing inside them and even being author of several of their covers, so as covers of several books, that all IMHO is a good sign of notability. Another sign of notability should be that several other world famous fetish models worked with Martin Perrault and they include his work in their portfolio. (The links to Internet incarnations of some of the mentioned magazines and models: <a href="http://www.skintwo.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.skintwo.com/" rel="nofollow">Skin Two</a>, <a href="http://www.marquis.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.marquis.com/" rel="nofollow">Marquis</a>, <a href="http://www.playboy.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.playboy.com/" rel="nofollow">Playboy</a>, <a href="http://www.bizarremag.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.bizarremag.com/" rel="nofollow">Bizarre Magazine</a>, <a href="http://www.penthouse.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.penthouse.com/" rel="nofollow">Penthouse</a>, <a href="http://www.juliestrain.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.juliestrain.com/" rel="nofollow">Julie Strain</a>, <a href="http://www.rubberella.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.rubberella.com/" rel="nofollow">Jean Bardot</a>,<a href="http://www.emilymarilyn.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.emilymarilyn.com/" rel="nofollow">Emily Marilyn</a>, <a href="http://www.darenzia.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.darenzia.net/" rel="nofollow">Darenzia</a>, <a href="http://www.tempestnyc.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.tempestnyc.com/" rel="nofollow">Storm</a>, <a href="http://www.suzanwayland.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.suzanwayland.com/" rel="nofollow">Sway</a>, <a href="http://www.masuimimax.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.masuimimax.com/" rel="nofollow">Masuimi Max</a>).<br />
<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>): Isn’t this a catch XXII a little – especially in case of an article about a person. It’s not correct to write a biography about a person until somebody writes a biography about the person. Still in several articles about and/or interviews with him I read his short bio – if it’s enough.<br />
The fact that Martin Perrault contributes to the article himself was addressed already but allow me to repeat it. If you observe his edits, you will notice they serve to accurate some information and to ensure the legal use of photos. Does it fall under <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a> – I would say not.<br />
IchiAi being a <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single purpose account</a> is not true. I know the person, so I can assure you –as far as you will believe me - he contributed to several articles, but created his account only when decided to write a completely new entry to Wikipedia. And something very similar applies to me. Naturally we edit only what is in the field of our interest.<br />
Using word "profile" instead "article": not everybody is a native speaker and/or everyday contributor to Wikipedia (like me for example). Then it can easily happen such person don’t use a best expression.<br />
And a final note to <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a>: Even tough you tell you are not against this kind of photography some of your words in the first paragraph hints otherwise. Why that personal and disparage remarks? <i>.... posted by <a href="../../../r/i/k/User%7ERikapt_6c0a.html" title="User:Rikapt">Rikapt</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rikapt_a40c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rikapt">contributions</a>), who didn't sign</i></li>

<li>(i) <i>The links to Internet incarnations of some of the mentioned magazines and models</i>: Links to the websites of the magazines prove nothing.

But note <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> on notable photographers: "Published [...] photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work."

(iii)&#160;<i>Why that personal and disparage remarks?</i> What's at issue here is not me but the article. But OK, I'll bite: How were my remarks disparaging?

(i) Such content you required is in payed zone so it can't be linked directly. Does it not count then? And how to prove the appearance in paper versions of the magazines you don't know?<br />

Still somebody pointed out Martin to react in <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a> way, so maybe he failed to notice your initial style might have initiate that reaction.

<li><b>Keep</b> Martin Perreault is an accomplished photographer and his work impacts not only the fetish world, but the world of, say, gamers - as it was his photography and work with Bianca that allowed her to become the "living model" of Elexis Sinclair in promotion of Ritual's "Sin Episodes" game series. I believe his work has significance and he has credibility and esteem enough to warrant a wiki article, which is why I started an account, so I could add this article. I have been an anonymous contributor to Wiki for some time, and I am a little annoyed that simply because I was required to start an account in order to create a new article, it is assumed that I have not contributed before. Is it not clear from the layout of the page (there was help from others - this too, is evidence that Mr. Perreault has a fan following and deserves a Wiki page) that this is a serious attempt to start an informative, biographical article? How much space does this take from Wiki? Any move against this article is, to my mind, simply puritanical cleansing and censorship. Please reconsider. IchiAi 17:29, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, Perreault is clearly an excellent photographer, but one whose notability is not yet established. The article fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> as it shows no independent verification of the details. It also fails <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> as the <i>only</i> references are to the sites maintained by Bianca Beauchamp and Mr. Perreault (and many of the details of Beauchamp's site require paid registration). Moreover, the article does not demonstrate a claim for notability, only a hallow claim that he is "an accomplished photographer (although I agree, the article does not demonstrate) . . . best known for his work with long time professional and personal partner, Bianca Beauchamp." As an aside (because this is not a fatal flaw), the article reads very much like an autobiography, full of details of interest primarily to one's self and, perhaps, one's mother. ["Perreault was excited by the fabric, but Bianca was a bit nervous about it. As a way of overcoming her fear and showing her affection for Perreault, she purchased the dress in secret and surprised him at a Halloween party. Eventually she posed for him for fun, wearing the latex dress. Although she was nervous at first, Beauchamp quickly came out of her shell and warmed up to the camera."] Delete and when Perreault does meet the standards by accumulating verifiable professional accolades by others, the article can be recreated. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMindsEye_e83c.html" title="User:TheMindsEye">TheMindsEye</a> 20:12, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Fringe notability but also blatant self promotion.

I will not deny the article about M. Perreault needs work, but no article is born perfect. Deleting it at this poing would be overly draconian. M. Perrault has also been inteviewed about his work in more mainstream media, including French and English Canadian TV chanels - Perhaps these should be added as references to the article. --<a href="../../../o/b/s/User%7EObserver31_3157.html" title="User:Observer31">Observer31</a> 19:18, 6 January 2007 (EST)</li>

<li><i>Comment</i> I see this argument here -- other articles are not notable, so why not let this one pass -- and must say that it is not persuasive to me. Following it to the natural conclusion would be a lowering of Wiki standards for all articles. Or perhaps you are suggesting that we just lower standards for Fetish Photographers? Rather than agreeing to lower standards, I would prefer to work on rooting out the articles that you think are less" well supported than this one."</li>

<dd>Moreover, I also find the documentation to not fully support your point. A look at the list of photographers on the <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetish_photographer.html" title="Fetish photographer">Fetish photographer</a> page reveals that four of the articles -- Andru Chrisst, Edward Lee, Timothy Hughes, and Kristina Vassilieva were deleted through Wiki processes. Apparently other editors have chosen to maintain Wiki policies rather than weakening them.

<li>I disagree, an artist who achieves mass penetration with his works is notable regardless of the field. I did point out that this is an opinion. A magazine is a third party source, the titles mentioned a notable ones. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">Malla</span></a><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMallanox_41c6.html" title="User talk:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">nox</span></a> 04:18, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Magazines have different covers every month created by literally hundreds of thousands of commercial photographers, some are notable some are not. Wiki policy on photographers notability is as follows: "Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work"(are considered notable). As far as I can tell no reputable reviews or awards can be cited. Just as an example I read the English car magazine <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evo.html" title="Evo">evo</a> they have 10-15 contributing photographers who have done covers none have Wikipedia articles because they are not notable just as Perreault is not. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<ul>
<li>That argument is a bit weak - Evo is a magazine about cars, not a magazine about car photography. Having one's photos on the cover of Skin Two is, within that field, a much greater achievement.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would like to state, for the record, that I am not a "sock puppet", nor is Observer or Rikapt. MartinPerreault is indeed the same man the article is about, and he has edited it to correct some small details about his life. Has it ever occured to anyone that perhaps casual wiki readers/anonymous contributors, when they see an article that is about someone whose work they admire marked for deletion, might come out of the woodwork, so to be speak, in order to speak out against it? I find this whole thing ridiculous and a bit disheartening, as I have been an avid supporter and reader of Wikipedia for years.IchiAi 04:10, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I understand the importance of being careful with inclusion of articles on Wikipedia being a project about archiving knowledge and information. I would like to clarify a few things: I am not posting under multiple usernames like some above have been implying. I know how "first time posters" make it look like that. These first time posters are people that follow Bianca Beauchamp's career on her website. I am very much present on these websites, being that I do all the photography there and more. So these people are very much aware of my work, and notability in the fetish scene worldwide. The article was started by one of them as a matter of fact, which also explains the reason why I came here myself to make minor modifications to the article because some details were wrong. I understand how this may look to many. Further more, as if this didn't look bad enough, one of our server is down at the moment due to a DOS ATTACK. So biancabeauchamp.com and martinperreault.com are have been down for 24 hours and as I write this, they still are down. Sure enough, some might see this as a sign that we are phony. Personally, I question the very odd timing as well for such an attack, but for other reasons. That said, I can certainly only state once more that this whole Wikipedia Article was done with good intention and is not a promo scheme. I understand there are ways and guidelines to follow at Wikipedia, and I am certain they were created to make sure Wikipedia remains a reliable source of information. Therefore, I leave it up to the Wikipedia contributors to make the final decision, and to look at the situation factually and not through eyes of suspicion. I would like to take this opportunity to publically thank the original contributor who started this article. I think you did a very good job and I am honored you thought important to contribute my name to the online encyclopedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> Per Rikapt and Hoary. Wikipedia needs to be careful with contemporary art and artists, that's true. However, I see a large number of supports of notability, and the entire nom is written so as to be skewed against his particular subject matter and style of photography. Further, at least some of the voters on this particular AfD have an established history of trying to police WIkipedia and remove articles of a ...'prurient' nature.

<dd>In summary, he does appear to be known within his realm, but the reliability of many sources is not sufficiently strong. Although there have been hits about him even in German, a lot of the detail in the article is very personal, and fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. My "week keep" vote change above is sustained by the articles in Fleshbot, Eros.com. We seem to be dredging the bottom of all available links to find articles to properly assert notability, and two articles does not equal "multiple" per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<dl>
<dd>I agree with Ohconfucius for the most part. The article will probably end up being kept because it is unlikely a delete consensus will be reached as the subject is near the very edge of notablity (IMO on the wrong side of it), but if that is the case it will need clean up to lessen the promotional tone and do away with information coming from autobiographical sources. If it were up to me I would <b>merge</b> with the Beauchamp article a section mentioning her primary photographer is all that is really necessary as there arn't really any good sources for the additional information. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

Especially in the case of Skin Two and Marquis magazines, that are worldwide sold magazines, whose main target of interest is fetish fashion and photography. Also repeated feature appearances in them (I have listed only the cover appearances, not the many inside features, and the ones I have access to; perhaps others could confirm the rest of apperances mentioned on MP's web), especially MP not being their employee, I don't find trivial.</dd>

<dd>This isn't about proving that Perreault exists or that he is a photographer, I think we all agree on those points. But there is no link to any article in Marquis, and the article in Skin Two says nothing of significance about him: he is a photographer, he shot 10 pages for the magazine, he was in Los Angeles. How is that notable? If you read a random sample of Wikipedia articles on other photographers to get a better idea of what makes a photographer notable. Here's a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_photographers.html" title="List of photographers">list of photographers</a> to help.<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 18:37, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> The issue here is not the subject matter of the photography, nor the subject matter or context of the few references/links provided, but rather that when you boil the article down to its facts we know only that a fetish/pin-up photographer named Martin Perreault was born in Montreal, possibly studied at Concordia University, has mostly photographed 1 model, has created two websites, and once hosted a fetish ball. How does that information suggest that Perreault is more notable than any of literally millions of photographers or artists around the world? Surely every editor on this page knows first-hand at least a few people with similarly illustrious CVs. I don't believe it's Wikipedia policy but it is common sense that the burden of proof for notablility ought to be on the editors <i>proposing</i> an article for inclusion and not on those who argue for deletion. People like Nan Goldin, Weegee and Robert Mapplethorpe have all photographed subjects belonging to various subcultures (usually with far more scandalous imagery than any of Perreault's images I've looked at) and they are included in Wikipedia because they have been exhibited, books and articles examinging their work have been published, and they have an easily traceable influence on society. The sources cited for Perreault, on the other hand, provide virtually no substantial information, certainly nothing to suggest that he is worthy of an article in a serious encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 17:56, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Pretty much my opinion as well. Now, if any of these fetish magazines had published articles about him or interviews, I'd consider him a notable person within the fetish community - and I know they do publish such articles. Right now, I'd say the time for an article on him has not yet come, if nothing else because there are no good third party sources that say anything significant about him. So far, if anyone's notable, it's his model - she at least gets the recognisability of having been on these magazine covers. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 06:21, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Pinkville. There simply isn't anything to suggest he is of encyclopaedic notability. GassyGuy 21:33, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Why such oversimplification of M.Pereault's (MP) appearances in the magazines? It's not true he has appeared in magazines only once or twice. As I mentioned at the beginning of the list I included only the referenced material I have access to and also the most notable ones (e.g. covers) and skipped the almost regular feature appearance in them. Secondly, listing more influential photographers to be the reason why MP should not have an article is weird. (Does the fact that <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> has an article mean <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Penrose_86ab.html" title="Roger Penrose">Roger Penrose</a> can't have it? Hardly.) The argument MP lacks awards is also weak simply because there are no such awards in fetish photography. So to enrich the list of reference (either by new ones or by adding extended information):<br />
&#160;* A photographer being included in the Fetish Anthology 4 (the last edition) book needs a great degree of notability. Being it a selection of few best artists in the genre is far from trivial<br />
&#160;* In the last issue of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquis_%28magazine%29.html" title="Marquis (magazine)">Marquis magazine</a> (#40) a (positive) review of the book MP created and published together with his muse <a href="../../../b/i/a/Bianca_Beauchamp_cd39.html" title="Bianca Beauchamp">Bianca Beauchamp</a> can be found<br />
&#160;* <a href="http://www.secretmag.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.secretmag.com/" rel="nofollow">Secret magazine</a> ( another fetish magazine, distributed worldwide) brings a color portfolio of MP’s photography. Quote from their webpage (first sentence): <i>Secret Issue #30 has a special color portfolio with Martin Perreault and fetish star/model "Bianca"</i><br />
&#160;* Two leading latex fashion producing companies, Vex and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymorphe.html" title="Polymorphe">Polymorphe</a> chose MP's work to advertise their creations<br />
The whole latex fashion phenomenon is recently going mainstream. It influences game industry, music, movies, generally all pop-culture, but even haute-couture fashion. We are trying to show you Martin Perreault and his photography, of course in close collaboration with his muse and life partner Bianca, have a strong influence to the fetish movement in recent years and are its trendsetters. They created one of the very first fetish websites. And although there are many other fetish photographers, MP helped develop the "glamour" side of fetish, apart from the classic BDSM art. For that reasons he (also) deserves an article on Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../r/i/k/User%7ERikapt_6c0a.html" title="User:Rikapt">Rikapt</a> 12:14, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The claims you make here for Perreault's influence may be true, but you have not provided any evidence to support them. This is the first mention of a book by him... does it have a title? Is it readily available? so his photos have appeared in various magazines... that's fine but not in itself notable. There are thousands of stock photographers, thousands of perfectly competent or even excellent photographers whose work appears in magazines, yet who aren't notable in any sense that's meaningful for an encyclopaedia. You didn't like the comparison between Perreault and Goldin, Mapplethorpe and Weegee (though I hardly think your Einstein and Penrose comparison is analogous), well how about comparing <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francesca_Woodman_89f9.html" title="Francesca Woodman">Francesca Woodman</a> or <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Veltri_15a4.html" title="John Veltri">John Veltri</a> or <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francesco_Scavullo_8ee7.html" title="Francesco Scavullo">Francesco Scavullo</a> with Perreault? Such comparisons are indeed apt, because the photographers I've mentioned <i>do</i> satisfy the criteria for notability, they constitute a basis to judge others. Let's take up your Einstein/Penrose comparison. First, Penrose is a hugely important physicist, so the ostensible contrast in notability between him and Eisntein doesn't actually exist. A more appropriate contrast would be between either Einstein or Penrose and a graduate student in physics. The latter may someday become a great physicist in her/his own right, but at the moment they're just building up a CV. If/when anything sustantive is written about Perreault's photography then a Wikipedia article will be appropriate, but not now. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 15:12, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>It is a shame that, rather than being allowed to grow this article slowly and naturally, with care, I must instead dump a list of credentials in order to stop the article from being deleted.</p>
<dl>
<dd>A shame? Frankly, that's a bizarre comment. Every article in Wikipedia is supposed to "dump a list of credentials" to support the subject's claim to notability. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 19:10, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Credential do not always add up to notablity. All this list really shows is that Perreault is a moderately successful fetish photographer. Many many comercial photographers could post lists many times longer then this one without establishing any notablity. The only things that I can see on this list that might take a step towards being good sources are the two interviews but being the subject of a grand total of three pages of independent material doesn't do much for me. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<dd>I think the evidence presented is compelling. I wonder if we may have an example of a commericial photographer who has a list of uses of their work many times longer who is not notable? <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">Malla</span></a><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMallanox_41c6.html" title="User talk:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">nox</span></a> 00:20, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Of course there are plenty. I list several commercial photographers among my acquaintances. As far as I know they have never sought articles in Wikipedia and it hasn't crossed my mind to make articles for them. This is no criticism of them as photographers or as people: they're excellent photographers and good people. They have much longer lists; and lists that tend to be more varied, though it's true that commercial photographers tend to concentrate on certain areas (cars, interiors, etc.; one of the trickiest is visually compelling piping hot food, from which [genuine!] steam must rise according to popular expectations if not normal reality). -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 00:50, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That doesn't really answer my question, I haven't been swayed by any arguments presented here. Four of the magazines in which he has contributed I could buy in my local newsagent off the shelf, his work has clearly been seen by an awful lot of people. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">Malla</span></a><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMallanox_41c6.html" title="User talk:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">nox</span></a> 01:25, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Just because many people have seen his work does not make him notable. In order to meet the notablity criteria we need multiple reputable sources asserting his notablity (ie articles about him), as it stands now all we really have is a list of times his photos have appeared in magazines, I want go back to my evo magazine example from above, many of the photographers who contribute to this magazine have much longer resumes, but since non of them have been written about (to my knowledge)none are notable, when some people write articles about Perreault then he can be included, until then he is just another comercial photographer. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<dd>Marquis 40 (the printed edition) has reviewed his latest book - I can't be more substantial than that because I don't have it yet. As far as the Evo magazine argument, please see my reply to your prior comment above <a href="../../../o/b/s/User%7EObserver31_3157.html" title="User:Observer31">Observer31</a> 22:52, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A review of a book by Perreault is a step in the right direction, as for the evo comparison I think it is valid, it is a magazine about cars, the magazines represented above are about fetishs. In both cases the photographer is seprate from the subject and is thus not notable merely for having there photographs on the cover of a magazine. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<dd>"<i>I can't be more substantial than that because I don't have it yet</i>" See, I have a problem with this.

<li><b>Delete</b>, per Pinkville. Supplying material for magazine covers shouldn't blindly justify notability. I don't see anywhere else bios about this person. He is no Helmut Newton, possibly wouldn't meet standards of pro photography in other fields. Also, references that lure to membership solicitation aren't very cool and smack of <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">soapbox</a>. -<a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurgh_9136.html" title="User:Murgh"><font size="-1" color="DarkSlateGray">M</font><font size="-3" color="DarkSlateGray">URGH</font></a> <a href="../../../m/u/r/User_talk%7EMurgh_f175.html" title="User talk:Murgh"><font size="-5"><sup>disc.</sup></font></a> 18:49, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't agree with your delete position, but I do agree that, in an effort to shore up the article, the number of references going back to B. Beauchamp's and M. Perreault's site has gotten a bit out of hand. I will try to correct that when I have time. <a href="../../../o/b/s/User%7EObserver31_3157.html" title="User:Observer31">Observer31</a> 00:57, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
