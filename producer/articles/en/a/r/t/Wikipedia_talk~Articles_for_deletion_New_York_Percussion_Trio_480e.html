	    <p>This is precisely the reason I created the article. This group did do pioneering work in new music, performance on traditional Indian percussion instruments, and in promoting percussion music to general audiences, yet little information is available about them. I am interviewing surviving members of the group via telephone in order to find out more about the various composers (many) who they commissioned for new works for percussion. Wiki serves an important function in providing interlinked information unavailable elsewhere. This article will be continually expanded and I hope others don't feel it is a waste of bandwidth. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 19:37, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Respectfully, I don't believe the purpose of Wikipedia is to create notability, but instead to document that which is already notable. The results of the vote clear things up if I'm mistaken. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">Chairboy</a> 19:57, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree; your "research" seems to consist solely of Google searching (a very incomplete/impartial and selective "history") while mine deals with printed sources as well as primary sources (the performers themselves). Respectfully, in this case I'll ask you to defer to those who are sincerely using Wiki to further cultural knowledge and bark up another tree, as the contents of this article has more cultural significance than a great many other articles that you are (justifiably) attempting to have deleted. There are many more worthy candidates and your time would be better spent going after those, or creating new articles of your own on subjects in your own particular expertise. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 20:40, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in this article. <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> states that an article must meet at least one *criterion*, not "criteria." If you re-examine both the article and <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines you will see that the article does do this. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 23:31, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for your continued interest in the New York Percussion Trio article. Please continue to keep in mind that the Internet/Google is not the be-all and end-all of the world's knowledge, and that you will not always be able to find the answers to everything there. Here is the answer to your question:</p>
<p><i>Has had a Top 100 hit on any national music chart, in a large or medium-sized country*</i></p>
<p><b>NO</b> - This generally doesn't apply to classical music, and particularly contemporary classical music, which appeals to small numbers of listeners (hence a greater need for Wiki coverage as information is not readily available elsewhere, as with popular musics)</p>
<p><i>Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in a large or medium-sized country*</i></p>
<p><b>YES</b> - Toured India c. 1959, where they gathered Indian percussion instruments, becoming among the first American percussion ensemble to use such instruments (I am still gathering information from the surviving group members about their tours throughout the U.S.)</p>
<p><i>Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable)</i></p>
<p><b>NO, BUT</b> - Released one LP on a major label (Vox) and one 16mm educational film</p>
<p><i>Has been prominently featured in any major music media</i></p>
<p><b>UNDETERMINED</b> - The group was probably featured in music periodicals of the time; more research is needed, and will be done</p>
<p><i>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise extremely notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such</i></p>
<p><b>YES</b> - Two members were also longtime members of the New York City Ballet Orchestra (one retired this year) as well as other major New York City classical music ensembles</p>
<p><i>Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both, as in British hip hop); note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability.</i></p>
<p><b>YES</b> (qualified) - Most percussion ensembles are quartets or larger; this group was a notable percussion trio in its time, and the most important percussion trio in the city of New York (arguably the most important North American city for classical music; musical activities that take place there often become known around the country). Although they are not well known today, they were during the 1950s and 1960s, enough to get an appearance on national TV on a program hosted by Steve Allen. (In comparison, I can't recall any percussion ensemble besides STOMP performing on the Jay Leno, David Letterman, or Conan O'Brien programs, so this was quite a notable appearance indeed.)</p>
<p><i>Has won a major music award, such as a Grammy, Juno or Mercury Music Award</i></p>
<p><b>UNCERTAIN</b> - more research is needed</p>
<p>Hope you'll now consider moving on to the deletion of more inane articles, which are much worthier of deletion, or to enriching Wikipedia by writing articles in your own area of expertise.</p>
