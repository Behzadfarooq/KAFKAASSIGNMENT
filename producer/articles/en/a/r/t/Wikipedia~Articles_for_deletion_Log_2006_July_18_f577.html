<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>).

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>. This has gone on long enough. Painting in very broad strokes: on the one hand, we have a vast number of editors who argue persuasively that this article does (and must by its nature) consist of unverifiable claims, original research, and no reliable sources. On the other hand, we have a slightly smaller number of editors who argue that this article should be kept for various reasons: (1) That Wikipedia has a duty to not delete articles about any entity criticizing it, (2) that various editors who favor deletion are acting in bad faith, and (3) since we have other articles that are similar to this one, it's unfair to delete this one. Those three "keep" arguments are all spectacularly unpersuasive, and (for the most part) do not address the objections raised to the article other than to assert their falsity. Added to this we have the spectacle of solicitation and/or spamming for keep votes. I have no opinion on Encyclopedia Dramatica — never having heard of it before tonight — but I am using my discretion and bringing this to a close, so we can hopefully all move on. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 05:25, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>None taken, but I don't base my sense of humor on geography, or on what other people think is appropriate or funny. If there was any possible question that ED was even <i>claiming</i> to represent their content as factual, that would be one story, but they're pretty blatant about the fact they they lie all the time. Come to think of it... I live in the US, and I've seen just about every televised comedian I'm aware of get laughs from auditoriums full of Americans by saying that Michael Jackson is a pedophile. We Americans have a strange and creepy fascination with pedophilia, throwing moral panics over it while continually pushing the envelope as far as sexualization of children in our advertizing. It's disgusting, and it's killing people, and it deserves to be mocked, quckly and repeatedly, because humor is an excellent weapon against social rot. I find the way ED parodies our culture's unhealthy fascination with pedophilia to be smart, incisive, and often hilarious. I am quite proud of the work they're doing there, whether or not you "can imagine" that I feel that way. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 12:03, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I believe that this concept isn't relevant to a WP:AFD. If an editor votes a particular way in an AFD, the only considerations the closing admin should consider are: (1) the strength of their arguments (if given), and (2) their experience/role in the Wikipedia community (factors to be weighed -- in no particular order -- include level of activity, level of recent activity, adminship/arbcom/mediator/etc., length of time here, quality of contributions, etc.). Whether or not the voter is associated with the website being AFD'ed is in my view irrelevant. --<a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a> 10:47, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've admited in previous AfDs that I am also a member of ED. I don't see a need to recuse myself (or for the other ED members here to recuse themselves). Its not just your wikipedia, its OUR wikipedia, and we all have a right to chime in our opinion on the AfD. As <a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a> said right above me, there are more important considerations to review then if one of the Wiki Editors here has expressed an opinion is also an ED member. Also, if you look at ED, my last real contribution was on February 18, 2006 http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/Special:Contributions/Azathar. Your status isn't as important as your opinion. Its more important to write a logical, rational reason about whether you want to keep or delete an article versus your relationship to the article.

<li>The notability of the site is still being debated after the issue was first raised a day or two ago, and this deletion was immediately forced through after editors complained about perceived bias (almost immediately after). Admins do a good job, but this does feel like a retaliatory nomination, especially given the ferocity of people to "get rid of it". This nomination so far is heading based on votes to either a weak to solid keep, or a no concensus. If that happens, the article should remain while it gets worked out further on the page itself. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 00:16, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

On your userpage it doesn't say "former admin" does it? Ergo if you are editing on the article about it and arguing for the article's existence, it is safe to assume that you are doing so with some motivation of vanity (as likely a number of other editors are). <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span class="pBody" style="border: 0; color: gray; padding: 0; font-size: 100%;">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 00:57, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Given what appears to be possible partisanship on BOTH sides, I again bring up what I wrote above, and my concerns of bias/retaliation over the whole MONGO 3rd party thing in all this: "The notability of the site is still being debated after the issue was first raised a day or two ago, and this deletion was immediately forced through after editors complained about perceived bias (almost immediately after). Admins do a good job, but this does feel like a retaliatory nomination, especially given the ferocity of people to "get rid of it". This nomination so far is heading based on votes to either a weak to solid keep, or a no concensus. If that happens, the article should remain while it gets worked out further on the page itself." <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 00:33, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - To respond to the various arguments for deletion presented; <b>OR / RS / V</b> - None of these are reasons for deletion of an article... only for changes to its content. Further, primary sources are valid for verification of non-subjective facts... such as 'creation date' and 'number of users'. Some might insist on phrasing such as, 'Encyclopedia Dramatica <i>claims</i> to have over 8000 users', but the existence of that claim would be verifiable, reliable, and not original research. <b>Attack site / Disruptive / We cannot be unbiased</b> - All possibly true, but not reasons for deletion. We do not exclude <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> because it is difficult to remain unbiased in writing an encyclopedia article on him... or because the page generates disruption... or because the man (and his followers to this day) said and did nasty things. Keeping this article from being used to attack others while not ourselves using it to attack ED may well be a difficult task requiring dedication and maturity... but we do that for <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> and plenty of other contentious pages and should continue to do so. <b>Notability</b> is the <i>only</i> argument for deletion I have seen here which has any sort of validity. The <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">notability standards for websites</a> are bizarrely high / arbitrary (in that actual usage measures like Alexa ranking, registered users, daily page hits, et cetera are all excluded from consideration), but ED does (barely) qualify even by those measures given the reference to it from <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Krebs_22fc.html" title="Brian Krebs">Brian Krebs</a>. By any sort of more reasonable standard of 'web notability' based on usage, such as those actually followed for <i>hundreds</i> of other articles which are uncontroversial keeps, they are certainly notable. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:32, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, those are all policies... about the <i>content</i> of articles. They have nothing whatsoever to do with deletion. All but a very few Wikipedia articles failed the 'verifiability', 'original research', and/or 'reliable sources' policies when they were first created... indeed, the vast majority of articles <i>still</i> fail those policies. Yet no one is arguing for the deletion of several hundred thousand articles... because those have never been and never will be criteria for deletion. The frequent citation of them on this page is an embarrassing example of searching for a pretext to accomplish a goal founded on entirely different motivations. Lack of <i>notability</i> IS a reason for deletion, and ED is within the (very wide) grey area defined by Wikipedians' wildly differing notability standards... but it seems clear that ED is notable enough that it would be unambiguously kept (like many <i>less</i> notable web-sites are currently) if the subject matter were not so controversial. Which is what this really comes down to in the end... an effort to exclude information on ED because the site is annoying/offensive/obnoxious/et cetera. If it <i>weren't</i> then the page probably never would have been nominated for deletion or, if it were, a handful of 'high notability standards' deletionists would be the only ones voting delete. A few people have been up-front about deleting for these reasons and to prevent strife et cetera... which are valid motivations, but I think outweighed by the importance of impartiality in how we review and maintain articles. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 13:34, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I said in my original vote... a good deal of the article IS verifiable. The claim that something can't be verified unless it has been printed in a major newspaper is just silly. The current user count of Wikipedia has been included in the Wikipedia article for years... despite not being stated in a 'verifiable third party source' or, since we got big enough that they <i>did</i> start reporting it, despite contradicting outdated figures in such sources. How is this possible? Are we 'breaking the rules'? No... we're using a <b>primary</b> source. The Wikipedia statistics page and/or list of users can be linked to directly as verification. ED exists. It has users. It has articles. Those articles are on various subjects. All of these things are easily verifiable by any user of Wikipedia... indeed, far more verifiable than references to obscure out of print books, which we accept without controversy. If the ED article were to say, 'ED is the funniest site on the internet' that would be POV. If it were to say, 'Josh Bumblemeyer of the New York Times says ED is the funniest site on the internet', that would be a verifiable opinion from a reliable third party source. If it were to say, 'ED claims to be the funniest site on the internet', that would be a verifiable claim made by the primary source (not that I am suggesting the make this claim - just an example). Verifiable means that there is some way for the reader to check that the info in the article is accurate. For most of this article... there is. Ergo, no... the claim that it can never be verified is just false. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:54, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I was asked about this, but reluctant to vote. The discussed site seems to exist for no purpose other than abuse and insult of Wikipedia(ns); and the article itself seemed to be pushed mostly as vanity by editors associated with ED.

<dd>Replying to Grue, all of the information about ED's content and tone, and most everything about its history that isn't a link to a deletion discussion here, is cited back to ED itself. That's original research, carried out by reading a lot of ED pages, learning about ED, and then writing on Wikipedia what you know about it. Are there any independent reliable sources that talk <i>about</i> ED from the outside, and comment on it, as a noteworthy phenomenon? Are we locating such sources and reporting on what <i>they</i> say is significant about ED? No, because such sources do not yet exist, as far as I can tell, anyway. Until you're doing that, you're doing original research. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 21:42, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, stop spreading the nonsense. An article about some document (be it a book or a website) can and should use the document itself as a source. In fact, it is the most reliable source available.

<dd>Grue, I'd appreciate if you don't speculate about my motivations. I happen to really like ED, have an account there, and think their take on Wikipedia is hilarious. I also agree that, if this article is to exist, it certainly should use ED as <i>a</i> source (obviously we would want to link to examples of what we're talking about), but not as the only one. At that point, it's original research, and there's no difference between using a non-notable website as a source about itself and using some self-published book you wrote yesterday as a source about itself. Independent reliable sources have not yet seen fit to talk about ED and provide us with sourced material yet. I'll be ecstatic when they do; until then, this article doesn't have the kind of sourcing it needs. You can say I'm speaking out of pettiness if you want to drag the conversation to that level, but it won't make it true. I'm speaking out of my belief that <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> are sound policies that should be followed more strongly and more enthusiastically than they currently are, because they are what will make Wikipedia more trustworthy and more valuable. Now, if you think my argumets are based on ignorance, perhaps you can lead me to better understanding by teaching me what I currently don't know. I'd be quite happy to have that conversation with you. Can we do it quite civilly, though? -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 07:37, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

To my understanding, much of this information is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">Original Research</a>, and thus must be removed. However, there is some <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> information, at least in the opener that can be written without violating <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. It is also my understanding that both ED regulars and Wikipedia admins are trolling the page and personally attacking each other. Several people even want this deleted because ED bashes Wikipedia. Censoring Wikipedia bashers violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> last time I checked. One person also sarcastically asked if <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Book_2873.html" title="World Book">World Book</a> or <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_Brittanica_8ec0.html" title="Encyclopedia Brittanica">Encyclopedia Brittanica</a> (sp?) would have this. Well, they wouldn't have articles on a lot of notable stuff we have here, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a paper encyclopedia. However, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a soapbox either, which is what about 4/5 of the article is. Also, the fact that so many Wikipedians, including myself (I'm an Uncyclopedian), hate ED, makes this have notability. I ask everyone, especially the extreme keepers and deletionists, to take this argument very seriously. This is one of those debates that went on for <b>an extremely long time</b> and have become <b>flamewars</b>. These debates need to end with all of us giving up a little of what we want to establish a firm community consensus so that doctrine doesn't get forced down our throats. Find a place for the one or two notable, verifiable sentences, and delete the rest of the article. Let's stop the trolling and settle this properly, okay? Thank you.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm fairly new to this discussion and have mostly been reading the comments of others, but it seems rather odd to me that we are considering deleting an article on a website which is home to a great deal of negative criticism of Wikipedia. It would not appear very favorable, now would it? I have done some reading of ED's articles on Wikipedia, and I can imagine that the editors of ED would be <i>thrilled</i> to see non-ED'er Wikipedians deleting the article on ED. It would serve to confirm every negative thing they say about Wikipedia. That alone is reason enough to keep, maybe prune it back to a stub, maybe block certain known abusive editors from being involved with it (esp. those cited as ED users above, per WP:vanity), but in general, keep it. Deletion is too draconian a solution. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 01:10, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I must admit that I don't understand precisely what the notability and verifiability complaints <i>are</i>. If the article isn't that notable, it should be trimmed back; I feel that at least some mention of ED is warranted, so I suppose it would be fair to characterize my opinion as being that ED is at least minimally notable. As for verifiability, is there a concern that ED pages are being changed and thus cannot be cited? Don't they have permanent page history like WP? If so, just link to the specific revision in which a claim was made rather than the article name, and add a caveat explaining that ED is a wiki and its content may change. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 07:58, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For me, it has more to do with avoiding original research, which is intimately linked with verifiability. I understand our policy to be: first something exists, then people in the world take enough note of it, someone publishes words about it, and then we get to write a Wikipedia article based on those published words. That gives you notability, verifiability, and the certainty that you're not doing original research, all in one. I don't see that happening with this article. Most of the facts in it just came from people who happen to be familiar with the website, which is pretty much the definition of original research. If we insist on using facts that come from independent, reliable published sources, then we aren't doing our own research. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 09:03, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I can't believe the utterly obvious double standards over web content notability guidelines that exist on Wikipedia. Having trawled through countless trivial and banal entries for webcomics, I can tell you 100% that any webcomic with an Alexa rank of 24,000 would be speedily kept and the nominator slapped on the wrist for a bad faith nomination. There is, and should be one guideline for web material, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, why the page interpretes as very much laxer for webcomics is beyond me. The amount of delete votes here suggest that any web material less notable or popular would be railgunned out of existence forever. This however, is not the case at Wikipedia, as can be seen in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Outsider_%28comic%29_%282nd_nomination%29_db2b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Outsider (comic) (2nd nomination)">this AFD</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Greeneyes_89ac.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Greeneyes">this AFD</a> and many others. For example, I agree with the keep outcome of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Wotch_e797.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Wotch">this AFD</a>, but note the total lack of delete votes for a website with an Alexa rank of 60,000. I think that an AFD for it's spinoff <a href="../../../c/h/e/The_Wotch%7E_Cheer%21_2c13.html" title="The Wotch: Cheer!">The Wotch: Cheer!</a> would also result in a keep, something which I would absolutely disagree with.

<li><b>Keep</b> - notable website. Its notability is due to its importance in LJ community &amp; spreading LJ memes, and also because it is related to Wikipedia. As equally as some people have argued that it could be a vanity page, I think the attempts to remove it are taking "anti-vanity" too far -- just because it is somewhat associated with Wikipedia, doesn't automatically imply its non-notable or vanity.

<dd>What about the lack of independent reliable sources for the contents of the article? That's the only sane reason being given for deletion; what's your response to it? -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 07:06, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I can interpret "the lack of independent reliable sources for the contents of the article" in one of two ways -- as referring to verifiability, or to notability. In terms of verifiability, most claims made in the article are verfied through primary sources (i.e. if Wikipedia says "ED says X", a link to a page saying X on ED is verification; in fact, its better verification than a link to a secondary source would be.) There are a few <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>, but I don't think that's a major issue. In terms of notability -- when dealing with websites, or Internet memes/phenomena, its not always possible to determine notablity by reference to "mainstream" sources, because this is the kind of stuff mainstream sources tend to ignore. But that doesn't necessarily mean they are unnotable... at the end of the day, notability guidelines (or even "policies") are only guidelines -- they are applied in accordance to consensus. (This AFD is one way of measuring that consensus.) --<a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a> 08:35, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the thoughtful reply. I guess I have this picture of how Wikipedia is supposed to work, and this article and many web-related ones conflict rather badly with that picture. My picture is this: first something exists in the world, then people notice it, and if enough people care enough about it, they start writing about it in published works. After that happens, we get to write an article about it. I got this picture largely from AfD discussions relating to biography articles. It's also reinforced by my conception of an encyclopedia as a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a>, which relies on reliable and independent secondary sources. They serve as a filter, both in terms of verifiability and notability. In this discussion, I'm seeing people trying to bypass that filter, which is probably not how they see it at all. I guess we're dealing with conflicting visions of what Wikipedia is. I'm not sure how to resolve that. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 08:53, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Of course, "published sources" are inevitably going to exhibit selection biases. And of course, Wikipedia is inevitably going to have selection biases as well. The question is -- what selection bias does Wikipedia want to have? Personally, I think in writing an we need to consider both published sources &amp; the collective experiences of Wikipedians--something can be notable if enough people here agree it is notable, even if published sources have not considered it notable. I think, in part because <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> paper, Wikipedia need not be beholden to published sources. But this is really a question which needs to be answered through Wikipedia's decision making processes (such as this one)... --<a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a> 09:11, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"<i>If enough people here agree it is notable...</i>". I think that's a bad idea. That's a good way to really hard-wire our systematic biases, for one thing. It's a good way to make Wikipedia more about internet culture and less trusted as a source for general information. It's a good way to make Wikipedia more like Encyclopedia Dramatica. I think it should be a matter of pride for us to have high standards for verifiability in independent reliable sources. If we actually get good about that, Wikipedia will be so much stronger. Articles like this erode at that possibility, and that's why I feel compelled to speak up against it. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 21:12, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I suppose the reality is that Wikipedia is a quasidemocracy. What the majority of people think does count for something -- including about the questions of what kind of content should Wikipedia include -- although its not a pure democracy because its a system in which some people's opinions count for more than others.

<dd><b>Absolutely not</b> A high level of interest among Wiki subculture people has nothing to do with what we actually mean by "notability".

<li><b>Delete</b>, the site is not very notable and in borderline nobility cases, I'm willing to entertain factors that I would not otherwise to make the decision. However, "borderline" is a charitable description in this case, as I have higher standards of notability than most editors. First, I received a spam email concerning the article. Second, the site has attack pages on Wikipedia editors. Third, those who edit the site are extremely interested in having a Wikipedia article and have gone to extraordinary lengths to have the article kept. This is a very bad sign. A notable organization would not care whether it has a Wikipedia article and a good non-notable organization would let the decision be made without trying to influence it, especially in an underhanded manner. Finally, unless an evil site, person or organization is so notable that Wikipedia would be incomplete not to have an article on it, like Charles Manson or the Aryan Nations, it should not have an article. When dealing with topics that are not very notable, Wikipedia can sometimes participate in the topic, increasing its notability, rather than just documenting it. In many cases, this is innocuous. In other cases, such as articles whose subjects are evil, it might not be. Wikipedia should never promote evil, not even a little and not even unintentionally. Based upon the attack pages, and the failure of the site to delete them, I believe that Encyclopædia Dramatica is evil. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 11:58, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Comment:</b> Actually, even if the main article is deleted, wouldn't a recreation after under parody count as a seperate article? Also, does anyone have any reason under policy that it shouldn't just be moved there NOW to end this nightmare? I now support just moving it RIGHT NOW. I'm tired of this, and if even thinks this won't be a no concensus vote where either a vote to keep or delete won't be met with scorn and appeal all the way up to ArbCom they're not thinking right. Rather than waste EVERYONE's time anymore I say we just move it to the parody section. Some day when (simple law of probability states it will happen... in 5 days, 5 months, 5 years, or 5 decades) when the site gets more notable press it can move back to the main name space. My vote is now to end the AfD, stick it in parody, and be done with it?

<li><b>Comment</b>, yes this appears to fall short of the WP:WEB guideline, but it has survided two AfDs as "keep" and "no consensus." (The "delete" VfD was very early in the site's existence.)

As it is many of the "references" are weak at best, eg. the Washington Post article that "refers to" ED actually refers to a webpage that happens to be on ED - it doesn't refer to ED as a site, nor does it even say "this page at ED." I tend toward delete per Andrewa, but the previous "keep" AfD gives pause. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 14:15, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, I've re-opened the discussion, after closing from AfD/18 July and found that that it was way off the 120 hours cut-off. (in fact, this should be listed at 19 July). Also, it appeared to be listed at the top when it's supposed to be bottom,is it done to gain more attention of editors? - <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMailer_diablo_6ffa.html" title="User:Mailer diablo">Mailer Diablo</a> 06:44, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What do you think of the whole vision of Wikipedia whereby things happen in the world; and then secondary sources write about them because they're notable, and hence noted; and then we report what the secondary sources reported as notable, since we're a tertiary source? At that point, we certainly may link directly to the website, or to otherwise iffy sources, in certain circumstances, but we don't get to just bypass the middle step where people who actually publish words for a living <i>take note</i> of the subject and generate secondary source material. Does that picture of how Wikipedia works seem wrong to you, or how do you see it, that's different? I ask because I feel that I was taught pretty directly in my early experiences here to think of Wikipedia that way, and I'm sometimes surprised that it's not a more widely-held vision. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 02:12, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, I agree that the fact that ED hosts the <i>tl;dr</i> article is properly cited. Right now, that's the only thing I know of that can be properly cited, besides the Alexa stuff. It's not a basis for an article. I asked Pmanderson the question I did because he seemed to be saying that verifiability doesn't require independent reliable sources, so I wondered if he was operating from a different vision than I was. I may have misunderstood him; if so, I hope I'll be corrected. It's becoming clear to me that we're dealing in this discussion with conflicting visions of what Wikipedia should be, and I think it would be great if we can get to the core of that issue and talk about it directly. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 09:40, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Surely importance is in the eye of the beholder. All of those advocating deletion do not appear to be from Scotland or exhibit an interest in Scottish politics. Those who are and so will find it useful to have a Wikipedia resource that includes individuals such as Angela Constance. Although I am not a supporter of her party I do know that she is standing for one of their target seats (Livingston) at next year's Scottish Parliament elections. Keeping this entry will, for example, allow ot to be sued as a link when discussing the election process in that constituency.--<a href="../../../s/j/h/User%7ESjharte_73ba.html" title="User:Sjharte">Sjharte</a> 15:17, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>I looked throuh <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and didnt see any reference to a game guide at first, I finally found it under instruction manual. So really this page just needs to be modified to fit what it was meant to be, it is currently horribly organized and needs alot of coordinated help from the VG group to Wikify it, but its premise is needed. It consolidates all the units from Starcraft and Starcraft:Broodwar into one place, yes the category can do that as well but it also contains people, places, etc. One thing for sure that needs to be done is to remove the "this unit is better because" references and just have a reproduction of the sheet that came with the games listing units of similar tier with cost and possibly stats. That is all verifiable fact, people can draw their own conclusions from it.<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESir_hugo_adef.html" title="User:Sir hugo">Sir hugo</a> 19:51, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply</b> - The sampling bias of WP's editors is fascinating in its own right, but each topic should be evaluated by objective evidence on a case-by-case basis. And anyway, judging solely by the vastness of the chess content on WP, its systemic bias would appear to be toward canonized pillars of culture over the new and shiny. As evidence in this case: over 9.5 million copies of Starcraft have been sold so far; <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1127055/000095012306007628/y22210exv99w1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1127055/000095012306007628/y22210exv99w1.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> at over eight years old now, it typically has around 70,000 Starcraft games currently being played on Battlenet at any moment, which is about three times higher than during its first year; 46% of over 10,000 voters in a <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Cyber_Games_ff08.html" title="World Cyber Games">World Cyber Games</a> poll this year named Starcraft, out of eight WCG competition games, as the one they'd most like to participate in, <a href="http://www.worldcybergames.com/5th/fun/GamerPoll/gamerpoll_result.asp?poll_idx=34&amp;page=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldcybergames.com/5th/fun/GamerPoll/gamerpoll_result.asp?poll_idx=34&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> a gain over the prevous year; at eight years old, more professional competitions keep forming, and professional earnings and endorsements are in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and have continued rising, while it is one of only two computer games with leagues of full-time professional players; <a href="http://www.geartest.com/sections/games/professional_gamer_2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geartest.com/sections/games/professional_gamer_2.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> the government of Singapore let a pro Starcraft player postpone his obligatory military service to play Starcraft at the World Cyber Games, out of its support for those "who are selected to represent Singapore at prestigious international sports and cultural events"; <a href="http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7000047607" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7000047607" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> in South Korea, <a href="../../../o/n/g/Ongamenet.html" title="Ongamenet">two cable</a> <a href="../../../m/b/c/MBCGame_212a.html" title="MBCGame">channels</a> have programs devoted to Starcraft competition, and schools post students' Starcraft rankings along with their academic rankings. <a href="http://www.geartest.com/sections/games/professional_gamer_2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geartest.com/sections/games/professional_gamer_2.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> While identifiable ancestors of chess have been around for 1000 years, modern chess would be at least "Chess 7" if they had kept track of different versions, and chess in its modern form has been around less than 200 years, only 25 times as long as Starcraft, while evidence indicates Starcraft has only continued to grow more popular over the past eight years, so it shows no sign of dropping into a void anytime soon. A fairer comparison with the greater body of ancestral games under the "chess" aegis should be to the whole Starcraft/Warcraft family, which has sold over 35 million copies over the past twelve years, and with the newest version, World of Warcraft, accumulating about <i>one million new paying monthly subscribers every three months</i>, since its release around a year and a half ago (the most paying subscribers of any computer game ever, by a vast margin). In sum, there is substantial evidence that Starcraft and/or its descendants will still be of comparable popularity and encyclopedic notability to chess in ten years.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The debate is not whether this level of detail is needed it is whether this type of information constitutes "Strategy" guide. If I were to say "When playing as the Zerg you need to build alot of Zerglings really fast and try to overwhelm your closest opponent." that would be a strategy guide, where as saying "Zerglings cost 50 minerals for a set of two and produce in the same time as a Zealot which costs 100 minerals making each Zergling more economical" that is no longer a strategy guide. If I had more time to actually edit this article instead of just skimming and fixing small things then I would try and rewrite it. When I first came looking for Starcraft on Wikipedia it was for this particular page, I wanted a page with a link to each units page as well as a place for basic information about each unit compared to other similar units.<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESir_hugo_adef.html" title="User:Sir hugo">Sir hugo</a> 12:18, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How is that strategy guide information? It is straight out comparison, a strategy guide explains step by step how to accomplish something. Saying this unit attacks faster, or costs less is just stating verifiable fact. Stating that one unit is more economical then another may be straying too close to original research though. I see this as no different then an article listing military aircraft comparing the F-22 to the F-16 and stating that the F-16 costs less and is faster to produce but less capable then the F-22.<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESir_hugo_adef.html" title="User:Sir hugo">Sir hugo</a> 14:50, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>The queen can be moved in a straight line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, any number of unoccupied squares as shown on the diagram at the left, thus combining the moves of the rook and bishop. The distance it can move is known as the Chebyshev distance. As with other captures except en passant, the queen captures by occupying the square on which an enemy piece sits. Ordinarily the queen is slightly more powerful than a rook and a bishop together, while slightly less powerful than two rooks. Because the queen is more valuable than any other piece, it is almost always disadvantageous to exchange the queen for a piece other than the enemy's queen, unless doing so leads to a position where the king can be checkmated.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Saying that "Users wanting this level of detail should buy the manual" seems a personal opinion having nothing to do with wikipedia policies. One could say that if you want to learn the chess rules you should buy a chess manual. The argumet about the number of people playing chess or playing starcraft or about the age of the games has no relevance with the WP policies. The real difference (not explicitily expressed so far) between chess and starctaft here is that starcraft is a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trademark.html" title="Trademark">trademark</a>. This could make you think that if we go in the details of the aspect of starcraft we are behaving unfairly with respect to the owners of the trademark. This would not happen with chess.

<li>I've read the above objections. You're harping on the chess and go articles, but I'm unmoved; I don't think they're particularly encyclopedic either. I really think they should be merged into a more-encyclopedic article, which I think is quite possible given the centuries-long history of chess. Not so with Starcraft, which, while exceedingly popular, doesn't have the history or breadth to justify more than a single article about the gameplay itself. Additionally, this article is so poorly-written that it is unlikely to form a useful basis for that single article, nor will it be a useful merge into that single gameplay article. On top of all this, this article is wholly unsourced and unlikely to become sourced.<br />

Describing them in such detail, however, is without question a game guide. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 00:48, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>Dragoons are created from Zealots who have been crippled or mortally injured in combat and are thus unable to continue fighting in their preferred manner - with a pair of psionic blades. They continue to volunteer their services, however; their crippled or mortally injured bodies are placed within large exoskeletons which contain any life-support equipment required by the individual Protoss. Living within a cold and dark environment, Dragoons are very somber compared to their Zealot counterparts. Seeing themselves as fallen warriors they show many signs of lost pride. Based on their quotes within the game; "I have returned", "For vengence", "I am needed", and "Make use of me" it becomes clear that Dragoons feel a sense of worthlessness among the protoss. For this reason Dragoons make a large effort to contribute to Protoss society. Although considered second class citizens compared to Zealots, Dragoons are undeniably valuable. Having both a ground/air attack and a ranged attack they are the all purpose Protoss unit(similar to the Zerg Hydralisk or the Terran Marine). When combined with Zealots they create a simple yet deadly force of long and close range attacks.</i></dd>

<li>If I were to write a single article on Draw Poker (actual example is kind of moot, since it's been sub-divided into so many articles on all the variants), pertinent information would include that you use a deck of 52 cards with numerical values of 2-10 and 4 face cards. Then I would have to describe the hierarchy of hands, as well as the betting system. I wouldn't describe the proper ways to bluff or other subjective tactics, as that would be a strategy guide. With Starcraft, the units and structures are equally worth mentioning and pertinent to the game's design, as they are base elements of this very complex game with its rules. The fact that it is a computer game and the subject requires a lot of material to adequately cover doesn't mean it should be dismissed as unimportant, and I believe that it can and should be covered without veering into how-to/guide territory. --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 05:15, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Regarding the nom: First of all, the quote at the top is misleading, because while it sounds crufty, it actually immediately follows the sentence: <i>Unlike Blizzard Entertainment’s first two forays into RTS with WarCraft, StarCraft went against the typical symmetrical match ups. Instead, each race is given its own unique properties, their own advantages and disadvantages. As such, each unit does not quite match up easily with another race’s.</i> which is then followed by several examples. This seems like a valid encyclopedic description of StarCraft's unit system. Which leads to me to another point: This page, <b><a href="../../../s/t/a/StarCraft_units_and_structures_1332.html" title="StarCraft units and structures">StarCraft units and structures</a></b> is the one up for deletion, <b>not</b> the sub-pages, which should each get their own AfD and be measured by their own merits, if people feel it's necessary. Remember, we are talking about this single page.
<p>This article is not cruft and it is not a game guide or instruction manual. It is an overview of the races, units and structure in a notable video game, a key part of the explanation of a complex gameplay system. It does not instruct the players - in that regard is it is pretty useless. It is also not original research, since this straight-ahead comparison of units can be cited from a secondary source such as an <i>actual</i> strategy guide, or just using the game itself as a primary source. I am further swayed by Reaverdrop's arguments. --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 04:18, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I already explained this. Guide is a broad term. Any sort of information could be called a guide. However, the game guide rule is a corollary of wikipedia is not a how-to-guide, which this isn't. Saying you can't cover game design in video game articles, only the publisher, release date, etc is like sayign you can't discuss literary technique in an article a book or cinematic technique in an article about a movie. In most cases, it's whatmakes a game notable. Stating the publisger and story of a game doesn't really you anything about it. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 08:01, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>How is it original research? The statistics of each units are facts - the units of different races do not have the same stats and abilities. (This is also a deliberate change in the from earlier Warcraft games, where for the most part, the units on both sides were equal in strength, movement, etc. That is probably why it is noted in the first place.) Those are factual observations, not interpretations - speed, attack, other things are hard numerical values in the game that can compared directly. It is not some kind of subjective value judgment, as you seem to imply.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. I vote delete, but with several major reservations that I feel have to be taken into account.

<li><i>Reminder 2</i>: Starcraft is not just a game, it is a <b>cultural phenomenon.</b> See the compilation of information provided by <b>reaverdrop.</b></li>
<li><i>Reminder 3</i>: <b>Not knowing something doesn't make it original research.</b> Aka, your ignorance on Starcraft is not an opinion. Sorry, no offense to those who actually know StarCraft material, but anyone who mentioned original research either doesn't know StarCraft or doesn't know original research. A quick google search verifies most of the information. Note that <i>Blizzard, the company that produced StarCraft, has endorsed much of the strategy on this page.</i> Is that official enough for you?

<dd><b>Second reply</b>. The amount of space/number of articles a given game deserves should be proportionate to its historical and cultural importance, and its intellectual depth. This is why Chess is like Shakespeare, and Starcraft is like Spongebob.

<dl>
<dd><b>Reply</b> You're right that the articles a game deserves should be proportionate, which is precisely why StarCraft deserves more pages. As already demonstrated by <b>reaverdrop</b>, Starcraft <i>is</i> historically and culturally notable. It's undeniably the most popular RTS and like several other major games, it has transcended its medium and become notable outside of gaming circles. Prove that StarCraft isn't notable culturally or historically or that it lacks intellectual depth. I'm a tournament chess player so don't try to fool me with poorly stamped comparisons. If you have any concrete comparisons to make with chess, make them now. If you have any evidence that contradicts <b>reaverdrop's</b>, show it now. Otherwise don't bother with the notability argument, it's worthless without any evidence backing it up. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolberg_69b8.html" title="User:Solberg">Solberg</a> 21:54, 18 July 2006 (UTC)Solberg</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Deleting units and structures is the equivalent of deleting any mention of cards from poker or chess pieces from chess. Articles like <a href="../../../r/o/o/Rook_%28chess%29.html" title="Rook (chess)">Rook (chess)</a> are less encyclopedic then this collection of information about each individual unit. I would argue the chess articles are even worse since they actually dedicate an entire article to each piece describing how it moves etc. which is equivalent to this condensed article describing the facts of the "game pieces" which happen to be bits and bytes. I think people are just failing to grasp how large Starcraft is and how much of cultural phenom it is. Terms have arose from this game, not fully directly, but popularized because of it, such as "to zerg". While there is a word, the term gained its popularity through the pieces in this game, much like people using the term "checkmate" when they out do an opponent. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_ecbe.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 12:18, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I've no interest in this computer game, and find some of the comments about it laughable. Having said that, the comparison between it and chess are appropriate, &amp; it is clearly a notable game.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>.<br />
Answering Varco: this is not knowledge, so we lose nothing if we delete it. Let me explain. The <i>basic details</i> -- such as the fact that different races have different units with different attributes, and require different strategies -- are knowledge, encyclopedic, and belong in Wikipedia, and can usefully be illustrated with representative examples. But <i>full lists</i> of every single unit are facts, not knowledge; they are to <a href="../../../s/t/a/StarCraft_11be.html" title="StarCraft">StarCraft</a> what a phone directory is to <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telephone.html" title="Telephone">Telephone</a>. One does not need such information to understand the nature of the game, nor its cultural importance; one only needs such information if one is actually engaged in playing the game, in which case there are plenty of better places to get it. So it should not be here. We are in the business of producing a first-rate encyclopedia, not second-rate game guides. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 19:11, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

As to the <i><a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">chess</a> argument</i> listed above, any game invented more than a century ago, which can be played by two people who don't even speak the same language, using very simple objects (think rocks and sand), which has <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Chess_Championship_2131.html" title="World Chess Championship">world championship</a> going back to c.1520, definitely falls into the notable category. Is there a grey area between chess and SC? Definitely. Can I understand that editors are excited about things that are top of mind in pop culture and use WP as an outlet, knowing there are others that share an interest? You bet. Another sanity check; would your grandma know about chess, or SC, or both, or neither? This level of treatment of fictional objects in a video game, albeit a currently popular one, is not appropriate for an encyclopedic resource, printed or otherwise. -- <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDolomite_0b0c.html" title="User:MrDolomite">MrDolomite</a> | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDolomite_8f87.html" title="User talk:MrDolomite">Talk</a> 01:05, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Because AfD's are shortlived, it is wholly appropriate for someone to give notice to possibly interested editors. I thought WP was about <b>inclusion</b>; if someone's "spam" causes an editor to put in his/her $0.02 or it's British equivalent, so freaking what. You can contact whoever you feel to give input, too, it's a free country (free world).

<dd>If people complain about spam, then someone may address it; to try to push your POV by discounting my (and anyone else who has been contacted) opinion has no basis in WP policy.

<dd>Zeromacnoo and others: I could have explained that better. There's an objection to "spamming" about discussion of deletion/policy/candidacy here at Wikipedia, because most of our processes work on the basis of consensus/rough consensus, the idea that most editors will come to some reasonable conclusion that is obvious, given the chance. Letting a certain subclass of editors know about a particular discussion skews those results and makes the final decision by the closing admin harder to determine if it's true or false consensus. Note that I didn't say "thse editors should be ignored", because a) that'd be assuming bad faith on Zero's part, and theirs, and b) I didn't look up what the reason was he contacted them (presumably, edit history with this or related gay porn articles). I just noticed that suddenly this discussion jumped from three commenters to six or seven, and wondered why.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Zeromacnoo's contact with other editors is no reason to close discussion. As for the topic at hand: The reason why Erik Rhodes seems to have appeared in Falcon Studios videos only is that he has an exclusive contract with Falcon. Falcon Studio (+ Jock and Mustang divisions) produces a limited number of films per year. While I may disagree with Falcon's business model of concentrating mostly on white males, the "Falcon Exclusive" is a status that Falcon grants to a very select few gay porn actors. Rhodes has such a contract and most wannabe gay porn actor would kill for such a contract. As for notability, go to the falcon website <a href="http://www.falconstudios.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.falconstudios.com" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. See that guy on the left? That's Erik Rhodes. Falcon, one of the world's leading gay porn studios, promotes its website by putting Rhodes on its homepage. BTW, Rhodes (before signing on with Falcon) did appear in a video produced by Studio 2000, <i>Flesh</i>, in 2004. And yes, Studio 2000 is one of Falcon's main competitor for top talent. As for the counting bean criterion for notability: it's quite off. <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryan_Idol_8c81.html" title="Ryan Idol">Ryan Idol</a>, one of the biggest gay (for pay) porn stars ever, appeared in around ten (10) non-compilation videos from 1990 to 1996. The reason he did so few was that he thought doing so many would make him more of a has-been a lot sooner. He was right. Idol is not alone.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Metros232 most have missed the source I gave under "Sources". The 06 season is clearly from the NBA website. I created this page as a way to talk about the international effect of the NBA. Both the effects of the league and the effects around the world, as the league is making the sport more popular.

<li>No, I see that link at the bottom. And I see that it leads to the 2001-2002 rosters.

Normally, I'd say this qualifies for <b>Speedy Deletion</b> as a recreation of an article deleted after an AfD; however, this might fall into a loophole. If I'm wrong on the qualification for Speedy, then I "re-nominate" this article for the additional reason that this is an event of only local importance which otherwise lacks any notability or importance. That the article itself has to include an argument for notability is a sign that there is none. It would not be surprising if many small towns had such an event, but we don't need an article on each and every one of them.

<li>I just listned to an online tech presentation, so I think I'm back up to speed again: we can't speedy it 'cause it wasn't XfD'd, just merged.

<p>vanity/spam article, marginal notability</p>
<p>This is a self-promotional article by persistent Wikipedia spammer Rudy Colombini; see</p>
<dl>

<p>for more info. It was originally entered from an IP address resolving to a hotel owned by Colombini and as such is almost certainly a vanity article. The band in question is a part time Rolling Stones cover band that plays in the San Francisco area. It has no records released AFAIK (anyone who wants to listen to Rolling Stones records buys real ones). It does have a few local press articles cited but that's pretty marginal for a global encyclopedia. The "Best of the Bay" award is not impressive since it's not really a competitive award; the newspaper just makes up categories to give out awards in, as a way of promoting local businesses and products, nothing like the "major awards" listed at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. The article gives no evidence of the band's notability per any of the other <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines except the above.</p>
<p>The tone of the article is relentlessly self-promotional and many of the details are unverifiable, and the author has a history of making disputed self-promotional claims (see the AFD linked above). The article also tries to promote the nonexistent "SF Rock and Roll Hall of Fame" and "Music City SF", two more vanity articles now deleted (author wrote about those venues as if they were separate and notable entities, when in fact both are at the same street address and are still apparently under construction. See Talk:Rudy Colombini for some details.</p>

<li><b>Merge</b>. Sorry to the rollercoaster project, but I'm afraid your goals are secondary to the goals of the Wikipedia project as a whole -- that is, you can only create a better rollercoaster reference to the extent that that is compatible with our goal of creating an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This article isn't much as it is, but all it needs is for a Wikipedian who lives near the park to go there and do a little first-hand research and maybe take a picture or two. Also, if this article is deleted and its entry is removed from the park's template, the template will be rendered meaningless as it wouldn't list ALL the coasters at the park. We'd have to call it "<i>Selected</i> roller coasters at Six Flags Darien Lake" or something to that extent. If this is deleted or merged, it will set a bad precedent for other similar coaster articles. Also, as much as I hate to refer to <a href="../../../p/t/e/WP%7EPTEST_5af3.html" title="WP:PTEST">WP:PTEST</a>, it pretty much applies here. <a href="../../../d/u/s/User%7EDusso_Janladde_a2ac.html" title="User:Dusso Janladde">Dusso Janladde</a> 19:55, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Not at all notable. "Trick or treat, bang bang" is a phrase that appeared in one episode of <i><a href="../../../c/u/r/Curb_Your_Enthusiasm_95fa.html" title="Curb Your Enthusiasm">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a></i>. The article provides no assertion that this phrase has somehow entered popular culture, been referenced outside the series, or even is considered remarkable by anyone but the individual editors.</p>
<p>I successfully nominated this article to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Trick+or+Treat+Bang+Bang" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Trick+or+Treat+Bang+Bang" rel="nofollow">speedied a while ago</a> under A7, no assertion of notability. I'm not a sysop, so I don't know if this is a carbon-copy recreation of the same material, but it might be, meaning that this article could be eligible to be speedied under A7 and G4. However, the {{prod}} tag I added yesterday was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trick_or_Treat_Bang_Bang&amp;diff=64368194&amp;oldid=64267434" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trick_or_Treat_Bang_Bang&amp;diff=64368194&amp;oldid=64267434" rel="nofollow">removed</a> by User:82.40.35.24 with an edit summary of "<i>its a very funny line. many of larry davids phrases end up in popular culture</i>." Not very compelling, but I felt I would be <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick" rel="nofollow">being a dick</a> for taking this to be speedied after the {{prod}} was removed, so I'm bringing it here. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 02:07, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>, I'd be stronger about it if I knew whether or not this "Cascade Server" product is of any note.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nomination and Calton's comments. I don't think this incident really stands comparison to Brandon Vedas -- Millett just went out, did something dumb and got himself killed, whereas Vedas pretty much died on screen and became a symbol for the stupid bravado ("i told u i was hardcore") and the cowardly group mentality and evasion of responsibility ("damn this is hard call[.] yall make it[.] good night[.] [exits]") that directly contributed to his death. They pretty much watched him die. That element is what made the Vedas incident famous and an ongoing part of internet lore, and that element is precisely what's missing in the Millett incident. (Obviously, they should've talked him out of it, but they honestly didn't realize that a) he was really going to do it and b) it really was a very dangerous thing to do.) Sure, the two incidents have parallels, but in the end, one of them is a very notable event, the other one isn't. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 08:49, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>First let me start with some history. Because of all of the attention and debate caused by <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_6e5e.html" title="Mahmoud Ahmadinejad">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a>'s statements regarding <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html" title="The Holocaust">The Holocaust</a>, the section of <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_6e5e.html" title="Mahmoud Ahmadinejad">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> dealing with his comments about Israel became too large for the article on him, so it was split off into <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_and_Israel_d40a.html" title="Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Israel">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Israel</a>. Ehud Olmert and Iran was clearly created as a POV response to <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_and_Israel_d40a.html" title="Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Israel">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Israel</a>. This article was created with the intention of showing that the Israeli Prime Minister makes parallel comments about Iran that Ahmadinejad makes about Israel. However, whereas <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_and_Israel_d40a.html" title="Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Israel">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Israel</a> actually talks about an ongoing controversy that is frequently in the news, this article is intended to create a controversy. If you read the article you will see that it is entirely POV and OR, and the grammar ain't much to write home about. Further, the subject is bogus, anything here that's relevant already exists at <a href="../../../e/h/u/Ehud_Olmert_e2ca.html" title="Ehud Olmert">Ehud Olmert</a> or could be merged there, and nothing that Olmert is quoted as saying here is particularly notable or hasn't been said by other world leaders. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 02:31, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Non of his statements were new and many of former Iranian and non Iranian muslim officials have had very similar remarks. Olmert's statements had also very similar echo in Iran and muslim countries. In this respect wikipedia is very much POV as it mainly covers what is in western media (as most of the media of Iran and muslim coutries use a language other than English). --<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitso_Bel_d44a.html" title="User:Mitso Bel">Mitso Bel</a>14:07, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>As a researcher, I'm happy if people take my tabulated findings and summarize them in their work. If they just take my work wholesale and provide no sourcing I think I have a very good standing if I call them on copyvio.

<li>I'm really not sure how rankings can be copyrighted - it's like saying that "The Red Sox are a half game in front of the Yankees" is copyrighted.

<ul>
<li>There's a clear precedent in college rankings. I guess part of the question is whether MLB compiles the standings themselves. If they do they clearly hold the rights for their efforts. If not they might still do as they generate the product that yields the rankings, but it's less clear. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 23:03, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>The result was <b>delete</b> with the possibility of transwiki. The prevailing wind here is that these articles are more than we need, and any possible merge targets already contain ample information on the subjects. As I don't think the StarCraft wiki is really a sister project of ours, I'm not going to mess with trying to transwiki this whole thing (also, it is possible/likely that their articles are better than what was here!). If someone would like the deleted content to do the transwiki work themselves, drop me a line.

<li><b>Don't Delete!</b>, If this is removed from Wiki then obviously we have to go even further than that.

<li><b>Eh?</b> I too am in favor of transwiki-ing, and you are right to point of the slippery slope fallacy. However! Starcraft is one of the most culturally notable videogames ever.

<li><b>Keep Zergling, delete the rest</b> Ironically, the title of this AfD is the one that should be kept, and seeing it on the afd list piqued my interest to come here and say so. Do we need an article on every SC unit? No way. But the Zergling has become extremely notable in popular culture - the term has come to be a word on its own, and is also more symbolic of the game as a whole than any other unit. However, it should be made into more of an article explaining these points than the strategy-guide reading they get having one for each unit. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">‽‽‽</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">⁂</a> 19:22, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Additional comment to my above - While I originally said keep zergling, delete rest, I'd like to clarify I have nothing againt a transwiki, as seems to be the growing consensus. The thing is, while I don't know the SC wiki, I would assume they probably already have info on all these units, and probably more about them than we do. But if not, then sure, trans away. Also, there have been a few suggestions to merge to a list. I would say that this is probably the best way of keeping any info here, as a list of units with minor single-line-ish info. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">‽‽‽</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">⁂</a> 03:11, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete, transwiki, smerge</b>, any would be an appropriate solution to this problem. Goldom <i>may</i> be right that zergling should be kept, but I think it's really the concept of the "zerg rush" that's the culturally notable thing (I know what "zerg rush" means, I didn't know that it involved zerglings), and that is quite adequately covered in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_%28computer_and_video_games%29.html" title="Rush (computer and video games)">Rush (computer and video games)</a>. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 19:57, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge/Transwiki</b> It appears Wikipedia is on an AfD rampage, but this one actually might be justified... however total deletion is still stupid and pointless, and the slippery sloper argument is becoming increasingly valid. Merge them into Starcraft Units, etc. or transwiki them to where they fit better. But don't delete outright. The game guide stuff should not survive any such change however, but it seems that rather than fix articles, Wikipedia is just deleting them altogether. I'm not sure that's a good idea. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Fuchs_e635.html" title="User:David Fuchs">David Fuchs</a> 22:19, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete All</b> game guide. Someone could take all of this material slap "StarCraft Game Guide" on the cover and make some good money selling this at Barnes and Nobel. As to the slippery slope there is a difference between video games and movies or books. There is no issues of "succeeding" or "doing well" at movies or books. ALthough this should not mean that video games or individual components of videogames are inherently game guide material. For example <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario.html" title="Mario">Mario</a> is highly notable and the article about him has no useful information in the execution of any of the vast number of games in which he has appeared.

As for the quality issues, these should be resolved by <b>IMPROVING</b> rather than deleting articles. From what I've seen, most of what has been called original research is actually insufficiency of references; these issues can be addressed by deleting true OR and improving the articles with more and better references for the objective information. As for notability, there is little question, as the references a few lines up indicate, that Starcraft is one of the most popular video games in the world and has remained so for the over eight years since its release, with indicators such as media coverage and endorsement contracts for professional Starcraft players (!) continuing to go up. As for the fuzzy, poorly defined "game guide" objection to encyclopedic worthiness, the proper dividing line is an active area of discussion, but I think should be between providing recommandations on strategy (not encyclopedic), and providing objective information on details of how the game works, as we do for detailed explanations of the rules for any notable game or sport (encyclopedic). Otherwise, where is there a principled dividing line between eliminating specific game mechanics, and eliminating any rules of a game, and eliminating any content at all related to a game or sport? If forms of recreation are encyclopedic at all, providing specific descriptions of their rules or mechanics should be limited only by the same criteria as for anything else, i.e. notability, references, etc. An apt comparison here might be made to <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">chess</a>, which has <a href="../../../c/h/e/Category%7EChess_9633.html" title="Category:Chess">dozens of categories</a>, with up to 137 articles per category; these are all properly encyclopedic as well, and must have been found so by the untold number of WP editors it must have taken to write them and who must have read them without a problem. I for one find them relevant, informative and fascinating and wouldn't want to see them deleted, just as with these Starcraft-related articles. They are filled with the sort of detailed game mechanics that populates the content of these Starcraft articles, such as this passage from <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_%28chess%29.html" title="Queen (chess)">Queen (chess)</a>: "The queen can be moved in a straight line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, any number of unoccupied squares as shown on the diagram at the left, thus combining the moves of the rook and bishop. The distance it can move is known as the Chebyshev distance. As with other captures except en passant, the queen captures by occupying the square on which an enemy piece sits. Ordinarily the queen is slightly more powerful than a rook and a bishop together, while slightly less powerful than two rooks. Because the queen is more valuable than any other piece, it is almost always disadvantageous to exchange the queen for a piece other than the enemy's queen, unless doing so leads to a position where the king can be checkmated." An even more apt comparison might be made to <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_X_3b16.html" title="Final Fantasy X">Final_Fantasy_X</a>, which is today's featured article on the WP front page (as of this writing). Final Fantasy X passed the gauntlet to featured status in part because it is well-referenced, obviously a notable subject, and provides objective information on detailed specifics of how the game works - see, for example, <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_X_3b16.html#Battle_system" title="Final Fantasy X">Final_Fantasy_X#Battle_system</a>. The editors who agreed that this deserved featured status did not seem to apply an absolute rule against "game cruft" as opposed to detailed, objective information on a notable recreational subject. This is the same in principle as each one of these articles would do in their ideal state, after being appropriately improved, rather than deleted. - <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReaverdrop_37ac.html" title="User:Reaverdrop"><b>Reaverdrop</b></a> <small><font color="green">(<a href="../../../r/e/a/User_talk%7EReaverdrop_ce3e.html" title="User talk:Reaverdrop">talk</a>/<a href="../../../../nl/r/e/a/Gebruiker%7EReaverdrop_a5b4.html" class="extiw" title="nl:Gebruiker:Reaverdrop">nl</a>/<a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPACE_cbae.html" title="WP:SPACE">w:s</a>)</font></small> 00:36, 20 July 2006 (UTC) <i>(repeating some comments made previously elsewhere)</i></li>

<li>Starcraft is notable. That's why it has an article. A Protoss Arbiter is not notable. Therefore, at best, it should be included in the game's article. And then it should still not be about how to use it in the game, or that's a guide.

<dd>A reasonable standard that I've been mulling over in my mind for topics such as this is the following: "Fictional topics should only receive articles if they are featured to a significant extent (i.e. not a cameo appearance) in works which are significantly separated from the ones in which they originally appeared." For example, <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html" title="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</a> (to use a popular example) gets an article, as it has appeared in a bunch of Pokemon media -the collectible card game, various video games, the TV series, etc. However, aside from a brief cameo appearance in <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warcraft_3.html" title="Warcraft 3">Warcraft 3</a>, the Zergling has never (to my knowledge) featured prominently in anything besides Starcraft. Neither have any of the other units listed here, so none of them should have articles. The same goes for <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Foster_Kane_1584.html" title="Charles Foster Kane">Charles Foster Kane</a> (of <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_Kane_0ced.html" title="Citizen Kane">Citizen Kane</a>); I may eventually propose that that article be merged to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_Kane_0ced.html" title="Citizen Kane">Citizen Kane</a>. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 01:20, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's certainly a...unique opinion. The <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html" title="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</a> example makes no sense under your criteria, since all of those other works are all Pokemon works and not any more "significantly separated" than the Starcraft books.

<li>Ooh, the existence of Starcraft books actually throws a real wrench into this particular issue. The difference <i>as I see it</i> is that the various Pokemon works are not as directly connected to each other as the Starcraft books are to the game: as far as I know, the Starcraft books serve as minor expansions and "riffs" on the story told within the game, while the Pokemon card game (again, as far as I know) shares very little with the TV show or the video game. Holden would, incidentally, actually be safe under my policy, though, as he appears in (or, at least, is strongly connected to) several other works of Salinger's. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 00:23, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> all. These articles have been worked on for YEARS now (look at the history on some of these), and contain a lot of valuable information. If they read too much like a game guide, there's no reason they can't be modified (after all, this IS Wikipedia). Those that have little information left after removing strategies could simply be redirected to the main StarCraft article. I think the biggest issue here is that if these are removed, there's really no telling where to stop. I mean, what about <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goomba.html" title="Goomba">this</a>? There are articles for just about every character in the Mario series. In fact, "Goomba" was once the featured article of the day, which is why I bring up this point. Also, what about the countless articles on Wikipedia dedicated to schools and songs and episodes? Are these somehow more notable than StarCraft units? I strongly urge you to re-think your votes. This sort of careless deletion immediately throws about 90% of other Wikipedia articles into question. <a href="../../../c/z/j/User%7ECzj_f490.html" title="User:Czj">Czj</a> 06:02, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Goombas have been in many different games and pieces of media. No StarCraft unit can claim such for themselves.

<li>Well, for a larp, I think 500-1000 participants <i>is</i> kinda notable, actually. You have to take a certain degree of relativity into account here; a thousand larp geeks is a significant gathering, whereas a thousand NASCAR geeks is not. That's just the dynamics of scale. However, that's neither here nro there, because this is way too crystal ballish -- I could see this becoming an article if they're successful (and particularly if it does become a yearly event), but that's going to happen after the event, not before it.

<li>Uh... I just checked, and I actually get more Google hits than she does. (Though not with the "model" qualifier thrown in. She wins flat out on that front.) In fact, I get <i>way</i> more, because most of the "alyssa miller" hits aren't about her -- there's a 14-year old kid with diabetes, for example. My hits are pretty much all about me, thanks to my crazy Finnish name. In any case, I certainly don't think ~10K hits is all that substantial. As for that IMDB entry, uh, well, you might want to take another look at it: the parts she was playing in 2004 were "Baby Forrester", "Baby in Nursery" and the like.

She appears surprisingly close to meeting "Multiple features in popular culture publications such as Vogue, GQ, Elle, FHM or national newspapers" from <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> due to her presence on the cover of Vogue and several other such magazines. Google tests regularly fail to adequately represent models that are big in the industry but have failed to acheive pinup status on the internet due to the type of work they participate in. This is particularly true for high-end fashion models.

<li>I would have to say that just being on the <i>cover</i> of Vogue isn't the same thing as having multiple <i>features</i> in Vogue. (The former being "just" a picture, the latter being an actual discussion of the person in question -- more or less, anyway.) Of course, if you're a model, chances are that you're more likely to be shown than discussed, but then that's the nature of the job -- I guess that's not unlike the difference between starring in a single blockbuster movie and being "Man #2" or equivalent in numerous movies; the latter doesn't really meet our criteria, while the former obviously does. That said, I'm entirely willing to change my stance here if it appears that she's considerably more notable than I thought she was -- I just don't think that fashion models are inherently qualified for inclusion, even though their jobs are inherently more high-profile than those of, say, plumbers or city council members. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 15:47, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Speedy deletion is for those cases where the deletion criteria can be applied by one editor alone without a great risk that an article that we actually would want will be deleted.

<li>Well if someone writes an article about their website hosted on geocities, or their MySpace, I'd think that one editor could render that pretty unnotable on their own.

<li>Oh, boy, whether someone or something has a Wikipedia article is a <i>terrible</i> gauge of notability! (I know you threw in that "maybe" so I'm not pouncing on you here, but it's a point worth addressing.) I agree that if a topic has an article, that's a fairly good indication that it's notable, but the reverse should not be assumed to be true! (If nothing else, if that was the case, that would obviously mean that there would be absolutely no need to create new articles on anything except new topics!) It's a <i>particularly</i> bad gauge of notability in this instance, because female cartoonists (particularly female editorial cartoonists) are not the kind of people who're most likely to get articles written on them. There's been a lot of talk about the problem of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">systemic bias</a> on Wikipedia, and while I think there's a lot of unreasonable alarmism about when it comes to that, the underlying concern there is entirely founded. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 14:18, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I read the article three times to make sure I hadn't missed anything but I still couldn't find any notability whatsoever.

<li><b>Comment</b>, I suppose this really depends on how well-known you are with a given person or subject. Personally, I find someone who apparently was a big influence on one of the worlds best known artist <i>much</i> more notable than the kids of random famous people, of which it is still unknown whether they will ever do anything significant or influence anyone else who does something significant. If it is not kept, a merge and redirect to <a href="../../../m/i/m/Mimi_Smith_4c4b.html" title="Mimi Smith">Mimi Smith</a> would be the best solution I suppose (per Grutness). <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi, this is why I ensured that I included the mention of the Islamic relatives. There are some editors who believe that parents of Islamic figures are more notable than someone who apparently had an influence on a musician - this is not recentism on my behalf. At present, the article does not contain a single assertion of notability. Even if there was some influence on Lennon, that does not mean that the person themselves is notable. The article states that he was the uncle of Lennon, and that Lennon lived with George Smith for most of his childhood. It then asserts that Smith lived a non-notable life before dying when Lennon was 15. None of that is even a claim of notability hence my statement that this is the least notable relative I have ever seen at AfD. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 09:27, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I created the article when individuals started giving the science fiction writer credit for coining the term (in his Summer 2005 book) when it was clear I had coined the term in that sense in 1998. The term has been used by fans of the science fiction author. It is not a scientific term but rather a fringe specualtive term. Maybe it should stay? But the article needs to be majorly cleaned up with regards to original research and vanity by someone other than myself. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 15:19, 10 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The question still stands, because such cleanup bears upon it: Is there anything written about exocortices that doesn't have you as its source? That exocortices are speculation is not important. It is whether people independent of you have written about them that is important. Is this a concept that is limited to one, possibly two, people? Or has the world at large accepted the concept (even if such acceptance is merely to argue against it)? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:58, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I actually tried to track the mentions of the term "exocortex" that were distinct from references to my minor website. The list is on del.icio.us here: <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/exocortex" class="external autonumber" title="http://del.icio.us/tag/exocortex" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>. There are only a couple dozen -- and I checked the whole web via a number of search engines. Via google there are 20K+ hits for Exocortex but almost all are references to my website or my various projects. Thus I would say that it doesn't have the notability as a separate concept from my website to warrent its own Wikipedia article -- again I wrote it to fend off this science fiction author from claiming that he coined the word -- I was concerned common usage within sci fi circles was going to take off, but it didn't. That said, if there is going to be an article in Wikipedia on "exocortex" I would like to remain noted as the one who coined the term and not the science fiction author Charles Stross. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 19:12, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>It seems to me that it may take some more time before the term catches on, and I do think it will. If the article is deleted now, at least some of the info in it could be lost. --<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbelani_8b2e.html" title="User:Abelani">Amit</a> 04:07, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b>, are there specific criteria involved for police? Peter Neyroud is slightly more than a local police officer. He heads one of the larger police forces in the UK, covering a number of counties. <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thames_Valley_Police_650c.html" title="Thames Valley Police">Thames Valley Police</a>. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 10:32, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There are only 56 Chief Constables in the UK each with a responsibility to serve around 1,000,000 people and overseeing 5000 staff. This should make him notable enough, but blimey has anyone ever seen a serious article name this long???

<li><b>Neutral</b> I don't see anything that meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (and from the username &amp; article tone, one could speculate that this is a probable <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> violation). There are no specific guidelines for Police, but I assume this is similar to the U.S. post of Chief of Police or Police Commissioner. That being said, I suspect there are external media sources out there that would qualify Mr. Neyroud under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, I just didn't see them. The probable violation of <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> makes me refrain from opining keep though. If this is kept however, a move to <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Neyroud_2a4a.html" title="Peter Neyroud">Peter Neyroud</a> is imperative, as is a rewrite so it doesn't read like a resume, and a rewrite for content as it appears there are some truthfulness issues with this article as well (or maybe just misleading wording).

<li><b>No vote yet</b>; do Chief Constables frequently appear in public fora to comment on arrests, investigations, or administrative issues? If so, a holder of the post may be notable enough; not sure that having a staff of 5,000 is enough in itself.

If the writer or anyone else could provide a bit of documentation about Celoxis from a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, it would be a bit easier to decide.

<li><b>Delete</b> I got 31500 hits for it on Google, which doesn't seem like a lot for a software product. I couldn't find any real discussion of it online. One site I saw listed various similar packages and gave the number of pageviews for each entry; Celoxis had a pretty low number of page views. Even if the article was improved - it has NPOV issues - the package seems to be Not Notable. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 21:11, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Very short article about a piece of project management software. A Google for "ATC Professional" yields mainly links to a professional development programme.

</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> for much the same reason as the above rationale to keep them - if all we're engaged in here is <i>guessing</i> that <i>one day</i> those players will play for <i>a</i> first team, then we're looking through the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Crystal Ball</a>. What if they all end up pursuing careers in unrelated fields or playing their club football for a third-tier team in Outer Mongolia? Unless and until they play for the first team (we can argue the notability of Outer Mongolia FC later) somewhere, they're not notable. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 11:22, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Week Keep</b> <a href="../../../i/n/t/Inter.html" title="Inter">Inter</a> youth team players are <i>likely</i> to end up being notable within a couple of years. Keeping these articles is not crystal-balling, the same as in, say, <a href="../../../2/0/1/2014_FIFA_World_Cup_6184.html" title="2014 FIFA World Cup">2014 FIFA World Cup</a>, which we know is <i>likely</i> to come into existence in a couple of years (when bidding officially begins). A more sensible approach would be to keep them for the time being, then re-submit them for deletion in a few years' time once it's known they would no longer be notable by virtue of being a professional football player. And it would be easily to verify -- if the article says a player's an Inter youth team player, and by, say, August 2008, he no longer appears on the Inter official web page nor plays in any other notable football team, then it would be safe to remove such a player as being non-notable. --<a href="../../../p/k/c/User%7EPkchan_0b01.html" title="User:Pkchan">Pkchan</a> 11:42, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's not a likelihood matter. There's nothing to say about them as of today. If one day they'll deserve an article on Wikipedia, we'll make it.

<li><b>Week Keep</b>. I could live with them being deleted, but I've learnt some info from those stubs. I now know where they all come from, the teams they are at, their positions and ages. If they are deleted the chances are they'll just get made again, e.g. Paolo Tornaghi. They are notable for being players at (mostly) major professional football clubs — it's not like they're someone's mate who plays for the local pub team. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlii_h_fb96.html" title="User:Alii h">aLii</a> 12:37, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Well, I don't think there are any statistics anywhere which can "prove" that it's a popular phrase - although you said "indication that it's popular" (I'd assume you meant to ask for proof), and it is indicated in the article. Nor is there definitive proof of how it became popular. Most of the Google results use the phrase in the same context that Larry David did, so it's a good guess that his TV show gave it some popularity (e.g. "I didn't want to stop and chat", "I hate the stop and chat"...). Again, Google has plenty of results for this; I did in fact come here looking for a Stop and Chat page before deciding to write one ("I wonder what Wikipedia has on 'Stop and Chat'" versus "Hm, I feel like writing a Stop and Chat article); it's fair enough to imagine that people have done the same before, isn't it? The article's also been updated again with more background; more to come, probably. --<a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidkay_530f.html" title="User:Midkay">midkay</a> 02:18, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Those are fine for the Hispanic customs that are discussed in the article, but again, not for the original definition or the mention of Larry David. Further, I feel like their might be a slight confusion here, between the Larry David use (<u>the</u> stop-and-chat: a specific, defined social encounter) and the common phrasing of "stop and chat," the coincidental use of those particular words to describe a social encounter not thought of as ritualistic or a specifically-defined encounter.</dd>
<dd>I hope that made sense. For example, see <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facts_of_Life_8b5e.html" title="Facts of Life">Facts of Life</a>. That's a common euphemism for knowledge about human sexual/reproductive activity. However, there are instances in which that phrase could be used, but not in reference to the idea of the euphemism: for example, someone could say, "The idea that sometimes you have to do unpleasant things is just one of the facts of life."</dd>
<dd>This is the kind of distinction that I feel may be a problem with the stop-and-chat: while many people may have chosen to use the particular words "stop and chat," I still fail to see anything other than Larry David that defines it as a codified, specific social encounter rather than a particular way to describe a common practice. And if it's the latter, we would be seeing articles entitled shoot the breeze, make small talk, bump-into, and the like. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 05:42, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Commment</b> - Well, I'm not really sure what to say. I personally feel like the article's nice to have, as I'm sure some people have looked for it before, but I can't prove that nor can I prove that it's "popular" or "widely used" in this context. My vote is keep, but I don't think anyone else is convinced.&#160;:( --<a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidkay_530f.html" title="User:Midkay">midkay</a> 06:10, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Surely importance is in the eye of the beholder. All of those advocating deletion do not appear to be from Scotland or exhibit an interest in Scottish politics.

<li><b>Comment</b> Perhaps all those with such an in-depth interest should come forward and present their views alongside you. But nevertheless WP needs to have one standard for failed candidates and local office-holders worldwide and, like it or not, they usually get deleted unless they can show a greater level of notability. <a href="../../../m/t/i/User%7EMtiedemann_f8b2.html" title="User:Mtiedemann">Mtiedemann</a> 15:21, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>It is definitely unfortunate that better resources for Scottish politics aren't online. That said, Wikipedia really isn't the place for such things--it's standard practice here to removed pages on losing candidates (regardless of country) who are of no other notability than having run. The good news is that there's a new site called <a href="http://campaigns.wikia.com" class="external text" title="http://campaigns.wikia.com" rel="nofollow">Campaigns Wikia</a> that might be appropriate for this article.

<li><b>Agree</b> with Kinu. Yes Radioactiveflesh (are you the contributor to the article with the IP address?) - we're not saying that it definitely is a hoax; just that it looks like one.. and the reason it looks like one is because when we try to find independently verifiable information about it, that information can not be found. Google is not an absolute measure of notability, it must be said - but if the sport really was notable as mentioned in the article, then SOME sort of references would be found on Google. Take, for example, the statement '"Page 99" and "Axe Wound" are the two teams credited with rejuvenating interest in Bootball.' If they are "credited" with this, then why can no information be found on the teams - let alone the fact that people attribute credit to them? An article needs to be verifiable. Even if someone submits an article here which is 100% true, it may still be deleted if it's impossible to <i>show</i> that it's true. I hope you understand now&#160;:) <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEurosong_5f20.html" title="User:Eurosong">EuroSong</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/u/r/User_talk%7EEurosong_19f5.html" title="User talk:Eurosong">talk</a></sup> 12:33, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>; local radio personalities are not notable. This one, in particular, is treading perilously close to {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-attack_4f04.html" title="Template:Db-attack">db-attack</a>}} territory, with suspicious assertions about an abusive husband driving her to anorexia and the utter inability to ever work with other people again in her lifetime. And her name doesn't bring up a single solitary Google hit with or without the hyphen, so it's <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>. The article on her radio station, further, was filled with inappropriate <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> assertions about the station's audience ("a station that played whiny music that the locals on <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welfare.html" title="Welfare">welfare</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/u/Housewife.html" title="Housewife">housewives</a> could listen to all day"), leading me to conclude that attack is an even likelier explanation here.

<p>Unnecessary subject description supposedly part of the Australian secondary mathematics curriculum. The external link (praising <a href="http://www.jaconline.com.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.jaconline.com.au/" rel="nofollow">Jacaranda Online</a> for their "award-winning textbooks") makes me suspect this is <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linkspam.html" title="Linkspam">linkspam</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: If we agree that people who are interested in Diana would want to look up information about her sisters, then I think that the idea of directing them to the article about Diana for such information is unsatisfactory, because we would either have to cut out some of the information or bloat the Diana article with off-topic stuff, which would make it less professional. It would be quite appropriate to put in Diana's article that her two elder sisters were . . . (names and dates of birth), but to give the names of Lady Jane's three children in Diana's article would be a little bizarre, and would stick out.

<li><b>Keep.</b> I removed the spammy link to a single compay -- there should either be links to several companies or none at all. It's apparantly a real electronic device and a real non-neologism or company-specific term. I got 237,000 Goggle hits for the string "Electronic load", granted that the hits probably cover a plethora of usages (but Electronic load as described in the article leads, with the first few results at least). It's very short, but not <i>empty</i>, and certainly expandable.

<li>The article is a 1-sentence stub on the subject of electronic loads. The further reading section of the article indicates that there is plenty of scope for expansion on the subject. The article should of course be renamed to conform with our naming conventions. Whether an electronic load is the same as a dummy load is something that requires sources.

<li><b>Keep</b> Yeah, the article isn't that great, but it is a notable mall. Of course, I say this while living in northern New Jersey. But with that said, it's easily one of the most popular malls in NJ, and it's considerably larger than many NJ malls with articles (including my local mall, the <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livingston_Mall_5aa5.html" title="Livingston Mall">Livingston Mall</a>.

<li><i>Comment</i> For notability standards like <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, an assertion of not meeting the standard is an assertion of not meeting all of the criteria. Notability criteria are usually written in the form (A or B or C or D), sometimes, as in WP:CORP, in the form ((A not including A1 and not including A2) or B or C). If you wish to say that it meets the standard, it is most helpful to show (with evidence) which criteria it does meet. I've yet to encounter a private company that met the second, and it can't meet the third, so really the independent published works standard is the one at hand for a mall. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 02:53, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In cases like this you need to cite every 'fact' and note when they are disputed. Citation makes a strong argument against somebody with an opposing POV, having a POV fork doesn't.

<dd>To be fair, more citation is required for the article in its current (protected) revision.

<dd>I meant 'you' (plural), as in you and everybody else who edits the original. As far as I can see the whole of this new article is your work, in which case most of it is uncited. If it isn't all your own work (and is in fact a copy of the original) then you (singular) have argued yourself back into only having one article. For the record, I don't agree with locking the article on one point of view (once it gets to that stage I'd prefer to have it taken down pending resolution of the dispute)...and by the way one of the rules of WP is 'assume good faith'. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> 18:59, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This whole "fork" talk is a non-issue. My additions are citeable, relevent and historically accurate. The original artice was not - the only citations were Michi Weglyn, Peter Irons and Personal Justice Denied. Your telling me that's not POV? Even the little addition of "disputed history" has a weasel words disclaimer. What a joke.</p>
<p>You folks are censoring this history. The Japanese American Reparations Movement dug themselves in a whole at so many levels regarding this history. It's obvious their lackeys are infecting this article.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - forgive the understatement here, but it is an extremely bad idea to have two articles on the same subject. The place that the facts of a topic should be debated is on the Talk page for the original article, not in a new one. A separate page on the same topic isn't "the next best thing"--it's not even a valid option.

This second article is known as a "POV fork" of the first. This is generally considered unacceptable."

If one page has been hi-jacked by an activist pov group of editors then it is entirely appropraite. I challenge any editor to point out my additions as historically incorrect. First you critize the style, then say sources aren't cited then say it's pov - all of which is untrue. You are looking for any reason to delete an opposing point of view while providing one explanation after another as to why the pro-reparations pov article should remain.

<p>Anyone following the discussion at the Japanese "Internment" article can see that the it has degenerated into making explanations supporting one's pov. The original article is still up and locked with incorrect history and bad history and history that needs clarification. That is reason enough why this article needs to remain to provide balance as the original has been totally hi-jacked by pro-reparations pov activists.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi, I am the author of the autobiography and understand your objections. However, I made a serious effort on meeting the three cardinal principles. I thought it would be important for people interested in gay fiction to know about the work published in Norwegian in 2002. Regarding my notability: I am a biographee in Marquis Who´s Who in the World 2006, Who´s Who in America 2007, Who is Who in Science and Engineering 2007, as well as in the 33rd edition of Dictionary of International Biography. I was approached by these publishers and since I am a frequent user of Wikipedia myself, I thought it would be useful for people who don´t have access to these dictionaries to find some of the information at Wikipedia. The books have been the cause of numerous reviews, interviews and articles in Norwegian press (100+ items in radio, television, newspapers, magazines). A pdf file containing many of these can be forwarded to interested parties. The publisher, Aschehoug, is the second largest in Norway and publishes writers like Salman Rushdie and Paul Auster. Regarding the contributions to cognitive psychology, these are published in multiple peer-reviewed journals with a high international impact factor.</li>

<p>The result was <b>delete</b> - keeping this article in limbo for a merge is only viable if there is anything to merge. PresN (despite arguing for merge) asserts that there is nothing to merge, Mangojuice argues that merging is unnecessary on this basis, and no-one is really taking issue with that (despite this AfD hanging around a very long time). Anyone can create a redirect if they want. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 11:57, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There was no United States before 1776, and naturally, nothing in history that would directly relate to the United States. I think renaming it 15th Century in North American history would be the way to go, but I wonder how much value such an article would have. Guess it depends on what the article's creator has in mind, but there needs to be a standard on the importance of events that go there, lest it become an indiscriminate list of information. <b>Delete</b> or <b>Rename</b> <a href="../../../y/t/n/User%7EYtny_f220.html" title="User:Ytny">Ytny</a> 19:35, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. As the author of the article proposed for deletion, I desire to defend it. I intend this article (and its predecessors and successors) as a time line of events that occurred within the present political boundaries of the United States of America or that profoundly influenced their later development. I chose to use the "in United States history" title even before the Declaration of Independence in the same sense that American history textbooks typically include chapters on Native Americans and colonists. This article titles continue backward into prehistory to provide continuity in both nomenclature and geographical coverage. <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> typically includes the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_Empire_6712.html" title="Aztec Empire">Aztec Empire</a> and Mesoamerican civilizations but excludes <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii.html" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>. I have added some extra events to the time line segment. <a href="../../../d/u/f/User%7EDufekin_dc04.html" title="User:Dufekin">Dufekin</a> 03:48, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Defining events in time based on geopolitical boundaries of the location's future seems artificial. For example, is it relevant to determine whether Viking exploration reached the current coast of Maine (or any particular of the numerous different boundaries between Canada and Maine as it shifted through time) to define whether it would be relevant to this article or is the exploration of Newfoundland and other parts of Canada sufficient to remark on the development of the region? How far back do you go and still call it relevant to the history of the United States as opposed to someone/something else's history? I'm not certain that Native American events prior to arrival of Europeans would necessarily constitute some portion of "United States" history. Native American descendants may even find it insultory to deem the events as part of "what was to come" (which includes the systemic removal of these people from their lands). If in 10 years time, we were to aggressively annex the coastline between Alaska and Washington state, do we suddenly go all the way back in time to the first human history of that region of Canada and annex the history to go with the land? Just some thoughts on your approach to United States history. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 18:08, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I suggest that we keep this article because smosh is a part of the internet as well pop culture. It has been written about in the New York Times, Teen People as aired as part of a news segment on ABC. (Sorry, I don't know how to place the links on here, but I have edited and checked the wikipedia page of smosh for a while now.) Sure, the writing might be a little on the lacking side but there was help offered by Zeketheo at 13:39, 1 June 2006 (UTC) saying that he'll do it in a day or two. I'm not putting blame on anyone but normally when someone offers help like that, it should have been follow through.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>One of the reasons I'm ticked off by this whole deletion situation is that the smosh wikipedia page keeps being marked as "advertisment" and does not meet the Neutural Point of View. No one has explained to us how the page got these status nor gave any suggestions how to improve on it to overcome this tag. Overall I suggest that we keep this page, but work on it so that it meets these standards and not to have just people tag it without a clear explaination. Thank you.

<p>Also, I have been doing some reading into the Wikipedia pages and keeping with a unbias stance, I don't see anything wrong with the page except with the quality of writing. I kept addmening and adding to the page it address a current pop fashion or fad becuase of the poplular "pokemon video" from thier site which was also broadcasted onto youtube. smosh is more than the website but it's becoming more poplular as more people are finding out about them through their videos. Also, according to WP:WEB (see link in the comment below this), this site was created a user of the forum other than the 2 smosh guys and it is not a promotion of this site, just an informative piece about the site, thus it is not going against any of the neutrality guidelines. amended byRockmusic389 07:34, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually quackwatch seems to be a consortium of professionals, mostly MD's. There is a founding member (as you mention, <i>the same guy</i>), but the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quackwatch.html" title="Quackwatch">Quackwatch</a> article is not primarily about him. Quackwatch (the web site) seems to have had a lot of press from NYTimes as well as an article in Time magazine. The <i>same guy</i> is also mentioned in those articles, which makes sense, since he founded the web site. It appears that <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quackpotwatch.html" title="Quackpotwatch">quackpotwatch</a> is not close to that level of notability. This should not be about <i>the same guy</i> but about whether the web site is notable or not. At present, <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quackpotwatch.html" title="Quackpotwatch">quackpotwatch</a> is not notable, even if it does focus on a notable guy. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 20:38, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe my interpretation of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is incorrect, but to me the first criterion for Web notability is stated as;
<ul>
<li>The <b>content</b> itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>To me, it means the <b>information</b> <i>within</i> the site. Thus I interpret; both sites are dealing with the same information from different POVs. Am I wrong? --<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDematt_b080.html" title="User:Dematt">Dematt</a> 14:38, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't interpret it that way, otherwise there could be wiki articles on any personal web site about Barrett. Besides the Quackwatch article is not about Barrett, it is about an organisation that comments on a wide variety of 'quack' related practices. The difference is that Quackwatch is a recognised critic of an idustry whereas quack pot watch is not a recognised web site and it only critiques a web site. More to the point it focuses its critiques only one individual, despite the fact that quackwatch appears to be more than one individual. In time quackpotwatch may establish its self as a reliable source of information regarding the 'quack' industry. At present it does not seem much more than a personal web site that is not recognised by any reliable source. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 15:05, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Wikipedia article <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quackpotwatch.html" title="Quackpotwatch">Quackpotwatch</a> makes no "unsourced claims about living people which would be libel if false" .. indeed you wrote most the article yourself! Jimbo is referring to Wikipedia articles, not other web sites. As for the actual site making unsourced claims, the same could be said for Quackwatch - they are magazine articles (at best), not sourced journal articles. Anyway, this whole section is inappropriate in a vote page and probably violates some rule. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 05:04, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I would tend to agree with you. I was too harsh on the article to begin with.

<p>The notability of the person detailed in this article is suspect. I've done some digging and have found that he does not have a single published work (outside of <a href="../../../l/u/l/Lulu.com.html" title="Lulu.com">Lulu.com</a>), interview with a notable source or even a <i>trivial</i> mention of him in any sort of press.

It then gives a short list of conditions, but I believe that this article meets them all - information not available in the appendices of the [self-] published work <i>Paper Eleven: The Complete Collection</i> is evident one way or another from the subject's website. I suppose this makes the presumption that the artist and the art are considerable as the same entity, but I believe that to be a reasonable assumption in this case. These are not <i>good</i> sources, I'll happily conceed, but they <i>are</i> sources and meet those conditions - and the phrase "outlandish claims beg strong sources" in the verifiability article suggests by implication that mundane claims [only] require weak sources. The website (which does contain all of this information in itself) is already mentioned in the article. Would a link to the book's Lulu page help?

<dd><b>Comment</b> Firstly, the guidelines on Notability are very clear to state that they are just that - <i>guidelines</i> - and not policy. From this perspective, it is presumptious to assume that failing to satisfy the explicitly stated examples is sufficient grounds for deletion; in fact, the Notability article itself specifically states the reverse. Not that to my mind it matters - it is easily arguable that Dan Kim has made, to quote <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability_(people)</a>, "a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in [the field of webcomics]". The fact that - say - <i>Paper Eleven</i> is not published by a 'mainstream' publisher does not make a hardcopy any less enduring (which is all the historical record we can really cite for webcomics, assuming the Internet disappears and all information contained within is lost), and the work in question has been recognised, as previously noted in this discussion, by several luminaries of the field of webcomics. Not to mention that to any degree which it is quantifiable I suspect Kim passes the 'Professor Test' suggested in Notability, and a quick resort to Google shows me that he passes that alternative suggestion as well. The main Wikipedia Notability article notes that <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#Obscure_content_isn.27t_harmful" title="Wikipedia:Notability">obscure content</a> - which one could argue the field of webcomicry as a whole should be classed as - isn't harmful and shouldn't be deleted on the grounds of obscurity alone; recognition within 'the webcomic community', as the original complaint so puts it, should be sufficient recognition for the article to remain. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakeS_e244.html" title="User:JakeS">Sar</a> 03:03, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> The 'digging' the original complaint has done is patently cursory and incomplete. Aside from the single volume published via Lulu, Kim also has work in the <a href="http://www.bluedaymedia.com/citylimits.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.bluedaymedia.com/citylimits.htm" rel="nofollow">City Limits anthology</a> published by <a href="http://www.bluedaymedia.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.bluedaymedia.com/" rel="nofollow">Blue Day Media</a>, leaving aside a previous edition of Paper Eleven that was sold through a now-defunct independent publisher. The assertion that the Connecticon text linked could possibly be the original source for the body text of the article is absurd - the article history shows that the text in question was originally written <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Daniel_Kim_%28artist%29&amp;oldid=22629780" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Daniel_Kim_%28artist%29&amp;oldid=22629780" rel="nofollow">in September of 2005</a>. Private conversation with Kim reveals that he copied and pasted the Wikipedia article and gave that text to the Connecticon staff around the 6th of June, but that's obviously unverifiable information... however, while I suppose it is <i>possible</i> that Connecticon could have booked Dan Kim ten months in advance and written and published an announcement early enough for this article to be a copy of that text, would they really bother for someone who is apparently not notable enough to warrant a Wikipedia article? Realistically, cons don't typically publish such information until far closer to the event. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakeS_e244.html" title="User:JakeS">Sar</a> 03:03, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> According to the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Wikipedia:Importance</a> article - which is admittedly tagged as a work-in-progress and not a final policy/guideline - the criteria for whether an article is 'important' enough to warrant a wikipedia article include "There is evidence that a reasonable number of people are, were or might be simultaneously interested in the subject (eg. it is at least well-known in a community)". A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Clone+Manga%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Clone+Manga%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">Google search for "Clone Manga"</a> produces at time of writing 'about 12,000' hits; I counted 3 in the first five pages which were not directly related to Dan Kim. These are, as noted by the original complaint, primarily from within 'the webcomics community', but I could not find anything in Wikipedia's policies that specifically excluded the webcomic community - or any other subset of the population - from consideration. Searching for the artist's name alone produces far less consistent results, but it is a very common name and thus this is to be expected. This suggests that at the <i>very least</i> the proposed 'Clone Manga' aggregation article is warranted, and I would argue that this infers importance on Dan Kim also, since he is the sole creator of the Clone Manga 'brand'. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakeS_e244.html" title="User:JakeS">Sar</a> 03:03, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Lastly, and by far least relevantly... I don't want this to come across as a personal attack, <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmyBlackwing_9d7b.html" title="User:JimmyBlackwing">User:JimmyBlackwing</a>, but I am curious as to your reasoning if you don't mind me asking: You mention on your user page that you edit the <a href="../../../a/p/p/AppleGeeks_f0a9.html" title="AppleGeeks">AppleGeeks</a> article, which links to the article on <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammad_Haque_64f7.html" title="Mohammad Haque">Hawk</a>; it's thus reasonable to expect that you have read that article. The only way I can see that the article on Hawk substantially differs from Dan Kim's in terms of notability is that Hawk <i>also</i> contributed work to Penny Arcade's CCG. His article also makes the grandiose claim that "Haque is an accomplished artist, designer, and programmer. He is primarily a digital artist, and at the young age of 23, he already has a considerable body of work under his belt", but since an {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAFD_70bd.html" title="Template:AFD">AFD</a>}} and not a {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-bio_ac6d.html" title="Template:Db-bio">db-bio</a>}} was applied that shouldn't be the problem. The article is no substantially <i>about</i> the PA CCG work, it is mentioned more as an also-ran - should Hawk's article also be deleted? I don't mean to assert that "X should stay because Y is already here" so much as to point out in an exemplary way that webcomics artists are necessarily not so notable as the kind of figures - politicians, athletes, TV personalities and so on - that the Notability guidelines really seek to specifically include, and this doesn't mean that they should necessarily be excluded. In the name of disclosure I am - as could probably have been guessed - a friend of Dan Kim, but am trying to work by objective metrics I would apply to anyone. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakeS_e244.html" title="User:JakeS">Sar</a> 03:03, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

And in regards to your comment on my possible status of bias, I only stumbled upon the non-notability of these articles while using Alexa's traffic rankings feature. Whether or not Haque and/or Panagariya are notable is not something I have seriously considered until now, and I will look into it - nominating the articles for deletion if necessary. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmyBlackwing_9d7b.html" title="User:JimmyBlackwing">JimmyBlackwing</a> 07:41, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment:</b> The <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> article specifies many <i>independent</i> criteria for notability, it is unreasonable to pick one and cite hwo the subject does not fulfil that one criteria if it is already demonstrated that he fulfils another.

<dd>I am broadly an inclusionist at heart, if a picky one, and my position on the Haque and Panagariya articles remains the same as this one - they are people who have achieved notable things within their field, therefore they are notable enough to warrant Wikipedia articles. There is every chance people will come to Wikipedia looking for information on those individuals, and it is more important that any information given is not false than that the subjects are 'famous' enough. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakeS_e244.html" title="User:JakeS">Sar</a> 09:57, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: As I noted above in response to <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a>, the Verifiability article also states "Material from self-published sources, and other published sources of dubious reliability, may be used as sources of information about themselves in articles about themselves". Is there a reason I'm missing that the PXI book and/or the Clone-manga.org website don't meet any of the criteria given for this, or that this doesn't apply? Again, I'm in favour of a merge, where such arguments would be more directly relevant, but I don't see why this shouldn't be sufficient in this case. To ignore them would be to suggest that Wikipedia doesn't trust Dan Kim as to who Dan Kim is, which is surely just as much a problem whether he's telling this information to us directly via his own site or in an interview with the Wall Street Journal? (Addendum: 'Proof' is not the point of Wikipedia's Verifiability clause - it is about passing the buck, deferring the blame. Or, more politely, allowing the reader to determine for themselves how much they trust and believe the source in question.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The section headed "Self-published and dubious sources in articles about themselves", from which the passage I quoted was sourced, features after the section you mention and I believe that it is obvious that it is intended as a special case separate from the previous section on self-published works. To give an example, the self-published works section intends that Crank Scientist Joe cannot write a book on cold fusion in a teacup, have it published on Lulu and then cite that in a Wikipedia article about how cold fusion is perfectly possible in a teacup. The section on self-published works <i>in articles about themselves</i> allows that Crank Scientist Joe's biography of himself that is carried in the appendix to his teacup book should still be a valid source when writing the Wikipedia biography of this obviously-notable luminary of crank science... facts such as where he was born and where he lives, what his middle name and his birthday are are not contentious facts, and he should himself be in a position to reliably impart them. I believe this intent to be obvious because if it <i>isn't</i> the intent of the '...in articles about themselves' section, I cannot see what the purpose of that section possibly is, since it would be entirely excluded <i>in all cases</i> by the previous section that you cite and it would be entirely pointless to include it in an important and considered Wikipedia policy article. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakeS_e244.html" title="User:JakeS">Sar</a> 00:56, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Oh, indeed. However, again, Reliable Sources is a guideline, not a policy, and the text specifically uses language such as "we should avoid ... is particularly true", which suggests that while it is frowned upon, it is not <i>specifically wrong</i>, just <i>preferrable to avoid</i>. And as it goes, I quoted the Verifiability <i>policy</i>, not the RS guideline, which contains a couple of sections of similar text. Assuming for the sake of the argument we cannot easily avoid such a weak source in this case, it is the best source we have and there is no Wikipedia policy which says that it is invalid - indeed, <i>policy</i> specifically allows it. We are not talking about controversial claims, here, we are talking about basic biographical and descriptive information. I'm in total agreement that it's not a <i>great</i> source, and I'd prefer more 'reliable' information. I guess this is a difference of philosophy; it seems to me that the question is between preferring a lot of reasonably informative articles on a wide array of subjects that have only a few sources, or a tiny number of articles with references in triplicate. Personally, I think it is reasonable to believe that the contents are true (and unreasonable to doubt them, largely), and Wikipedia's policy - while preferring articles of a higher quality - allows it as it stands. Going out of our way to find guidelines and suggestions that tell us it is imperfect - which we already know - strikes me as a waste of time that could be better spent removing actual inaccuracies and lies. I firmly believe that the intent of these guidelines and suggestions you are picking up on is to ward off intentional fraud and force a leery stand against 'common knowledge', not to filter out factually true articles which happen to only have poor-quality sources available. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakeS_e244.html" title="User:JakeS">Sar</a> 12:55, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Regardless of your personal attack, Wikipedia guidelines exist for a <i>reason</i>, and are not to be ignored without very good reason. As the very template at the top of guideline pages states, they are considered standards which all users should follow. Although it notes that they are not set in stone and should be treated with common sense and the occasional exception, I have yet to see any reason why an exception should be made for this article. The subject of this article has not made a "widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in [his] field" any more than Greg Dean of <i><a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_Life_Comics_dcfa.html" title="Real Life Comics">Real Life Comics</a></i> (his article was deleted) or Scott Kurtz of the extremely popular <i><a href="../../../p/v/p/PvP_f9e8.html" title="PvP">PvP</a></i> (he has no article of his own, and never has). And the reason I cite these facts is not because I am relying on the "if that doesn't have an article, this shouldn't" argument - it is because even people more notable or on the same level of notability as this article's subject are still not notable enough to include on Wikipedia, by its very guidelines on notability. I might also mention that the professor test, which you cited earlier, is a <i>proposed</i> guideline, as seen on the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28academics%29_2568.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (academics)">Wikipedia:Notability (academics)</a> page - not an actual guideline.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And one final thing I think I should mention: a person's creation being notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia does not automatically suggest that said person is notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia. For example: Max Goldberg, the creator of the incredibly popular site <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a> (a subject notable enough for inclusion), does not have an article of his own. This stems from a few key factors - namely, Goldberg has not made any other accomplishments which would be deemed noteworthy enough for an article of his own in Wikipedia, and YTMND is not notable enough to in turn make <i>him</i> notable by itself. An example of a modern work so notable that it pushed its creator into notability would be <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-Strike_03ae.html" title="Counter-Strike">Counter-Strike</a> - <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minh_Le_2b6e.html" title="Minh Le">Minh Le</a> is notable because of this work, and only because of this work. Daniel Kim is in a similar position to Goldberg's - his work, while notable, does not push him into a position of notability on its own. With that said, I do believe now that at least some parts of this article should be merged into <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clone_Manga_9e1e.html" title="Clone Manga">Clone Manga</a> as opposed to outright deletion. He is notable enough to be detailed to some extent past a mere mention in the article on his creation, if not in an article on his own. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmyBlackwing_9d7b.html" title="User:JimmyBlackwing">JimmyBlackwing</a> 14:12, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The relevant part of this comment is just a note of my agreement that the article should be heavily edited before a potential merging into <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clone_Manga_9e1e.html" title="Clone Manga">Clone Manga</a>; the more I look at it the less satisfied I am with the quality, particularly in terms of structure. By inference, I'm also kind of ashamed that it's sat in my watch list for this long and I haven't done this on my own initiative at any point. The rest of this comment is just unimportant philosophical rambling, really...</dd>
<dd>As guidelines go - well, I am perfectly happy to conform to policy where is exists and I am aware of it, and I am content that the onus is on me to go in search of policy in order to self-regulate my activity on Wikipedia. Policy is the hard-and-fast rules, and it follows that guideline - by virtue of not being policy - is not. As best as I can see - and this stands for the Reliable Sources guideline in question - the main reason guidelines are not policy is that that they tend to cover the areas where there is a black and white answer for the extremes - "A guy I know met Dan Kim on the stairs and he told me..." is not reliable (or even verifiable!), an entry in the <i><a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannica.html" title="Britannica">Britannica</a></i> is - but the middle ground is often indistinct and filled with qualifiers, conditions, and possibilities too great to enumerate entirely. Thus, when not talking about an obvious case, it is in my opinion wiser to consider the intent of the guideline when considering words such as 'should'. The intent of RS is not to exclude perfectly good information, it is to ensure that articles are not written based on information that is <i>not</i> reliable. I see no reason to consider Dan Kim an unreliable source on the subject of Dan Kim, and thus my position. Apologies if it was not clear, but there was no personal attack intended - I was merely attempting to summarise what I saw as my position and your position in order to more efficiently work out which parts it is pointless trying to convince you on and vice versa.</dd>
<dd>As notability goes, I would - had I had those articles mentioned in my watch list at any such time their merit or lack thereof was being discussed - have made much the same argument in their defence as in defence of this article: their existence does not <i>harm</i> the encyclopaedia in any way, so long as they meet policy's minimum standard, and more information is better than less information, so long as there are people willing to edit that information as and when it needs editing. In this case, both those criteria that <i>I</i> consider important are met, and I suspect that they would be in Greg Dean or Scott Kurtz' case. (Kurtz, from what I know of him, probably deserves an article to himself more than either Dean or Kim; I find the idea that there has never been one kind of puzzling.) The concept of notability which you keep returning to in order to justify the removal of [admittedly badly-] sourced, valid information is not policy or guideline for the moment for the simple reason - as noted on the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability essay</a> page itself - that is is a controversial razor to use when deciding what should and shouldn't be included in Wikipedia. The examples you cite, for instance, make little sense to me. What is particularly special about Counter-Strike that makes Minh Le notable that isn't special about Real Life Comics or YTMND? Why does Counter-Strike make its creator notable where Team Fortress apparently doesn't? Assuming some particular quality of or level of awareness, where does that line fall? These are rhetorical questions, of course, the point is that it's fairly arbitrary where one draws that line, and I (and many others) will be wary of an argument that is entirely based on border cases in such a non-consensual ideal. That said, we're going around in circles now, and we both seem to be agreed that <s>butchering</s> editing and merging is the way forward. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakeS_e244.html" title="User:JakeS">Sar</a> 03:07, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>Hi. Its me again. Well this article has been here for a while since the AfD decision. The Category: Pop punk groups is pretty reflective, but not competely reflective of this list. Of course the Category doesnt assist in dividing the bands by dates or provide a list of independent pop punk bands. But, as it seems, this list will be deleted at some point. One thing that is going to be a problem though, is when people start vandalizing the pop punk article with more band names. Thats the good thing about this list. It receives the vandalism and the pop punk article is spared a bit. I do now understand the importance and utility of Categories, but in the meantime, I would rather have this list than more vandalism on the pop punk article. The list might seem to be arbitrary, but its acting as a buffer and it also can be a reminder that wikipedia needs to figure out new ways to sort and represent information.</i> <a href="../../../x/s/x/User%7EXsxex_c215.html" title="User:Xsxex">Xsxex</a> 15:18, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is exactly the kind of article that <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms</a> cautions against. After a lot of good effort to improve and source the article, we are left with a bare dictionary definition, plus a rather short list of cultural references to the term (some of which don't refer to the term, but to the act only). The article includes references, but all the references are examples of use of the term, rather than <i>about</i> the term (as is specifically required for reliable sources about neologisms in <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. See my vote for specific criticism of the FCC document, which is the best source). The article was nominated for deletion before, three times, however, each of those nominations had a problem. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cleveland_steamer_9c10.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cleveland steamer">first</a> was based on an ill-advised attempt to censor WP. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cleveland_steamer_%28second_nomination%29_a4c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cleveland steamer (second nomination)">second</a> (no consensus) was perhaps the best, but several of the keep votes are based on the idea that the article could be expanded and sourced properly, and it's now 3 months later but this hasn't happened; the keeping of the article in the previous round was also a factor. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cleveland_steamer_%28third_nomination%29_6f2a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cleveland steamer (third nomination)">third</a> AfD was largely decided because of the outcome of the previous two, plus allegations of a bad faith nomination that led to a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Brian_G._Crawford_c88b.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Brian G.

<li><b>Delete</b> as nominator. Let me point out that the FCC source is not a reliable one. In it, a "cleveland steamer" is defined by a radio jockey in a transcript that the FCC includes in a document. The FCC document is not about cleveland steamers, but rather, includes the transcript to demonstrate the portion of the show the FCC objected to in fining the radio station for broadcasting it. The article uses this source to back up the definition of a Cleveland steamer.. however, the definition in this source is just given off-the-cuff by a DJ (with apparently very little certainty). <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 19:53, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Although it is gross, and dubious in ever having actually occured, it is a widely known and used term.

<li><i>Cleveland Steamer</i> is neither new, nor fringe.

I doublecheck and see a merge target is already offered. I'll consider that issue. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:41, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> What is the fuss about this. Delete it! There is nothing really need to merge. Perhaps hunter91 or another conributor can copy a couple of lines. Apart from that it really isn't neccessary. Hunter91, should also watch out how he is treating other users. U do not delete other peoples opinion. They can voice their own opinion. If u do suspect them of vandalism or a sock puppet, take it up with an administrator. It makes u look like a vandaliser yourself otherwise!--<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChombawomba_c49f.html" title="User:Chombawomba">Chombawomba</a> 12:13, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b><s>Neutral</s></b> - Granted, only 270 unique Ghits; not huge, but this isn't incredibly small for unique hits on subgenres. It appears to be familiar enough to its purveyors and fans to be a legit subgenre, but not too well-known outside of that group. The only reason other WP pages point to it is because it's included in the {{punk}} template. I'll admit I've heard the term before, so I came here expecting to be this article's defender, but I've switched positions on this a few times while writing this comment out, so I'm staying neutral for now. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 01:33, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_subculture.html" title="Punk subculture">punk subculture</a> article is running the risk of being way too long.

I would rather the information on scum punk there be put into the <a href="../../../s/c/u/Scum_punk.html" title="Scum punk">scum punk</a> article, and only a couple of sentences about it and a link in the <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_subculture.html" title="Punk subculture">punk subculture</a> article, in order to balance due emphasis and maintain reasonable size.

<li>It's difficult to find the articles he wrote for the Colombian newspapers in 1970. There wasn't any internet at that time, so I won't find anything on line. His play was famous in Colombia in 1969. I'm trying to find anything about it in the Colombian newspapers. The archieves on line don't go back to the sixties. It would be easier if it had been in England. Perhaps I can get a time machine. I give you again the link where you'll find a reference to his novel (Go to page 45) <a href="http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:bQLaDDBwS5oJ:www.eafit.edu.co/NR/rdonlyres/0B65FC0B-B669-4C48-BD59-145FB2848B92/0/Cuaderno14.pdf+Siete+minutos+by+Ismael+Camacho&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=17&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external autonumber" title="http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:bQLaDDBwS5oJ:www.eafit.edu.co/NR/rdonlyres/0B65FC0B-B669-4C48-BD59-145FB2848B92/0/Cuaderno14.pdf+Siete+minutos+by+Ismael+Camacho&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=17&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">[60]</a><br />

I have to find archives of the Colombian newspapers on the internet. An impossible task! I think it's easier to build the time machine.<br />

<li>Mr RHaworth and friends.<br />
I have been thinking about this. You only want in your Wikipedia people who are very, very, very, very famous. My father only had some fame in Colombia as a writer in the sixties. I have been trying to find the articles in the Colombian papers about him but it has been impossible. So I don't mind whatever conclussion you reach. I have translated his book into English. If it is published again, perhaps he could be in your wikipedia.<br />
Thank you<br />

<p>A vanity press charges thousands of pounds to print ANY book, regardless of quality, and will not expect to sell any copies other than those to the author themselves. Plane Tree is a POD printer who specialise in new small-press books and reprints of out-of-print books. You are fudging the terminology! Vanity press = exploited writer, out of pocket and devalued. POD printer = writer in control. The difference is clear. (N.B 'The Red Book' is still number one on Amazon's Hot Books chart - has sold over 1000 copies in two months - very large number for a poetry book!) Poetics uk 23:58, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Sources that are not online are perfectly valid , it's just harder for us to check them. The above does lend some weight to notability as a poet. Some points in connection with it
<dl>
<dd>a) There are very many little literary magazines that flower and die. Which of the above are major, longstanding ones that I can find in a good reference library? What issues should I be checking?</dd>
<dd>b) "In 1997 aged fifteen he won first prize in the Ottakars/Faber &amp; Faber poetry competition for National Poetry Day in his home county of Kent. The following year his poem The Re-Birth Remembered repeated this success by winning the competition again. The poem was also a winner in the National competition and was published in the accompanying anthology. Reviews at the time labelled him ‘Britain’s youngest, most published poet’." That seems to be a regional rather than a national win and in a Children's section.</dd>
<dd>c) Links with Derek Jarman - what are they? Notability is not contagious.</dd>
<dd>d) The Saga magazine links are short travel articles - INMHO they add nothing to a claim of notability. Thousands of articles of this genre are written (they also seem to be unattributed but I'm not disputing authorship).</dd>
