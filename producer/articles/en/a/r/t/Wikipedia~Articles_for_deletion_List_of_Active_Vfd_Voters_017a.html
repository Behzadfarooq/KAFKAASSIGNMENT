<ul>
<li>You could try edit every single day, but I think you are going to get approximately the same number of active voters. Active voters population does not change that fast. So editing the list once a week will be fine too, as long as this list is used for statistical calculation of the population percentage that has to participate on a Vfd poll, in order for the poll to be valid. If you really want accuracy, why dont you try to hire a daemon to do the job for you. Also, could you please answer me <b>why active voters are the people who voted for the last 5 days</b>? Why not the last 7 days? You seem to want accuracy for the list of active voters and the fact that it is not edited every day bothers you, but you cant explain why this 5 days initial value is considered an accurate and correct value, can you? All lists are similars, they change when time passes. Whats the difference with that list?
<ul>
<li>Yeah! correct. <b>If you really want accuracy, put this 5 days initial value in a poll</b>. As long as this 5 days initial value is decided by a small minority, it is not an accurate value. Active voters should vote in order to define what the correct number of days is. Its Active voters' responcibility and right to define how small or how large their community should be.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't see what purpose the page serves. It seems like its an attempt to get a list of people to complain at by J.Random User following an article of theirs being deleted. However, it doesn't distinguish between who voted in the poll for that article, whether any user has voted in one poll or 100 polls or what someone's vote is (i.e. there is little point hassleing someone about the deletion of your article if they voted to keep it) - it therefore doesn't improve on the VfD page for each article. If a list like this <i>is</i> needed (which I don't agree with at this point in time), then a list at Wikipedia:Wikipedians who have voted in VfD polls would be more apropriate. -<a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 12:27, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The purpose of this list is to define Active Vfd Voters, and use that number for the calculation of the minimum voters (as a percentage of the active ones) that have to cast a delete vote on a Vfd poll, in order for the poll to be valid and for the proposed for deletion article to be deleted. <b>I hope that you agree that if you have a population of 400 active voters, you just CANNOT delete an article in case in a time period of 5 days just 4 voters voted for deletion. can you? So a minimum participation in a vfd poll should be defined somehow, in order for the vfd poll to be a valid and legitimate one</b>. I dont care about the name. I agree with you that a list at Wikipedia:Wikipedians who have voted in VfD polls in the last 5 days and a list Wikipedia: Active Vfd voters as a redirect to the same page is more appropriate. Thank you for your recommendation.

<li>Actually, I think that having 4 voters vote for deletion is quite sufficient in many circumstances. If an article has been recognized quickly as junk by the first four voters to pass by, I don't feel the need to add a 'me too' vote that just bloats the VfD page. (It would waste almost as much space as <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson's</a> 'policy statement' votes.) The commments with each vote are far more important than the votes themselves.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment (Disagree)</b>: Do you think that having just 1 voter's vote for deletion is also quite sufficient? And what about 4 voters' vote for deletion in a population of 9000000? I think that you also define a minimum participation. Your defined minimum participation is just small,it is about 1%, <b>but you do have a minimum participation defined , and what I am trying to say to you is that this minimum participation should be defined by all of us, and not only by you!</b>. <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a> 14:28, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>In detail: not encyclopedic. Self-referential, so does not belong in main namespace.

<li><b>Of course we are majority!</b> As I said in my vote, in order for this poll to be valid, after <b>7 days</b> voters' participation should <b>exceed 12%</b> of the List of Active Vfd Voters. Current participation is 28/307 (9%). But as long as <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majority_rule.html" title="Majority rule">majority rule</a> is going to be used to extract the decision from this poll and as long as all current votes are DELETE votes, this means that the result is not going to change even if the rest 3% cast a KEEP vote . So this article is a candidate for speedy delete, I think we dont have to wait for 5 days. (unless of course a lot of people change their mind suddently wich I think is not very likely, or unless suddently 29 new people arrive and vote KEEP, witch also I think it is unlikely to happen too).

<li><b>Delete</b>. I feel left out, I had no idea that I'd spent so long away from VFD that I wasn't considered "active"! Although this article is, to use a term I enjoy, codswallop, I wouldn't mind seeing something along these lines; it would certainly give the deletionist/inclusionist factions something to talk about, if their records were up on display. On the other hand, if such a page actually began to form, it seems like certain users might abuse the VFD process to manipulate their statistics on the list. Although accountability is nice, I'm not sure we need this.

<li><b>Delete</b>. While it's nice to see my name being recognised, it's definitely useless as an encyclopedia article, and hard to maintain as a Wikipedia article. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 19:04, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> I've just had another look at the page and it seems that some user names appear more than once e.g. <i><a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETregoweth_2a9b.html" title="User:Tregoweth">Tregoweth</a></i>, possibly casting doubt on <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a>'s figure of 307 active votes. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 12:38, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment (Agree)</b>: The author of the List of Active Vfd Voters wrote: "<i>The above list has been extracted using the below linux command, <b>then doing some editing</b>: grep "User:" Wikipedia\:Votes_for_deletion.html|cut -f2 -d"\""|cut -f3 -d":"|sort &gt; wikivoters</i>". He has to find a more accurate linux command to use in order to extract the users directly and avoid erroneous editings like the one you are mentioning. <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a> 14:17, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delete. Interesting idea, but half-baked and in the wrong namespace to boot. I notice I'm not on the list, who cares, it has no standing IMO. Originally by an anon with no other contributions. Let's not waste time on it. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 10:03, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well isn't that just creepy. I wonder if my name's in there now. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../r/i/f/User%7ERiffsyphon1024_ff13.html" title="User:Riffsyphon1024">Riffsyphon1024</a> 21:55, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This is an attempt to subvert the VfD process. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartg76_fbde.html" title="User:Martg76">Martg76</a> 23:00, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete disruptive list. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFire_Star_28a1.html" title="User:Fire Star">Fire Star</a> 06:55, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. While not perfect, VFD would not be improved using this 'system'; thus this list is pointless and unencyclopedic.<a href="../../../s/c/1/User%7ESc147_bf9d.html" title="User:Sc147">Sc147</a> 21:55, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>This page is now preserved as an archive of the debate and, like some other VfD subpages, is no longer 'live'. Subsequent comments on the issue, the deletion or on the decision-making process should be placed on the relevant 'live' pages. <b>Please do not edit this page</b>.</p>
