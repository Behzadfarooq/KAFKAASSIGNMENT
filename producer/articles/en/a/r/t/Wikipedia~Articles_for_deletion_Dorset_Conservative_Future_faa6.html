<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I question the knowledge of the nominator when he says Dorset CF has no national profile. Oliver Letwin MP, head of Policy Review for the Conservative Party, is an active supporter and he is involved in one of our policy debates later this year. Similarly, Robert Syms MP and Tobias Ellwood MP have both contributed to the organisation and Mr Syms is our guest speaker next month. We have a page on the national Conservative page and we are spreading to Wiltshire as part of that Area Chair. And by saying it has no history you have overlooked its origins as the "Young Conservatives" in Bournemouth. Finally, in terms of notability, four of its members are standing for election this year to Dorset councils and one of its former members is a parliamentary candidate for a Dorset parliamentary seat. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardbooth_bdaa.html" title="User:Richardbooth">Richardbooth</a> 23:58, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>...so none of your members are actually serving as elected representatives, and the highest any of your former members has ever reached is being a candidate for an election that won't happen for another 3 years. If your organisation has ever been profiled in the national media, or if you have evidence that it has a high national profile, by all means provide links here. Otherwise, see <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 00:21, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>In fact one of our affiliated members, Tobias Ellwood, is the Member of Parliament for Bournemouth East. Its national profile can be found on the Conservative Party website and several articles will be appearing in Dorset-wide press (such as The Daily Echo) during the April run-up to the local elections. As a final point, considering David Cameron's drive to promote youth interest in politics, I think this article is very relevant as evidence that shows we are embracing his campaign. In fact, Nick King's parliamentary campaign office is establishing an Executive position to deal with Dorset CF and youth-based constituency matters. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardbooth_bdaa.html" title="User:Richardbooth">Richardbooth</a> 00:26, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>WIkipedia is an encyclopaedia, not a forum for demonstrating that the modern Conservatives (or Labour, or Liberals....) are "down with de kidz". The fact that this article highlights your embrace of David Cameron's ideas and policies is utterly, utterly 1000% irrelevent, I'm afraid. This is not a political soapbox, or an indiscriminate collection of information. Sorry, but that's the way it is. The right thing to do is to restrict that sort of material to party or personal blogs and websites- it has no place in an encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 01:17, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> An organisation which certainly wields local political influence with Dorset's councillors and Conservative MPs. It has a website and a profile on the national website. As a result, it deserves a Wikipedia entry. Twiggybriggy 00:06, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> Dorset Conservative Future is an official ofshoot of the United Kingdom Conservative Party. It is a registered branch which is supported and endorsed by many senior figures in the party. I am concerned that in this situation a political bias against the party is occuring, and this is especially worrying when an article about the youth organisation of the BNP has been allowed to remain unchallenged on the site.

<li>I certainly have no political agenda for my own part, and I think that some of the above&#160;!voters are&#160;!British even, so I suspect that the only issue at hand here is whether this page (and by extension the related vanity/self promotion pages that I came across today and put up for deletion) is, or is!, in line with policy, particularly that on notability. In my view, they blatantly are not. So far, no-one here (with the exception of one dubious possible meat puppet) has&#160;!voted to keep the article that is not directly mentioned in it as an active member of DCF. That seems to say it all really. If you feel the BNP article (which I am not aware of) does not confirm to policy then feel free to nominate it so that the issue can be discussed. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 00:28, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have no idea who Twiggybriggy is - he could very well be a lurker who objects to your seemingly political agenda. In actual fact, looking at your comment on the history page ("Sock it to us, Twigster!"), it looks like you're making a mockery of this entire process. If the national Conservative Party has a page on Wikipedia, it makes sense for its county-wide offshoots to have pages as well, especially when we play an active role in formulating local Conservative policy and holding debates against institutions such as Bournemouth Council. As I've already written, we also have several notable members. I am not comfortable with <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">User:Badgerpatrol</a> making this administrative decision due to political bias reasons; I hope a neutral figure can step in, and not one who has a vendetta against certain users and organisations. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardbooth_bdaa.html" title="User:Richardbooth">Richardbooth</a> 00:36, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>With respect, you clearly have no idea how AfD works. I am not an admin and I have no power to delete the article; after the discussion has run its course, an admin will step in and make a decision as to whether the page's inclusion in the encyclopaedia is in accordance with policy, as demonstrated by the arguments and evidence in this discussion. It is certainly <i>not</i> logical that every local offshoot of a national organisation is automatically notable- because <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tesco.html" title="Tesco">Tesco</a> or <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_0d83.html" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> are notable organisations, does that mean that <i>every</i> one of their local stores should have its own article automatically? Of course not. Again, the only issue here is whether or not this article conforms to policy. It does not, in my opinion, and neither does it seemingly in the opinion of the other disinterested correspondents so far. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 00:45, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I also take exception to your personal attack btw, for the record. I have no vendetta against any organisation- in fact, I rarely edit political articles. Please provide some evidence that I have any kind of vendetta against <i>"certain users and organisations"</i>, as I feel that's a pretty serious accusation. I first became aware of the existence of these (DCF) articles and users less than 24 hours ago...the simple fact is, that the subjects of this and the other related articles are not at all notable, per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 12:45, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
