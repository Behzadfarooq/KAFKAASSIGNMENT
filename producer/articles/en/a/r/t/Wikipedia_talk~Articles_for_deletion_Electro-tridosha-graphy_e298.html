<p>Removal of the information about <b>Electrotridoshagraphy E.T.G.</b> is seems mischivious acts. The motive of the removal,is unknown. The technologies are for the entire globe and is used universally. It can not kept within the boundaries of a nation or place. The ETG technique is being practiced in its international center KERI and KPCARC, where everyday number of patients are benefitting the effective Ayurvedic treatment of those conditions, where there is still no treatment in Modern western medicine. The internaional center KERI and KPCARC both are equipped with the ultramodern basic facilities for examinations and scans. Even then Modern western medicine practitioners recommends the examination of their patients by this technology. Those who have removed the information, they are not the friend of mankinds but in this context they are the enemy to the sick mankinds and sick community.</p>

<p>The Indian system of medicine is considered to be about 5000 years old medical science. The complete Ayurveda is based on the basic principles like Tridosha, Tridosha-bhed, Sapta-Dhatu, Mala, Oaj, Agnibal etc.</p>
<p>To quantify the status of these principles, stages of Dosha presence in human body, radial pulse examination is the only way, which is known Nari Pareekshan [Pulse examnination]. Pulse examnination is dependent upon the qualification and experience of the Ayurvedic physician. The process of Pulse examination and their results are experienced and concieved by the brain and mind, depending upon the capacity of the Ayurvedic physician, but cannot be seen physically.</p>
<p>How Ayurvedic physician accepts the state of the presence of the Tridosha, Tridosha-bheda,Sapta Dhatus, Mala etc himself and how they estimate the intesity of the dosha-dhatu-mala and how they express the intesity of these principles, this is not possible in evidence form. For example in modern medical science, as they talks of the "Evidence Based Medicine", i.e. Xrays,CT scan, MRI,ECG,Pathological examinations.</p>
<p>In the history of Ayurveda, probably this is the first time happens that after the invention of the Electrotridoshagraphy machine, with this technology all the basic principles of the Ayurveda is produced successfully in the evidenced based form.</p>
<p>It is believed that with the invention of this technology, Ayurveda, the Indian System of Medicine will proove its scientificity. The Ayurveda will be more scientific. The technology will open new doors for research in the field of the Ayurveda, Ayurveda basic principles, Ayurveda philosophy, Maulik Siddhanta and new innumerable concept in the Ayurveda research. At modern time, Ayurveda have a scientific tool and scientific approach with this technology.</p>

<p>1- The ETG technology scans the whole body. It detects the most sick parts to the lesser sick parts of the human body. The technology is very cheap. The expences of the single examination is worth Rs. 10/=IC [equivalent to less than quarter [1/4] US dollar]</p>
<p>2- So many diseases / disease conditions are not tracable from Xrays, Ultrasound, Scans and other Pathological examinations. ETG traces these complaints.</p>
<p>3- Monitoring of the sick persons health are easily possible. The effects of the treatment, the effects of the medicines, the effects of the managements can be examined and monitered.</p>
<p>4- This technology is for the use of all medical sciences practitioners, physicians practicing in their diciplines i.e. Modern western medical practitioners, Yoga , naturecure, Unani, acupuncturist etc etc. The technology is very easy and simple and can be performed anywhere, any place, any time, any condition, in clinic, in hospital, in home. The technology is very easy and no need of any prior medications and preparations.</p>
<p>The technology is invented by Dr. Desh Bandhu Bajpai,Kanak Polytherapy Clinic and research center, 67/70, Bhusatoli Road, Kanpur.</p>

<p>Many curious reader's reactions about the invention of Electrotridoshagram technology have been recieved after the publication of the article in the 09 August 2005 issue. The curious readers have asked several questions regarding the ETG technology, which are common, uncommon, serious and very serious.</p>
<p>1- The development of the ETG technology came in existence slowly and gradually by the continuous efforts since 10 years to the present state.</p>
<p>2-The scientific presentation of this technology have been successfully done before the high level expert committee set up by the Department of Ayurveda [AYUSH], Ministry of Health and Family Welafre, Government of India, New Delhi on 23 December 2004.</p>
<p>3- The Institution set-up by the Government of India for Grass root innovation recognition, National Innovation Foundation, Ahamdabad, India accredited the technology as " extraordinary combination of Ayurevda and modern scientific technology", believing with the fact that the technology will be foolproof for the dianosis of the ailments.</p>
<p>4- The ETG technology is selected as competition entry for Asian Innovation Award 2005, Singapore and international "Global Entrepolis Singapore Award 2005.The competion is organised by the famous Hongkong newspaper The Wall Street Journal with Do-Jones inc.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_Electro-tridosha-graphy_e298.html" title="Edit section: Reply of some questions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Reply of some questions</span></h3>
<p>Readers of The Moral is questioning that ETG technology is useful for the all practitioners and all physicians Modern western medicine practitioners, Ayurvedicians,Hakims, Naturopaths, Accupuncturist etc. can use the technique. On the other side the technology is specifically for the use of the Ayurveda and quantify Maulik siddhanta of Ayurveda and propagated that the technique is useful for the Ayurveda, there is controversy in the statements? Which two statement are correct?</p>
<p>In reply of the question, it is better to say that both the statements are correct. For recording the tracings, the whole body is divided in the 21 sectors mainly and few sectors in options, which are known additional sectors. In fact in this technology the modernisation is included and at one side the data obtained is analysed in view of Modern western medicine, at the other side the data is analysed in view of Ayurveda Dosha-dooshya-mala-oaj. Thus the Ayuveda physician have advatages of the disease dagnosis in both way.</p>
<p>The body is a single unit. The body cannot divided into the separate parts. The technology gives the indication of the [a] Physiological basis of the diseases [b]Pathological basis of the diseases [c] Metabolic basis of diseases [d] Psychological basis of diseases. All the four divisions are represented to Ayurveda.Which quantify the status of the seven doshas, 15 doshas kinds, Seven dhatus, three Malas, two oajas, four Agni etc etc.</p>
<p>For example, if in the tracings of the Vata and Pitta, the B wave is 4 e.v.,Ras dhatu is below 50 percent, Mans Dhatu is 160 percent, Pureesh, Mootra and Swed is below 50 percent, Oaj and complete Oaj are less than normal level. In ETG B wave signifies the Saman Vata and Ranjak Pitta.</p>
<p>This details signify the diagnosis according to Ayurveda is "Yakrat janit Vata-Paittik shotha" or "Vata-paittik yakrat shotha" and in the view of Allopathy Modern western medicine the disease condition will be "Hepatic Oedematous condition" or "Hepatic Edema."</p>

<p>The Ayurvedic Research is being published since last two issues of The Moral newspaper. A large number of the readers of the newspaper from the different states all over India welcommed the research work done by Dr. Desh Bandhu Bajpai of Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Many questions were asked for.</p>
<p>1- The research work is carried with the financial help from the patients and donations from the patient's family and the admirer of the Ayurveda. Therefore it is decided by the inventor Dr. Desh Bandhu Bajpai that the Electrotridoshagram technology should be dedicated to the entire community of the patients, all over the globe. Dr. D.B.Bajpai is dedicating his entire ETG research work to the patients.</p>
<p>2- This is known to be all concerned to Ayurveda that in future Ayurveda should be ready to face the possible challenges standed by the Modern Western Medicine. The target is straightly towards the Ayurveda.Foreign Multinational companies are in mal-practices to sell their products in India. They are using mal-tactices to sell their products by hooks and crooks. These multinationals directly or indirectly is advertising that Ayurvedic medicines are containing toxic materials and herbs and those will use these medicines, they will be poisoned and their body parts will hurt by using these Ayurvedic medicines. By using Ayurvedic Bhasma and Mercury-sulphur based medicines causes to fail kidney and liver and many Vital Parts of the body is affected. This type of the news published and broadcasted by the media, now a days the American, British, Canadian, German, Francicy governemt banned on the use of Ayurvedic medicines in their respective countries.</p>
<p>This is a direct attack to defame, on the 5000 years old timely developped Indian system of medicine, Ayurveda and an insult of the Indian traditional medical system. The foreigners why forget that the development in the Modern western medicine is not very old and the progress which have in the Allopathy that is 40 and 50 years old. In Indian during the regime of Britishers, the overall British families taking the treatment of the Ayurveda which was provided to them by the King and Nawabs of the respective states by their Rajvaidya. At that time there is no complaints done by any Britishers to failure of Kidney or Liver damages.Years and years Britishers uses theses medicines. Why this propaganda against the Ayurveda is at this time?</p>
<p>3- However a <b>famous Ayurvedic Medicine Arogyavardhini Bati</b> has been tested by the Electrotridosha graphy technology on human body. In this Vati medicine the Mercury, sulphur, herbs , minerals, metals are used for the preparation. The medicine is tested on the patients of Hepatitis, Enlargement of Liver, Swelling of Liver, Gall Bladder inflammation and time to time monitored their health conditions. After testing this medicine on the human body, no side effects or adverse effects are not observed and patient safely got cure. All the body parts did not shown any abnormality.</p>
<p>4- The technology is not yet Patented, so that the details will be provided to the readers with limitations.</p>

<p>Ayurvedic physicians from all over India welcommed, by heart and soul, the invention of the ETG technology.</p>
<p>1- It should be well noted to all that Electrotridoshagram technology is the First, only, alone Hi-tek of Ayurveda, which is in existence. This is the only indigenous technology, which is developed in the country, without any external supports. The technology is a boon of Ayurveda, which is giving by the Ayurveda to the whole world. It should be noted here that all the scans, examinations are came from the Modern Western Medicine [Allopathy] sides.</p>
<p>Electrotridoshagraphy is came from Ayurveda, complementary medicines and Holistic healing medicine sides.</p>
<p>2- Many Ayurvedic practitioners shows interest in the E.T.G. machine and the technology. To understand the ETG and the interpretation of the recorded tracings are the essential part of the technique. One have a good knowledge of Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, Practice of medicine etc along with the Ayurvedic Dosha-dhatu-mala and other Ayurveda basic principles. Because the interpretation of the data will be based on the Ayurveda side diagnosis and Modern Western Medicine sides both. So without having a good knowledge of the mentioned subjects the interpretation will be difficult.</p>
<p>3- It is observed since long experience that Ayurvedic treatment based on the Electrotridoshagram diagnosis and findings, cure is ascertained. The reason is, all the comprehensive disease picture comes before the physician in data, index, graphical forms of Tridosha existence, Five kinds of the Tridosha, Sapta Dhatus including Vata affected sapta dhatu, pitta affected sapta dhatu, kaphha affected sapta dhatu, Three malas - stool, urine, sweat, Agnibala, prakrati etc. The data also provides that which side, right or left, is affected or which part of the body is more or less sick.</p>
<p>This data provides physician the diagnosis ability and the physicians finds the exact location of the problems in the body. The physician came to know where and what treatment should be given to patient with the management.</p>

<p>It is very easy to estimate the presence of Vata Dosha in the human body by the help of ETG technology. Hundred thousands Electrotridoshagram trace record's pattern shows that ETG records are identical and individual. It is impossible that similar pattern of one person will tally with the other person in the same way. This fact came after studying hundred thousands recording. Therefore recording of the ETG is said to be identical and individual.</p>
<p>Before recording , a normal parameter is seted to the sick. This parameter is came from the IEC and CEC. The parameter can be changed and will not remain same.</p>

<p>Tracing no:1- this is record of a 58 years old male. The normal parameter is 25.44 e.v. The person is having 16 e.v. from Vata-sthan. Thus he is having presence of Vata in his body 62.89 percent. The normal should be 95 to 99 percent.</p>
<p>Tracing no:2- this is record of the 38 years old male. The normal parameter is 12 e.v. In the tracing 8 e.v. is present. This person is having vata presence 66.66 percent.</p>
<p>Tracing no:3- this is record of a 50 years old female. The normal parameter is 14 e.v. The tracing shows 10 e.v. She is having presence of Vata 71.42 percent.</p>
<p>Tracing no:4- this is a record of the 71 years old male. The normal parameter is 26 e.v. The tracing is 28 e.v. The person is having presence of the Vata 107.69 percent, which is above from normal 95 to 99 percent.</p>
<p>Tracing no:5- this is a record of 22 years lady. The normal parameter is 20 e.v. She is having 20 e.v. She is having normal presence of Vata.</p>
<p>{The article contains [1] five trace records pattern taken from the Vata-sthan [2] Original record of a patient, named Sajjan Tewari, 22-10-05 at 01:50 PM, Diagnosed Acute Filariasis Right Lower Limb with Hyperpyerexia. Ayurvedic diagnosis is Dwidoshaj jwara vataj-pittaj with Pheelpawn.</p>
<p>The introductory line contains:</p>
<p>Example of the 15 sector recording of the Electro-tridosha-gram. This is a record of a young 35 years old male patient, which is sick from the Dwidoshaj jwara [Vataj-pittaj].

<p><b>English Translation:</b></p>
<p>In connection with the publication of news and details about the invention of new technology of Ayurveda in weekly newspaper The Moral, physicians and medical practitioners have taken it with great enthusiasm and applaudes expressions.</p>
<p>1- Dr. S.K. Gupta M.B.B.S.,M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Chacha Neharu Children's Hospital, Cooperganj, Kanpur have gone through with details of Electro-tridosha-gram technology, expressing his view that the technology can provide good diagnostic ability in early detection of cancer, of the body-parts.</p>
<p>2- Ayurvedic treatement experiences, which have been gained with those disease conditions, which are chronic in nature and is going parrellel with the life spawn, can be treated by taking the base of ETG findings. ETG findings makes easier the comprehensive Ayurvedic treatment classical concept, which have been said in the classical books of Ayurveda without any doubt and mistakes, because the technology provided the internal organs sickness stage foolproof and no chances of any mistakes in the provision of treatment. The Ayurvedic physician have thus confidence in himself and his Ayurvedic treatment and medicine/drug prescribing. ETG avoids the risk of wrong diagnosis. What is to be cured in the sick? this target is provided by the technology. The technology avoides confusion of Physician and opens the target for treatment, on the other side the technology provides confidence in the mind of the physician and save from any deviation before, during and after treatment.</p>
<p>3- The technology is easy for the doctors and the patient. Any place, any time, any circumstances the recording can be done. There is no need of any premedication or pre-preparations.It is a very easy technology. There is no torturing medications, no blood lettings, no injections no pain. When patient is Hospitalised or on bed or in emergency and if physician feels for regular monitoring of the patient's conditions, electrodes can be fitted in the proper place and thus the condition can be monitored as desired interval quickly. The psychological aspect of the regular monitoring will provide patience in patient's mind that the physician is watching regularly his/her condition and they are doing something.</p>
