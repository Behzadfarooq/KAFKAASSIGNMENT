<p>We do not sort cities based on ethnicity. It would be ridiculous to have a 'list of white cities' and etc. Such lists should have solidly established borders for inclusion criteria.

<dd>I don't know why you feel the need to repeat the same argument three times, it's not exactly convincing. If there is some disagreement as to whether a particular city was Kurdish, then including that disagreement is a simple matter. In any case, this objection has nothing to do with the reasons for the original nomination, which was based on the existence of the page, which is clearly not a problem. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:06, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>After some thought though, I believe a <b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Kurdish_people_8e65.html" title="History of the Kurdish people">History of the Kurdish people</a> might be more appropriate here. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:19, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I wouldn't be opposed with a redirect. The thing I'm not conviced of here is the actual existence of true City-States in the political sense. Please note that there is a conceptual difference between a city and a city-state and as it stands most cities in the article appear to have been part of larger empires which would mean they were not city-states. That, combined with a <i>total lack of sources</i> which could verify the existence of actual Kurdish City-States makes me lean towards deletion. Now, if sources are provided that actually illustrate that Kurdish City-States did, in fact, exist then this is a perfectly valid article topic, though it should be more than a list and it really should be <b>renamed</b> to draw attention to the fact that such city-states are not contemporary but rather historical. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 21:13, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well. whether or not there were independent Kurdish cities is a question that I don't know the answer to, I can believe that such did happen, so even absent some sources, I'm comfortable with a redirect. I don't see the need to rename the article absent some existing city-states that might cause confusion, especially if the page is being redirected. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:04, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that it's not an important question if this is to be a redirect. However, it <i>is</i> important if the article is to be deleted or kept. Unless this question can be satisfactorily answered in the positive the article should not be kept as is. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 01:56, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think we're communicating effectively here. Redirecting the article after a deletion would only remove a few edits from the history, which I don't consider consequential enough to matter. It'd be one thing if the content were libelous, but I don't think that's an issue here. So, there isn't an issue to keeping and replacing with a redirect. Leaving the history won't bother me. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:29, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> As poorly defined list. This list may be valid if it's referring to historical city-states. However, the article seems to at least imply that these are current city-states as the title is in the present tense and there is virtually no actually prose in the article. Given that there <i>are no</i> Kurdish city-states in existence today (I'm unsure of whether there have been in the past as I'm not all that familiar with Kurdish history, though I have a feeling that there weren't ever any truly Kurdish only city-states although I very well may be wrong) this should go or at least the title should be reworded and a brief introduction should better define what is being listed. I do, however, agree with Manticore that the argument that such cities shouldn't be sorted by ethnicity is false, as Ancient Greek City-States would be perfectly valid. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:43, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, if they aren't historic then this definitely needs to go because there are no modern Kurdish city-states, as you seem to imply as well. This 'article' is way too ambiguous for my tastes, though I recognize it may be valid. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 09:33, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I've gone through the blue links in the article, which is just a list, and am now completely convinced of the need to delete; these weren't necessarily Kurdish, they were Assyrian cities, and they were explicitly city-states either. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 09:48, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The problem with this is that Assyrian and Kurdistan are more or less in the same area, just at different times. Thus that a city was originally Assyrian, and the Wikipedia article covers only that period, does not mean that the city was never Kurdish. It would help to have sources, mind you, and that is a problem with this list. Too bad the nominator didn't try that argument. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:29, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, it would be better then if it were titled Historical Assyrian City-States as I don't believe Assyrians are identical to Kurds. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 21:13, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That would only be applicable if the intent were to make a list of Historical Assyrian City-states, and that would I assume, be taken care of in articles about <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyria.html" title="Assyria">Assyria</a>. As I said though, the thing is, many of these names might be in common, since the regions are in the same geographical area, just not at the same time. That's why I don't take saying "These are Assyrian cities" as proof that they weren't also Kurdish cities at some other time. Proving they were never Kurdish would require different sources. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:04, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The problem that I see here is that the burden of proof is on the articles creator and those seeking to keep it to provide sources that show that these were Kurdish city-states. Without sources we have no clue whether these Assyrian cities were every Kurdish city-states. Hell, we don't even have anything that actually proves that there ever have been city states that were strictly Kurdish! Without any sources and with what appears to be misleading/inaccurate information we shouldn't keep this. Also, just because the nominator didn't use the lack of sources as a reason for their nomination of this article doesn't mean that it can't be deleted for that reason. Again, finally, although I'm not particularly well acquainted with this region's history I do have a general knowledge of it and am personally unaware of there ever being anything that could properly be categorized as a Kurdish City-State. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 01:04, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, I do agree that a lack of sources here is a problem, but merely showing a city was Assyrian doesn't disprove that a city was also independent and Kurdish at some point in time. Still, given the lack of sources, I'd suggest a redirect to the already sourced page I mentioned above. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:48, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
