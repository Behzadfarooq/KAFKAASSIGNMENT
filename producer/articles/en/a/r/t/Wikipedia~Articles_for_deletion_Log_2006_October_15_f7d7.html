The concern is that the article doesn't show proof of this being a wide-used term to describe these areas. It appears as though the group that helped create this article and one newspaper are the only people to ever use this term in the context given in the article.

<li><b>Keep, but needs major revamping</b>. From discussing this with proponents of the "Inner Banks" term, this is a fairly new term and has yet to catch huge attention like the "Outer Banks". As a result, the exact boundaries of this "region" are very very vauge. I personally do not think it should even come close to Fayetteville, as that would be considered part of the "Coastal Plain". The inner banks article may need to merged into a new article about the Coastal Plain of North Carolina (not just <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Coastal_Plain_736b.html" title="Atlantic Coastal Plain">Atlantic Coastal Plain</a>) until its definition can become more widely accepted. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGooday.1_70f1.html" title="User:Gooday.1">TinMan</a> 18:55, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b>. This term has not achieved sufficient widespread usage to warrant an article here. In fact, I believe the term was created recently by the Foundation of Renewal for Eastern North Carolina as part of a fairly sophisticated public relations and marketing campaign, a component of which involves securing an article on Wikipedia. Mr. Mills alleges <i>"A Google search for Inner Banks in quotation marks produced 24,700 hits today."</i> <s>That is patently false.</s> To insinuate that those all refer to this region is false. If one continues to the last page of the Google search results, it is easily confirmed that this term receives only <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=+%22inner+banks%22&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;start=900&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=+%22inner+banks%22&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;start=900&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">688 GHits</a>, the vast majority of which have nothing to do with this "region" of <s>South</s> North Carolina. The firm that Mr. Mills works for may eventually succeed in establishing this as a commonly used term, but they should not be allowed to use Wikipedia to do so.

<dd>I apologize for getting hung up on Googling and obfuscating my main point. I am not arguing that this article should be deleted because it only gets 688 unique Google hits. I was trying to say, albeit clumsily, that it should be deleted because virtually none of those 688 unique Google hits that can be accessed have anything to do with North Carolina (so saying this "region" of NC gets 24,700 hits <i>is</i> false). This term is simply not widely used as specifically referring to a geographic region of NC, and that's why we can't find reliable, third-party sources to verify it in this context. --<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatori_Son_3c62.html" title="User talk:Satori Son"><b>Satori Son</b></a></span> 06:33, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As another fellow North Carolinian, I agree with Jayron32. I've never heard of the "Inner Banks" until I saw the WP article. It should be renamed Coastal Plain (North Carolina) or something like that and reorganized and reformatted to reflect the more popular and more official name. It is basically a subregion of the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Coastal_Plain_736b.html" title="Atlantic Coastal Plain">Atlantic Coastal Plain</a> and can probably use its own article.

<li><b>Keep and clean-up</b> This is a marketing term, and it is possible to have an encyclopedic article on a marketing term. But the intro should describe it as a marketing term in an encyclopedic voice, not describe the area in an advertising voice. I think all the list sections should go away.

<li>With respect to <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>'s comment that "all of those regions have their names and borders clearly defined in the historical record going back for a LONG time." The <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampton_Roads_cf0c.html" title="Hampton Roads">Hampton Roads</a> of <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> was branded for <i>marketing purposes</i> with the founding of the Hampton Roads Partnership on May 15, 1996 <a href="http://www.hrp.org/about_hrp.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hrp.org/about_hrp.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>.</li>
<li>The nonprofit organization that is working to brand the region as the Inner Banks is doing so for very important reasons. The region is three times the size of the state of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>. If this region were to be removed from the rest of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_5c52.html" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a> and made the 51st state, it would be the poorest state in the nation. Ten of the 20 poorest counties in the United States are found in this region. Economically, the region is still in the 19th Century, having been traditionally dependent on agriculture and manufacturing. Many of these jobs have moved overseas as a result of internationals agreements such as <a href="../../../n/a/f/NAFTA_941e.html" title="NAFTA">NAFTA</a>. This region has no clear identity outside of the region. Other users on Wikipedia who hail from North Carolina are not sure what to call it. The suggestion to rename this article the Coastal Plain (North Carolina) is proof of this. The purpose of having a regional identity is to set it apart from other areas. The Coastal Plain reaches across at least 10 different states, so it makes no sense to call this region the Coastal Plain (North Carolina) not only because it fails to set it apart from other areas, but because the Coastal Plain and the Inner Banks are two different areas on a map (while the Inner Banks is mostly located in the Coastal Plain, there are some counties, such as <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_County%2C_North_Carolina_6254.html" title="Warren County, North Carolina">Warren County, North Carolina</a>, that are actually located in the <a href="../../../p/i/e/Piedmont.html" title="Piedmont">Piedmont</a> region of North Carolina).
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>, as someone who lives in Raleigh, you, of all people, should understand the power that branding can have on a local economy. People from all around the world know what you are talking about when you mention the Triangle. While you enjoy the benefits of having an internationally known regional identity, some of the poorest places in this nation are just a few miles away. But then again, if anyone should have the right to argue that this region should not have a clearly distinct regional identity, it should be you. You do, after all, along with everyone else who lives west of I-95, subsidize the poverty here with your tax dollars. <a href="../../../k/m/i/User%7EKmills_ea55.html" title="User:Kmills">Kevin R Mills</a> 14:27, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. With all due respect, Mr. Mills, no one is criticizing your motives or the good marketing work you guys are doing. We're simply saying that Wikipedia is not a marketing tool; it is an encyclopedia of notable subjects. This article will be welcome here once you and your team succeed in achieving widespread use and notability for this term. Thank you, <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatori_Son_3c62.html" title="User talk:Satori Son"><b>Satori Son</b></a></span> 14:59, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>With all due respect to you sir, there are literally thousands of articles on this website that can be deemed as marketing. Whether it is marketing a brand, such as the hundreds of regions in the US that have articles (such as <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampton_Roads_cf0c.html" title="Hampton Roads">Hampton Roads</a> and The Triangle of North Carolina), marketing a television series (such as VH1's <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flavor_of_Love_4286.html" title="Flavor of Love">Flavor of Love</a>), marketing an entertainer (such as <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britany_Spears_c4e8.html" title="Britany Spears">Britany Spears</a> and her albums, like <a href="../../../t/h/e/B_in_the_Mix%7E_The_Remixes_7d73.html" title="B in the Mix: The Remixes">B in the Mix: The Remixes</a>, which, technically, could be seen as a means of marketing a product), and promoting political groups (such as <a href="../../../m/o/v/MoveOn_be79.html" title="MoveOn">MoveOn</a>). I might add that all of these terms have come into popular use within the last 10 years. Yet they all have articles on Wikipedia and they all deal with a marketable concept or marketable product. With regards to whether or not this term is a neologism or not, in THIS region, the term Inner Banks has been used to refer to North Carolina's <i>second coast</i> for many years (the <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outer_Banks_c310.html" title="Outer Banks">Outer Banks</a> being the other coast of North Carolina). Much in the same way that <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampton_Roads_cf0c.html" title="Hampton Roads">Hampton Roads</a> was used for years to describe a geographical area - a body of water in this example - but is now (since 1996) used as a tool for marketing. It is extremely interesting to see how much attention people are paying to whether or not this term (the <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_Banks_9160.html" title="Inner Banks">Inner Banks</a>) is a neologism when Wikipedia has other articles that are clearly neologisms and that do a great deal more harm to the credibility of this Internet encyclopedia (see <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirty_Sanchez_67e0.html" title="Dirty Sanchez">Dirty Sanchez</a>) <a href="../../../k/m/i/User%7EKmills_ea55.html" title="User:Kmills">Kevin R Mills</a> 16:04, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> The "If X then Y" arguement will get you NOWHERE. This article is being judged on its own merit and not on that of other articles on WikiPedia. If you have a problem with another article, put it up for AfD and see what happens. But don't bring up this article in reference to any other. Simply make a case based on the merits of the article in question. The question here is not whether it is <i>marketing.</i> It may be, it may not be. Who cares. The question is does the article meet the primary notability criterion: Does it get significant coverage in multiple, non-trivial sources as a primary focus of the writing. This region DEFINATELY does. So the information is worthy of keeping. The second question is is this the best name for this article? According to the map in the article, and the descriptions of the region, including one right here in the AfD, the region is more than a subset of the North Carolina Coastal Plain (again, check out the <a href="http://statelibrary.dcr.state.nc.us/NC/GEO/GEO.HTM" class="external text" title="http://statelibrary.dcr.state.nc.us/NC/GEO/GEO.HTM" rel="nofollow">link from the official State Library</a>), it is COTERMINOUS with that region (that is, it is identical to it). Thus, it is a renaming of a region with an established historical record and boundaries, not merely a division of that region. The Triangle is a subdivision of the Piedmont, not a renaming of the whole region. The older name is more established in the literature and the historical record, so the article, while it should be kept, should be renamed. Yes, a "coastal plain" is a generic geographic term. Yes the "Atlantic Coastal Plain" is a larger region. But within the context of North Carolina geography, the Coastal Plain has a very specific meaning: It doesn't mean Delaware or Florida. It means the area defined by this article. SO keep the article, and rename it to fit what the established record is. Redirect Inner Banks to it. You can even expand the article to explain the marketing strategy, and the origin of the term. That would be fine. But to imply that the region is BETTER known as, or MORE PROPERLY known as the Inner Banks is currently not verified by the established documentation. The established documentation points to the name Coastal Plain. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 20:10, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> If you read all of my comments, you can see I changed my opinion. The REGION being described is a coherant region. The NAME of the region is a new name for an old region. Until it recieves more coverage, what we should do is <b>rename</b> the article, <b>redirect</b> "inner banks" to thge newly named article, and <b>rewrite</b> the article (with sources) to indicate the alternative name. For example for how this works, see what typing <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kings_County%2C_New_York_b6a2.html" title="Kings County, New York">Kings County, New York</a> turns up. That name is a LESSER USED name for what is Brooklyn. The two designations are COTERMINOUS, and thus redundant. We don't need two articles where one will do. I posit that while Inner Banks is a valid name for the region, it does NOT describe a region different than the North Carolina Coastal Plain, and thus while ALL of the information in the article should be kept, we should name the article with the MORE WIDELY RECOGNIZED name. If you are positing that the Inner Banks is somehow different than the North Carolina Coastal Plain, then PROVIDE SOURCES that indicate so, and show how it is a different region. The article AS IT IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN does not give evidence to that point. Oh, and you keep bringing up other articles that should be deleted. If you want another article's deletion, please <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">Nominate that article for deletion</a>. The existance of another deletable article has NO BEARING on the status of this article. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 16:34, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Debate was speedy closed per <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> and because the majority of votes at the time were keeps, after running for less than a day. Third nomination, hopefully this time there will be less bias when people here comment on this. The man died, and nothing has changed since January. Anybody with enough knowledge can start up an IRC network, in my opinion founding one doesn't make a person notable or worthy of their own article; and in most situations dying doesn't increase a person's notability. <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">jd</a> || <a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di">talk</a> || 01:19, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Notability has been established as founder of an IRC network with significant &gt;30k users.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Freenode is not simply an IRC network, it is an IRC network with the intention of fostering open source projects. It is successful as networks go, and Rob was at the helm of that success. Since January, Rob isn't around minimizing his importance out of a sense of humility. Rob was notable among IRC network communities. It occurs to me that we're seeing a pattern forming here of AfD's being started and failing, and so repeating, being shopped for new voters. --vmarks 02:17, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Normally, I would tend to agree that founding an IRC network is not notable. However, the IRC network founded, Freenode, stands apart from the thousands of other IRC networks, in that it is the chosen gathering place for those involved in Internet and Information Technology related projects, including Open Source Projects, Linux, Wikipedia, WikiNews, 'Blogging, and many more related disiplines. Freenode was established to give groups a common meeting place to discuss, share and grow ideas that affect us all as Internet and IT users, both professional and the casual home user.</li>
</ul>
<p>One precedent for inclusion of places pointing to a special interest group is in the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood%2C_Los_Angeles%2C_California_07ef.html" title="Hollywood, Los Angeles, California">Hollywood</a> Wikipedia article, which contains a rather large list of Hollywood Landmarks and interesting spots. Freenode is no less a landmark to those involved in Internet and IT projects, much in the same way as several references in the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood%2C_Los_Angeles%2C_California_07ef.html" title="Hollywood, Los Angeles, California">Hollywood</a> article to <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musso_%26_Frank%27s_Grill_edba.html" title="Musso &amp; Frank's Grill">Musso &amp; Frank's Grill</a>, a favorite hangout of Hollywood celebrities, and <a href="../../../g/o/w/Gower_Gulch_c82d.html" title="Gower Gulch">Gower Gulch</a>, a street intersection where aspiring cowboy actors would hang out, in hopes of being "discovered".</p>
<p>Freenode is the "Gower Gulch" or Schwab's of the Internet community, and Rob Levin, as founder, holds a place of distinction in creating an IRC network which serves a unique purpose beyond that of other IRC networks.</p>
<p>Virtually all special interest groups, political, religious, or social, has a place that is held in respect as their place of origin or of significance to their organization. Freenode is no less a place as any other, created to bring together people for purposes of furthering ideas relevant to the progress of society as a whole.</p>
<p>Another such example is <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tun_Tavern_277e.html" title="Tun Tavern">Tun Tavern</a>, the birthplace of the U.S. Marine Corps. I can cite many others of all descriptions. Should the Rob Levin article be removed, I would then request that every other article pointing to a place, or an article referencing the founder of any place synonomous with any other special interest group then be placed for deletion.

<li>In what way is imploring someone to stop trying to delete articles which have obvious public interest a 'personal attack'? I'm not a fan of article deletion, much less three time article deletion. The first one passed because nobody noticed (which is a serious problem with article deletion -- basically, if you don't want articles to be deleted, you MUST watch them), the second nomination was immediately squashed, and the third doesn't have wheels. Stop deleting reasonable articles! It's wrong! If you want to have fun deleting articles, go delete an article nobody cares about.

Also, the previous AfD, though showing a large number of keep votes (24, including weak keep) against a small number of delete or merge/redirect votes (5), was closed early, so it could be worthwhile to listen to the debate.

Wales has been featured in numerous reliable publications in multiple countries, has been interviewed many times, and is president and founder of the corporation which controls one of the most popular and well-known Web sites. He is also coauthor of a published academic paper.

<li>Yes, that's a good point. I agree that jwales is indeed more notable, but I would put them both in the same category as people like Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds - all four of these are working for freedom of information. I leave my&#160;!vote as a Keep, but I would say that it's definately not a strong one, as I understand that I may appear a little biased - as a freenode volunteer, I would never close this AfD even if I had not made a comment in it.

<li><b><strike>Delete</strike> Keep</b> (Please see below for reason to change the vote, the old reasoning is left here for the record.) per jd, very little has changed (other than the recent death), and however saddening it may be, it doesn't necessarily justify his own wikipedia page. The problem I see is there is very little chance of this growing beyond much of a stub page, with basic facts of his life, and the one major accomplishment of founding the Open Projects Network / Freenode. That is why I would strongly suggest merging/redirecting to the Freenode/PDPC articles, detailing his contributions there. While I would agree that his influence was profound, I'm just afraid there's very little content which can be added to make this deserving of its own article. While I can see his influence now as being significant, I'm not sure that it would stand the test of becoming a part of the historical record in the field, per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<dd>The reference here was to some not formally accepted tests for notability in biographies: the expandability ("will this ever be more than a stub?") and 100-year test ("will anyone without a direct connection find the article useful?"). While I'd agree that 100 years is a bit far-fetched in this case, I have problems visualizing long-term notability. The main clause from the accepted policy is "[those] who are likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field." That would be what I would contest. Again, if someone has evidence which may contradict me, by all means—please show it. I knew and worked with Rob Levin on Freenode staff, and considering he even stated that an article about himself was not notable (see first AfD), the not uncommon (although tragic) bicycle accident leading to his death in itself does not give notability (not that this is necessarily what people are contesting). Also, yes, I have read comments below, although I will comment on them there. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDougk_db9d.html" title="User:Dougk">Dougk</a> 17:24, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I hate to fight the prevailing wisdom here, but I'm not seeing any real evidence of the subject's <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a>. There appear to be no <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">reliable sources</a> from which to draw information for the article. Most of the comments above seem to base their claims of notability on subjective criteria—"Levin is notable because he started a <a href="../../../f/l/o/FLOSS_260c.html" title="FLOSS">FLOSS</a> IRC network" and such—which I think is an unfortunate example of Wikipedia's <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a>. Unless I'm mistaken, we don't have article(s) about the founder(s) of <a href="../../../d/a/l/DALnet_4eb7.html" title="DALnet">DALnet</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/c/IRCnet_fd34.html" title="IRCnet">IRCnet</a>, or <a href="../../../e/f/n/EFnet_6857.html" title="EFnet">EFnet</a> (which according to the article is the present incarnation of the original IRC network), although those networks have existed for much longer than Freenode and have an order of magnitude more users. An article about the now-deceased founder of an IRC network dedicated to, say, collectibles would probably be summarily speedy deleted or merged into an article about the network. In addition, the article was deleted in its <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rob_Levin_5c4e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rob Levin">initial AfD</a> with the approval of Levin himself, who stated he did not believe himself to be notable enough for Wikipedia, and only recreated following his death. My recommendation would be to redirect the article to <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freenode.html" title="Freenode">Freenode</a> and incorporate information about Levin into that article (which could use a great deal of improvement itself, but that's another matter). --<a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowking_Man_5da9.html" title="User:Slowking Man">Slowking Man</a> 09:05, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>We have discussed the merits of Rob's self-effacement of the first afd before and they were dismissed at that time in the last afd. We also extensively discussed the merger question and it was dismissed on several grounds. That wikipedia is lacking representations of notable people, such as the other major irc network founders, is not evidence that it should keep them out or delete them. There is no reason to delete this one either or to merge it. It stands as a question of whether he is notable or not and whether there are verified facts, there are verified facts and notability has been established. Is he as notable as Jimbo, does he pass the notability test in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a>, yes.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 14:54, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would have to disagree on some points here: I didn't see necessarily how the "merits of Rob's self-effacement" were dismissed (other than the AfD being closed)—there simply wasn't a lot of discussion on the topic, as I wasn't aware of the "several grounds" for dismissing the merger idea. Perhaps you can shine some light on the subject? I don't think the past AfD being closed is sufficient grounds to completely dismiss all arguments for the delete, but perhaps another way to look at it is at he time, the reasons to keep outweighed the reasons to delete. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDougk_db9d.html" title="User:Dougk">Dougk</a> 17:24, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Time is an important factor here, I agree. I can see an AFD on this article in maybe 3-5 years, once the facts of history have become pretty stable, perhaps in 3 years no one will know who lilo was, however, in the present, things are still current, freenode is still running, and his other efforts are likely still being documented. as for the merger debate that was on the article talk page, jimbo perhaps put it succinctly in regards to time on that page. --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 18:40, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ok, I see what you mean... I hope time wouldn't be a factor, though I agree that it could cause this article to be re-evaluated. Jimbo's comments do sum up the argument pretty well, since it does establish some idea of notability (at least, given this context), and that a merger of the articles would seem out of place. To me, it seems a precarious balance, although in this instance, I think you have indeed shown that the keep vote is justified. However, I would recommend leaving the vote open for the full term, so that this doesn't happen again immediately after the vote—it looks like the last AfD was perhaps closed too early, while there was still some debate. Again, as Buridan has pointed out, it is noteworthy to read through <a href="../../../r/o/b/Talk%7ERob_Levin_ac50.html" title="Talk:Rob Levin">Talk:Rob Levin</a>—there is discussion relevant to this issue on that page which is not included in the previous AfD pages. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDougk_db9d.html" title="User:Dougk">Dougk</a> 20:17, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, still, and if the article can't be made to grow at all, merge to PDPC/freenode articles. I'm not buying the "just a memorial" thing; the guy has at least <i>some</i> minor claims to fame, aside of just being dead. And "we don't have articles on other IRC net founders" is not an issue, in my opinion... assuming that the founder was well known among the network users, and lilo was well known among Freenode users. (Really, I don't really even pay attention to who runs the IRC networks, but lilo stuck in mind.) --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 10:10, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>that seems to be a strange interpretation of events, but it hinges on whether you know well enough to know that what he said, is what he meant.

<dd>I think I can understand somewhat what Rebecca is saying (though I won't speak for her)—I find myself sitting almost smack in the middle... on one side, he did make rather significant contributions founding the first open-source/free-software-centric IRC network (others have since split from the original project)... but still, there is the fact that he originally wished to have the article deleted. Also, outside of Freenode, there aren't any major contributions that I am aware of. I don't think the issue necessarily rests on the issue "Was his contribution to Freenode notable?" but rather, "Was his life notable as a whole?" -- and to me, at least, it's a very difficult decision to make. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDougk_db9d.html" title="User:Dougk">Dougk</a> 04:18, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> per many comments made above, but also because he stands to be an important representation of open source cultural values that may prove valuable later; as such, retaining this stub seems reasonable. Chris Messina 01:05, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Freenode is a landmark IRC network and one of the few networks not full of botnets and script kiddies. It is as central to the world of IT as <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a> or <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sourceforge.html" title="Sourceforge">Sourceforge</a>.

It sets out "criteria used for these lists", which erroneously suggests some sort of universal acceptance of the definitions used therein. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRobinson_7e5c.html" title="User:MartinRobinson">Martin</a> 02:09, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Oppose</i>. This is <b>Strong Keep</b>. This is very important because it was added to Arab Israeli conflict template for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Arab-Israeli_Conflict" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Arab-Israeli_Conflict" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. Instead of having to link to 3 different lists which will seem more POV if anything. It's important to have different lists because of the huge number of events, but it's also important to have this disambiguation page . <b>I can't begin to understand how it could be construed as being POV</b>. I'll assume <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and assume that <b>this nomination was made by mistake</b>. List of lists is exactly what this should be and it doesn't have any POV in it. Please remove this whole nomination. --It doesn't set out the criteria anymore, which was written exactly that way in all 3 articles so it didn't suggest anything, but I removed it. Now it's compltelely neutral. Nomination should be speedily removed... obviously it's a disambguition for 3 differnet palestinian lists and it's important to have. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 02:12, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Come now, any terrorism related article has the potential to be regarded as POV by somone, so I don't see how you find it so unbelievable. The edits you made are an improvement however. I appreciate that you're only trying to organise information in the best way possible, but I'm not sure if this is it. A list of lists seems a rather awkward way to go about things. This list is not a list of Palestinian suicide attacks, but a list of lists of Palestinian suicide attacks. Does this list do anything that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Suicide_bombing_in_the_Israeli-Palestinian_conflict" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Suicide_bombing_in_the_Israeli-Palestinian_conflict" rel="nofollow">Category:Suicide bombing in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> doesn't? I just feel it adds no encyclopaedic value. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRobinson_7e5c.html" title="User:MartinRobinson">Martin</a> 02:31, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I find it strange you say it's POV and mention the word terrorism which was never used here. The category is a category and this is a list - we want people to see the entire list together and not different events. Category suicide bombing can contain events that aren't even suicide bombings but reactions to bombings and so on. This is simply a disambiguation link to the 3 lists, because else a redirect will be misleading to only ONE of them. Basically, it's a smarter redirect. I don't see how this can be problematic in any sort. You also didn't bring any arguments against this - you're saying it's redundant because there's a related category&#160;? That doesn't make too much sense IMO and definitely not a reason for deletion. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 02:42, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, going by <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_in_Wikipedia_9f97.html#Explore_the_alternatives" title="Wikipedia:Lists in Wikipedia">WP:LISTV</a>, I think the use of categories vs. lists is a valid concern: "lists which consist solely of links and nothing else are liable to speedy deletion under criterion A3". And as I'm sure you're aware, terrorism was mentioned in your original draft of the article. Regardless, I've been thinking about it, and perhaps a Palestinian suicide attacks (disambiguation) article, or something of that nature, would be a better choice? If it's intended to be a disambiguation page, then let's not be ambiguous.&#160;:) <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRobinson_7e5c.html" title="User:MartinRobinson">Martin</a> 02:53, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>lol...there are some people less charitable than myself who might view that as <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">content forking</a>, but that's another matter. Anyhow, have a think about my suggestions. If you want a disambiguation page, then it's probably better to just create one, rather than mess around with lists and such. That way, if someone searches for "Palestinian suicide attacks" (or whatever), they get a page saying "<b>Palestinian suicide attacks</b> could refer to...". The page could then also link to other appropriate articles about suicide bombings, etc. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRobinson_7e5c.html" title="User:MartinRobinson">Martin</a> 03:11, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a> page suggests otherwise, lists of lists are called listcruft, would go better as a category instead, maybe Category:Palestinian suicide attacks? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelBillington_855e.html" title="User:MichaelBillington">Michael Billington</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelBillington_4525.html" title="User talk:MichaelBillington">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MichaelBillington_ddac.html" title="Special:Contributions/MichaelBillington">contribs</a>) 12:16, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Provisional keep</b>. I see the cruft argument but I believe this has a valid purpose and is, importantly, <i>in use</i> as a navigational aid. I don't see the argument against defining the scope (attacks against civilians vs. attacks against the Israeli military is fairly straightforward and broadly accepted) since that helps keep the list from becoming POV (and editors often argue on AFD for defining the scope of an article down). The list could conceivably include suicide attacks by groups <i>other than</i> Hamas, Fatah, and IJ, but I don't know if there are any that have been so attributed. This isn't a list of lists, it's a single list with three logical subarticles. Now, if there's any improvement that could be made, I would actually <b>reverse merge</b> the relatively brief content of the Al-Aqsa and PIJ lists into this one and keep only Hamas separate. But they're separate, probably, so they can be articles in the categories for those groups. Really, it's not as if Hamas, AAMB and PIJ are all fighting separate wars (although they are fighting separately within the same war, to clarify the distinction). --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 19:41, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Are they producing ministers? How many students attend? Is this bigger than a high school? Can you compare it to a high school? Does it have classrooms? Is it ran out of an apartment?

<li><b>Strong Speedy Delete</b> Advertising abuse of Wikipedia by single purpose account.

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> - I was going to stay out of this, having said what I wanted to say on the talk page, but the more I think about this, the more I feel compelled to make a stand and say delete. I've run across these type of articles before, and they are so disingenuous. It is a single purpose account. The creator, on the talk page, says he will not be silenced by the forces of repression of freedom of speech, blah blah blah, but then has only made edits to Chuck Pfarrer articles, and the original article was just a cut and paste of the press release for a book that there is no buzz about. "Is going to be published" and "Is published" are two different things. The author might be notable, but the book is not - hell, it doesn't even exist yet. For all we know, Chuck has only given an outline to the publisher and is now sweating it out in his basement trying to figure out what to write to meet his deadline. This is most definately, unambiguously, crystal ball stuff here.--<a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobunaga24_963d.html" title="User:Nobunaga24">Nobunaga24</a> 00:16, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Also: the book being <i>announced</i> by Random House doesn't mean it's actually been written yet, or that they will <i>actually</i> publish it. Furthermore, the proposed guideline at <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a> doesn't actually mention the reputation of the publisher, although it notes that a book being self-published is generally indicative of non-notability. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 20:40, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Being tied for the longest game in history does not make this game automatically worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia. There seems to be no precedent for this, as there are no articles that I can find about the longest games in MLB, NFL, NHL, College basketball etc. The article seems to be mostly trivia which, if relevant, should be merged into other lists or articles. Also, if kept, the current name of the article is inappropriate. <a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhatru2_6f16.html" title="User:Khatru2">Khatru2</a> 08:16, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Exceptionally weak keep</b>. I don't follow College Football half as closely as the professional game, but the longest game in the history of a sport or a league (assuming it can be verified, something which a cursory Google appears to say can be done rapidly) strikes me as relatively notable. Even though it's easier for a college game to extend into multi-overtime than a professional one. That said, the title will need work and it may be a better idea to write up a summary of the other 7-OT game and stick it into this page as well. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 09:04, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is a relic from pre-category times.

<li><s><b>Move</b> per Pursey to List of notable artworks. The list itself says that's what it is. "List of artworks" is potentially infinite, unmaintainable and potentially POV. Is the picture of a "Burdy" my 5-year-old niece drew for me an "artwork" (yes, but nn however cute it is)? At the other end of the scale how about <i><a href="../../../e/q/u/Equivalent_VIII_dfc7.html" title="Equivalent VIII">Equivalent VIII</a></i>; in the view of some not an artwork at all, but definitely notable (though not on the list)?

<li>I don't think that a move will solve the problem. Every individual artwork that has a wikipedia article is in some way "notable". But we clearly don't want all of them on this list.

<li>Hey guys. Maybe this is non-wikipedia of me, but this seems useful for it's purpose. No categories, no way to judge (but that's art for you), just a long list of paintings I might want to click on.

<p>This is an incorrect view. The article has a few opinion no doubt, but the purpose of the article is to list the impact of Aryans on Tamil Culture.This is different from the other article Aryan Invasion Theory (history and controversies, in that this examines the impact of Aryan culture on Tamils. Moreover it does not confine itself only to an invasionist scenario. The fact is that different tribes of India, who have different origins intermingled and have produced a composie culture. The effect has been different in different places, and it is not necessarily because of some kind of invasion. --Harishsubramanian 10:38, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The term "Aryan" was widely used prior to the second world war by European and Indian historians, the modern equivalent sometimes used is Indoeuropean, which refers to a language and people. The other principal Indian ethnic and language group was <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dravidan.html" title="Dravidan">Dravidan</a>, which includes Tamil. Ok, this is all something of a simplification and is contested. However, the term "Aryan" does not have neo-nazi overtones in this context. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 13:03, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Comment in this regard: Dont confuse this subject with the Aryan invasion or migration theory which is something that happened much prior to an interaction in south India with representaives of Aryan Culture(who you may say have become indigenous to India by then, yet retain the name Aryans)</p>
<p>The word Brahmin is not synonymous with the word Aryan, but the former are seen as the living representatives of Aryan Culture.My earlier title indeed was a mistake, it could have been Indo-Aryan Culture and Tamils(an Indo-Aryan culture can come into existence only a long time after an Aryan migration), and I have therefore changed the title, in acceptance of my mistake. .Thus one cannot separate the two words -Aryan and Brahmin from each other, but one has to understand the difference in the two terms. Aryan Invasion is not the same as Brahminical influence on other cultures, but understanding the latter requires understanding of the former.</p>
<p>I agree this article is confusing for two reasons 1. The article needs improvement and standardisation 2. Readers who find this article similar to Aryan Invasion theory have insufficent knowledge of this whole subject,because they confuse the two aspects. This confusion is fairly widespread and thus it has also been mentioned in the article and the subject will continue to require a reference to Aryan Invasion theory.</p>
<p>I am certain that addressing the first aspect solves the confusion, but this in no way calls for deletion. Such an action will only be based on ignorance and lack of knowledege of different aspects to the term Aryan, Brahmin , Indian and Dravidian, all of which are different and yet subtly interlinked.One thing cannot be mentioned without reffering to the other.</p>
<p>I would like to know how the other article in anyway explains the relationship of Brahminical culture with Tamil Culture.It only talks about the Aryan invasion theory, and does not in anyway deal with 'Brahminical interaction with Tamil Culture', which took place much later than an actual Aryan migration or invasion. I honestly agree that The content may need to be revised but the article should exist beyond any doubt.</p>
<p>This is not intended to be an essay. It seeks to put forward the various theories that have been put forward by scholars and none of the points which have been mentioned are mine. I have mentioned the theories as proposed by scholars such as Koenrad elst, witzel, Neelakantha Shastri, Romila Thapar, periyar and I have also shown all the references and this article is most certainly neutral. These references will comprehensively prove my point.</p>

My <i>entire point</i> is that the article is written (and extremely badly at that) from a 19th century perspective, add the "Brahminism" to the confused notion of "Aryan", so <i>if</i> you insist there is anything salvageable here, just try and turn it into something presentable in contemporary terms. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 17:33, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the context of Hinduism, the term Aryan is still in current usage <a href="http://www.shaivam.org/hiparyan.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.shaivam.org/hiparyan.htm" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>. There is some debate regarding the term, however there is a viewpoint that not using the description would constitute a posthumous victory for nazism. Similarly, there is debate about the swastika, which for example is used in the Hinduism template. To use Brahmanism for Hinduism would be completely inappropriate, however to use the term to describe a specific aspect of indoeuropean culture is again current usage <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/hrsolid/mainfile.php/2001vol11no08/1168/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ahrchk.net/hrsolid/mainfile.php/2001vol11no08/1168/" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>.

<dd>In the context of Hinduism, Sanskrit <i><a href="../../../a/r/y/Arya.html" title="Arya">arya</a></i> is used, which article I kindly ask you to review. This isn't just about Nazism, it is about accuracy. The term "Aryan" for <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Iranian_e152.html" title="Indo-Iranian">Indo-Iranian</a> is <i>obsolete</i>. The term "Aryan" for <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Aryan_3705.html" title="Indo-Aryan">Indo-Aryan</a>, as it is intended here, is inaccurate. If you could just use "Indo-Aryan" if you refer to the sociolinguistic group, things would be so much easier. The term "Aryan" is still in the compound, as you will note, it is just a matter of specifying a <i>subgroup</i> of the group formerly, and confusingly, known as "Aryans", and now properly called "Indo-Iranians". This has no direct connection with Hinduism, however, and discussing the term as used in Hinduism, you should link to <i><a href="../../../a/r/y/Arya.html" title="Arya">arya</a></i>. While there is no dichotomy "Tamils vs. <i>arya</i>" (Tamil brahmins can obviously be considered <i>arya</i>), there is a dichotomy Tamils vs. Indo-Aryans, <i>linguistically</i>. We have a set of beutiful articles that are explain this in detail, and the reason I put this on AfD is that both title and article were completely unaware of the first thing about this terminology. You can read it <i>all</i> up on Wikipedia, <i>already</i>. Now that it transpires that this article could be about Sanskritization of Dravidian peoples, or about <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_separatism.html" title="Tamil separatism">Tamil separatism</a> in Indian politics, it of course addresses a valid topic. So yes, we can <i>move</i> the article from the broken title, and <i>replace</i> the broken text with actual English containing actual encyclopedic infomation, but how exactly this is different from deletion isn't quite clear to me. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 19:07, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>yes, but there is a lot of confusion, because the terms are so similar or identical. Your link <i>also</i> uses "Aryan" in the socio-linguistic sense, not the <i>arya</i>=noble one, even if it talks about Hinduism, and with "these Aryan" refers to what we properly call <i>Indo</i>-Aryans. See <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryan</a>. And Harishsubramanian is apparently also a classical victim of such confusion. Dravidians aren't [Indo-]Aryans, in the socio-linguistic sense. But they may of course be <i>arya</i> ("noble" in the Hindu sense, viz., if they follow Hindu doctrine and what not). The article, talking about "Aryan theory" and "Aryans" vs. Dravidians was obviously intending the socio-linguistic terms, but was caught up in confusion about the religious term. Now this article is about Brahminism and Tamils So <i>how</i> is its topic different from <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_brahmins.html" title="Tamil brahmins">Tamil brahmins</a>? Yet again, we see that it should be merged with an existing article. If it isn't about obstruse racial theories (anymore), merge it to an article on whatever it wants to be about. Also note that we are missing <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_separatism.html" title="Tamil separatism">Tamil separatism</a>, that might bear creation and a quick writeup, since it seems to be central to the topic at hand. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 19:46, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is once again some misunderstanding here,</p>
<p>Dravidians and Hinduism is once again a wrong topic.</p>
<p>Hinduism just like the word paganism is an umbrella of faiths. Moreover brahminism is not the same as Hinduism nor Hinduism an exclusive Indo-Aryan faith. Nor is brahminism always denoting religion - take for instance a most certainly brahminic atheistic tradition - that of charvakas. A sect, if at there is one such contemporary faith,which is completely dravidian without any external influence, can still be hinduism. There is a lot of debate on what is hinduism and what is not, and that's a completly different topic. So I am moving back this, until a more appropriate title can be suggested, in this case Brahminism and Tamils,which is not the same as Aryan,nor is it exactly the same as Hinduism.</p>

<p>You can see that the article brahminism has a POV attached. In scholarly circles brahminical culture is seen as a living sample of Indo-Aryan culture,although it is most definately Indic being influenced by other indian culture as well.Yes brahmins are almost always hindus, but the way they practice hinduism is not the same as others practice it and thats where the term 'brahminical culture' comes into place.so in a brahmin's ideology hinduism is brahminism. for instance brahmins cremate the dead, excepting those who have left rituals completely-sanyasis in north which is influenced more by brahmin culture, creamation is very common. in places like tamilnadu even people who have a respectable position in caste heirarchy bury the dead, and without the ellaborate rituals of brahmins. it is most certain that brahminical culture is influenced by the other practices of hinduism and even jainism and buddhism, but then there is this distinctiveness.so i am not sure how controversial the word brahminism is, but brahminical culture- which represents the culture in which brahmins are the priests of the community is very much a reality. there are other aspects to hinduism and many hindus, especially the low caste do not either perform the brahmin rituals nor do they refer to brahmin priests, but may still worship gods considered as part of hindu pantheon. so brahminical culture is considered by scholars as the offspring of indo-aryan thought,and the vedic culture and writings of brahmins is the main reference which is used to study Indo-Aryan culture. Without these writings, there is no point of reference at all.it is not that there are no other castes which can be classified as indo-aryan but we are ab;e to obtain information about the life of aryans in india, mostly from brahmin writings.</p>
<p>hinduism in any case is too vague, and for all we know even core hindu beliefs which is now propagated by brahmin works such as reincarnation(including in non humans) may have its origin in other cultures of india and thus in that sense their claim to hinduism could be greater. some also believe that vedic culture is more oriented to montheism. so in ancient times, dravidians may have been more hindu than brahmins before being influenced by their culture. all these points which i have specified are part of scholarly debate and continue to this date.</p>

<p><b>Redirect</b>. The article is in an awful state, largely due to incompetent editing (and I don't mean that in a pejorative sense – it's just a fact that this, like some other South Asia articles, has been written by persons who do not understand encyclopedic norms, and are not sufficiently proficient in the English language to write decent copy) BUT the subject is highly important and should be covered. However, I would prefer Dravidians and Hinduism, which currently redirects to this page as the title, and have this page redirect there, since that is the general area we need an article on – the present title is absurdly specific to deserve a Wikipedia article, not to mention somewhat ORy. <span style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none"><a href="../../../m/g/e/User%7EMgekelly_7b5b.html" title="User:Mgekelly">mg</a></span><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/g/e/User_talk%7EMgekelly_f99d.html" title="User talk:Mgekelly">kelly</a> 08:59, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. What is at stake here is a case of censorship - this video is being attacked left right and center whenever it is put online. It is information that the public deserves to have access to, and if the video is not going to be able to be shown because of threat of lawsuit then at the very least we should have a Wikipedia article that discusses its content and the situation around it. It should be noted that whenever the video is put up online the relevant site is threatened within two weeks, forcing the information that it contains about the insidious group that is Landmark Education into the dark. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 144.82.194.252 (<a href="../../../1/4/4/User_talk%7E144.82.194.252.html" title="User talk:144.82.194.252">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_144.82.194.252_b1d0.html" title="Special:Contributions/144.82.194.252">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This article was put up as a smear campaign. The content is in French referenced is in French and only selective parts are being quoted. Where this video has appeared on the Internet, it has been taken down for <b>copyright infringement</b>. Wikipedia has been used to promote copyright infringement, not by hosting the copyrighted content, but by serving as a marketing and promotion link source. That is a major intent of this article. It's fine to reference the film from the Landmark Education wiki page because it is controversial and because of the effect it had on Landmark Education France. Note also that France 3 (when searching on "Landmark Education" on their web site) no longer maintains information about the broadcast, but only a reference to the Landmark Education web site. So, in summary, its fine to report the controversy, but the promotion of copyrighted material and the selective nature of creating articles to support a point of view that is part of a larger smeer campaign needs to stop (over 3000 edits by Smeelgova in three months), no matter how cute the articles look. Note also that all of the photographs are used without permission, in this article and several others. Furthermore, the reference is to a version with English subtitles. Who added the English subtitles? The video does not say--which is supreme evidence of copyright infringement. <a href="../../../s/m/1/User%7ESm1969_68e2.html" title="User:Sm1969">Sm1969</a> 16:35, 15 October 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: <a href="../../../s/m/1/User%7ESm1969_68e2.html" title="User:Sm1969">Sm1969</a> (<a href="../../../s/m/1/User_talk%7ESm1969_2d2b.html" title="User talk:Sm1969">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sm1969_8748.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sm1969">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<dd>The article is relevant only in the context of Landmark Education. The French Wikipedia says nothing about LE and nothing about this video. The article was created to put forth negative evidence on LE. What's worse--the underlying source is all in French language and any disputes to it would be in French, so they are difficult to find. We do know that France 3 was fined for violating media ethics. The film should be given a paragraph on LE's main web page, not its own article with selective quotes and ongoing advertisements of links and directions on how to get copyrighted material without permission. <a href="../../../s/m/1/User%7ESm1969_68e2.html" title="User:Sm1969">Sm1969</a> 19:55, 18 October 2006 (UTC)<small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: <a href="../../../s/m/1/User%7ESm1969_68e2.html" title="User:Sm1969">Sm1969</a> (<a href="../../../s/m/1/User_talk%7ESm1969_2d2b.html" title="User talk:Sm1969">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sm1969_8748.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sm1969">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>

<dd>Ok, let me address the <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a> assertion I made. I has more to do than with just POV fashion. For it to be a POVFORK, it must be a POVFORK of something. I assert that the article would have no merit outside of <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landmark_Education_4c93.html" title="Landmark Education">Landmark Education</a>. The French Wikipedia has (last I checked) neither an article on Landmark Education nor on this particular episode nor on the series in general: Pieces A Conviction. In fact, before this Wikipedia article and a few discussions on the Rick Ross message boards, there is little to no English language discourse on the episode. We can't tell what is said about it in France, because we can't read French. That's my evidence for the POV FORK--it should go to <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landmark_Education_4c93.html" title="Landmark Education">Landmark Education</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>All of the quotes in the article are taken from <b>anonymous</b> translations of English subtitles of the episode. We don't know who did the translation.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../f/r/a/France_3.html" title="France 3">France 3</a> web site that broadcast this episode no longer mentions it, but does put in a link to Landmark Education's French web site.</li>
<li>There is zero evidence that <a href="../../../f/r/a/France_3.html" title="France 3">France 3</a> released copyright, and considerable evidence that they did not: the video was taken down from YouTube, Archive.org, Google Video. <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmeelgova_a687.html" title="User:Smeelgova">User:Smeelgova</a> has been putting links in several Wikipedia articles to the purloined content, and I have redacted them. The lack of telling who did the English language subtitles and the lack of all the other "credits" in the video are further evidence of an unauthorized translation. <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmeelgova_a687.html" title="User:Smeelgova">User:Smeelgova</a> has gone so far as to put up links to piratebay.org on how to get the video, and there are two different versions of the video going around: one split into six pieces and one that is whole, but neither that tell who did the translation or any of the other "credits" information. We don't even know if we are seeing strategic excerpts.</li>
<li>Landmark Education's French web site notes from a Google-automated translation that <a href="../../../f/r/a/France_3.html" title="France 3">France 3</a> was fined for violating the French media code of ethics.</li>
<li>Landmark Education also likely has copyright over the extensive sections of their courses that were secretly filmed, and the journalists signed "copyright acknowledgement" forms as a pre-requisite for being in the course.</li>
<li>This is a case of Wikipedia making news, rather than reporting on news (original research).</li>
<li>Finally, I assert that all of the content of this article has problems with 1) <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> because we don't know who did the translation, 2) copyright and contributory copyright infringement, 3) the refutations and responses would be in French and we don't seem to have French-speaking Wikipedians that can translate the responses and refutations, and if we did, we would have the problem with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As an issue of verifiabilty (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>): the article concerns a broadcast by reputable information-provider (France 3 and <i>Pieces a conviction</i>). There seems little doubt that the broadcast took place: the response to it by Landmark Education itself confirms this. The article correctly attempts to link to on-line copies of the video where available, in an effort to provide verifiability. Even if complaints force the video out of publicly accessible space, the fact remains: the broadcast took place, the France 3 channel effectively and thoroughly published the content of the video by broadcasting it, and it aroused and continues to arouse interest. This makes it a legitimate subject for a Wikipedia article. -- <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant17_032b.html" title="User:Pedant17">Pedant17</a> 13:49, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I doubt they are *veiled* at all. Landmark Education owns the copyright and that's the end of the issue. France 3 also has copyright. This is about obeying the law--whether you like it or not. The version with the English subtitles does not even identify *who* put in the English subtitles. Clearly, they are not translating the whole video, but selective parts of the video. We seem to acknowledge that the video was taken down from both YouTube and from Archive.org for copyright violation, and the only entity that can make that request is the copyright owner. Yet, Smeelgova insists on linking to material which is--with overwhelming probability--copyrighted. <a href="../../../s/m/1/User%7ESm1969_68e2.html" title="User:Sm1969">Sm1969</a> 17:25, 15 October 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: <a href="../../../s/m/1/User%7ESm1969_68e2.html" title="User:Sm1969">Sm1969</a> (<a href="../../../s/m/1/User_talk%7ESm1969_2d2b.html" title="User talk:Sm1969">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sm1969_8748.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sm1969">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></dd>

<dd>(1) This is a investigative artical on something that may have been contriversal, in 2003, in France. <i>It turns out it was not</i>. (It does show a significant bias however. <b>It is also noted that France 3 was fined for this Film</b> and the only contriversy, seems to be made up by France 3) (2) It is only one episode, I wish we could do a page on every Simpsons episode, but that is left to other sites.

<dd>Whether or not the French public found the video controversial in 2003, the broadcasting of that video certainly appears to have played a role in the closing down of Landmark Education activities in France. Any French controversy may have cooled; but other countries still hosting Landmark Education activities have a potentially more lively interest in Landmark Education methods and practices. -- I understand that the France 3 channel paid a small token fine only -- more like an insurance payment in case of invading privacy -- and does so regularly for its broadcasts. -- <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant17_032b.html" title="User:Pedant17">Pedant17</a> 13:49, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for <i>Copywrite Violation</i>, I originally posted that as I have a concern about the significunt number of <i>block quotes</i>. If the artical links to a copywrite violation, that's not our problem. That's the problem of the hosting site. I do have a concern about the number of inclusions of links to the "copywrite violation" on Wikipedia. At last count it is over 20. It appears that <i>every and any</i> page that has any link (even by 2 or 3 degrees of seperation) with Landmark Education has had the link included.

<p>The above statement by Sm1969, as well as the attempts by Landmark campaigners to falsely and defamatorily:):) claim the article and film in some way break their copyright, shows the legalistic bent of Landmark. When a person writes 'cult' they mean in common parlance, as normal people would use the word. They use it to mean a destructive group. Anyway, I'm not going to get into a debate here about the worth or otherwise of the Forum/EST (strange they have to rename themselves so many times- as if their previous name they have to obscure from new recruits due to obtaining a reputation as a destructive group.)</p>
<p>P.S. Thanks for your comment Smeelgova. However I'm ok:) I don't consider the comments of Sm1969 to be biting, he's entitled to his legalistic viewpoint, as others are entitled to disregard it as irrelevant to everyday use of the term 'cult' to mean 'destructive group.'<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerkinsmum_5c9a.html" title="User:Merkinsmum">Merkinsmum</a> 07:25, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> When I put up this AfD proposal, it was really because I couldn't see that a TV program was a likely candidate for an encyclopedia article. But if there are pages devoted to episodes of the Simpsons, perhaps that's perfectly appropriate. However, my concern is now that the article is really a back-door way of evading the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policies. It's a way of giving extensive coverage to minority opinions about <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landmark_Education_4c93.html" title="Landmark Education">Landmark Education</a>, and cloaking them in unwarranted authority. It's perfectly ok to report the fact that some population (as long as you can identify them) hold the opinion that Landmark is cult, or that its programs harm people, or that it exploits its customers. So long as you also report the fact that other (much larger) groups hold the opposite views, give due weight to each side of the debate, and don't advocate that either opinion is factually correct. All this is already reported in the Landmark Education article itself (at perhaps excessive length already). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveApter_966a.html" title="User:DaveApter">DaveApter</a> 18:56, 17 October 2006 (UTC)<small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveApter_966a.html" title="User:DaveApter">DaveApter</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDaveApter_c506.html" title="User talk:DaveApter">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DaveApter_ea57.html" title="Special:Contributions/DaveApter">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<dd>The concern about minority views gaining expression seems particularly apt in this case. By artificially regarding those who have "done" Landmark Education courses as experts or as a privileged body, one can give the impression that large numbers of people support or endorse Landmark Education. This non-consensus view, misrepresented (I believe) on the current <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landmark_Education_4c93.html" title="Landmark Education">Landmark Education</a> talk page, stands in contrast to counter-arguments on archived talk pages. The subject of the article currently proposed for deletion, the film <i>Voyage au pays des nouveaux gourous</i>, casts a wide net during its hour-long run, presenting views from supporters as well as from detractors, from participants as well as from commentators, from Landmark Forum Leaders and a Landmark Education representative to "assistants". It does the film, the broadcaster and the article a disservice to suggest, one-sidely, that this coverage may constitute "extensive coverage to minority opinions about Landmark Education, and cloaking them in unwarranted authority." -- <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant17_032b.html" title="User:Pedant17">Pedant17</a> 13:49, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As far as I'm aware the -majority- opinion is that Large Group Awareness Trainings such as Landmark are somehow 'iffy'. I don't imagine the average man in the street would rush to say they're not a cult and are lovely, unless he happened to already be a believer.

<p>(section title)<i>Jokingly refers to Landmark as "Cult"</i> And it’s useless to formulate the idea that this mumbo-jumbo clouds the thoughts/ideas, Alain Roth will not hesitate to impose his truth: "I’m the boss. So show yourselves to be trainable!" Total submission required. But the absolute weapon of Alain Roth is humor. You ask yourself if you are not in a cult? Any occasion will be good for joking on the subject. "Especially, when going to dinner, don’t forget to take off your badge. Otherwise people will think that you are in a cult!"[4]</p>

<li><b>Cleanup</b> and <b>keep or merge</b>. There is definitely much that needs cleanup in the article -- it looks as if people from both sides have tried to make sure there are sections which reflect their POV alone (Antonrojo has posted perhaps the worst-offending section here) and the article devotes too much space to <i>conveying</i> the content of the program rather than <i>describing</i> it (quotes might be appropriate in <i>some</i> places to precisely represent a particular point being expressed, but I doubt they are needed as much as they are used here.) However, what certain people have described as a reason the article should be <i>deleted</i> -- the fact that France 3 was made to pull the report under pressure -- is actually a strong reason it should be kept: like <i><a href="../../../s/t/o/Stolen_Honor_0dcd.html" title="Stolen Honor">Stolen Honor</a></i> or <i>The Road to 9/11</i>, the controversy around it has made it itself notable. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 14:05, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do not find myself agreeing with Anateus often, but I would do this time.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I don't wholly disagree with your point, Starblind, but there is a difference here: a single-purpose cable network gets many fewer guest stars than one of the "Big Four" networks. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 13:52, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's true, and perhaps choosing NBC as my example was a poor choice on my part. My point is, though, that when people want to look up guest stars, they're much more likely to do so by program than by network. This list includes guest stars in cartoons (Rugrats), Comedy/variety (All That), Game Shows (Double Dare), Music shows (Nick Rocks), Mysteries (Shelby Woo), Talk Shows (Livewire), and sitcoms (Pete &amp; Pete). It's a pretty diverse bunch, and doesn't (IMHO) make a whole lot of sense all grouped together. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 17:13, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It is your reasoning that is faulty, not the criteria. Lots of companies are traded on stock exchanges. Any criterion based upon that would be exceedingly daft. If the company is as notable as you assert it to be (without citing any sources to back up that assertion), it should be easy for you to cite sources to show that the criteria are satisfied. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:38, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>He didn't say "any stock exchange." He indicated the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which is an exclusive exchange like being listed on the NYSE. Not every company in the States is listed on the NYSE, nor is every company in Japan listed on the TSE.

Given the type of product they provide, it is much less likely they would be the focus of too many articles. Companies (even huge ones such as this one with subsidiaries in the United States, Canada, and The Netherlands) which provide manufacturing parts don't often get press coverage.

<li>It is your application, not the criteria, that is deficient. WP:CORP <i>explictly</i> does not restrict published works solely to press coverage.

<li>Since the only likely source of that coverage would be in industry journals and such, and since I have no access to any of those (nor any interest in them), finding any covereage <i>not</i> in the press is ather difficult for me. Regardless, the company is absolutely notable due to its revenues (regardless of whether it meets WP:CORP), as indicated by Fg2. So, I still say <b>Strong Keep</b>.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This list was created at my suggestion. It follows the same format as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_notable_brain_tumor_patients.html" title="List of notable brain tumor patients">List of notable brain tumor patients</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_with_epilepsy.html" title="List of people with epilepsy">List of people with epilepsy</a>, both of which are <a href="../../../f/l/_/WP%7EFL_362d.html" title="WP:FL">WP:FL</a> featured lists. This information has value as an educational tool for putting a human face on a serious illness and for awareness-raising. Before I became a Wikipedian two charities requested an earlier version of the brain tumor list from me. It's good awareness information. Also see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_HIV-positive_people_232c.html" title="List of HIV-positive people">List of HIV-positive people</a>, which is now in peer review and close to <a href="../../../f/l/c/WP%7EFLC_1027.html" title="WP:FLC">WP:FLC</a>. <b><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font color="blue">Durova</font></a></b> 14:58, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom.

Since medical information is legally private (in the U.S. and probably most other countries), these are individuals who have chosen to make their cases public. The brain tumor patients list met an eager reception within the patient/caregiver/charitable community before it came to Wikipedia. On a purely human level this information is comforting - people who face a serious life-changing (or life-ending) ailment like to learn that they aren't alone. There's also a value to parents and educators: several of these diseases are common among children (brain tumors are the leading form of childhood cancer death in the U.S.) and this sort of list is a resource to teachers who want to develop innovative classroom lessons so that affected children aren't unduly stigmatized. <b><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font color="blue">Durova</font></a></b> 02:00, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Comparisons with Hello magazine or secret police files are unfair. The sources used are from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> media, not tabloid tittle-tattle and gossip. If you look at this list, plus the HIV/Epilepsy/Brain Tumor ones, you will see that many of the (still living) notable individuals involved <i>want</i> this information to be very public: they give interviews and go on awareness campaigns The stigma attached to certain chronic conditions gives grief to those with the condition and may well be leading to people remaining undiagnosed. Charitable organisations actively seek out celebrities to give a known face to their awareness campaigns. I can appreciate the <a href="../../../y/u/c/Yuck_factor.html" title="Yuck factor">yuck factor</a> reactions to seeing such a list on a "drive-by AfD". Hep C is the leading cause of liver transplant in the US and known as a silent killer - since many are unaware of their infection and discover only when in end-stage liver failure. Those two facts are given examples in this list. Listing undisclosed "personal medical information" is not the intention or purpose of this list. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_66ca.html" title="User:Colin">Colin</a>°<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_65e3.html" title="User talk:Colin"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 07:11, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How can you ascertain the original source of the information? Maybe some overzealous paparrazi... In any case, I still don't see the benefit to society of posting this type of list on WP.

<dd>The first point is hopefully covered by using reputable news sources, who have editorial teams and lawers checking what they write. The list generally uses old news, so anything legally unsound would have been pulled off the web site a while ago. A negative tabloid story should definately not be used (but a "Sold my story to the tabloids" interview or biography might). Your last point is true of all of Wikipedia and other media: only the famous get noted. We don't list the members of your local cricket club, and your gran is never going to get an obituary in a national newspaper. Celebrity, whether you like it or not, is a fact of life and does have its uses. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_66ca.html" title="User:Colin">Colin</a>°<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_65e3.html" title="User talk:Colin"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 07:25, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> (author's comment) Perhaps this subject would sit easier in the Music and the Arts families. The problem here is that it was the assassination of Lincoln by the famous actor in his own right, John Wilkes Booth who saw himself as a combatant a few days after the close of the Civil War that effected the nation, AND the life of an emerging theatre tradition in America, which was put right by the assassin's brother, equally famous actor Edwin Booth with his actors club in New York. Members of this family were imprisoned at the time, and remained "infamous" for years. Individual family members could be in categories as diverse as "famous assassins" (John Wilkes), or "famous theatre dynasties" (Junius Brutus, Edwin), but that would be a black mark against one or the other. This article is my humble attempt to pull it together showing the dynamics and interactions between ALL the members of this family. And their much neglected historic family home Tudor Hall has just opened as a museum near Baltimore, which I've visited, where I'm sure they're trying to do the same thing. I'm the first to admit that the article needs to be fleshed out with references and external links, just a beginning, I was hoping that others might get involved.

<li><b>Keep</b> but only if cleaned up to focus on the notable members. A <i>brief</i> background is permissible but the point of the page should not be obscure silversmiths and they certainly should not be redlinked. As it is this is a rambling narrative that might go well in a family history but fails the encyclopedic test.

<li>There, you see, I did not know that Blair is married to the daughter of a Booth descendant. And there's no way I could know, without a notable "family page", which holds all the keys to such links.

<li>Thank you. I have already tried to clean it up a bit. I've deleted reference to the family pre Junius as not necessary. This family is not generational like the Redgraves, so does not qualify as a dynasty, and therefore a genealogical layout doesn't help. It is, simply, the story of a remarkable and tragical theatre family, its members giving people lots to think about, and explore further. JohnClarknew 00:15, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've cleaned up the article, stripping out all of the extraneous information such as the siblings who died young. Some of this information could be merged into the Junius article, but most of it is of no value in an encyclopedia.

I think I'm mostly in agreement with Bwithh's comment above: there aren't enough sources and citations to show that more than a couple of members of the family are notable. There's a reasonable chance those sources might exist, but as the article stands right now it's just a geneological listing of the questionably notable family of a definitely notable person, which as the original prod stated is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_directory" title="WP:NOT">not</a> what Wikipedia is for. If notability citations for a couple other family members can be provided, I would definitely change my opinion. -- <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowlynk_6f44.html" title="User:Shadowlynk">Shadowlynk</a> 07:27, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>John Wilkes and Edwin are both major notable persons. Edwin was already one of the most famous actors in America before the assassination, so it isn't just that we know him because of his brother. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 08:50, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

It could use some more citations I think, maybe a link about the family in general (For an idea of what I mean, I like the second paragraph of <a href="http://www.nps.gov/archive/foth/booth.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.nps.gov/archive/foth/booth.htm" rel="nofollow">this National Park Service page</a>), but I'm much more convinced this article is encyclopedic, or at least very close to it now. -- <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowlynk_6f44.html" title="User:Shadowlynk">Shadowlynk</a> 10:09, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I do think an encyclopedia should be factually correct. John Wilkes was not in the play. Also, the family was treated as an entity, and was punished, not just the notables. I don't think it was a tree at all. Any other voices out there? Join in. Two generations don't make a tree. Maybe a bush. JohnClarknew 17:07, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>So he was not, JohnClarknew. He had access because he knew the owner of the theatre. Sorry about that! But as noted above Wikipedia is not a genealogy site, and I don't see justification for adding non-notable family members to this article. The <i>children</i> of Junius is something that belongs in that man's article. This is also not an article about the assassination, and insofar as any non-notable members were punished, that may fit better in the John Wilkes Booth article. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 22:30, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Our 5 days will soon be up. I want mainly to defend the title of the page, to retain "Booth family". There are some families, very few in fact, whose collective deeds are so unique and notable, that one wants to know more as an aid in understanding them. That's where genealogy becomes important. When investigating the conditions prevailing in the development of this family at different stages, the inclusion of dates becomes almost a <i>sine qua non</i>. For example, the guilt he must have felt abandoning his only son and his wife, what was the date? Later, he brought his father over to live with them, his father had abandoned his wife too. One of his daughters stayed home, a spinster, to take care of her mother. Then there were the deaths of 4 of his small children to smallpox and a local epidemic of cholera, could that have contributed to his alcoholism and dementia? He was a political radical, did his son John Wilkes feel compelled somehow to continue his father's radicalism after his father died, and murder our most famous President, let's see, that was thirteen years later? And what was the time frame after that when his brother was able to reverse society's condemnation of the family name and the profession of acting with his Players club? If there's precedent you want, there are other families which haven't given rise to these challenges; for example, if, as Dhartung says, Wikipedia is not a genealogy site, why then the genealogically presented <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bach_family.html" title="Bach family">Bach family</a>? He says Wikipedia is not for non-notables, then why was Irish immigrant not notable founder P.J. Kennedy important to the development of the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy_family.html" title="Kennedy family">Kennedy family</a>? And why was the messy <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrymore_family.html" title="Barrymore family">Barrymore family</a> site not deleted? Others to compare might be <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Midgley_Family_e5b7.html" title="The Midgley Family">The Midgley Family</a> (who?), <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockefeller_family.html" title="Rockefeller family">Rockefeller family</a> (scores of non notables listed), <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godrej_family.html" title="Godrej family">Godrej family</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/p/Dupont_family.html" title="Dupont family">Dupont family</a> (fronted by <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Samuel_du_Pont_de_Nemours_3eb7.html" title="Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours">Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours</a>), and <a href="../../../j/a/u/Jauch_family.html" title="Jauch family">Jauch family</a>. So, again, I urge the retention of <u>at least</u> the title of the subject <a href="../../../b/o/o/Booth_family.html" title="Booth family">Booth family</a>. Dhartung has rewritten the page and deleted what he doesn't like, and he has a right to do this. But notice he has already come up with more links to the family name, WHICH IS WORKING BACKWARDS! If we can't lead off with the family name, we will have to provide more tidbits of information on each individual member's page, and leave it to the reader to connect the dots. Wikipedia is superior to other encyclopedias precisely because it is prepared to occasionally be a little provocative with unexpected accurate information in worthy situations, thus going a little further in aiding the student or researcher or writer in gaining a better understanding of the motivations of the members' actions. I can think of no other family with such built-in raging conflicts, finally resting in peace into eternity in a family gravesite, all of which makes them a very exciting subject. Please, let them be, don't cause them more rejection. JohnClarknew 06:42, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> JohnClarknew, you have to understand what Wikipedia is and is not. We are an encyclopedia. We are not a genealogical site, nor a place for family histories, nor of emotive narratives about children who died of cholera. What you seem to want is a psychological portrait of the family, which is fine in an article or a biography. It isn't appropriate here. Please also note that impassioned speeches are not what is needed in an Articles for Deletion debate; instead, you should be able to point to Wikipedia policy and how it is or is not satisfied. I'm glad you are excited by the subject, but you have to understand that what you write must fit here. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 01:55, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Dhartung, having studied again several articles on what Wikipedia is and is not, I fail to conclude that it is "not a genealogical site" or "a place for family histories". To proclaim "We are an encyclopedia" states the obvious, and is not enlightening. I believe that, judging from what I read, Wikipedia policy is not fixed, and there are no absolutes, but it is designed to bring information to many levels of its readership in the best and clearest way, and I believe that to give the Booths an article entitled <a href="../../../b/o/o/Booth_Family_2603.html" title="Booth Family">Booth Family</a>, unquestionably a noteworthy family, will serve as a SUMMARIZING ARTICLE which best leads the reader to whichever sections they wish to study further. You do not address the question why <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Midgley_Family_e5b7.html" title="The Midgley Family">The Midgley Family</a> belongs and <a href="../../../b/o/o/Booth_Family_2603.html" title="Booth Family">Booth Family</a> does not, suggesting you have a double standard. This is a debate over whether to keep the article <a href="../../../b/o/o/Booth_Family_2603.html" title="Booth Family">Booth Family</a>. You have already rewritten the article (with an error which I had to correct) into the content which you feel is more appropriate. Now you've changed your mind, you want to delete the article altogether. I think you are wrong. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Booth_Family_2603.html" title="Booth Family">Booth Family</a> should exist as an entry page, and does conform to the site's standards.

<li><b>Reply</b> JohnClarknew, you seem to be under the belief that I have argued for deletion of the article. I have not. I argued that it should be kept but rewritten under Wikipedia policy. It's hard to argue with someone who appears not to be reading what you say.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>As I have stated above, we have developed guidelines (which are strong recommendations) and policies (which are firm rules). In AFD discussions arguing by example is counterproductive, because no other article is really under discussion. The question at hand is whether the existing article conforms to policy and reasonably fits within guidelines. Other articles that you cite could well be themeselves violations of either and their existence is not an argument that our policies are inconsistent. Please don't accuse me of having a double standard, especially since you have me on the wrong side of the fence. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 20:43, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Usually admins close AfDs after a week. Normal users can occasionally close them when it's pretty much open-and-shut keep, but we had enough discussion and changed minds going here I don't think that applies. I'd still say it's likely a keep consensus, so we might as well just treat it as such and let the admins handle all the rubber stamping when they catch up the backlog. -- <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowlynk_6f44.html" title="User:Shadowlynk">Shadowlynk</a> 08:48, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree. I really like this page and find it very useful. The main page has too much other information, and this page is where a person should go if they want a synopsis of particular stories.

<li><b>Compromise</b> I suggest that we shoudl compromise. As B.M.Bendis, unlke many other comic authors, is using 'Real Time' for this series, we need only break it down into a simple Timeline like that used for 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' - that shows the evens happening in Ultimate Peter's Life from the moment he got bitten to this current clone saga and beyond. Any Major events - The Death of Gwen Stacy, The Clone Saga- can be redirected to the artile on the 616 version of the event, and, if it has an 'Ultimate' sub-article, perhaps redirected there as well.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I seriously think that the page should be kept. It can be much more useful than the official Ultimate Spider-Man article for some things, and I actually used it just the other day. I can't believe this, of all articles, is being considered for deletion. <a href="../../../t/a/i/User%7ETai112_fb4e.html" title="User:Tai112">Tai112</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - the difference between Ultimate Spidey and titles such as Hulk, Avengers, and X-Men is simple. Ultimate Spidey sold better, much better. It had a competent, realistic writer and a kick-ass illustrator. This is something all of the previously mentioned itles have, at one time, lacked.

If you don't want us to do it this way then please suggest a better way. The colours issue arises because it permits each user involved in the discussion to use a different colour for their comments. We could also use signatures, but does it really matter given that this is not intended to be anything except a working version?</p>

<p><a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandroide_fda5.html" title="User:Randroide">Randroide</a> 09:20, 17 October 2006 (UTC) Hello everybody. I am the user who had the <i>"weird idea"</i> and who took the <i>"strange approach"</i> of using a colour code for the proposals made by different users. All the other users are "innocent".</p>
<p>I never had the intention (not even the awareness) of going against <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>. My idea was to make easier and more fluid the communication in a <b>extremely disputed</b> topic. Of course that, once a consensus is (hopefully) reached, colour codes are to be elimitated and the Atelier page deleted. We are not asking "ownership" of "our" contributions, only using a colour code to make communication easier.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>If</b>, even under these conditions, the format of the page is unacceptable, <b>I beg indications</b> about Wikipedia guidelines about SOP in this kind of hotly disputed atelier pages. We have no discussion page (the page is already an offshot of a discussion page) and lenghty discussions inside the disputed text would make the Atelier very difficult to work with.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>If</b> the page is to be deleted, <b>I ask</b>, please, <b>to be warned</b> with some advance, to copy (without colours, of course) the improvements made to the text so far.</li>

Subject's only assertion of notability is as third mike on a little-known radio talk show; the rest of the article (what little there is) is unsubstantiated fan cruft and a photo. If anyone wishes to move this material over to the radio show's article, that's fine, but as we know, a "merge" consensus = a "do nothing" consensus, so I say full delete. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 16:22, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

This is purely about Pike; being third mike isn't notable in and of itself. I should, however, note that their show has only been on Air America for about three weeks now, while the Pike article has existed since at least June 2005. In any case, being an Air America personality does not confer one with inherent notability, because Air America is not a radio network in the same way that, say, <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> is a television network; while almost all NBC affiliates carry the entire NBC schedule, very few AAR affiliates carry the entire AAR lineup.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> yet bands like Death Valley Meth Lab who apparently have no releases, get to stay up? Genetic Angry has put out two demos in less than 4 months. I don't see why a band that's getting recognition should be deleted while others stay up. It clearly states in the critera for having a band on Wikipedia that a band who is considered the best representative of a style, or of a local scene, is allowed to have a page on the website. This band has been proven to be considered the best representative of Truro, Nova Scotia and of the new style "emotional metalcore". So why delete it? It's not spamming or anything. It's a serious, well thought out article. I thought this was an encyclopedia, not a pop culture trivia game.(Timrotten 17:47, 15 October 2006 (UTC))</li>

Secondly I assume you are argueing that your band meets the condition: "<i>Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both, as in British hip hop); note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability</i>". You are not representatives of a notable style from the local scene of a city.

<li><b>Comment</b> Death Valley Meth Lab is probably a very ripe candidate for deletion as well, and that's why when arguing to keep an article, people shouldn't use other "similar" articles as "precedent". We have policies about content on Wikipedia; the one specific to bands is <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and the information has to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Genetic Angry are making huge waves in the underground punk and hardcore scene and have had their demo reviewed by CANADA's MOST HIGHLY REGARDED, most highly distributed Punk/Hardcore fanzine, Equalizing Distort aka Equalizing x Distort. They are a serious band who want to have one small page out of the millions on wikipedia, dedicated to their band. Wikipedia should be open to everyone, not just people who already have enough information known about them that they don't even need an article here. (Negative Nick 17:56, 15 October 2006 (UTC))</li>

<li>Actually, it very much does. Provenances of sources is important. If the sources of the information were <i>independent</i> of the club, and were in-depth articles about the club published in magazines, newspapers, books, or suchlike, then they <i>would</i> count towards notability. See the <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">primary notability criterion</a> in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>.

<li>Bad choice of wording on my part there I think, Uncle G. I took the choice of the word "supply" to mean that the anonymous user was suggesting that the article should stay solely because it (the article) had been created by someone who is a member of the club, that's what I was suggesting isn't sufficient to justify it being kept.....I think..... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 11:33, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Possibly not the best place to do so, but initially I wanted to raise the suggestion that we be more flexible when proposing club articles for deletion. If there is an article on a club, even sub level 10, but which already contains a significant amount of information within it, including links to other wiki articles, our focus should be on reasons to <i>keep</i> the article not why to deleted it. The <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> policy says a club is notable if <i>"The club... has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the club... itself"'</i>, so if one can find a multiple of mentions of the club on articles from independant websites, then the article should be retained.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In this instance, however, the article is not that detailed. I can find little mention of the club other than in football databases and similar online encyclopedic sites. Furthermore, I cannot find the club itself's website - I have found the club's youth football website <a href="http://www.parleysportsrangers.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.parleysportsrangers.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Parley Sports Rangers</a>, which contains no link to a senior club - which raises the question whether there is a senior team? Added to the confusion about a possible notable past player (see here) and all in all I am inclined to vote to <b>delete</b> this article. --&#160;<b><a href="../../../m/l/d/MLD_b5b6.html" title="MLD">MLD</a></b>&#160;<small><b>·</b>&#160;<a href="../../../m/l/d/User_talk%7EMLD_aa63.html" title="User talk:MLD">T</a>&#160;<b>·</b>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MLD_8977.html" title="Special:Contributions/MLD">C</a>&#160;<b>·</b></small>&#160;<font face="Courier">@:</font>&#160; 13:44, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>you lot are like a bunch of old women god whats the big problem&#160;? I made an article about Parley Sports F.C and none of you can say that it's has proof of notability, why dont you contact the Dorset F.A or even the Dorset Premier League for Parley Sports history, the information i added was taken from the Bournemouth Daily Echo can't you phone them to confirm notability. And also I no we are not a top level 10 club but we used to be as you will see in are history we resigned from that League in 2000. <b>Check Are Hits Out On Google</b> for a small village team that used to play in the 'Dorset Premier League' thats pretty good, and as your see the first search result to be found is <b>Parley Sports FC - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</b>. So that means most people will use WIKIPEDIA to search history about it. And you want to 'Delete IT' you want to take a look at other pages that are just as bad as are's with nothing on them at all. You look throught the 'Dorset Premier League' pages of teams for this season and see how many have history about them selfs, not many i'll thing your find!<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.29.92.124 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.29.92.124_8519.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.29.92.124">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, the google evidence works AGAINST your arguement. In order to be valid subject matter for a Wikipedia article, then the subject needs to have notability outside of Wikipedia. Wikipedia is NOT a means to gain notability; it only documents subjects that have notability verified by reliable third party sources. If a WikiPedia article turns up as the first hit on Google, it is usually a red flag that the WikiPedia article (and NOT an outside source as required by the WikiPedia policy against <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>) is the only major place to find this information. As such, it should be deleted. If you have evidence to the contrary, then IMPROVE THE ARTICLE. <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">Calling experienced editors names</a> or complaining that the club should be kept without providing hard facts will not work in your favor. Also, proof of existance is NOT proof of notability. The fact that a single local newspaper wrote about them does not mean that anyone outside of the immediate area has even heard of this club. If they have, then PROVIDE REFERENCES to show that the club is widely known and regarded outside of the immediate Bournmouth/Dorset area. If there is no such evidence, the article is not notable. Even if they were the best level-15 club, that makes them like the 500th best club in England. Again, my Church softball team is pretty good. But it's not the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a> or even the <a href="../../../t/o/l/Toledo_Mud_Hens_7294.html" title="Toledo Mud Hens">Toledo Mud Hens</a>. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 20:14, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> unless I'm very much mistaken it's the responsibility of the creator of the article to demonstrate the notability of the subject, editors participating in an AfD debate shouldn't need to start phoning up local newspapers to find these things out.... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 10:48, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>"If article X then article Y." is a fallacious argument. Each subject should be assessed on its merits. The best approach, I suggest, is to go through each article and research the subject. Find out what sources exist. If you find good sources, add them to the article (as references or as further reading) in order to improve it and in order to let other editors build upon your work. If you cannot find enough material of suitable provenance and depth to satisfy the notability criteria, <i>then</i> think about deletion. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:15, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorset_Premier_Football_League_0154.html" title="Dorset Premier Football League">Dorset Premier Football League</a> used to be one level below the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wessex_League_68c7.html" title="Wessex League">Wessex League</a> back when the latter was only one division. When the Wessex League essentially absorbed the Hampshire League, the DPL was placed below the 2nd level of the WL, at the same level as Wessex Div 3 (now called Div 2). That's why the DPL clubs have articles, along with a number of other level 11 leagues: <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sussex_County_League_eadd.html" title="Sussex County League">Sussex County League</a> Div 3, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Western_League_5b24.html" title="South Western League">South Western League</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devon_County_League_c73f.html" title="Devon County League">Devon County League</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Midlands_League_75d1.html" title="Central Midlands League">Central Midlands League</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spartan_South_Midlands_Football_League_94f5.html" title="Spartan South Midlands Football League">Spartan South Midlands Football League</a> Div 2. These leagues are among the strongest at level 11 (indeed, the CML has applied for level 10 status and the SWL and DCL are merging to form a level 10 league next season). Club pages in a garbage level 11 league like the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northampton_Town_League_e5c2.html" title="Northampton Town League">Northampton Town League</a> are questionable, but club pages in the previously mentioned leagues I think should stay because these leagues consistently supply promotion candidates and <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Vase_c23f.html" title="FA Vase">FA Vase</a> entrants. --<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalerion_82c4.html" title="User:Balerion">Balerion</a> 01:44, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Addition</b> - It's worth noting that Parley Sports played in the DPL for <a href="http://www.fchd.info/PARLEYSP.HTM" class="external text" title="http://www.fchd.info/PARLEYSP.HTM" rel="nofollow">four decades</a>, but have more recently run into hard times necessitating a move down to more regional leagues. The larger issue is how we deal with clubs who drop from what's considered a notable level to a non-notable level. This issue was tested in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Wareham_Rangers_F.C._e8cd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wareham Rangers F.C.">this mass AfD</a>, but in the confusion of the case-by-case basis of each club, nothing was fully discussed. --<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalerion_82c4.html" title="User:Balerion">Balerion</a> 01:54, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> It's also the problem that nearly every football club in England is under the auspices of a single governing body. This includes over 700 teams within the top 11 levels of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_football_league_system.html" title="English football league system">English football league system</a> alone. Levels 12+ include (i did an approximate count) 450 leagues. Assuming, even conservatively, 15 teams per league, that results in 6750 teams in these divisions, meaning we have well in excess of 7500 teams, probably closer to 8000 teams. That doesn't even count Sunday leagues. SOME standard has to be applied. By analogy, the U.S. has a rather extensive Baseball structure running under the auspices of <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_League_Baseball_a0e6.html" title="Minor League Baseball">Minor League Baseball</a>. There are also thousands of smaller amateur and semi-pro leagues. Counting ONLY Major and Minor leagues (down to rookie leagues), and including equivalent independant leagues, there are about 400 teams. Assuming that as a reasonable number of potentially notable teams, that matches well to levels 10+ in the football league system. It is unreasonable that the 700th best football team in England recieves notable press coverage beyond, say, a mere note of game scores in a local paper. This team USED TO be as good as the 700th best team. Its currently about the 3000th best team. That <i>can't</i> be notable. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 04:37, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not necessarily advocating a keep, but there will be tougher calls than Parsley Sports in the future - clubs who spend a number of years at level 9, but then drop to level 13...what do you do then? (see: <a href="../../../t/u/f/Tuffley_Rovers_F.C._3e8b.html" title="Tuffley Rovers F.C.">Tuffley Rovers</a>, which was kept) I'm not the biggest fan of the baseball analogy because the US sports structure, legally, practically, and culturally, especially in baseball is completely different from England's. Minor league teams are essentially independently-owned reserve/youth teams and outside the minor league structure, there is no smooth decline in talent like there is from the Football League to the Conference, for example. --<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalerion_82c4.html" title="User:Balerion">Balerion</a> 06:58, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> This is in response to the writings of LUIGI909 and 86.29.94.218(anon) above. NO ONE doubts that this football club exists. NO ONE is denying it, or other facts, such as where they play, what league they are in, what their history is, etc. etc. The question is whether such facts warrant that the club is notable. Word of mouth contacts with people involved in the organization, or with local newspapers, or anything else, does NOT establish notability. Please read <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WIkipedia's guidelines on notability</a> BEFORE you comment on this article. The primary notability criterion is: Does this subject receive 1)<b>significant coverage</b> in 2) <b>several</b> 3) <b>non-trivial sources</b> as 4) <b>a primary focus</b> of the writing. So far, this subject fails on all grounds. We have no evidence of coverage beyond a single newspaper, and no evidence that the coverage is more than scores and results of games. Passing mention in a sports section does not qualify. Do we have articles that review their performance? Have books been written on their history? Are they the subject of ANY critical analysis? If they are, then PROVIDE THE SOURCES. Simply saying "I think the local paper wrote an article on them a few years ago" isn't good enough. Provide book titles and authors, website URLs, newspaper dates and by-lines; give us something to work with. If the ONLY way we can get more information about the subject is to call someone, then they aren't notable. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 19:36, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is yet another near-infinite list of objects of an exceedingly broad class which have nothing in common save that they are fictional. It includes books that are one-off jokes and books that are themselves the main subjects of the works in which they appear and fictional books that you actually get to read all or portions of and books which are mentioned only in passing by their titles and...well, it suffers from the same basic problems of indiscriminate fictional lists, in that it's too huge to be usefully complete, that new entries are made all the time, and that the list is so broad that most of the subjects have nothing whatsoever in common other than that they're fictional books.</p>

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> To recap my remarks from <a href="../../../f/i/c/Talk%7EFictional_book_7a5a.html" title="Talk:Fictional book">Talk:Fictional book</a>, while it's true that it is a rather broad and diverse list, it is also well-organized, interesting, entertaining and useful. The fact that the fictional books serve different purposes as outlined above (jokes, plot elements, excerpted works etc.) only makes the subject more compelling from a literary standpoint. Looking over titles in a section related to Adams, Borges or King helps to give a sense of the tone of their books as well as how extensively they use this literary device compared to other authors with only a few fictional books listed. I realize this article is just a list, but further perspective "is provided in the parent article, <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_book.html" title="Fictional book">Fictional book</a>.

The only alternative would be to split this page into ~58 tiny pages (which noone wants), or split the lists amongst their author articles as A Man In Black suggests, but that would make it very hard indeed to browse the entries as a collected <s>genre</s> device.<br />

To avoid just being a pointless list, this article would have to put all these books in context and explain their significance - but that kind of discussion only belongs in the article about the author or the actual work of fiction. It may not belong there if the detail is not a significant narrative device (e.g. the one-time gag punning book titles in Wallace &amp; Gromit.) .

<li><b>Comment</b> - it is not a genre, but a <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literary_device.html" title="Literary device">literary device</a>, serving several purposes depending on the needs of the writer. Dispersing this material into individual authors' or books' articles or, worse, deleting the material entirely, would not only undo the work of many Wikipedians who consider this list worthwhile, but also make it harder to consider the scope and value of this convention. Nor would a list of works about fictional books serve, because only a few are the subject of the real books in which they appear. As for being "pointless" (I hope you folks don't mind my consolidating my rejoinders here), I did not consider the <a href="http://www.invisiblelibrary.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.invisiblelibrary.com/" rel="nofollow">Invisible Library</a> pointless when I first came across it years ago. This article improves on that site by organizing the data better, and providing a little background on some of the individual titles. More of this detail would make it better still. Deleting the article would merely leave a large hole in a reader's resources on the subject. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMavarin_8ade.html" title="User talk:Mavarin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mavarin_e910.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mavarin">contribs</a> 15:43, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree that's it's an unwieldy page and lists things that have little in common, but also its information is handy and amusing and thought-provoking and, most important, not found elsewhere (since Invisible Books went under). I would love for the list, or its sections, to be linked to from the authors' (or the books') main pages, so that discussion of Borges' or Vonnegut's fictional books as a construct could happen at a more logical place and in context. This has already happened with books from the Harry Potter universe, probably because of their number and popularity, and at least a few others from this page, like Stephen King and Tolkien, could support similar pages. But I think it would be a pity if a reader could not jump from page to page of fictional books to get an idea for the popularity and variety of the device.Ljhliesl 21:36, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>—per Karen and Quiddity, et. al. Lists of this sort have a lot of value to the customer-reader. Just scanning it was better than a weeks jokes by email! Brings back many fond memories and smiles!<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;If the Admins who patrol vandalism can't keep it under control, then it's past time to face the fact we need to lock more things down to registered editors only, and that Jimbo's ideal's are in the long run, abusive of the admins time.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;There is no reason to not provide limited protection for more articles save unworkable starry-eyed idealism that will cave to a more pragmatic policy sooner or later, and this is one such class where that applies. Yes such are prone to vandalism, but it also represents a lot of love by a lot of contributing editor's and <b>to delete such <u>spits</u> on their contributions.</b> (Did you really mean to be so Baldly antisocially BOLD, you anom nominator? (Did I miss some policy change—where's your signature?)<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;I say it's much better to <i>contemplate deleting the nominator</i> of this very nice example of care and affection than such a well presented compendium—he or she <b>can be replaced far more easily</b>, and can walk anytime no matter what we decide! (Given the size of our wiki-paycheck, who could blame them! &lt;g&gt;)<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;Not all data need be limited to dead tree standards, and Dead tree encyclopedia's can't do this type of dynamic listing job; it's one wikipedia should take on proudly as additional value added for our readers.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;Whether or not it's ever 'complete' is irrelevant—any wiki user needs to face the fact that they evolve, so that is a non-starter.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;As a father of two teens, I marvel at how often they dive to look up social minutia (Band, a baseball or football stat/fact, etc.) which the old lady and I just throw out in passing casual converstation (normally in a prone position!)... usually as a 'do you remember so-and-so when he did such-and-such? When was that anyway? While we search the failing grey matter for clues, the kids dive in and most frequently give us a date or whatever from wikipedia. So like it or not, wikipedia's become a go-to resource for the now-maturing generation... as well as the rest of us. God knows, even as a computer engineer of mature years, I wouldn't think of researching such on the web—at least not for a long while—and to them and many of you, that is now second nature. That is why this is a typical article type <i><u>one now would expect to find herein</u></i>, and <i><b>each are little treasures</b></i> to brag over, not delete.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Um, A Man in Black did sign his nomination. I strongly disagree with it, but it was done correctly and in good faith. Unless I missed something, no one else has brought up vandalism as an issue with respect to this article. I actually haven't seen much, compared to articles with more specific subjects to target, e.g. <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickelodeon_%28TV_channel%29_ac4d.html" title="Nickelodeon (TV channel)">Nickelodeon (TV channel)‎‎</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madeleine_L%27Engle_bc8e.html" title="Madeleine L'Engle">Madeleine L'Engle</a>. Also, there are a fair number of people working on this article, which makes it harder for vandal edits to stand for long. I happen to agree that requiring registration would reduce vandalism slightly, but this is not really the venue for that suggestion. Let's please stick to the merits of this particular article.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Fascinating to those who dig all things bibliographic, fictional or not, and of no interest to others, who can leave the list alone and get on with their lives. Encyclopedic in that it includes links to the actual works which include the fictional titles, so that readers can then <i>go</i> to the pertinent article per <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> for context. And although "the list is so broad that most of the subjects have nothing whatsoever in common other than that they're fictional books"...does having apparently only one thing in common make it less worthy of note? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegship_9306.html" title="User:Pegship">Pegship</a> (<a href="../../../p/e/g/User_talk%7EPegship_2cd1.html" title="User talk:Pegship">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pegship_9aaa.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pegship">contribs</a>) 10:30, Oct 17, 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>Indeed. And is that not the <i>raison d'être</i> of a list -- to collect things that have something in common? (List of redheads, anyone?) --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookgrrl_63e2.html" title="User:Bookgrrl">Bookgrrl</a> 18:18, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Strong Keep. The question is whether this list is useful. To start, it is useful in the sense of being fascinating--I had never imagined such a list or List of redheads-- I find it refreshes the imagination for those who remember the original works well, serves as a hint to reread for those who remember the original work but not the fictional ones within it, and is suggestive for those who see something that looks worth following them up. It's useful in the sense of suggesting other things to include--I havea few in mind--or in seeing if perhaps the people who wrote the WP missed one. WP is not a list. This does not mean that WP does not contain lists, when they have a purpose. Nor is it a place for bare lists alone, without articles From WP:List</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Information</b>. The list may be a valuable information source. This is particularly the case for a structured list. Examples would include lists organized chronologically, grouped by theme, or annotated lists.</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Speaking personally, I use this list for reference purposes all the time. I fail to understand why the possibility for infinite expansion is a reason to delete a list of data that is otherwise difficult to come by. I think it's so useful (and interesting) that the <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_books.html" title="Fictional books">Fictional books</a> parent article should be strengthened, and if anything, the list broken off into comprehensive articles about various authors' fictional books. I can't speak to the articles of every single author listed, but the Stephen King article for example is far too long as-is, and if the list were dismantled an entire new article would be written. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Stangl_e97f.html" title="User:Chris Stangl">Chris Stangl</a> 09:23, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't delete</b> There is no other side in Wikipedia able to have a map for each year as has been requested. The political geography is changing each year. I see absolutely impossible to put in a single page all the changes of all the hundreds and hundreds of German, Greek, Italian or Arabic sovereign states. (Who can reading tables like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_states_in_the_Holy_Roman_Empire_d818.html" title="List of states in the Holy Roman Empire">this</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Great_Lakes_kingdoms_fc8d.html" title="List of Great Lakes kingdoms">this</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Tamil_country_68bb.html" title="Ancient Tamil country">this</a>?) If there are static years, redirections exists. It's absolutely impossible to have an idea of what exactly existed in a year with only a list of what appear and disappear. The possible divergence of opinions never are a reason for delete an article. The POV says that if there are more than one opinion both them must be written but never is a reason of deletion. The laziness never is a reason for don't write an article. I think that be able to know the countries that were sovereign in a year watching a single page would be very, very interesting.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> There were only 9 sovereign states in 820AD? I expect a few hundred kingdoms scattered around the globe might have disagreed. An historical atlas would be a useful reference for questions such as, did Croatia exist the year Nikola Tesla was born, or where was historical Macedonia, or when were Israel, Judea and Palestine sovereign states, but there would clearly be differences of opinion and hair splitting definitions, so the articles would be huge. In theory, the history of sovereignty could be argued and settled in the article for each state, but the claim of so few in 820 is troubling.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 21:39, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Sorta Keep</b> I'm doubtful of the viablity of the arguments made against it. POV wars? If there is any disagreement about whether a state existed in a given year and was sovereign, then the problem is with the Wikipedia article on it, which should be sourced itself. If there's diagreement about what constitutes a sovereign state, that's a seperate problem, worth addressing on its own. And that one person can't handle 5000 different lists? I think that's why Wikipedia has more than one editor. That said, I don't think we need a page for literally every year. Grouping by century and listing the years of sovereignty in there would be simpler. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:16, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> A world political map as suggested by Sobira for each year or decade is an excellent idea. The lists are second best but better than nothing. If the editor reponsible is heading towards dated world political maps encourage them. If knowledge of years such as 820 is small Areas for which information does not exist would have a separate colour code until that knowledge is found and cited.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not an active community member, so I won't vote, but I stubled across a pag with this deletion notice and have to say that I think this information is potentially <i>very valuable</i> to readers who don't want to sift through a few dozen pages to get an idea of the geography of the world in a given year.

<li><b>Keep but prune</b> This strikes me as being highly encyclopedic, but horribly overdone. With the exception of some years, there is no reason why these lists could not be pruned down to a decade level, rather than yearly.

<li><b>Comment</b> The concept of having world maps showing the sovereign nations is fundamentally flawed and impossible to realize. World maps are extremely poor vehicles to show countries: there just isn't enough "bandwidth" to accommodate the necessary data. The problem starts with the fact that the earth's surface is 3/5ths water, so only 40% of the map can be used. Add in problems with projection, and you end up being able to show only the very largest countries, and being unable to even label these adequately. Look at the problems inherent in <a href="http://www.euratlas.com/big/big0800.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.euratlas.com/big/big0800.htm" rel="nofollow">this map of Europe in 800 AD</a> and this is just 8 - 10% of the world's surface. <a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMapMaster_75f4.html" title="User:MapMaster">MapMaster</a> 16:57, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b> per problems with scope and definition. The modern definition os State arose after the Peace of Westfalia, so lists of "states" before then are most likely to be misleading. This is compounded by the problem of when an entity can be said to be sovereign: For instance, were all the entities of the Holy Roman Empire sovereign states? Should they be included in these lists?. It also seems overkill to have a list for every single year; listings by decade or longer periods would allow for more commentary which could be used to provide <i>context</i> to most of the controversial claims, though I wouldn't be entirely satisfied with that solution.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I can't see how this cannot be solved by creating a bunch of country-specific Timelines and sticking them in related articles; these could easily cover long periods and show the evolution of several countries at once. For example, think of a timeline showing simultaneously the different kingdoms in the <a href="../../../h/e/p/Heptarchy.html" title="Heptarchy">Heptarchy</a> then their gradual merge into the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_England_1e4c.html" title="Kingdom of England">Kingdom of England</a> an so on, until modern times. That'd be <i>one</i> Timeline in about 10 articles, all showing the same info <i>and</i> being a navigational aid to boot. Much better than clicking 100 articles just to see when the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_5d2d.html" title="Kingdom of Great Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a> became the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland_5d03.html" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a>. -- <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERune.welsh_2e22.html" title="User:Rune.welsh">Run</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#339900">e</font></a> <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERune.welsh_2e22.html" title="User:Rune.welsh">Welsh</a> | <a href="../../../r/u/n/User_talk%7ERune.welsh_7599.html" title="User talk:Rune.welsh">ταλκ</a> 13:52, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep, keep, keep!</b> That's what I've always wished and never found in all the web, and I think that only Wikipedia and its more than 60 millions visits per day can get. My experience is that if you are interested in know what existed in a year (something absolutely important for understanding the changes in the History) you won't find this information. You will have to search in more and more hundreds and hundreds of pages crossing information for each year. I don't want to know the year when the "Kingdom of Great Britain" became the "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland" I want to know how many states there were in the south of Spain, Italy, France and Germany when bore the "Kingdom of England" and the expansion in the same time of the Asiatic states. How many pages I'll have to check for having this information? Please, keep all these information! I need all them!

<p>This page needed deletion as it is spam and fails to have proper references. Indeed it only cites other sites of a similar nature which it promotes and therefore fails to be subjective. It is also ideologically dubious and there is probable <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity.html" title="Vanity">vanity</a> involved.

As for <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>'s A7: this is quite specific - it requires an <i>assertion</i> of notability. So an article about someone notable can be deleted if the article doesn't even try to say why. At the same time, an article about someone who has no notability <i>can't</i> be deleted if the article gives good cause for why they are notable. For instance, I have no idea who the current president of India is; but they are notable for being president of India. If the article about them never mentioned that fact or any of their achievements, it could be deleted. If an article about somebody else provided proof that the person in question was president of India, even if I hadn't heard of them, it would still be grounds to keep. It's a fine line, and no reflection on you as speedy nominator. That's why we have admins elected for their experience in these things and AfD as a process of the community to discuss them in case better experts exist.

Yes, the policy states: "first an article on the election", but the very next paragraph starts with the following statement: "This should not be used as a reason to delete candidate articles". Secondly, she won a five-way primary for the Democratic nomination in her district with almost triple her nearest opponent (i.e., she is no "sacrifical lamb" candidate). Finally, the latest poll has her ahead of the incumbent (see <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2006/10/09/daily46.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2006/10/09/daily46.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Yes, the article (clearly) needs beefing up, but that's no reason for deletion. I'll volunteer to help beef it up -- but only after this is resolved (I don't want to waste my time).

It is a request for comments on the article as it stands. No offence to the writer of the article or supporters/detractors of the candidate in question is implied or meant.

I realize that "usefulness" isn't a criteria for which biographical articles stay and don't, but with thousands of truly worthless articles already in wikipedia and incredible amounts of cleanup and other fixing needed, exactly why should time be spent debating keeping a biography that clearly is (a) not a vanity page, (b) not a soapbox/campaign page; and (c) actually useful to tens of thousands of voters in this Congressional district? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 21:41, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As a public high school, this school has inherent claims of notability, and the article more than meets the qualifications for retention.

See <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>, which explicitly states that "Avoid using the word "vanity" in a deletion discussion — this has created serious problems. Remember that such an accusation may be defamatory. As explained below, an author's conflict of interest by itself is not a basis for deletion", which thoroughly undermines the case for deletion. The article had a lengthy section criticizing the structure of the school and its IB prgram, which has has been removed (and could have been removed -- or edited-- by any of the individuals who had an issue with the NPOV content). As one of only four schools in New England offering the IB program it makes explicit claims of notability. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 05:00, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm aware that the POV section has been removed, but as a former student I know this Wikipedia article has been somewhat of a hot topic, and usually when the POV section was removed, the author reverted the article within a matter of hours.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I've never seen potential for reinsertion of POV section as a justification for deletion. If it were, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> would have been deleted long ago (not that there wouldn't be those now considering this as an approach. Hmm...). A combination of monitoring the article on watchlists (it certainly is on my radar) and page protection should deal with the issue. You, of all people, are best suited to identify -- AND CORRECT (or at a minimum identify) -- the issues you have cited.
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> A friend of mine (don't know his username) had tried to remove the POV pushing and rewrite the controversey section to make it more netural several times some months ago. The original author of the article (who apparently has a major ax to grind with the school) reverted most or all of his changes systematically every time, and eventually started accusing him of vandalism and "cheerleading". Patrick Hurston 20:04, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>PS</b> If the article is indeed not deleted and the POV section is replaced, I will most certinally correct it, though if the original author is as vehement as he was when my friend tried, I can't gaurantee that my changes will stay. Patrick Hurston 20:07, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> For many months, individuals claiming affiliation with the school--students, alumni, teachers, unspecified others--have attempted to obliterate details of the school's history and current standing, using the entry on Wikipedia to facilitate public relations, rather than increase public knowledge. Wikipedia administrators have repeatedly refused to sanction these effortson the basis that striving for NPOV does NOT require eliminating controversy, it requires acknowledging ascertainable facts and balancing conflicting accounts and interpretation. This effort requires thought, not politicking for deletion. The "friend of mine" cited above as a champion of truth was in fact soon thereafter banished from Wikipedia for vandalism. At this time, there exist more than 700 IB-affiliated high schools in the US, as well as thousands of charter schools, and tens of thousands of public high schools. None of these characteristics--IB-affiliated, charter, or high school--is itself notable. On the other hand, Sturgis is well-known for having made an explicit promise to its surrounding community that it would involve all students enrolled in the IB program, which according to IBO policies, requires IB testing of each student in each subject area. The fact that the school claims to be educating all students to IB standards without testing students at those standards is notable locally (because of the promise of the charter), nationally (because of the debate over the role of standards in education policy), and internationally (because of the violation of IBO policy and the implicit challenge to IBO control of IB standards). For the most part, the sanitized entry merely reiterates what is already available under pre-existing entries for the IBO or minutia from the school's handbook.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Let me just say that what is important is the consensus among all Wikipedians, not among schoolwatch this is a very <b>alarming statement</b> and not at all in the spirt of wikipedia goals. I visted the link to Schoolwatch and found no discussion as to what are notable or what is not. All I found were a list of AfD's current and a past AfD's with results totaled by month list with totals by month. As to its point of view I found this statement right at top of page <b>"the terms 'keep' and 'no consensus' are used interchangeably (as no consensus defaults to keep)."</b> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRanger_6fb8.html" title="User:TheRanger">TheRanger</a> 16:02, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Can <b>I</b> say that, as someone who is not a "member" of Schoolwatch and dislikes being classified as such by people who think most school articles should be deleted, I don't really think it's in the spirit of Wikipedia to continue to nominate secondary schools for deletion when general consensus on AfD definitely seems to be that such articles should be kept. It's a pointless exercise, and often seems to be merely a (very poor) attempt to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">prove a point</a> (i.e. we can continue to nominate these articles even though general consensus is against us).

<li>I know that Wikipedia is not democracy; consensus is the important thing in much of the project, though, and a very large and interested part of the community has declared their opinion on the notability of schools. That assuredly counts for a great deal in AFD, just to look at the other Keep users' comments for example, like Silensor's valuable additions to this discussion. Just look at the facts given in the article, like the 350 students figure and the budget of 1.2 million, and the fact that it's a school.

<hr />
<p>If you don't get it, read Ludamad's blog. Or play the game. -MK53 PS: What do you think about the game?</p>
<p>The page has been vandalized now, all well, it would be deleted anyway. For the record, this is the third time a ciribot article has been attempted, the third time it is being deleted, and the third time it was not anyone who made Ciribot making the article. Many things this page could be condemned for, true. But do not call it vanity, that insults me. - Ludamad</p>
<p>If it was already made and deleted two times, then you should have already learned your lesson. - kulinsj007</p>
<p>Quoted from you:"<strong>"Wikipedia is not for novel things you and your friend come up with in school or in your garage one day." - [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NFT" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NFT" rel="nofollow">[69]</a>] Seriously, this article is a waste of space, I say that if less than 5 people care for its existence, it deserves to be deleted. Sorry if it hurts, but you can make your own website about this. Oh wait, you already have. - Kulinsj007"</strong> Well, in fact, there are <strong>AT LEAST A THOUSAND</strong> people who care about it. And Ludamad came up with it in <strong>1999</strong>, and created a videogame for it in <strong>2005</strong>. So what do you mean "in school or in your garage one day"? That doesn't mean "over the course of 7 years". You just got <strong>OWNED!</strong> -Mageknight53</p>
<p><br />
Kulinsj - it was not me who made it! So there is nothing to be learned. Mageknight, you DO realize you are saying that to the guy who came up with the idea of ciribot, right? (which I have mentioned is not me, but rather the person you just "owned"). In addition, as if you aren't clueless enough, he made the videogame along with me. This is just silly.-Ludamad</p>
<p>Kulinsj-i would like an explaination for who is using my name (kulinsj007) in this debate, I am the one who invented "ciribot" many years ago and since then, it's concept has been taken far by ludamad and I believe that it is worthy of an entry in wikipedia. More work is being done in the ciribot games and will likely gain popularity at it's release.-kulinsj</p>
<hr />
<p>Sorry, I was busy laughing uncontrollably after reading those statements. All of them. Over 1000 people care about Ciribot? Yeah right. Come on, I see the forum on your ciribot site, theres 318 posts from 272 users. 92 of which are from the creators. An average of 0.83 posts from non-creators. And outside of the top 5 posters, there's an average of 0.54 posts per user. I guess they REALLY care about ciribot. And also, if its 7 years old, don't you think you'd grow out of that kind of thing by now? Come on. And for the record, mageknight (nice name, are you a level 72 dungeon master?) I didn't "get owned." Whether you've been obsessing over it for 7 years or not, it's still something that you made up in school or in your garage one day, and is still useless information to the world. This is an encyclopedia, not a worldwide diary for things you do with your friends. You have your own site, get over the fact that just about nobody cares about ciribot. More people care about this rock [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helis_Nunatak" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helis_Nunatak" rel="nofollow">[70]</a>] than your little ciribot.</p>
<hr />
<p>Wait a sec... Luda didn't make Ciribot? And besides, more than a thousand people DO care. Try 64Digits. =P Owned, -Mageknight53</p>
<hr />
<p>Once again, mageknight, I tried 64digits, and theres 109 downloads and 33 comments. 1000&gt;109. Stop saying that over 1000 people care if only 109 downloaded it, and theres about 20 of those people that actually bothered to comment (most of the comments are responses from "ludamad" who I prefer to call adam). I downloaded it myself too, and got bored in a couple minutes. I went to play games on my SNES, much more entertaining. Anybody can make a little game like that with a gamemaker program. And stop saying "owned" when you are just making yourself look like an idiot by saying things that are obviously not true. I still think it's funny you call yourself "mageknight" too, what are you going to do, blast me with a fireball spell? Please, you are doing nothing to help defend the game, you don't even know who created Ciribot. Making invalid, untrue and exaggerated comments doesn't help win an argument, especially if you back them up with something as stupid as "owned."</p>

<li>There is no consensus that "all schools are notable." When an AfD results in "No consensus," that's effectively a "keep," but it still means--um--"<i>no consensus</i>." <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 17:45, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, if the consensus at schoolwatch is that all schools are notable, and the editors from there can show up in large numbers to influence AFDs however they like, and no consensus = keep, then all deletion nominations are efforts in futility, and my above comment about pointless nominations is right. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> 18:11, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> There is no consensus all schools are notable, primarily evidenced by the number of school AfD's that end in no consensus. Largescale opinion spamming by a wikiproject (as you've describe above; I'm not stating the wikiproject actually does this) may be effective, but it doesn't prove consensus. Your logic above is flawed and just demonstrates an example of gaming the system.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:26, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think that there's any effort to take advantage of the system. I think the reason School AFDs continue to be such a problem is that there is a small, vocal minority that would mostly like to see all but the most popular schools' articles deleted and a large majority of editors who have declared consensus that schools are notable and that verifiability needs to be the factor considered in AFDs. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> 19:39, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How odd, I would think that there is a small but vocal minority that wants to keep all schools and that most editors don't. Given that most of the keeps in these AfDs come from established schoolwatch editors (by your own description) and that frequent deletes come from editors who don't have anything to do with school articles at all the above claim is very hard to understand and seems to border on projection. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 19:54, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment, actually... School AfD's are such a problem because neither side of the debate has the majority they wish they had, and there is no incentive for both sides to sit down and try and hammer out a good faith compromise (and the views are so far apart I'm not even sure compromise is possible). I'd say it is a pretty safe bet that this will go on <i>ad infinitum</i> as long as Wikipedia exists. If a majority exists at Wikipedia, it is the teeming mass of editors who just don't care one way or another.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:11, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - ForbiddenWord wrote "a large majority of editors who have declared consensus that schools are notable"...I just visited schoolwatch, and there's a handful of editors that have expressed opinions on the talk page there, but not at all a large number of people, and there's no listing of editors that endorses ForbiddenWord's opinion. Ironically, there is, instead, a statement that the project was going to remain neutral.... <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 21:44, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, even though it looks very pretty and is nicely-written. A metric I like is, "Will anyone ever hear about this out-of-context?" In this case, the answer is probably no. Everyone who hears about the Mooniecast will have a pretty good understanding what it is. If you can learn everything there is to know about something in one conversation, it just doesn't need an article in an encyclopedia. You'd rather have them go to your own website anyway, right? --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasamage_4cdb.html" title="User:Masamage">Masamage</a> 00:00, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> This is a real online game, though fairly new, so I wouldn't expect much for it, and it was recently blanked because of game guide concerns. Since this game is so new though, I'd rather give it a month or two to see if it has legs before deleting it.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Actually, the prod was removed per Wikipedia policy, which states that once a prod is removed for any reason, the article is not supposed to be subsequently re-prodded. See the <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> page for more details. If the original author hadn't removed the notice, I probably would have as it appears to meet <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> (although rather poorly and without citing sources). The catch is that I don't care enough about the article to actually bother improving it, which is why I suggested sending it to regular AfD. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Au_82f0.html" title="User:Alan Au">Alan Au</a> 02:54, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Only because you deprodded it for specious reasons. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 17:29, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In hindsight, I was a bit terse in the edit summary. The implication about of my comment about it being a commercial piece of software was that it meets WP:SOFTWARE regarding third-party coverage (game reviews and strategy guides in print, etc.). I typically reserve prod for unsalvageable articles. Of course, the irony is that I'm not personally interested in salvaging the current article, which is why I suggested sending it to AfD. Please see the article talk page for more information. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Au_82f0.html" title="User:Alan Au">Alan Au</a> 18:48, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. A GameSpot entry does set it aside from the cesspit of free MMOs, but it's still only in beta; it might be suddenly taken down (like <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiplayer_BattleTech_3025_fd12.html" title="Multiplayer BattleTech 3025">Multiplayer BattleTech 3025</a>) and then fade into obscurity.

<p>I disagree, however this page does need lots of expanding, breakdown is usually a core element that makes up metalcore. Otherwise if this is not getting expanded, then get it merged into the metalcore article. Invictious 09:59, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> agree with nominator even though he listens to fireball ministry. This could be a section in metalcore, but many metal genres make use of breakdowns, although their exact nature differs from genre to genre (for example, in certain more commercial black metal variants the breakdown is employed as a cheap means to put a slow, haunting keyboard-intensive bit in the middle of the song).

<li><b>Delete</b> because there's no telling which ABC this is referring to, but I can't for the life of me think of which one it might be. It actually seems more like Nick programming than ABC, and I think they are sharing with CBS, not ABC anyway. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:57, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy delete</b> A1, no context. Nickelodeon shows on the schedule, no ABC kids block, not even old CBS kids block. Can't comprehend what this is. Plus, does not disambiguate between the Australian and US nets.</li>

<dd>That would be the Phillipines, actually.
