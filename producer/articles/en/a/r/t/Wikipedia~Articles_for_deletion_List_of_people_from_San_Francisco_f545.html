<li><b>Keep</b>. The purpose of a list is to supply additional information beyond simply names. This list will do that. It is currently underpopulated because I am going through the effort of verifying the name of every individual added to this list, as well as others, as per wikipedia guidelines. Also, as the list grows, it will be clearly obvious that it could NOT be added to the San Francisco page without making that page itself unbearably huge. And, yes, the proposer of this deletion did make the exact same comments earlier. Evidently, s/he did not read the reply I posted then, which contained substantially the same information as this statement. MAYBE he will now. Similar lists for other major cities already exist, and there is no reason to think that San Francisco should not receive the same level of attention and respect as those other major cities. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 16:12, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - The wikipedia is not about specific individual posters, such as possibly the poster above, getting in a hissy-fit because their own self-importance is not recognized by others. The poster states that he himself has only been on wikipedia for approximately a month. He would thus not be aware of the huge number of similar lists, many of which are completely unreferenced, which already exist, and which this self-styled "deletionist" has NOT challenged. If he can contain his comments to the matters at hand, I think that we would all be very appreciative. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 20:05, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Categories don't annotate. This list is incomplete but that is easily corrected.

<li><b>Keep</b>, expand, and reorganize. As a purely alphabetical list, it would be redundant to a category on the same topic. However, if expanded so that each entry in the list explains what the individual's connection is to the locality, and organized in a meaningful manner, there is no redundancy; see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_associated_with_Albany_County%2C_New_York_4646.html" title="List of people associated with Albany County, New York">List of people associated with Albany County, New York</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_associated_with_Columbus%2C_Ohio_b1c9.html" title="List of people associated with Columbus, Ohio">List of people associated with Columbus, Ohio</a> for my attempts at this. If all you have is a locality category, you have people who were born in a city but left it as a young child lumped in indiscriminately with people whose very reason for having an article is strongly tied to that city. Also, organizing chronologically helps turn the list into a history of the people of a place rather than a mere list of trivia or local vanity. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 16:29, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This isn't a particularly good list of people from a city, but that's for the editors to improve. There are many lists like these on several city pages, and they need to stay on their own page, otherwise the city pages will get too long. Its not like people are going to be able to click on to a category of people from San Francisco on the main San Fran page, because it wouldn't apply to the city, nor could they type in "List of people from San Francisco" in the search and find the information they wanted if it was a category. If they wanted a category they would have to track it down from a notable resident or something. For ease of information, a separate page linked to the main one is preferable. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVertigo700_7fa2.html" title="User:Vertigo700">Vertigo700</a> 16:36, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, lists of notable residents are a common feature of city pages on wikipedia. for larger cities, which tend to have a larger number of notable residents, it makes sense for organizational reasons to make such lists seperate articles. If this specifric list is a mess, by all means clean it up. But please do not set a precedent that would imperil the many similar and by and large useful lists across wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinpwilsonadvocate_1f76.html" title="User:Justinpwilsonadvocate">Justinpwilsonadvocate</a> 16:37, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. These <i><b>People from ...</b></i> lists are useful for researchers and writers delving into a particular city.

<li>You have mistaken the number of entries for the number of pages. There are less than 400 entries in <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_from_San_Francisco_de02.html" title="Category:People from San Francisco">Category:People from San Francisco</a>. It is more important that the list be informative and useful than manageable. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 02:01, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oops, yes, my mistake. Well summarise and categorise all 400 then. This Google search 'site:en.wikipedia.org "People from San Francisco" +musician' shows 22 musicians who should be listed - is that different from what the list will achieve?

<li>You're really worried about this size issue, aren't you? I suggest you look around Wikipedia to see the variety of list articles and how size is dealt with. But be careful, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_by_name.html" title="List of people by name">List of people by name</a> might give you a heartattack. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 03:10, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No. I'm not. Just set some rules for inclusion and exclusion. If it's to be all inclusive, make it so. Still believe I'm better off doing my own research, now I've worked out how to search for multiple categories.

<li>No one has said that the list should NOT be made more inclusive. That's what we do here on Wikipedia. The issue before us is deletion. <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_people_from_San_Francisco_36f6.html" title="Talk:List of people from San Francisco">Talk:List of people from San Francisco</a> is the place for suggestions about article improvement. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 03:55, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Dystopos as this is a well annotated and quality list worthwhile of inclusion. <a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamaguchi%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F_6995.html" title="User:Yamaguchi先生">Yamaguchi先生</a> 21:21, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Agree with most of what was said. Yes, the information is redundant from the category, but if the page is well-organized, annotated, and updated regularly, I don't see a problem. <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllipsis22_5384.html" title="User:Ellipsis22">Ellipsis22</a> 20:34, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
