<p>Mr. Davidson was a candidate for President of the CRNC, but lost to Paul Gourley.

<li><b>Keep</b> - AFAIK we have no set guidelines for politicians and political parties. IMO we should have more rigorous guidelines. IMO such a person is sufficiently notable for encyclopaedic value, but without set guidelines, how do we know? Propose we work on making fixed guidelines for such cases.

<li><b>Keep</b>Michael Davidson's impact in terms of the history of the CRNC is a major one. The reprecussions of his run are still alive and well, given the fact that there is still talk a 'Davidson' Facton of the CRNC, it is wroth continuing to consider Michael Davidson as 'Worthy' <small>—<i>preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment by</i> 67.78.216.40 (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.78.216.40.html" title="User talk:67.78.216.40">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.78.216.40_0231.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.78.216.40">contribs</a>) 01:15, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - It is impossible to understand or appreciate the CRNC, one of the oldest and largest and well funded 527s operating in all 50 states with hundreds of thousands of members, without understanding Davidson's impact on it in the last election. Half the organization is still loyal to him and rabidly hates Gourley. Davidson was also a principal reformer in the California College Republicans, which has many thousands of members and does a significant amount of work for the California Republican Party and its candidates throughout the state. He may not be elected to any government post, but that doesn't mean his role in republican politics isn't significant enough to be of value to W'pedia users, particularly conservative college students interested in their principal political organization.BoomBox 17:55, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Michael Davidson is still involved in politics as the executive director of pro-business PAC. As suggested by earlier posters, "his" faction of the CRNC still looks to him as an inspiration and founding father. Michael Davidson's name will likely be remembered in CRNC politics for as long or longer than the current chairman, Paul Gourley, and both "establishment" and "reform" parties believe Davidson will be a significant player in politics in the future. I say keep, if for no other reason than WikiPedia can someday say "you saw him here first!" <small>—<i>preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment by</i> 70.36.24.151 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.36.24.151_b2d0.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.36.24.151">contribs</a>) 06:10, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>STRONG DELETE</b>: The claim that he was a "key player in the effort to recall Gray Davis" is ludicrous. David Drier was a "key player", Duf Sundheim was a "key player", Davidson was a hanger on who got more from the campaign than he contributed. Since when does being part of a college organization qualify someone as a political figure? I would love to know who published this entry about Michael Davidson. I would be willing to bet it was him or somebody close to him that did it on his wishes. There are enough venues for self promotionin on the internet, let's not let Wikipedia be a medium for the self serving climbers of the world. <small>—<i>preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment by</i> 70.32.244.133 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.32.244.133_e395.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.32.244.133">contribs</a>) 05:02, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</small></li>
