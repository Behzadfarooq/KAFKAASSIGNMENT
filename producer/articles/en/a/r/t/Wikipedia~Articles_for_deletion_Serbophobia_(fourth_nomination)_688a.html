I reported the deletion to the community at WP:AN/I, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive158#WP:IAR_in_practice" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive158#WP:IAR_in_practice" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and it was widely endorsed.</li>

</ul>
<p>So, here we are at the 4th nom: contrary to the conclusions in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Serbophobia_%28second_nomination%29_2029.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Serbophobia (second nomination)">lengthy closure</a> by HappyCamper, in the meantime the article became a soapbox for enumerating all instances of hatred and crimes towards Serbs throughout the history. Actually, it's not a problem of sourcing (it's not too difficult to prove the existence of most of stated instances of crimes): the article tries (and certainly would continue, if the future permits) to establish the common link between all crimes commited against an ethnic group — that link, inferred or spelled out, is the hint to the eternal hate of Our Evil Neighbours against Poor Us.</p>
<p>...And, yes, per <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>, existence of other similar articles is not a reason to keep this one. (And I promise I'll work on their demise too)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> because this is a neologism that hasn't reached widespread usage. Only 3K hits on google. Wikipedia isn't a dictionary and there can't be one of these for each [insert-ethnic-group]-phobia except in extraordinary cases of very widespread adoption of the term. Existance of similar pages isn't a justification of this existance of this one (delete them as well). <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 16:07, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The topic seems to be worth writing about, even if the word used for it is a neologism. Anyway "<i>xxxx</i>-ophobia" is a well-known way of saying "dislike of <i>xxxx</i>". <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Appleyard_20bf.html" title="User:Anthony Appleyard">Anthony Appleyard</a> 16:19, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Move</b> to Anti-Serbism. The only problem I see with this article is the title. Most of the rest is no different than <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">Antisemitism</a>. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 16:53, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The topic is notable enough and the article is well-sourced. Although the title might not be used that frequently, the subject it refers to a well-known topic. I wouldn't have anything against moving it to Anti-Serbian Discrimination or something of the sort, though I think Serbophobia is fine. <a href="../../../t/s/o/User%7ETSO1D_9399.html" title="User:TSO1D">TSO1D</a> 16:57, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. the nomination is misguided: the nominator ironically says <i>the eternal hate of Our Evil Neighbours against Poor Us.</i> He confuses two issues: whether the "eternal hate" exists with whether "some think that the ethernal hate exists". For starters, I would suggest him to re-read the article "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a>". `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 19:38, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I did, thanks. And I maintain that this article, along with several similar ones, is a feeding ground of conspiracy theories rather than an objective overview of peer-reviewed sociological studies (and they can't become good, because none of those became good, except possibly widely-understood phenomena such as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">Antisemitism</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Americanism_e60d.html" title="Anti-Americanism">Anti-Americanism</a>). <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 21:49, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> If there are balance/NPOV problems with the article or if it needs more of an academic/historical perspective, this should be corrected through cleanup not outright deletion. There is evidence that, besides any historical incidents "anti-Serbism", the specific term of "Serbophobia" is at least encyclopedically notable for being a key term in the historical discourse of Serbian nationalism <i>as used by Serbian nationalists themselves</i> both during the 1990s wars in the Former Yugoslavia (and since) and as part of the internal tensions of Yugoslavia when it still existed as a functioning Communist state. Non-trivial examples of its use can be found at the level of governmental relations, academic institutions, party politics and international relations in recent decades. (I don't know what the phrase is in Serbo-Croat, but "Serbo-Croat" is used by reliable direct English translation sources). The term then is important for understanding the history of late 20th century Serbian nationalism. (There was also an inaccessible references from google books search that on the face of the listed search description suggested the term may have been around during the beginning of the First World War)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't see any of those references Bwithh produces being 'non-trivial references' - simply mentioning the word is not the same as a legitimate source <i>about</i> the term and its connotations. When the topic is as loaded with POV warriors on both sides, all we can do is be stringent in requiring decent references and do our best to maintain a neutral perspective, stating the facts and not attempting to draw any form of conclusion. Unfortunately, none of the references that are provided are anything other than uses of the term, and the extrapolation of these, as well as being used to push nationalistic propaganda (and the other 'side' to this are no better), is tantamount to original research as well as being a hopeless and counterproductive POV fest. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 23:40, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Excellent catch, and a good book, on the first sight. Now, if we had an article <i>akin</i> or <i>summarizing</i> the Macdonald's book, which goes into the great detail of the conflict and its history, causes, related myths, propaganda, etc. I'd be perfectly happy. But that's not what we have, and we're very far from that. Like I said on AN/I, having a "Serbo-Croatian relations", "Serbo-Bosniak relations" or like could be a good thing potentially, as it would enable to <i>contextualize</i> the phobias and give an outline of thoughts and actions of both sides in proper historic contexts. What we have here, though, are lists of misdeeds without context, hinting at presupposed phobias and hatred by the neighbors as the reason for the conflict. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 13:58, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment - Leaning towards Weak Keep</b> - Neologism or not "serbophobia" is a notable term, even outside Serbia. Having lived very closely from Greece (Greek medias were very interested in these events; sometimes in a pro-Serbian POV way) the tense days of the Bosnian War and of the NATO air strikes in Kosovo, I do know that this term was notable in my country. So, the argument of not-notability is not convincing for me. Now, the POV and edit-wars concerns are important. But are these reasons strong enough in order to delete a notable article which has been in Wikipedia for more than one year and has survived three (or four?) previous nominations? I'm not sure. My experience in Wikipedia has taught me that we should try to resolve POV and edit conflicts, and not just delete notable articles, when such problems appear. Tag the article as POV if necessary! On the other side, maybe Eusebeus has understood better than anyone here the essence of this article's problems. He had said in a previous nomination and I quote: "The attempt to accommodate NPOV and OR objections has stripped it of any value and the content has moved from the encyclopedic to the ridiculous. This is choir-preaching and it seems to me that no one stumbling across this would be able to make much sense if it one way or the other. Articles that become subject to such disputes usually make themselves irrelevant in this way". As it is now the article tends indeed to become irrelevant, and, therefore, deletion will soon be indifferent.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 12:57, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - there is an immense number of possible phobias and every ethnic or other group has its own "phobia", mostly in sporadic use (notable exception being the antisemitism and perhaps a few others). But the description of these phobias in Wikipedia is often very subjective and prone to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Therefore I think that these and similar articles should be deleted until they are backed by two or three academic books writen by independent researchers (i.e. not Serbians or Croatians in this case).--<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 13:36, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - To those who think the article should be deleted, I hope to see AfDs and the same support for the majority of articles in the <b><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_anti-ethnic_and_anti-national_terms.html" title="List of anti-ethnic and anti-national terms">List of anti-ethnic and anti-national terms</a></b> / <a href="../../../a/n/t/Category%7EAnti-national_sentiment_1488.html" title="Category:Anti-national sentiment">Category:Anti-national sentiment</a> as your reasons given here will apply to all these articles as well (because of this I don't think WP:ILIKEIT applies).

<dd>In my (bitter) experience, such global polls seldom come out well; you get too many "global" keep votes objecting to the procedure, objecting to the bad weather, then piling on "keep per all above" etc; it gets real messy. While I don't have a global strategy at the moment, a better approach could be to establish few precedents, formulate a kind of guideline on the basis of that, then apply the principle everywhere it's applicable.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - the fact that this article is being nominated for a fourth time (!) should be enough to keep it. However, this term is <b>at least</b> twenty years old, if we ignore instances of its use way before the 80s, by people including the famous <b>Croatian</b> man of letters, <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miroslav_Krle%C5%BEa_5674.html" title="Miroslav Krleža">Miroslav Krleža</a>. It has been used in many languages, and examples of its use are linked to in the article, so it is notable. That the term actually exists further demonstrates that it is notable compared to other <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_anti-ethnic_and_anti-national_terms.html" title="List of anti-ethnic and anti-national terms">similarly-titled article</a>, which are mostly descriptive and do not exist outside Wikipedia. If these anti- articles are the problem, as some claim, then lets have a vote to delete them all, instead of singling this article out FOUR TIMES. It reeks of Serbophobia, ironically. If half the energy invested in showing how the article is biased, poorly written etc had been invested in improving it, it would be one of the better Wiki articles today. --<a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEstavisti_9746.html" title="User:Estavisti">Еstavisti</a> 20:41, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The redirect from <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbophobia.html" title="Serbophobia">serbophobia</a> would I think be sufficient in this case. The reason for the move would be to put the article on arguably more neutral and less loaded territory, and give it a more encyclopedia title, instead of leaving it with a fairly ugly neologism. I think a consonant example is the article for <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">islamophobia</a>--which is <i>strictly</i> about the neologism itself (if <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbophobia.html" title="Serbophobia">serbophobia</a> were so amended, I'd be fine with that--and then then sister article for <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Arabism_9893.html" title="Anti-Arabism">anti-Arabism</a>, which discusses the conceptual prejudice against Arabs contained within the neologism <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">islamophobia</a>. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFordmadoxfraud_5d6c.html" title="User:Fordmadoxfraud">Ford MF</a> 18:55, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, no; it's been in use sporadically for a little over two decades, and even then almost exclusively in a political context by Serb nationalists. The only "scholarly lliterature" mentioning the term refutes its existence, so I don't see what point you're trying to make there. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 07:21, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What are you smoking that makes you think <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miroslav_Krle%C5%BEa_5674.html" title="Miroslav Krleža">Miroslav Krleža</a>, the famous <b>Croatian</b> man of letters, is a "Serbian nationalist"?

<dd>I already knew that and, as usual, you're missing the point. Krleža used the word a few times, but never in the sense of some wide-spread and established phobia as you're trying to portray here. The "Serbophobia" Krleža talked of (or rather, "mentioned") could be applied to any nation; a Croatian intellectual today in 2006 could just as easily combine "Bosniaks" and "phobia" to create "Bosniakophobia." He could then even use the word in some interview, but this would hardly make it a subject of encyclopedic value. If you still disagree, could you please provide examples of other Croatian intellectuals using Serbophobia during this time period? I mean, surely your mention of Krleža is simply one part of a complex argument grounded on an impressive knowledge of early Yugoslav political circles - it's not as if you simply took the information from Mir Harven and then tried to twist it to suit your goals. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 23:07, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You seem to be the one missing the point. We're not discussing the quality of the article, but whether it should be deleted. You said that the term is "almost exclusively in a political context by Serb nationalists" for "little over two decades" before admitting that Krleža (who as a Croat can hardly be considered a Serb nationalist) used it many decades before that. I didn't get this information from "Mir Harven" but from the very article you're so anxious to have deleted. If you had bothered to read the article, you wouldn't have asked me for other examples of Croatian intellectuals using the term either, because one is given - <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antun_Gustav_Mato%C5%A1_26af.html" title="Antun Gustav Matoš">Antun Gustav Matoš</a>. Also, you assume bad faith, accusing me of trying to "twist [information] to suit your goals". Really, you have no arguments... --<a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEstavisti_9746.html" title="User:Estavisti">Еstavisti</a> 23:47, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>1) Yes, the article should be deleted. 2) Krleza's occasional (i.e. sparse) mention of "Serbophobia" does not make it a term of encyclopedic value, and either way it is quite separate from the far more relevant (but equally worthless) definition of "Serbophobia" - the one invented in the 80s and the one that, after several months of existence, this article proves to consistently return to. 3) I have followed the article. In fact, apparently far closer (or more scrutinizingly) than you have, for I know that the brief mention of Krleža and Matoš was brought up by Mir Harven in discussion. If it wasn't for him, you wouldn't even have this pathetic excuse to fall back on; you'd simply resort to the same recycled greater Serbian garbage from earlier. 4.) I had read the article and I was just waiting for you to bring up Matoš. Nonetheless, I asked you for more than "one given" example, because I just don't believe that two brief mentions of a (then) utter neologism make it encyclopedic or give the later propaganda term some sort of historical foundation. 5) The good faith guideline does not require me to continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 20:51, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I explained reasons in in my comments above. To sum it up: notability of the sentiment and the word used to describe it seem fairly well established and that is not disputed by the nomination anyway. What is disputed, and what was the point of the HappyCamper's closure, is that "The article itself...is little more than a focus for edit warring...". I don't think that that should be reason for deletion of any article, ever. If edit warring and POV pushing is a problem, preventing edit warring and POV pushing is the solution, not deleting articles so that people would have nowhere to edit war. Heck, we could probably delete the article on Bush for the same reason. People who think that other articles would be a better solution should maybe try to write those other articles first and see how that comes out. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 16:43, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>How many times do I have to repeat myself? The word has been used for decades, by Croats as well as Serbs. Try reading the other comments on the page. It has also been used by Western commentators:</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Friedman_9ada.html" title="Thomas Friedman">Thomas Friedman</a> (who himself has quite a little aversion towards "the Serbs") used the word Serbophobia in the New York Times <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E16FB385D0C728DDDA90994DD494D81&amp;showabstract=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E16FB385D0C728DDDA90994DD494D81&amp;showabstract=1" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>:</dd>
<dd><i>"But then the German Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, acting on the long love affair between Germany and Croatia (and traditional German <b>Serbophobia</b>), told the E.C. that Germany would recognize Croatia by Christmas 1991 -- no matter what."</i> (TimesSelect membership required to read the article.)</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, it's not a question of "belief", but sources - and there are many sources showing that the term has been relatively widely used for decades. Finally, your casual dismissal of a death camp for Serbs (whom you futher insult by only deigning to call them "Orthodox Yugoslavs"), is just the kind of comment that has no place in any civilised discussion. You don't need to care yourself, but I would appreciate some respect for the dead.--<a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEstavisti_9746.html" title="User:Estavisti">Еstavisti</a> 12:51, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
