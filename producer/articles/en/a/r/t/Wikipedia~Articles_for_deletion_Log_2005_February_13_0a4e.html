<p>Originator. <b>Delete.</b> I believe that the "Thundercats Outtakes" article should be deleted. It was not really a significant Internet meme, but more just a "look at this, isn't it cute?" kind of forwarded e-mail. Furthermore, I really wonder if there are copyright issues involved, although Wiki doesn't host the media. ‚Äî <a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike">WCityMike</a> 00:37, Feb 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. When I saw the VfD message on that article, I was pretty sure this was a "bad language" kind of issue, because of all the swearing on those quotes. That doesn't offend me, but anyway, I'm surprised. The article is all there, and it's pretty complete, too. So why delete it? Because it's not notable? There are several hundreds of articles on Wikipedia that deal with much less notable subjects, with much less content. Somehow, they're still there. What I'm trying to say is, I do not think we have the need to get rid of this article just because it's "not important enough" to be listed on Wikipedia. I see Wikipedia as "the encyclopedia where we'll find everything we won't find on other encyclopedias", so I think it does fit here. That said, keep it. By the way, this article holds absolutely no copyright violations.--<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackeriv_619c.html" title="User:Mackeriv">Kaonashi</a> 02:47, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>"the encyclopedia where we'll find everything we won't find on other encyclopedias" is not a very accurate description of the reasons that Wikipedia exists, and its goals. Look at the standards at <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>: "When you wonder what should or should not be in an article named "whatever", ask yourself what a reader would expect under "whatever" in an encyclopedia."

<li>Well, this is another problem with the article; can somebody cite (a) the dates of the original recording sessions in which the bloopers appear - and given that some of the dialogue includes specific plot details, this seems possible (the 'mega-condenser' seems to appear in episode 42 of season one, 'Feliner Pt 2'), and (b) when the bloopers were 'leaked' and who by? I can understand Wikipedia having an article on the 'Troggs Tapes', and perhaps Orson Welles' frozen peas commercial, but the underground nature of most bootlegs renders them un-encyclopaedia-ble.

<ul>
<li>Here's the gen:
<ul>
<li>A couple of days ago -cle was created. Like many, I suspect, when I saw it my first reaction was that that was blatantly false etymology. For starters: "corpsicle" is a pun on "popsicle", which in turn is derived from "icicle". I was all ready to write a sarcastic note on the talk page, complete with mention of "bicycle", "muscle", "corpuscle", and "pinocle", when I turned up the fact that the "-icle" root of "icicle" in fact <i>does</i> refer to a spike-like shape. So I aborted my note thinking that the {{move to wiktionary}} process would sort out the problem of the other words. Other editors apparently have not been as restrained, or have not done as much research. The addition of "testicle", "rusticle", "phonisicle", and "fungusicle" appear to have been made in order to make the point that the etymology as presented is ... <i>cough</i> ... slightly too broad. It is only "icicle" that has the "-icle" suffix. The remaining words are derived from "icicle" ("popsicle", "rusticle"), are puns on words derived from "icicle" ("creamsicle", "fudgesicle", "corpsicle"), aren't derived from an "-icle" root at all ("testicle"), or are nonce words to make a point ("fungusicle", "phonisicle").</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I vote: <b>Fix</b>, and <b>Wiktionary</b>, -cle before this nonsense gets out of hand (note that the {{move to wiktionary}} notice has unfortunately been removed); and <b>Delete</b> both phonisicle and fungusicle.</li>
<li>... and a vandalism watch on the anonymous users who are giving us all of these neologisms (further ones are "phonopolis", "gyropolis", and "paleontopolis"), bogus additions to <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polis.html" title="Polis">polis</a>, and <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wario_the_Quario_5898.html" title="Wario the Quario">Wario the Quario</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:25, 2005 Feb 13 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Even if it had some Google hits, it wouldn't be notable - having 0 Google hits is an extreme case of that. The point is that this is a piece of software that very few people have heard of, so it is extremely unlikely that someone is going to be looking for an encyclopedia article about it.</dd>
<dd>Basically, Wikipedia is not a place for you to promote your own software. There are other sites for that - a much more appropriate place, for example, is the <a href="http://www.python.org/pypi/" class="external text" title="http://www.python.org/pypi/" rel="nofollow">Python Packages Index</a>.</dd>
<dd>You are, of course, welcome to contribute things to Wikipedia. A good way to contribute is to find a topic that you know about, that other people would want to learn more about, and that isn't covered fully enough, and write or expand an article about it. When I joined Wikipedia, for example, I didn't write an article about the Python parser for parsing expression grammars that I was coding at the time, but I did write an article on <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parsing_expression_grammar.html" title="Parsing expression grammar">parsing expression grammars</a>. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer">RSpeer</a> 17:47, Feb 18, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This was a non-notable event involving the earthquake. It didn't get big ratings like the 9-11 aid. In fact, the only coverage on it was entertainment shows and not even the news. The only promotion I ever saw was on the show Access Hollywood, which incidentally is on the same network this was broadcast on. I doubt it even garnered enough money to pay for its production costs.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is the English Wikipedia, and even if this phrase is common and notable in Chinese, that doesn't mean that is common or notable in English, and deserving of an article.

<li>I see your point and in some ways agree with it, but I'm still not sure that this is the proper venue to air it out. It seems to me, based on your thoughts, that a more proper article could be created that would talk about this cultural phenomenon in a more big-picture way -- not only as it relates to these four inventions; something like China's Public Image or China's National Pride. The Chinese are obviously very concerned with their public image and there are multiple examples that could be explored (their space program is one). But of course that would require a creation effort from someone well-versed in the issue, which I am not. And as the article stands now, it's fairly useless. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">Katefan0</a> 17:11, Feb 14, 2005 (UTC)

<p>User:68.126.250.240 created this article to refer to the Universidad Cat√≥lica de Santa Mar√≠a, in Peru.

<li>Comment: The general ettiquette is to show your desire to remove the nomination by striking through your comments above (using &lt;s&gt;text&lt;/s&gt;). Removing the VfD tag early is severely frowned upon. Too often, it is a tactic used by vandals to try to disrupt the process.

<li><b>Delete</b>. It presents personal opinions as facts. There may be questions or uncertainties about some of the geological tests but that does not, in any way, validate the alterantive explanation. The arguments for Creationism should stand or fall on their own merits. Weaknesses in the arguments for Physical or Evolutionary Geology do not validate Creationist Geology. Furthermore the failiure to apply the same rigorous debate to theories of Creationist Geology can only serve to bring discredit upon the theory. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPing_4215.html" title="User:Ping">ping</a> 07:39, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I would support someone adding a criticisms section if they are concerned that the current rendering is not <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> enough, but the topic itself is sound regardless of the fact that many people on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> disagree with the points being discussed. They do represent a distinct and real interperetation that has been posed by various groups, and so this does legitimately warrant a topic to discuss these views. -- <a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperorbma_7b7a.html" title="User:Emperorbma">EmperorBMA</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/p/User_talk%7EEmperorbma_7607.html" title="User talk:Emperorbma">Ë©±„Åô</a> 14:21, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. It isn't really a repost of the deleted article. For one thing, I think it has existed for a while. However, it is still true that there is very little, if anything, in this article that is not a recap of the same basic creationist arguments to be found in such articles as <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_science.html" title="Creation science">Creation science</a>. If there is something which isn't duplicated elsewhere, that little bit could easily be moved elsewhere. The sections that relate specifically to geology are recaps of the arguments in <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flood_geology.html" title="Flood geology">Flood geology</a>, or arguments about dating techniques which overlap <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiometric_dating.html" title="Radiometric dating">Radiometric dating</a> and <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Earth_creationism_db9a.html" title="Young Earth creationism">Young Earth creationism</a>. Creationism being a notable view, albeit far from mainstream, Wikipedia obviously must cover it. But how many different articles should there be, all pushing basically the same pseudoscientific arguments?

<li><b>Delete</b>, geology is a science, creationism is not. The name of the article is therefore an attempt to mislead. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 01:20, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I was tempted to vote <i>delete</i> on the grounds that it could be combined with the <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flood_geology.html" title="Flood geology">Flood geology</a> article, but the latter is already fairly large and this article does cover different material than the <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flood_geology.html" title="Flood geology">Flood geology</a> article. In any case, if they were to be combined, it would probably be best under the title of <i>this</i> article.
<ul>
<li>On another note, I again see that a number of people here are voting to delete purely or partly because of their personal POV on the topic (for example, Megan1967, the entry just above this). That such people can't see how much their biases get in the way of NPOV causes me to despair that Wikipedia will never achieve its goal of truly presenting a neutral point of view. As with writing articles, voters should vote on whether the article is suitable for an encyclopedia, not on the basis of their personal POV, no matter how common that POV may be. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_J._Rayment_3d07.html" title="User:Philip J.

<ul>
<li>Are you claiming that creationism is a science? Science relies on testability of proof. Creationism relies on the written words of the Bible, a book with a religious POV. Faith is not science. You can't ignore the facts. It has nothing to do with claims of my POV. Of course being a christian yourself Philip wouldn't have anything to do with your position now would it.<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 06:50, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Are you claiming that your POV is undisputed fact? Because it isn't. It doesn't matter what I claim. Creationary scientists <i>do</i> claim that it is as scientific as uniformitarian views, and, although getting it's <i>framework</i> from the Bible, is also based on hard scientific evidence. <i>Those</i> are the facts. Your implied claim that it <i>indisputably</i> not science is simply not true. You <i>may</i> (hypothetically) be right that it is not science, but that is disputed by very many people, including many scientists, so you are, as I said, basing your vote on your POV. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_J._Rayment_3d07.html" title="User:Philip J. Rayment">Philip J. Rayment</a> 03:04, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sign your posts next time Philip. Creationism is not based on "hard scientific evidence". Creationism is based on the writings of the Bible - that is not science, that is faith. I would seriously challenge your statement that "many scientists" support creationism as science. Research does not back up your claim. For example - "Out of the approximately 13,000,000 scientists and engineers in the US alone, less than 5% (some 600,000) are creationists, according to Gallup poll results. However, this number includes those working in fields not related to life origins (such as computer scientists, mechanical engineers, etc.). Taking into account only those working in the relevant fields of earth and life sciences, there are about 480,000 scientists, but only about 700 believe in "creation-science" or consider it a valid theory [Robinson, 1995]. This means that less than 0.15% of relevant scientists believe in creationism. And that's just the US, which has more creationists than any other industrialized country. In other countries, the number of relevant scientists who accept creationism drops to less than one tenth of 1%." see <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA111.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA111.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. 0.15% does not equate to "many" <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 07:58, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I normally do sign my posts (and I have now signed that one). But to get to the point, you are still ignoring that it is a POV that you are using to justify a deletion. Do you dispute that <u>others claim</u> that creationism <i>is</i> based on hard scientific evidence? I don't know why I'm asking‚ÄîI asked last time and you ignored the question in favour of arguing your POV again. Personally, I would consider even your attempt-to-minimise 700 scientists to be "many" in the sense that it is a non-trivial number. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_J._Rayment_3d07.html" title="User:Philip J. Rayment">Philip J. Rayment</a> 15:19, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And if you think that creationism is not POV, you are sadly mistaken. Creationism takes the view from a religious point, there is nothing scientific about that. You still haven't provided any evidence that creationism is more popular than evolutionary science except from your own POV. Any number provided by any survey wouldn't satisfy you. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 03:37, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What makes you think that I think that creationism is not POV? I'm saying that evolution is <i>also</i> POV, and that you are therefore voting to delete because it doesn't agree with your POV, which is not a valid reason to delete. It is also your <i>opinion</i> that there is nothing scientific about creation. Others disagree. I never claimed that creationism is more popular (although I think that argument can be made with qualifications). Where did you get the idea I was claiming that? <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_J._Rayment_3d07.html" title="User:Philip J. Rayment">Philip J. Rayment</a> 14:28, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ignoring that the "flat earth" belief was mainly fiction, you are correct. Many people now think that evolution is true, but that does not make it so. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_J._Rayment_3d07.html" title="User:Philip J. Rayment">Philip J. Rayment</a> 15:19, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>The first paragraph makes it clear that it's considered pseudoscience. what else do you want? the fact is, it EXISTS, just like phrenology. but phrenology isn't up for deletion. why are you voting to delete an article on a topic that exists, and which is flagged as pseudoscience in the intro? <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 13:15, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>If you agree that it is a pseudo-science then Creation Geology is misnamed as such. Creation Pseudogeology maybe. Whatever. Calling it Creation Geology is misleading. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 02:16, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps so, but that's what the creationists call it, so the naming convention guidelines are pretty clear that that's what the article ought to be called (if there's an article on it at all). For example, we have an article on the "true Catholic Church" called, yes, <a href="../../../t/r/u/True_Catholic_Church_2212.html" title="True Catholic Church">true Catholic Church</a>, not because the article should in content or in tone approve of the claims of the subject of the article, but because that's the generally used (self- and otherwise) description. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 02:58, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Creationists may call it that but that doesnt mean the majority call it that or that it is true and correct. Creation Science and Creation Geology are oxymorons. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 06:00, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>So you keep asserting, but NPOV is about not claiming something disputed to be true even if you think it is true.

<li>You are not neutral Philip. I've seen your profile page. It's quite obvious you are not neutral on this.

<li>I'm not claiming to be neutral. I'm claiming that you are not neutral either, yet you are basing your vote to delete on your non-neutral POV, which is an invalid reason to vote to delete. How about you address my points instead of attacking me? My position on creationism is, as you say, public. I don't shirk from that. But that is not the point. The point is that <i>your</i> position is also public, and you are invalidly basing your vote on <i>your</i> opinion.

I don't comb the encyclopedia for articles to delete; when one is proposed, and it's in my sphere of personal or professional interest, I look at it and vote accordingly. In so far as there's any inconsistency in this (and I don't think that there is any), it would apply to most people on most VfDs.<br />
Besides, it's slightly disingenuous to point to the fact that we're told in the first paragraph that the subject is considered to be pseudoscience. Would an article describing at length the theory that all North Americans were intellectually and morally inferior to other nationalities, and accursed by god, be acceptable if it said at the beginning: ‚ÄúThis theory is rejected by mainstream thought and considered to be groundless‚Äú?

<dd>At the present time there exist upon the earth five races or varieties of man, each very different from the others in instincts, social customs, and, to an extent, in structure. These are the Ethiopian or negro type, originating in Africa; the Malay or brown race, from the islands of the Pacific; the American Indian; the Mongolian or yellow race, including the natives of China, Japan and the Eskimos; and finally, the highest type of all, the Caucasians, represented by the civilized white inhabitants of Europe and America.‚Äù (<i>Hunter's Civic Biology</i> pp. 195‚Äì196)<a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/hunt195.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/hunt195.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> 138.130.194.229 13:37, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm not quite sure why this would bear on the debate... particularly since modern science has basically discredited the idea that different ethnicitics are descended from different species of early man (and, therefore, has discredited the idea that certain races are inherently genetically inferior). <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">Katefan0</a> 14:55, Feb 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You've ignored most of what I said (and the reason I gave for my vote). In short: a psudo-scientific theory pushed by a geographically restricted (if unfortunately politically powerful) group of religious fundamentalists might warrant a short article; it doesn't warrant one of this length and detail, especially when little mention is made of its status. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis (<font color="green">ŒúŒµŒª ŒïœÑŒ∑œÑŒ∑œÇ</font>)</a> 15:30, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>perhaps if your premises were correct, your conclusion would follow. but you of course ignore the entire religion of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>, which ascribes to a young-earth interpretation of geological phenomena, including the flood. geologically restricted? hardly. dominant in north america, south america, nearly universal in africa and the middle east, all the way through to Indonesia, and at least 5% in Australia. Evolution is the geographically restricted fringe view -- a uniquely Western materialistic phenomenon. <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 18:26, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>As a religious belief, you're right; as a pseudo-scientific theory, presented as scientific (as it is in the article), you're wrong.

<li>if religious belief and historical belief were separable in this case, you'd be right. but since this is above all a HISTORICAL belief about a deliberate act of creation, a garden built on a river, and a really big flood, you're wrong. that's my point. divorcing science from religion in this case is rather silly. genesis is either historical or it isn't. <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 13:43, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why are you conflating science with history? Even if I thought that Genesis was an historically accurate account of the beginning of the world, that wouldn't mean that I thought that creationism was scientific (it wouldn't even mean that I took Genesis to offer an <i>explanation</i> of the beginning of the world. I wonder if you're aware of what distinguishes science from non-science and pseudoscience? This isn't the place to go into it, but I'd be happy to discuss it somewhere appropriate. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis (<font color="green">ŒúŒµŒª ŒïœÑŒ∑œÑŒ∑œÇ</font>)</a> 13:55, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>i'm aware of how the contemporary scientific community defines science and pseudoscience, and that creationism falls within the latter category. of course, i find that definition to be unreasonably narrow, but that's beside the point. the fact that creationism is pseudoscience doesn't change what it is -- and it is primarily a historical argument, based on an ostensibly historical account, and the subsequent interpretation of contemporary phenomena in light of that history. to accept the account as historical is to interpret natural phenomena in light of it. <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 14:03, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>
<ul>
<li>Well, first, it's not just scientists who think of science in that way (many of them religious believers of a less literalist persuasion), but also philosophers of science (and many theologians). But, secondly and more importantly, what do you take the importance of science to be? What distinguishes science from guessing, or choosing the most congenial theory, or just believing what you're told? What's the relationship between the scientific method and justification? Thirdly, and finally, how soon before we fall off the edge of this screen? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis (<font color="green">ŒúŒµŒª ŒïœÑŒ∑œÑŒ∑œÇ</font>)</a> 18:37, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>This vote isn't about whether Creationism is as a science, a pseudoscience, etc. This vote is about whether <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_geology.html" title="Creation geology">Creation geology</a> warrants a separate article. If there is enough encyclopedic material on Creation geology that is distinct from the material presented in numerous other articles about creationism, then it should have a separate article, whether Creation geology is science, pseudoscience, or utter kookiness. I don't think there is enough such material, and the proliferation of articles related to creationism seems to be just a POV-motivated attempt to increase its presence in the Wikipedia and make it seem more like valid scientific view. The proliferation of articles also complicates the task of editors who are trying to ensure that creationism is presented in an NPOV manner. So the number of articles on creationism should be reduced, and this one seems like one of the first that can easily be dispensed with since the little material it contains that doesn't overlap other creationism articles can easily be merged with one or more of the others. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:19, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm open to the idea since this ship looks like it's sinking. how do you suggest we do it? <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 14:23, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My first take on this is to move the material on antideluvian geology and dating techniques to the "Creation geology" section in <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_science.html" title="Creation science">Creation science</a>, keeping the link to <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flood_geology.html" title="Flood geology">Flood geology</a> as a separate article. <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_science.html" title="Creation science">Creation science</a> is currently only 9K in length, so there is plenty of room for expansion. Indeed the Creation geology section of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_science.html" title="Creation science">Creation science</a> currently has a "sectstub" tag, calling for the section to be expanded; so this move would also permit that tag to be removed. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 16:02, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That seems to me to be a very sound place to start. I must admit I share a lot of the concerns you raise. There does seems to be at least a strong suggestion that there's a strategy here of "add creationist POV faster than it can be taken out/NPOV'd", so it's a bit rich for said advocates to cry "NPOV foul" when the removal of POV material is supported. Nonetheless, there's no reason material on this topic shouldn't be here, <i>provided it can be put in a NPOV context</i>. (By which I do <i>not</i> mean, 'we've written our creationist POV stuff, add some POV "evolutionist" material and it'll thereby be NPOV.') <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 18:16, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>let's put bizarre accusations of strategy to rest, shall we? this page was created to address issues unique to creation geology, and it is absolutely, without a doubt, best addressed here, because:</li>
<li>1) it parallels other creation science pages</li>
<li>2) putting it in creation science will make creation science ridiculously lopsided on one topic</li>
<li>3) it doesn't do any HARM to have this page here -- it's not taking up any space that wouldn't be taken up on another page -- on the contrary, it covers unique material precisely on one topic.</li>
<li>now of course, those who wish to suppress any ideas other than those they consider to be rational will naturally delete this without justification (or pseudojustifications, like "this isn't science!" or "it's pov!" -- if that's the way it's gonna go down, then feel free to integrate this material anywhere you see fit. but don't fool yourself into thinking you're justified. <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 18:52, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Let's put the unwarranted level of hysteria to rest. I speak from experience, where I've attempted to resolve POV issues in particular articles (notably <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theistic_realism.html" title="Theistic realism">theistic realism</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_biology.html" title="Creation biology">creation biology</a>). These articles appear with text with no reasonable claim to be NPOV; there then follows endless edit wars and tangential debate on the talk pages, with the general effect of making removal of the POV as long-drawn-out as possible; and then much the same set of authors move on to do the same thing in another page. (Witness in the former case I'm still waiting for the restructuring you undertook to carry out, but you're still activity adding material to other pages.) I'm not suggesting this is reason per se for deletion, but it's pretty frustrating to deal with. (You'll notice I haven't even <b>voted</b> for the deletion of this page, so yelling "unjustified deletion!" at me is pretty, well, unjustified.) And if it's not a 'strategy' it's certainly a 'pattern of behaviour'. If these pages were really aiming at NPOV even in tone, never mind substance, would we really see such lavish use of POV neologisms like "creationary" and "evolutionist"? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 19:52, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nah. It really <i>was</i> a vanity article. Read the original. Rewriting such personal vanity articles to be about something entirely different and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notable</a> can be almost as satisfying as slapping a great big {{copyvio}} on top of corporate vanity articles. Moreover, you just know that if we do delete this, someone else will be along to write another Cleo vanity article sooner or later, or we'll end up with stub duplicates of <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Cleo_2808.html" title="Miss Cleo">Miss Cleo</a> because someone omitted the "Miss".

<li><b>Keep</b> as disambiguation page. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 01:16, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm sorry to be a spoil-sport, but the new article is not a proper disambiguation page. A <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleo.html" title="Cleo">Cleo</a> disambiguation page is needed when there are several articles (or redirects) on different subjects that might reasonably be titled <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleo.html" title="Cleo">Cleo</a>. Usually disambiguation pages are created where there is an article or redirect titled <a href="../../../x/_/_/X.html" title="X">X</a>, and someone comes along to write an article on a different topic with an equally good claim to the title <a href="../../../x/_/_/X.html" title="X">X</a>. The solution is to give the title to a disambiguation page which lists the other articles, and to give the various other articles competing for the title a longer title along the lines of X (in Y). However, that is not the case here. Few of the listed articles would properly be titled <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleo.html" title="Cleo">Cleo</a> except for the magazine, which is a red-link, meaning it hasn't been created yet. Rather than a disambiguation page, the proposed new content for the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleo.html" title="Cleo">Cleo</a> article is mostly a List of people whose first name is Cleo and other things somewhat related to the word Cleo. That isn't a disambiguation page; it is just a list masquerading as a disambiguation page, in this case an especially dumb list. Furthermore, as a process point, even if it was correct to edit the original article in this way, it seems to me very questionable to do it before the VfD vote is completed. This is not the article that was originally written, or even on the topic of the original article, and at least in principle, the article that was submitted to VfD has 5 days to be considered. If it was OK to change the subject of an article submitted to VfD because it seems to an editor to be vanity, then it would be OK to let administrators simply speedy-delete such articles. However, there has never been a consensus for allowing administrators to speedy-delete articles for reasons of vanity, however obvious the vanity might seem to the administrators. People voting on VfD should either leave the articles alone until they are deleted; or else clean them up on the subject on which they were originally written. In this case, that subject is the name "Cleo" But they shouldn't switch the subject to something else, even if that is a fake disambiguation page. People can comment in the VfD vote that the title should be used for a disambiguation page, but people should wait until there is a consensus from the VfD process before they mess around with articles that are submitted here. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:07, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Examples like <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter.html" title="Peter">peter</a> or <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick.html" title="Nick">nick</a>, or <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sally.html" title="Sally">sally</a>, or pick your faforite name show that given-name articles do not always abide this. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 02:24, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Of those three, only <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sally.html" title="Sally">Sally</a> is really a disambiguation page, and only two of the several entries in that list are proper entries for a disambiguation page, meaning links to articles that otherwise would be titled <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sally.html" title="Sally">Sally</a> if there weren't competition for that title. The other entries are miscellaneous Sally-cruft. Disambiguation pages should be for disambiguation. As for <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter.html" title="Peter">Peter</a> that is really just a List of famous people named Peter masquerading as a disambiguation page, with a couple of sentences thrown in about the name. Same thing for <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick.html" title="Nick">Nick</a>. So my opinion is that those pages are bad examples to be emulating, and arguably should be deleted. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:38, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Quite. But these names are the first that came to my mind. Be sure that there are dosens of such. Did you try, say, er... <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon.html" title="Simon">Simon</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas.html" title="Thomas">Thomas</a>... <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 05:46, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon.html" title="Simon">Simon</a>, ditto what I said about <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter.html" title="Peter">Peter</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas.html" title="Thomas">Thomas</a>, ditto. These are all just lists of people with that first name masquerading as disambiguation pages. On this Simon list, there is only one article which might logically be titled <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon.html" title="Simon">Simon</a>, and that is <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_%28game%29.html" title="Simon (game)">Simon (game)</a>. On the <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas.html" title="Thomas">Thomas</a> list, there aren't any. It seems like we have quite a few of these Lists of people with the first name X articles masquerading as disambiguation pages. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 18:43, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am not arguing with you. That's exactly what I am pointing at. Something must be done with it. Lists of people whose first name is Tom or Sam seem weird. But since there are lots of such articles, the issue must be discussed at administrative level, to have a common decidion for all such articles, rather than VfD them one by one. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 20:44, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Now finally regarding my vote. I vote to delete because once the apparent vanity is cleaned up, this article's topic is a sub-stub about the name Cleo. I don't think sub-stubs are preferable to red-links. If someone cares to expand the article during the VfD (on the subject of the name Cleo), then I will reconsider my vote. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 01:47, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as rewritten. I think name disambiguation articles are entirely valid, <b>if</b> some of the things or people concerned are commonly referred to by just that name. For example, someone looking for the apostle Peter might reasonably expect to find him under <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter.html" title="Peter">Peter</a>; so might someone looking for <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Rabbit_fb89.html" title="Peter Rabbit">Peter Rabbit</a> if they didn't realise that Rabbit functions as his surname as well as his species. In addition, the history of the name can be encyclopaedic. I do think that pages like <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter.html" title="Peter">Peter</a> should be limited to those commonly known simply as 'Peter' though; so <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Green_a0b6.html" title="Peter Green">Peter Green</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Jackson_8dca.html" title="Peter Jackson">Peter Jackson</a> have no place there. On this specific case, Miss Cleo, the women's magazine, the TV series, the physicists' collaboration, and the programming language at least all look like things which people might reasonably expect to be able to look up as simply 'Cleo'. <a href="../../../t/s/p/User%7ETSP_05ce.html" title="User:TSP">TSP</a> 15:13, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Excuse me, but you have to do a little more than bang a few words into Google and give a cursory glane at the results! I knew nothing about him 10 minutes ago, but have already discovered that Choi Bae-Dal (745 Google hits by the way, pretty well all for him) lived from 1922-94 in Korea and Japan. His real name was Masutatsu Oyama, and he was a top proponant of martial arts techniques. "In 1950, Sosai (the founder) Mas Oyama started testing (and demonstrating) his power by fighting bulls. In all, he fought 52 bulls, three of which were killed instantly, and 49 had their horns taken off with <i>knife hand blows</i>" There were famous Korean comic books written about his life some thirty years ago, and the fourth largest grossing movie in Korea last year was "Fighter in the Wind", Choi Bae-Dal's life story. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheCoffee_bcb6.html" title="User:TheCoffee">TheCoffee</a> and <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> say he "Doesn't seem notable" and "anecdote, unverified and unencyclopedic". I don't think so, guys! Having said all this, the article is brief and poorly written, but that just makes it a stub. I could live with a (new) artcle on Masutatsu Oyama/Choi Bae-Dal with a re-direct from <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knife_hand.html" title="Knife hand">Knife hand</a>, but otherwise keep this, and it will get sorted sometime. <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowardB_42ca.html" title="User:HowardB">HowardB</a> 15:42, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choi_Bae-Dal_e8f1.html" title="Choi Bae-Dal">Choi Bae-Dal</a> is notable, but I don't think <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knife_hand.html" title="Knife hand">knife hand</a> is article-worthy in his context. If there was a Choi Bae-Dal article, I would recommend the information here be merged there. Also, if "knife hand" <i>is</i> article worthy, it probably shouldn't be under that name, as the term "knife hand" is more commonly used to mean either a taekwondo block or the hand of someone using a knife. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheCoffee_bcb6.html" title="User:TheCoffee">TheCoffee</a> 20:18, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The plot thickens.... It appears we already have a <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masutatsu_Oyama_1486.html" title="Masutatsu Oyama">Masutatsu Oyama</a> article (this is <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choi_Bae-Dal_e8f1.html" title="Choi Bae-Dal">Choi Bae-Dal</a>'s more usual name, it turns out). So I have put a redir from <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choi_Bae-Dal_e8f1.html" title="Choi Bae-Dal">Choi Bae-Dal</a>. Then, we have a <a href="../../../k/y/o/Kyokushin.html" title="Kyokushin">Kyokushin</a> article (this is a style of karate that Oyama/Choi developed -- now HUGE worldwide). In here, we have a better life of Oyama than in the main article! Also, the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masutatsu_Oyama_1486.html" title="Masutatsu Oyama">Masutatsu Oyama</a> article appears to be a straight lift from <a href="http://oyama_masutatu.exsudo.com" class="external text" title="http://oyama_masutatu.exsudo.com" rel="nofollow">Exsudo.com</a>. So, when I have some time, I propose to:
<ul>
<li>merge what little there is in <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knife_hand.html" title="Knife hand">knife hand</a> into <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masutatsu_Oyama_1486.html" title="Masutatsu Oyama">Masutatsu Oyama</a> and redirect</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree with Rossami that this should be deleted because it's a memorial.

See for example <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbine_High_School_massacre_3e4b.html#Victims" title="Columbine High School massacre">Columbine High School massacre#Victims</a>. Individual articles on the victims would be memorials unless they were otherwise notable. Although, I would actually find such memorial articles an interesting window into a bygone era. But at any rate, I think the list is a useful addition since a quick scan of it gives a feel for the sex, age, &amp; ethnic distribution of the victims. <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfman_124d.html" title="User:Wolfman">Wolfman</a> 04:00, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b> unless more can be said, if we are to be at all consistent to previous decisions on this page.</s> I strongly disagree that all peers are notable; this chap was the SECOND Baron Harlech, i.e. a peer only because his father was, and Baron is the lowest of the orders of peerage; and will have been in parliament (though MP is <i>always</i> used to refer only to members of the House of Commons) only because he was a peer. If the 'average professor' and the 'average middle school' aren't notable, the average peer certainly isn't. If this chap is notable (and if, indeed, he was an MP), fine, but his reason for note needs to be mentioned and is orthogonal to his peerage.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. He was an MP (House of Commons) for Sligo from 1841 to 1852, and for Leitrim from 1856 until 1876, when he succeeded his brother as 2nd Baron Harlech. His brother, who had been an MP too and a groom-in-waiting of Queen Victoria was created 1st Baron Harlech in 1876, with the special provision that his younger brother (our hero) would inherit the title in the event of no male offspring. The 2nd Baron didn't have to wait long because his brother died the same year. The 2nd Baron was also High Sheriff of County Leitrim, and Lord Lieutenant of County Merioneth. He achieved the rank of major in the 13th Light Dragoons. I don't have any information about whether he did anything notable in these posts. Some of the later Barons Harlech were quite notable. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:45, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ah, thank you! I couldn't find anything on the page or in the first few Google hits explaining this. As a Major, an elected MP, a High Sherrif and a Lord Lieutenant, I believe he's notable for reasons mostly unconnected with his peerage; <b>keep</b> assuming that all this information will find its way into the article. I re-emphasise that I don't believe that "all peers are notable" - all a hereditary peerage is is a distinguished family, and in some cases not even that distinguished. (Should I at this point mention the non-notability of my late great-uncle Lord Hatch of Lusby just to taunt someone into making the page?) <a href="../../../t/s/p/User%7ETSP_05ce.html" title="User:TSP">TSP</a> 22:09, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Lord Hatch of Lusby is very notable! He was one of the last peers to be told formally to shut up by the House when he continued to ask questions and refused to sit down. I think I also ran into someone who lived in the London flat he used to live in, which was in Peckham Rye. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">Dbiv</a> 22:39, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sounds like him&#160;:-) Write about him then, you seem to know more about him than I do... (It was mostly an idle reference to the traditional "I'm a more notable [a] than he is a [b] and I'm not in Wikipedia", which I see has got <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Burdette_521d.html" title="Kevin Burdette">one Wikipedian</a> an entry that is currently resisting deletion - I think that pretty much all <i>life</i> peers probably are notable, given that it's about the highest honour the United Kingdom can award.) <a href="../../../t/s/p/User%7ETSP_05ce.html" title="User:TSP">TSP</a> 00:18, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I cannot claim to know an awful lot about 'Eddie Boy' and the INC, but even a cursory surf of relevant pages and other Wiki entries around the topic show that a) INC is a major religious and political factor in the Philippines (it is said that in 1998 the sect helped Joseph Estrada take the largest winning margin ever in a presidential contest) and b) Eduardo Manalo is a pretty big cheese within the organisation. Admittedly the article needs some attention to make it more interesting and informative (need some Philippinos who know the intricacies of the religious-political scene to help out here).

<li><b>Comment</b>. First let me say that I am not Filipino, and I have no axe to grind for <a href="../../../i/g/l/Iglesia_ni_Cristo_44b9.html" title="Iglesia ni Cristo">Iglesia ni Cristo</a> or <a href="../../../e/d/u/Eduardo_V._Manalo_7100.html" title="Eduardo V. Manalo">Eduardo V. Manalo</a>. In fact the religion/cult, call it what you will, is most likely a strongly negative influence in the Philippines and in other parts of the world. It wouldn't bother me if it disappeared off the face of the map. <b>But</b> you can't ignore the facts just because you are ignorant of the situation or the country , or don't like what you read. The fact is that <a href="../../../i/g/l/Iglesia_ni_Cristo_44b9.html" title="Iglesia ni Cristo">Iglesia ni Cristo</a> is a <i>hugely</i> influential organization (millions of adherents/members around the world, and probably the second biggest group after the Catholic Church in the Philippines). Politically, it is a king maker, and is credited by the Philippines' media of having been pivotal in getting Joseph Estrada elected as President in 1998, and (switching sides) very influential in getting President Arroyo re-elected last year (Arroyo and her honchos made a courtesy call on <a href="../../../e/d/u/Eduardo_V._Manalo_7100.html" title="Eduardo V. Manalo">Eduardo V. Manalo</a> just before INC awarded her with their support). <a href="../../../e/d/u/Eduardo_V._Manalo_7100.html" title="Eduardo V. Manalo">Manalo</a> himself clearly has a major influence in the organisation and over its millions of adherents. His grandfather founded it, his father (aged 80) runs it, and the chair is getting very warm!

<li>It's an attempt at a disambiguation page. I think that the best way to create disambiguation pages is to let them grow naturally from the conflicts that arise between articles with the same names. There's nothing wrong with creating a disambiguation page from scratch, of course, provided that one is also going to create the articles that it disambiguates amongst. Had this page just been created hours ago and with some dangling hyperlinks on it, I'd have given the page the benefit of the doubt. As it is, it has been five months and this page has seen effectively zero growth. The dangling hyperlinks that were there were never filled in. Indeed, the original article seemed to be a weak attempt to justify advertising the fourth item by masquerading as a disambiguation for the other three. They are all simply non-<a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">notable</a> brand names as far as I can tell. There is, however, a record label "Eye Q" that <i>appears</i> to fulfil the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines</a> criteria, although I'll let others be the final judges of that.

<p>When the Sun is high in the sky, the horns of the crescent moon always point down, and when the Sun is below the horizon, the horns always point up, so this happens every month, not every 7 to 14 months. I did some research on google, and found one <a href="http://www.wonderquest.com/cheshire-moon-speedy-sunset-languid-eventide.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.wonderquest.com/cheshire-moon-speedy-sunset-languid-eventide.htm" rel="nofollow">bald assertion</a> that did not give any further references, that explains what this phrase is supposed to mean. Apparently, it's supposed to mean the crescent moon with the horns pointing up and tilting neither to the left nor to the right, not even a little bit. However, it's still a poorly chosen phrase, since "rising crescent moon" already means <strong>any</strong> crescent moon at any given time when it happens to be rising! As far as I know, April Holladay invented this phrase, and even if she did not, I still think it is someone else's <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_Forste_ec22.html" title="User:Eric Forste">Eric Forste</a> 00:16, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I repeat: the hell? "Trishna" is a more common term than "Tawals", and thus it's more difficult to winnow the relevant info from Google, but it's there.

That's because (although I must say I haven't looked at them all) they have something of uniqueness, or have won multiple awards, or murdered their co-star, or whatever. At least there is a bit more to say than "a porn star who lives in Florida". If it said "she is a <b>non</b>-porn star who lives in Florida" we'd still be voting to delete. If you have something to add to the article to make it of encyclopedic interest, please feel free to add it, and I for one would happily reconsider my vote.

<p>This looks like a straightforward undergraduate prank. The clues are too numerous to mention; apart from the last paragraph, I'd point to her supposed book, purportedly published when she was eighteen, no details given. Needless to say, Google brings up six hits, none of which supports anything in the article; two are related to a petition she signed, two are about a marathon, one is some photos she took of a dinner, and one actually relates to "Foot, Philippa: <i>Locke...</i>".</p>

<li>The previous VfD resulted in a clear vote for deletion (explicitly discussed and rejected was the suggestion that the page be kept and turned into a redirect). A motion for undeletion was almost unanimously rejected. Mikkalai has twice recreated the page, making it a redirect, and most recently gave it its own content, with links to other pages. What he refers to as <i>speedy deletion</i> is in fact the deletion of his redirect code, and later of his content, and the placing of a message explaining the situation. All of this has been explained to him at length at Talk:Jewish ethnocentrism. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis (<font color="green">ŒúŒµŒª ŒïœÑŒ∑œÑŒ∑œÇ</font>)</a> 19:31, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Mikkalai is simply trying to engineer a third vote here. The title and contents were deleted according to the vote at VfD, where only two users voted to redirect, and the decision was upheld at VfU.

<dd>I don't know whether there's a policy. I know only that the vote was clear. People were at liberty to vote to redirect, as this was presented as an option, but only two voted in favor. You should quote the policy that allows you to distinguish between votes regarding content and votes regarding the title. Perhaps you'd do better explaining why you feel strongly about retaining it, because it seems to me that you're engaging in sophistry and acting like a vandal. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 19:52, Feb 13, 2005 (UTC)

<li>When people vote for deletion on VfD, they are voting on whether an article of that title should exist. In most cases, they are not voting about the current content of the article. If the content of the article is the issue, then they will typically vote Keep and Cleanup. (I admit sometimes when Cleanup would make the article a stub or sub-stub, people will vote to Delete without prejudice to the title because they believe a redlink is preferable to a sub-stub; however that was not the case in these votes.). If people want the title to exist, but think the title does not merit independent content, they will call for a Redirect, or a Merge/Redirect. Delete means "there should be no article of this title". That the article should be deleted was the overwhelming consensus of the VfD vote: that the article should be not be undeleted was the overwhelming consensus of the VfU vote The recreation of VfD-deleted article is one of the grounds for speedy deletion, by that policy. . Reinstating the article as a redirect flies in the face of this consensus and renders the votes meaningless, and those reinstatements are properly speedily-deleted. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:07, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>Delete means "there should be no article of this title"</i>: This is your interpretation. If you believe it is correct, please suggest the policy update.

<dd>I think you've misunderstood the VfD process. It's not simply a question of 50 for, 10 against. The admin reads the comments and tries to determine from those what the community consensus is. For example, there's a vote going on regarding Conscious Evolution, which was a pile of garbage. Most people have voted to delete, but many made the comment that
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscious_Evolution_dc8b.html" title="Conscious Evolution">Conscious Evolution</a> was a pile of garbage, and I voted against as well. But it does not preclude writing an article that in a NPOV way explains this kind of stuff. We have plenty of articles about various kinds of <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snake_oil.html" title="Snake oil">snake oil</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/o/Kook.html" title="Kook">kookery</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 20:42, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>there's nothing wrong with having an article with that title, just not this article. Therefore, an editor decided to rewrite it to make the content acceptable. But with Jewish ethnocentrism, people did not comment that rewriting or redirecting was appropriate. They voted, with no hesitation or ambiguity, to delete the whole thing. Can't you see the difference? You are splitting hairs by demanding that there be an explicit policy (i.e. instruction creep) for every single decision the community makes and that's why I'm calling you a sophist. Also, I have a question for you.

<p>The page <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Larson_2ea5.html" title="Ron Larson">Ron Larson</a> contains information about the professor with that name, who wrote a textbook, called "Calculus of a Single Variable: Early Transcendental Functions".

<p>More, in the <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derivative.html" title="Derivative">derivative</a> article, the citation of that book has the following form:</p>

<p><b>(1)</b> Delete <b>this article as completely and utterly unencyclopedic.</b><br /></p>
<p><i>First off, this provides no reason. You are just saying it does not belong on Wikipedia through no argument. It is not a point. Also, encyclopedia is defined by the American Heritage Dictionary as "Embracing many subjects; comprehensive." By embracing many subjects, it means none are excluded. Thus, by this definition, argument (1) is proven false.<br /></i></p>
<p><b>(2) Nobody has ever been blocked just for nominating an article on VfD. There are no restrictions on what can and cannot be nominated here.</b></p>
<p><i>My votes have been changed, you are assuming things that aren't true. Also, this is completely irrelevant to the arguments and voting</i><br /></p>
<p><b>(3) Calling people who frequent Wikipedia retards (as in your link) is flaming, which is not tolerated here.</b><br /></p>
<p><i>Aside from being completely irrelevant, you should enjoy some humor in a conflicting situations. Americans make fun of themselves as stereotypes, so do some <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipediholic_2ec3.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipediholic">Wikiholics</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedians_0c31.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedians">Wikipedians</a>. Even Helen Keller did. Also, this is not vandalism or "flaming," as you call it. In here we can make points and the points are even better if they are right or can't be disproven. Also, to use this as an argument is <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argumentum_ad_Hominem_3cf8.html" title="Argumentum ad Hominem">Argumentum ad Hominem</a>, which is a logical fallacy.</i><br /></p>
<p><b>(4) A "sub-legal" process? Filtering the information in our articles is perfectly legal; there are no laws prohibiting us from doing with our website what we want, and we choose to include and exclude information based on what we collectively deem worthy to be in an encyclopedia. This process allows us to build an informative resource without being flooded with inane contributions that have no place in a work of reference (like this).</b><br /></p>
<p><i>Please note that referring to forensic or legal does not imply anything about American law. I was talking about a process, in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">the place of conflict</a>, which is used to destroy information while upholding certain integrities and rules, which make a legal process. This is a partition in this legal process. Also, by the earlier definition of encyclopedic, this work is encyclopedic. Would you like me to look up informative to give you an idea of what it means? This article gives <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information.html" title="Information">information</a>, to <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_Wow_6ef4.html" title="Bow Wow">Wikipedians</a>. By your logic, I chose to include the article because it is based on what <a href="../../../s/o/m/Some.html" title="Some">some</a> deem to be worthy to be in an encyclopedia.

<li>I'm really not going to nit-pick this issue since in the end, all the votes that count (yours doesn't count because you have not registered an account) have been to delete, and there is no way this article is being kept. For the record, no reason has to be given <i>why</i> something is unencyclopedic for a vote to count. It seems pretty obviously not appropriate for a reference work according to everyone else so I don't really feel the need to explain myself. Just because something counts as information doesn't mean it belongs in an encyclopedia. Someone on here (I don't remember who exactly) once made the analogy of Wikipedia as an organism: we must take in food (information) and build the useful parts of that food into the bulk of the organism while excreting that which doesn't contribute to the overall health of the organism. In our case, this means deleting that information which doesn't belong in an encyclopedia. We get a lot of articles which are clearly factual in nature but the subject matter is not notable enough or appropriate for inclusion in an encyclopedia. This is not just some collection of every piece of information we can possibly find. No hard feelings, but I won't continue to debate this issue any further as VfD is cluttered up as it is and none of this is going to change the fate of the article. ‚Äî <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">–õ–∏–≤–∞–π</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">‚ò∫</a> 01:02, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Where does it say that? All people that know how to edit and use Wikipedia should be given "voting rights".

<li>Comment: Because of serious problems in the past with people attempting to use <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppet_c4eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet">sockpuppets</a> to "stuff the ballot box", we have established a fairly firm rule on this page that the votes of anonymous users and very new users are subject to steep discounting by the admin who finally makes the decision. However, any facts you can add to the discussion are welcome and will be considered by the community. To whoever has been blanking the anonymous votes, <b>PLEASE STOP</b>. Trust that the deciding admin will investigate them and weight them appropriately. Marking suspicious votes is a courtesy but erasing comments just confuses the discussion thread and incites unnecessary confrontation. To the anon who was tampering with other people's votes, stop that too. What you did is immediately obvious to anyone reviewing the edit history. It seriously prejudices the case against you. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 03:36, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Allowing anonymous users to vote would create a few problems: firstly, an IP address does not identify a user uniquely -- some people's ISP does not give them the same IP every time they log onto the Internet, for example. Or a logged-in user could log out and get a second vote signed with their IP. Or somebody could vote five times at five of their friends' houses. Getting an account only takes a minute and is free. You don't even need to give out your name or email or anything, so in theory everybody is equally entitled to a vote, although it helps a lot to have a history of helpful contributions attributed to your account. While not strictly necessary, it lets people know you're not a sock puppet, plus it helps to have experience in Wikipedia community so you get a good feel for what is and isn't encyclopedic before voting on Votes for Deletion. ‚Äî <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">–õ–∏–≤–∞–π</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">‚ò∫</a> 00:24, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<p><b>Delete</b> the article. Not notable enough for a whole article. Wikipedia is not a jokebook. However, this <b>was</b> a real category of joke that experienced a vogue circa, um, (counting on figures... age of kids... grade they were in when they came home with these kneeslappers...) the mid-1980s. Or maybe it's long been popular among fifth-graders. When I was in junior high school there was a fad for what were called "sick jokes" of this kind; I don't remember a Helen Keller subcategory but it probably evolved over time. I would love to think that all the delete votes are because these jokes <b>have</b> gone out of style and are no longer familiar. Do we have an article tracing the rise and fall of categories of jokes? We should, and this category should be mentioned. Do people still tell "elephant jokes?"

<li><b>Delete</b>. The formatting on this is definitely not wikipedia (I'm not sure it's worth trying ot fix). A lot of it is opinion, making this an essay. I'd say <i>merge</i> to Ritchie Blackmore (which could use the addition) if anyone is willing to do the work of reading this article. <a href="../../../r/j/f/User%7ERJFJR_0643.html" title="User:RJFJR">RJFJR</a> 01:34, Feb 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>Always ... always ... <b>always</b></i> check for copyright infringement first, before listing on VFD, <i>especially</i> if the article has at the bottom a hyperlink to the web site where the original article was published, as this one did.

<li>Thanks for finding that. To be fair, I had assumed copyright, but copying-and-pasting the text into Google still finds nothing. The epinions text must not be searched, or something. The link at the bottom of the page wasn't the page the review is directly from either. Anyway, should have looked harder. ‚Äî <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos">Talk</a> 17:55, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
