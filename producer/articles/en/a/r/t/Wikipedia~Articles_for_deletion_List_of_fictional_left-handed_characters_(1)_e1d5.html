<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. On raw numbers, this would just barely reach two-thirds. But later comments by T. Anthony show that he isn't sure it should be deleted himself, and being below that threshold and seeing nothing in the debate to justify lowering it (apart from the usual "keep, cleanup (but not me!) stuff) this is not a consensus. I don't know what Ichiro is thinking with his relisting. We don't hold AfDs open indefinitely until they reach a delete consensus. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 23:51, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's unusual for me to do this, but the verify tag has been up for a month and as far as I can tell it's still totally unverified.

<li><b>Delete</b>, apart from being original research and very hard if not impossible to verify for most entries, I'll go on a limb and say this is unmaintainable.

<li><b>Delete</b>. There would be a few (very few) characters where left- or right-handedness is significant (I'm thinking a couple of murder mysteries and the like), and a few cases where it's an enforced quality from the actor which portrays the character, but for the rest it's unimportant and in the case of animations likely to be due just as much to ease of drawing or a mirror image of an originally opposite-handed picture, and thus subject to change. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConMan_d21d.html" title="User:ConMan">Confusing Manifestation</a> 15:43, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

In fact I'm not even strongly arguing to delete this. I just don't see how it'll work as this is usually not important in fiction or entertainment. Or it's inconsistent with characters being left or right handed depending on whose drawing them, or in the case of live action what actor's playing them. The two Darrens on Bewitched were probably the same-handed, but there's likely been soaps where the character switched around on being played by a new actor.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<dd>But us AfD voters are not only a very small subset of Wikipedia, and we are almost always a small subset of the number of editors working on any particular article. Thus, if an article needs cleanup, we can slap a cleanup or expand tag on it, but perceived future non-cleaniliness should not be a reason to delete something. Articles can always be improved, but they only get deleted once. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 19:47, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I did slap on a "verify" tag a month ago. I also went to the talk page and told a defender of the list about this delete page so they could defend it. I'd made complaints on the article's talk page before coming here. I like lists, most of the time, and had some I worked on Afd'd without warning so I made sure to give warning.

<dd>Wikipedia being non-paper means we can do all kinds of things and I like lists. I'm just not sure every odd aspect of fictional characters is the best use of the ability to expand. Added to that I'm admittedly being a tad petty here. Grue voted to delete <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Catholic_authors_b10e.html" title="List of Catholic authors">List of Catholic authors</a>, although as unmaintainable not unencyclopedic, and did so on other lists I've enjoyed working at.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is mostly reposted from a comment I made on the discussion page for the article last month: I think it's useful because there is a certain stigma that comes with being left-handed. Although usually not verified by actual facts, left-handers are thought to be one or more of the following: more intelligent, off-the-wall or wacky, strange, more successful than right-handers, more creative, or more likely to be serial killers. Showing this list of characters shows how much these ideas can affect even popular media. Looking at the characters on this list, you can see that many of them fit into one or multiple of the categories mentioned. Others might not fit into those groups, but show that left-handed characters are not portrayed as being these things 100% of the time. Also, unlike what someone said above, half of the world is not left-handed, it's really about 10% (as a quick glance at <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-handed.html" title="Left-handed">left-handed</a> would have explained). It's also good to point out that most of these characters are listed here because of it being mentioned in the book/movie/game they're in that they are left-handed. Perhaps the page could use some explanation such as this at the top of it to describe the importance of the list. -<a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamblinMonkey_6201.html" title="User:GamblinMonkey">GamblinMonkey</a> 19:50, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b>. this list is fascinating. there are reasons why an author chooses to make the reader know a character is left-handed. very fascinating indeed. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 05:35, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>-I had kind of voted merge, but that'll just aid the effort toward no concensus. I prefer merge, but I guess I'll just come down firmly on the side of preferring delete to keep. It's all essentially trivia as it stands. If someone wants to do an article on Left-handed characters in fiction they can certainly do so, but until then it's just an accumulation of names without any evidence to support them.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.
