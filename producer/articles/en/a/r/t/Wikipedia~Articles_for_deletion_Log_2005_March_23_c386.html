<li><b>Keep</b>. I sympathize with Ganymead and Radiant and would prefer to vote delete on articles like this. But, unnfortunately, the precedent has been established that place-names are all encyclopedia topics. Rambot added tens of thousands of stubs for American place-names automatically. I think this was done without sufficient forethought, and might well be reconsidered, but consistency demands that it not be done on an article-by-article basis.

<dd><i>In 1974, the city dealt with a crisis when a federal district court judge, W. Arthur Garrity, ordered busing to integrate the city's public schools. Racially-motivated violence erupted in several neighborhoods -- many white parents resisted the busing plan. Public schools - particularly public high schools - became scenes of unrest and violence. Tension continued throughout the mid-1970s, reinforcing Boston's reputation for discrimination.</i> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheCustomOfLife_ae8d.html" title="User:TheCustomOfLife">Mike H</a> 09:04, Mar 25, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Further up you identify two supposed reasons for deletion&#160;: "No potential to become encyclopedic" and "vanity". I assume these are the two valid criteria you refer to. Re the first one: It already is encyclopedic, so that isn't a reason. Oh you mean you have a different definition of "encyclopedic" to me... well I don't think we are saying anything ground-breaking when we suggest that that deletion reason is more or less useless. "Vanity"... that makes no sense... vanity is a human trait... not something a school can possess.

"Encyclopedic" doesn't mean "it's in the encyclopaedia", otherwise every article here would be automatically so. In answer to your question, not only does it not add anything that we don't already have ("the school was opened, then it closed" - as if that's not here already), but contrary to your claim, it is <i>not</i> harmless. Every single article like this is a hit on Wikipedia, and its reputation as a serious source of information. People elsewhere might think "So, you've got nothing on the culture of third-world nation, but you've got two lines on some unimportant school in Florida?"

People have been using your line of reasoning "someone might come along ands say Wikipedia is bad because...." literally for <i>years</i>. But it simply <i>is not true</i>! People who write critically about Wikipedia <i>never</i> <i>ever</i> say it has too much on trivial topics. They never do it. (The complaint these days is always about credibility and sources, as you might expect). If you have any evidence to the contrary, I'd love to hear it.</dd>
<dd>P.s. Re "encyclopedic", you seem to misunderstand me. I already said in what you replying to that it depends what "encyclopedic" means... and then you go and tell me the same thing&#160;;-). <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 17:31, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Actually no I can't. The new edition of the <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">circumcision</a> article on this website is actually pretty good though. I am not getting a lot of support for this article so maybe I was in error to create it. Given the amount of debate over the neutrality of wikipedia circumcision articles, I really feel that there ought to be an article of some sort that deals with the fact that the subject is controversial and why. I don't know what an appropriate title would be but am open to suggestions.

<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was <b>keep</b>. This debate has been extremely contentious, just like the other debates about other high schools. The result is split down the middle, with some vehemently arguing for deletion, and others vehemently arguing for inclusion. There has been a lot of commenting on people's votes, and there have been claims of vote stuffing. Since this article has been on VfD for a very long time now, I will close it. Deletion requires a consensus, and there does not appear to be one. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 07:17, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>No grounds for deletion, other than being a pointless substub with negative potential of becoming encyclopaedic, and most likely vanity too. <b>Delete</b>. Look at it this way - if we include an article on this school, we <i>have</i> to include an article on every other school in the world, to be fair. Schools are so numerous, that if we embarked on such a drive, we'd easily hit the 2 milliojn article mark, but it would be at the expense of improving coverage of other areas. Think about it - someone hits "random page" repeatedly and gets nothing but pointless school substub after pointless school substub; are they going to take WP seriously as an information source? If you think that WP is an encyclopaedia of some value to someone, especially in areas where buying a full set of Britannica might be out of the question, vote <b>delete</b>. If you think WP should turn into some kind of a joke, a parody encyclopaedia with nothing but worthless substubs about the world and his wife, keep voting <b>keep</b> on crap like this. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> 21:20, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So every time we include an article of a certain type, that obliges us to embark upon a drive to include every other article of that type? We have articles on American towns with a population of less than 100, is there a drive to include every of settlement in the world? Wikipedia should aim to become a valuable encyclopedia, rather devoting itself to impressing "random page" users. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 05:07, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Suit yourself, but ultimately it's the "random page" users that are best placed to gauge the overall value of WP, by not looking for specific fields. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> 18:50, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Incredibly notable? No. Notable enough to make the cut on Wikipedia? yes. The analogy I would make is discovering a new species. Only a few ilving mammalogists have discovered a new species (and I mean really discovered one, not just argued that an existing species should be split into one or more). Many, if not most, entomologist shave described species. Is finding an astroid a bug or or a mammal?

<li><b>Keep and Cleanup</b> for the following reasons, which combine to make this a notable discussion:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The current Court has been intact and unchanged for a longer period than any Supreme Court in over a century;</li>
<li>Chief Justice Rehnquist has become an iconic figure, and will leave very big shoes to fill;</li>
<li>Throughout the history of the Court, there have only been 16 Chief Justices, so they do not come and go very often. This article should consider not only who may fill the vacant seat, but also who will become the next <i>Chief Justice</i> {Scalia? O'Connor? Thomas? Someone from off the Court?);</li>
<li>The process of appointing Justices has become particularly politicized since <a href="../../../r/o/e/Roe_v._Wade_9976.html" title="Roe v. Wade">Roe v. Wade</a>, which has lead to rampant speculation as to who may succeed Rehnquist dating back to the 2000 election campaign.</li>

<li>I disagree with your analogy. <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_2008_f751.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 2008">U.S. presidential election, 2008</a> will not be irrelevent when the position is filled, because we can still have an encyclopedic article on the subject of the election. However, once the next Supreme court justice is chosen, it will be will be useless to keep an article on the process that went into choosing that justice. Furthermore, speculating on an election, a huge event that follows a rigid process and schedule, is vastly different then speculation on the appointment of a justice, which could happen at any time and will happen according to the whim of the President. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">DaveTheRed</a> 04:38, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Speculation is well documented so the article can be kept. My main problem is with the title (see my comment above) and the article is hard to title because it is not clear when the appointment will be made, unlike the US presidential election which is virtually certain to take place in 2008 (I'm not up on US election procedures, could possibly happen earlier or later in extreme circumstances?). That said IMO this speculation is documented well enough to be included, just not under a seperate title hence my vote for <b>delete</b> this particular article and <b>merge</b> content to <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States_b835.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> -- <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochaber_a720.html" title="User:Lochaber">Lochaber</a> 11:50, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Seriously, though, I think the unusual intensity of coverage of this issue (based in no small part of the factors I listed above) marks a rare phenomenon worthy of its own article, <i>once we can agree on a title</i>. -- <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">8^D</a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="#FF5500">gab</font></sup></a> 12:14, 2005 Mar 24 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ok here's another idea. How about creating a new article called U.S. Supreme Court nomination, about how it's done and all (I know it's not really that complicated but there could be more detail about why confirmation isn't as easy as it sounds) with a section called maybe "Speculation on possible George W Bush nominations" or something. As a section the title can easily be changed / updated and new sections can be added when further speculation comes up in the future. -- <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochaber_a720.html" title="User:Lochaber">Lochaber</a> 13:21, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

It is true that more appointments to the Supreme Court will necessarily be made, but no one knows <i>when</i> this will be, or even <i>who</i> will be replaced, however likely Rehnquist is.

<p>A rather small and unimportant place somewhere in Australia, the only notable thing about the place is that an alleged politician called George Ober grew up there; however, Ober does not seem to be verifiable (<i>"George Ober" liberal</i> and <i>"George Ober" Australia</i> both turn up nothing relevant on Google). If the questionable paragraph about Ober is removed, we're left with a place that is some distance from Canberra and has four distinct seasons -- <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerkelparade_da80.html" title="User:Ferkelparade">Ferkelparade</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFerkelparade_2c87.html" title="User talk:Ferkelparade">π</a> 12:21, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Apart from the illformed sentence on the seasons and the dubious claim for one George Ober, what exactly is nonsensical about it? It's a genuine town, so deserves an article.

<li><b>Comment</b> if a person wanted to write about what was in the Confessio of St. Patrick it should go into Confessio of St. Patrick. How about, when someone wants to write about when confessios started being written, if they are still used, what their purpose is/was, how they have evolved, etc. they can start an article at that time.

<li>Current content is a mere dicdef and has been that way since this orphan article was created on 8 Jan 05. However, I can see a possibility that it might someday turn into a real article.

<li>I think this could be made into a decent encyclopedia article, but this usually doesn't happen without a nudge, and the best nudge is usually a VfD. If it's expanded by the end of the voting period then keep. If not, delete, but keep it as a redlink and see if that prompts anyone to create a full article.
