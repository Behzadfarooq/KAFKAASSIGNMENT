<li>I respectfully disagree with <a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a>. John Hughes surely knew this school when he was growing up and has used a number of schools in the area as locations for his films. The fact that he chose Niles North as a filming location shows that its atmosphere fits into a certain idealized type of midwestern "upper middle class" high school. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 05:24, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>You see - it was in the movie precisely because it was not notable - because it was just like every other midwestern "upper middle class" school out there. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, of course&#160;:). <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 05:39, 7 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I don't see, and I still think you are wrong. Information that a film was made at a location also belongs in the article for that location can make that location notable. The school was in the movie due to having a certain look -- being a quinessential example of such a school-- and being in a certain location. I doubt that Hughes sent out a team to look for this location, given where the school is he almost certainly was familiar with it from his personal life. Furthermore, assuming the information were added to the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Sixteen_Candles_5b12.html" title="Sixteen Candles">Sixteen Candles</a> page, wouldn't it be more elegant to mention the school and then link to an article with more information about it (location, info on architecture, etc.) than it would to put all of that in the Sixteen Candles article? That <i>is</i> what hyperlinks are for, after all. Especially since the article currently has no information about where any of the scenes were filmed. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 12:27, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The demands for "notablity" of schools (not a valid criteria for deletion of schools in the first place) by deletionists are getting increasingly baffling and incomprehensible. This school was used in a major motion picture, front page of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> and already has some listed notable alumni. The fact that this school has these clearly <b>notable</b> events in it's history just goes to demonstrate how pointless it is to argue "notability" with deletionists in the first place. This institution is inherently notable anyway - waiting for deletionists to subjectively call out the particular instances of notable events and then argue about them is just a waste of time; after all, we have so much to do voting to <b>keep</b> on other school articles!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>May I perhaps add my two cents about this matter? Although it is certainly trivial knowledge, adding that information just to the sixteen candles articles is a disservice. Consider the following situation. I'm researching, say, facts about schools in this school system. I may not have the wherewithal to search and look at all the hits, I may just look for articles on each of the schools. In this case, having the article serves a purpose. Sure, its not much of a purpose, but in the case of things like schools (who are not here trying to get hits or sales), as far as I'm concerned, any reason is a reason to keep. What's the harm?

<li>This is not consensus - in fact its obvious there is no consensus. Until both sides agree to do something with these terrible "articles" this debate will continue every day here. I already suggested making school district articles and moving it there instead, but the <i>keep all schools</i> side does not agree, so instead we have this - every day. At least on the keep side things have degenerated to cut n' pasted arguments - give me something about the particular article that makes it noteworthy, not a <i>keep all schools</i> argument please. Oh, and comments like "Nominating schools is a waste of everyone's time" is just going to make things worse. Something needs to be done here, and just deleting everything or keeping everything is not the answer. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 13:29, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>What is obvious is that 85%-90% of school articles nominated to VfD/AfD this year are not deleted. 85% not deleted over the course of a year sure sounds like a concensus to me. It may not be a concensus to keep or a concensus to delete, but it is a concensus about something. As though the arguments to delete from the deletionist side aren't every bit as tired, facile and formulaic as you are suggesting the keep arguments are. Case in point, <b>this very article</b> is nominated with the oh-so-impressive and intellectually rigourous comment: "NN, D." by none other than a deletionist usual suspect.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 18:27, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
