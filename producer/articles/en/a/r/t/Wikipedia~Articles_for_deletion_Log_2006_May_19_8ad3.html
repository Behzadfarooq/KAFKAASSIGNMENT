<li><b>Comment</b>. Google is not a substitute for library work. However, thanks for quoting Friedman's book, I was looking for the publication date for others reasons! In any cases, although Friedman may have anecdotically used it, "economic totalitarianism" is not a concept used neither by political scientists nor by economists. As User: Ewlyahoocom points out, it is quite comparable to making an article on <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Greenspan_c1c0.html" title="Alan Greenspan">Alan Greenspan</a>'s "irrational exuberance", without the "memorability". If you do some library work on the (political) concept of <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarianism.html" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a>, you will see that "economic totalitarianism" is necessarily an <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxymoron.html" title="Oxymoron">oxymoron</a>: totalitarianism relates to the state's control on every single part of human culture and society, including of course individuals' psychic lives. "Economic totalitarianism", as used by Friedman, is simply a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polemic.html" title="Polemic">polemic</a> word to argue against <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planned_economy.html" title="Planned economy">planned economy</a> and the Soviet Union (which is fair game, but is far from being the same of defining it as a political concept). <a href="../../../t/a/z/User%7ETazmaniacs_ae79.html" title="User:Tazmaniacs">Tazmaniacs</a> 20:01, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>If a merge is proposed, it should certainly not be done with "corporate fascism" (which redirects to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporatism.html" title="Corporatism">corporatism</a>) but to <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarianism.html" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a>&#160;! (Interestingly enough, this proposition to merge it with "fascism" would lead to the exact opposite use of the term that Friedman had reserved for it, that it is an anticommunist term!) <a href="../../../t/a/z/User%7ETazmaniacs_ae79.html" title="User:Tazmaniacs">Tazmaniacs</a> 20:02, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As noted by others above, this delete request is part of a rampage to delete Jewish-related articles. If it is a stub, then expand it. Perhaps there could also be a merge with other pages on Jewish summer camps into a general article on Jewish summer camps and how they are different from "run-of-the-mill" US summer camps (i.e., their role in ethnic identify of Jews, history re: Jews being not welcome and/or proselytized by Christians in other summer camps, use of Hebrew and Yiddish languages at these camps, etc.) But simply deleting all Jewish summer camps as "not notable" smacks of a hidden agenda against Jews. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERooster613_e82f.html" title="User:Rooster613">Rooster613</a> 23:49, 21 May 2006 (UTC)Rooster613<a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERooster613_e82f.html" title="User:Rooster613">Rooster613</a> 23:49, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think any of those are grounds for deletion, unless it's actually <i>impossible</i> to verify its existence. I see instead a notability problem, considering how this is about a single synagogue that doesn't even exist any longer. It could make a case, however, judging from the general claim that "the synagogue became a center for cantorial music, and many of the greatest cantors of the 20th century performed there." If that can be verified and made into more of a concrete factual statement rather than mere puffery, it might pass the test. A building that survived from 1857 until 2006 may also be notable, even if not so as a congregation in and of itself.

<li><b>Keep, but Move</b>. It actually does Google; you just have to search "First Romanian-American congregation" rather than "First American-Romanian congregation" <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=6UV&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial_s&amp;q=%22First+Romanian-American+congregation%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=6UV&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial_s&amp;q=%22First+Romanian-American+congregation%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Also note that the nickname mentioned in the article ("The Cantor's Carnegie Hall") Googles, with results including news media, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial_s&amp;q=%22The+Cantor%27s+Carnegie+Hall%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial_s&amp;q=%22The+Cantor%27s+Carnegie+Hall%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, and the results appear to be relevant to this place. This is one where I would prefer to err on the side of overcaution and keep just based on how long it was in existance for.

<p>I suspect substantially similar articles could be written about any country or organization (e.g. U.S.-bashing, Thailand-bashing, U.N.-bashing, Boy Scouts-bashing, Baby-bashing etc.) As it stands, the article lacks sources and seems un-encyclopedic ("...is a favorite pastime of naysayers, and doomsday predictors").

These Italian/Croatian noble families ought to be verifiable in Austro-Hungarian printed sources or other references covering Central European nobility, as well as possibly Italian biographical reference works. There is no reason to assume that they are "unverifiable" until these works have actually been checked. We clearly have a problem in this case with systemic bias in both the most easily available, googlable sources and in some of the databases I have access to, but there are enough indications that these are real historical people of some importance in their own time and place.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>lazy close</b>. While discussing the possibility of a merge after an article has already been brought to AfD is quote appropriate, articles should not be nominated on AfD if the nominator only wants a merge.

<p>This article originally had a db-bio speedy tag attached; I placed a hangon tag and attempted to assert notability. I think I've succeeded, but would like the community to judge. My vote is <b><s>Keep</s> Merge with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisystem.html" title="Antisystem">Antisystem</a></b>. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Colon</a><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_Esperanza_bb00.html" title="User:Col tom/Esperanza"><font color="green">el</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Tom</a> 03:20, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

In particular -- "Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable)." Now, I am no expert in punk labels. Pax Records or Reconcile could very well be notable, but I can't find much on them, either on the web in general or on Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrixman_d51f.html" title="User:Irixman">Irixman</a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrixman_fd51.html" title="User talk:Irixman">(t)</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Irixman_abb2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Irixman">(m)</a></sup> 03:33, 19 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I couldn't find enough to convince me that the labels above match notability either - I am undecided re this section of wp:band. My keep is more based on the one essay I found suggesting that the author believes thay were a notable 'Crust' band. I'm not sure that others would agree that this constitutes notability, so here we are... If this is kept, a <i>merge</i> would seem to be appropriate with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisystem.html" title="Antisystem">Antisystem</a> - I've changed my suggestion above.

<li><b>Comment</b> After some consideration, I am withdrawing my weak delete and just leaving my comment. <b>Merge</b> would definately be needed.

<li><b>Keep</b> I created the article after creating an all-time roster page for the St. Louis Cardinals. Not surprisingly, many of the links pointed to the wrong people, so I started going through and fixing that by creating stubs for such players. The plan was to eventually go back through and upgrade those stubs, but even so, I can't see why the stub should be deleted. It's not harming anyone by sitting there. That said, the idea of creating a one game players or small service time players list seems reasonable. But again, there seems to be no reason to delete- it's not as if we need the space or the page available for something more notable or more useful. --Sharur 23:34, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> This entry isn't just about a 'forum'. It's probably the most visited site in the actuarial profession and it's used as a resource not just a chat room. The unique history of the site also makes this entry noteworthy in the annals of the actuarial profession. Suggesting it's a forum with an alexa rank disregards the importance of this site and the information contained within it, particularly to the profession. There's a case could be made that this site is the realization of the actuarial profession. The site itself also holds quite a bit of symbolism within the profession, just like the iron ring does. -glenn</li>

<p>- besides, alexa rank doesn't hold much water in this community. These folks don't have toolbars installed, it's severly misrepresented with that.

If it is dynamic, it is becuase of the chat rooms, things like palindrome post count, what's the first thing that pops into your,.... I agree that the spin off site is not significant for it's own entry, but it is noteworthy to be included in the other entry, one voice, be it Patty Sheehan can be deemed significant (source unavailable). The poster glenn above also has a personal vendetta against the spin off site, he was posting IP addresses, employer information and other information in an attempt to intimidate users of the spin off forum. I would have been fine with a neutral intervention that was a compromise, but it is clear that Avarum and his sock puppets want the entry to be nothing more than an advertisement for the owner of the domain name, an actuarial recruiting firm.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Notability has to be evaluated in context. The actuarial profession is a relatively small one and so should not be expected to achieve the same numerical results as Britney Spears. An Alexa return of 77,439 is extremely impressive in this respect.

<dd>I think even most actuaries will agree that 77K is less than 100k. What context makes something notable? Is it the largest discussion forum for "actuaries" who aren't yet actuaries and may never become actuaries, who are still taking exams, who are under 30 years old and favor liberal politics, and is supported by a recruiting company and a non-actuary in Canada? I guess if you put enough constraints on notability you can make anything notable. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Smythe%2C_AAAA%2C_MAAAA_b63e.html" title="User:Joe Smythe, AAAA, MAAAA">Joe Smythe, AAAA, MAAAA</a> 18:57, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Comment – With Alexa ranks, a smaller number is better. The site ranked at 1 is the most visited site on the Internet (by users with Alexa toolbars).

<dd>Comment – Many, if not close to 50%, of the users of the Actuarial Outpost are credentialed actuaries. It is incorrect for anyone to say that it is "only" mostly aspiring actuaries, as that is false. It includes thousands of credentialed actuaries notable in their field. – <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheActuary_5432.html" title="User:TheActuary">TheActuary</a> 20 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oops my BS meter just went off again. I can claim 5% credentialed actuaries at your site and you can claim 50% because there is no source. In fact if you are the site promoter (former webmaster - glenn cooke whose blog is trashing me right now and calling for my employer to take action against me) then I can easily check the Soa.org directory of membership and see that even you are not a credentialled actuary. There is NO mechanism in your sign up to check if someone is credentialed, much less if they were signing up for multiple id's in the past (until the change to non-public email requirement). Given that much of your activity (as far as diverse posters - not the 10 who regularily post to the reef or political) is in the exam section - it is fair to say that those taking exams are for the most part non-credentialed and once they stop taking exams they rarely return (although your member list is rarely if ever purged of members who posted). Bottom line, you make outrageous claims with no data.<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Smythe%2C_AAAA%2C_MAAAA_b63e.html" title="User:Joe Smythe, AAAA, MAAAA">Joe Smythe, AAAA, MAAAA</a> 01:55, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>COMMENT:</b> Against my better judgement, I've decided to post my thoughts on the whole situation. When I first encountered the article {via a post on <a href="../../../r/f/i/WP%7ERFI_2cc3.html" title="WP:RFI">WP:RFI</a>), I came across a POV article engaged in a minor content dispute. However, as time progressed (and I attempted to informally mediate), the dispute became more profound. An edit war has insued, reversions are nonstop, and I'm pretty sure the two primary contributors (Avi and Joe Smythe) have both violated the 3RR. But I digress. This article is obviously an outlet for the two of them (and their groupies/sockpuppets) to fight over some internal dispute on their website. The talk page has become very uncivil, and personal attacks are flying from <b>BOTH</b> sides. Now, I won't give my opinions on whether the article should be kept or deleted (I can justify both viewpoints in my head), but I just thought I'd throw some general commentary about these two users into this debate for consideration by others and the closing sysop. At this point, I'm washing my hands of this article and my involvement in it. <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">^</span><a href="../../../%5E/d/e/User%7E%5Edemon.html" title="User:^demon"><span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;">demon</span></a><sup><span style="font-size:10px"><a href="../../../%5E/d/e/User_talk%7E%5Edemon.html" title="User talk:^demon"><span style="color:red">[yell at me]</span></a></span></sup>&#160;/<em style="font-size:10px;">12:55, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</em></li>

<dd>I am sorry you feel that way, demon. However, I would suggest you check both the article history and IP logs (if you have access) and you will see that nowhere have I reverted anything three times within 24 hours to my knowledge. As for the incivility, yes, I must admit I have been pushed to being somewhat less than absolutely proper, and that may be a personal failing for having a somewhat emotional attachement to an article I spent many hours on; I hope you can understand that human emotion. As for the person(s) who persist on trying to glorify a complete non-issue, all I can say is that if you have spent the months, let alone years, that I have as part of the community in question, your patience with some of their shenanigans would have run thin as well, I believe. Once again, I truly thank you for your efforts to both mediate and help out, and I hope it doesn't sour you from contributing to Wikipedia in that way in the future. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 13:39, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Although I am not quite sure they are talking about the same one. anyway yea, if i was intending to create a hoax, i think i could have made something a bit more humorous than something like this. my best friend is really sick and in the hospital now because of it, and i thought people should be aware of the threat that is being posed here.ShadowOfAGirl 04:43, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

I have done a lot of work on (and written some of) these articles to make them not cruft. Those who are new to the game, and even veteran players, can learn things about the maps from these articles (I know I did!). Also, Counter-Strike is so popular that people who have never played the game might encounter references to these maps on the Internet, whether through forum postings, flash videos, etc. Additionally, cruft alone is not enough to delete an article - from <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">Wikipedia:Fancruft</a>: "[Things labeled as fancruft are usually deleted] due to the fact that [they] are often poorly written, unreferenced, unwikified, and non-neutral - all things that lead to deletion."

<li>Although you are correct that they are not referenced (and I mistakenly said they were), they are not original research according to the page you provided. These articles do not fall into the category of original research based on the "<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html#What_is_original_research" title="WP:OR">What is original research</a>" section of the page. A line from it which particularly defends my position is: "An edit counts as original research if it <b>proposes</b> ideas or arguments." These articles propose no ideas or arguments. The information is taken mostly from primary sources. As this is the case, and since they should have had references added long ago (my own fault), I will add sources to the articles. -<a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVarco_d844.html" title="User:Varco">Varco</a> 05:43, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> into <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-Strike_maps_845e.html" title="Counter-Strike maps">Counter-Strike maps</a> or <b>keep</b>, my preferences in that order. I don't see a lot of expansion for any of these articles, and they are all somewhat short. Even a merge into Counter-Strike hostage rescue maps, Counter-Strike assassination maps, etc. would make the articles much better. Also, a lot of the articles are inflated by weasel words, e.g. "the map is often criticized ..." criticized by who, exactly? (Of course, that can be fixed, not deleted.) Sources would be appreciated, but the articles seem over-inflated.</li>
<li>One final note: I would appreciate some clarification as to the copyright status of the images. The screenshots -- are they fair use screenshots or not? If they are, I think we have a few too many for each page. (Actually, I believe we have a few too images on all of the pages.) Oh, and as for the maps -- it would be very nice if we could have free images of those instead.

Counter-Strike's preminence as a staple of internet gaming needs to be documented, and the popularity of the game is directly related to the player's experience of individual maps. Oh, and of course the 'weasel' words are subjective, as there is no offical body commenting on Counter-Strike, it is left to bloggers, fanboys and the like.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I personally think these are more notable than the starcraft related articles on Wikipedia. Just flicking through the server browser now, and there are over 10000 servers running either de_dust or de_dust2 with similar player numbers, in the thousands 24/7. I do not support a merge because the various merge targets are already overfilling, and I definitely think that showing the progression of long standing maps from conception to <a href="../../../s/o/u/Source_engine.html" title="Source engine">source engine</a> is interesting and encyclopedic. For example, there is an article on Surfing (Counter-Strike) which collates all the surf map details onto a single page, note that currently on counter-strike there are only 237 servers running any sort of surf map compared to the thousands for every official map. It may be worthwhile creating an article for hostage rescue maps, one for defusion maps and then merging. Some maps, I believe are not exactly that notable and are possibly merge or deletion targets, de_survivor maybe, as_oilrig into an assassination maps article maybe. I'd also like people to consider this, although not very vocal on Wikipedia, the counter-strike community is very large, at this very second, there are over 200,000 players actually IN GAME according to the stats at <a href="http://steampowered.com/status/game_stats.html" class="external text" title="http://steampowered.com/status/game_stats.html" rel="nofollow">Steam</a>. I guess that the counter-strike community and the number of people who would find articles on de_dust and cs_militia interesting and worthy of an encyclopedia greatly outnumber those who find specific webforums or webcomic characters to be notable, yet due to their lack of presence on Wikipedia, their voices are not as well heard. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 18:51, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> despite the fact that there are many CS players, we have to ask ourselves the most important question. Is it a content appropriate for an encyclopedia? The game itself certainly is. Separate maps certainly aren't. It is ok to mention them in the central article, or even a separate one, but certainly not each one in its article. If someone wants to know details of the map, he/she should look at the official website. Not here. --<b><a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETone_f843.html" title="User:Tone">Ton</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETone_Esperanza_c538.html" title="User:Tone/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a></b> 19:27, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The official site has very little information about map details.

(Note that I am not saying that those should be deleted; Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia, those articles, as well as the ones in question, are harming nothing.) The fan-base is not small enough to be considered cruft (part of the definition on <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">Wikipedia:Fancruft</a> is that it is only of importance to a small group of enthusiastic fans...

<li><b>Comment</b> - I can understand why you would call for a merge. I remember a while back there was a sort of Blood Gulch precedent as set by the Halo map. Whereas static unchanging maps such as Blood Gulch are served perfectly well with the Multiplayer in Halo: Combat Evolved article, I do not believe this would be the same for Counter-Strike maps. Not only are they vastly more popular, but with counter-strike's iterative release and development, they also have significant version changes, remakes and retextures, which I believe would be lost in a merge due to article size. I believe that there are currently more players on de_nuke alone, than there are readers of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concerned.html" title="Concerned">Concerned</a> or people interested in <a href="../../../s/k/_/SK_Gaming_8f02.html" title="SK Gaming">SK Gaming</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia 1) is electronic, and 2) promotes the "open source"/"share and share alike" mentality. Both of these elements are characteristic of a new age in a world where the definition of "encyclopedic" is changing to encompass more than what was in your grandfather's bookshelf encyclopedia set.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, or alternately merge into "Counterstrike Hostage Maps," "Counterstrike Assassination Maps," etc. as suggested further above. These articles are useful and interesting to the literally hundreds of thousands of counterstrike players. I know that I have looked at them in the past myself. I liked the comment above, these indeed may be very geeky articles... but it's geeks that get the most mileage out of Wikipedia! Stop being elitist and accept the fact that Wikipedia is a repository for MUCH esoteric knowledge that would probably not make it into a print encylopedia. This may fit the original mission statements or what whiny, power-hungry deletionists believe in, but it's what the site has evolved into. This is _not_ a bad thing. Wikipedia has much well-written information on extremely specialized, non-mainstream topics, which is part of what makes it such a valuable resource. The reason this is a "Strong Keep" instead of just a "keep" is because I believe deleting this article would be only be serving to strengthen the bias of certain wikipedia editors.

<li><b>Comment</b> Show me where in Wikipedia policy fancruft is labeled as a valid policy for deletion. Fancruft is too subjective of a term to be a sole reason for deletion. I noticed that you edit articles relating to military naval vessels... in your world, those should be deleted as fancruft because they're only of real interest to those interested in military history. Almost everything in Wikipedia can be considered fancruft to someone else. In regards to these articles, even if they were only of interest to fans, there are 19.5 million legal owners of Counter-Strike. I think that's large enough population to not be considered cruft. It's not up to you to decide what's interesting to lots of other people. --<a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVarco_d844.html" title="User:Varco">Varco</a> 06:02, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> – or merge, but preferably delete. Individual maps for a game, no matter how popular the game, do not merit encyclopediaic articles. Especially not ones with such stupid names – <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_e84c.html" title="User:Gurch">Gurch</a> 13:26, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>The articles <i>are</i> badly named, in my opinion. I don't think many people would search on those names. To use another example, say I was going to make an article on the Call of Duty 2 map "Moscow, Russia". While that map has a technical name similar to these (like cd_trainyard or something) it would be better and more encyclopedic to name the article Moscow, Russia (Call of Duty 2 map) because that's what would allow someone to find it. If <i>I</i> were the one who wanted these articles kept, I would be putting my energy into making them the best they can be and possibly changing some minds. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 21:04, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>They're absolutely <i>not</i> badly named. Whereas players do refer to the maps as Italy or Dust, they just as much refer to them as cs_italy or de_dust. Do a search for Dust Counter-strike on google, and you'll see that most of the results come back with de_dust in them. Even in articles about counter-strike and strategy guides, they'll most probably mention the map prefix. And counter-strike players will have been used to filtering the maps by name as well as their name in the server browser. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 21:20, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> Come on, it is non-encypledic. Very detailed information for fans of a particular game. To the "keepers": do you think such information would make it to a paper encyclopedia?

<li><b>Comment</b> - My keep vote above is based on the enormous size of the CS-community. The difference between the CS Community, and those of the Macromedia Flash community, webcomic community or podcasting (god damn I hate that word) community, is not one of size, but one of representation on Wikipedia. For example, de_nuke has had more critical commentary, guides written about it, CPL level competitions played on it, and probably has tens of thousands of people playing it right now and 24/7. Compare this to an article I voted to delete, Joseph Blanchette, a Flash animator on Newgrounds who will never have the amount of fans or commentary that a single official CS map will have, or any piece of tripe from <a href="../../../w/e/b/Category%7EWebcomics_03f4.html" title="Category:Webcomics">Category:Webcomics</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> My main objection to those maps and other sorts of over-detailed gamer stuff is, that they are not respecting wikipedia as an encyclopedia readable and accessible to all people with all sorts of interest. I see that way back, August 2005, a cleanup was recommended, but these map articles are still very poorly structured and using a lot of insider gamer-understood phrases. It sort of says: "If you don't understand what this is about and how important it is, well, leave us alone". Those who advocate keeping those maps, should make efforts turning them from fancruft to decent articles. 130.225.184.24

<li><b>Merge</b> — Individual pages for maps of a particular computer game? It completely devalues Wikipedia's <a href="../../../s/t/a/Special%7EStatistics_969e.html" title="Special:Statistics">article count</a>. OK, if it's a really popular game then it is justifiable to make an article specifically about the maps. But an article for <i>each map</i>, especially if they use esoteric jargon, is not suitable for any wiki other than one about the game in question. I don't object to this information (on specific maps) being in Wikipedia, but it shouldn't be fragmented like this. Callum85 13:39, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - If people would come down from their latin-using high horses for a minute and think about these statistics, pulled FROM THE WIKIPEDIA Counter-strike article: 20,000,000 (twenty million) people own Counter-strike. At peak, there were 30,000 (thirty THOUSAND) counter-strike servers operating, more than THREE TIMES the 2nd place game (UT with less than 10,000). In 2006, Valve's online distribution system, steam, reports that there are 200,000 Counter-strike players, accounting for 70% (SEVENTY PERCENT) of the online first-person-shooter audience. World-wide, people spend a total of 75,000,000 hours EACH MONTH playing counterstrike.<br />
If someone can tell me how a short list of 15 or 20 articles relating to a game that 200,000 people play currently, and 20,000,000 people own, and accounts for 70% of FPS playing, is *NON NOTABLE*, I'd be happy. Especially when compared to a list of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_National_Pok%C3%A9dex_number_f32d.html" title="List of Pokémon by National Pokédex number">400 pokemon characters</a>. Fancruft would imply only a few dedicated fans - I would say this falls in the category of "not fancruft". de_dust is the most played FPS map in the history of online gaming - how would it not deserve an article?

<p>From the Wiki on Vanity pages: "Does lack of fame make a vanity article?</p>
<p>An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous. There is currently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia (although consensus exists regarding particular kinds of article, for instance see Template:IncGuide). Borderline cases are frequently nominated for deletion and discussed on WP:AFD. Lack of fame is not the same as vanity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an article is not "vanity" simply because it was written by its subject; indeed, it can also be vanity if written by a fan, or close relationship. Articles about existing books, movies, games, and businesses can be "vanity" depending on the amount of recognition - e.g. a homemade movie or game, a self-published book, or a fanfic story is not generally considered encyclopedic. In general, the content is kept to salient material and not overtly promotional.</p>
<p>The key rule is to not write about yourself, nor about the things you've done or created. If they are encyclopedic, somebody else will notice them and write an article about them." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.191.156.108 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.191.156.108_209b.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.191.156.108">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>Maybe delete quotes from personal webpage, but the Buzz Out Loud Podcast is a popular one for tech fans. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Adkinsjm (<a href="../../../a/d/k/User_talk%7EAdkinsjm_4657.html" title="User talk:Adkinsjm">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adkinsjm_ecae.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adkinsjm">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>Seems to me that while Veronica Belmont probably merits inclusion in Wikipedia - after all, Buzz Out Loud is a popular podcast and its presenters accordingly well regarded - the article itself isn't strong. It's disjointed and interspersed with rather trite comments. It just needs more depth, more detail, and fewer flippant observations. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 80.177.135.98 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.177.135.98_7b41.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.177.135.98">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>I think that this article going up for deletion has increased its value greatly. It has been changed from a vanity article, but I stand by my opinion that the previous iteration was much more like a vanity page. I think that we should now remove its deletion tag. If there are any objections to that discuss below, and if not I will remove the tag after 02:00 UTC. P.S. I'm a 4 month BOL fan myself and was just trying to adhere to what in my opinion was wikipedia policy. --Bolfan 13:51, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I understand you wanted to adhere to wiki policy, but the deletion page is <b>supposed</b> to be used for articles that obviously have generated very little or no interest from the community as a whole. This is especially true if the article is very short and contains unverifiable data. What I disagree with what you had done is that instead of going in and changing the article itself to make it less vanity and more content, you simply opted to have it deleted. That isn't very responsible in my opinion. It took me less than an hour total to revise the page to a hopefully better version. Next time please, be careful with how you use some of these special wiki tags. They are not usually reversable once issued. --<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeStar_2a7c.html" title="User:LifeStar">LifeStar</a> 19:01, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Google is a long way from being a comprehensive reference source on anything, and is of almost no use at all in determining the "notability" of historic subjects recorded largely in paper documents (ie anything before the 1990s) - although I know how difficult it is for most people under the age of 30 to come to grips with such a crazy notion. <a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELentisco_93c7.html" title="User:Lentisco">Lentisco</a> 06:09, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think the notability argument is missing an important point, which is the inclusion of valid historical information. A person does not in themselves have to have any outstanding characteristics to make them worth including, if they are relevant to something which is worth including. This provides context which is necessary to understanding the full picture of an event or time. The "notability" argument is based on the values of contemporary celebrity culture, not in depth research.<a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 09:14, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article was written originally by one user Jfkelley. He hasn't made tons of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jfkelley_d149.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jfkelley">other contributions</a> since. The text basically refers to one John F. Kelley's dissertation in 1980, and its only sources are from it. While "no original research" can and should be loosened up a bit in the cases where your research was actually published, nobody else seems to know anything about this particular project to write it up to proper encylopedic style while not subverting the intent of the author. As it stands, the article just isn't encylopedic.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Suggest to Mr. Kelley that he write up the current article at his own website, then include said website as an external link in the article that someone else suggested merging it to, <a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizard_Of_Oz_%28experiment%29_d7a2.html" title="Wizard Of Oz (experiment)">Wizard_Of_Oz_(experiment)</a>. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 21:08, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Abstain</b> (As the author, I didn't think a vote was appropriate). My purpose in writing the article to define the "alleged methodology" (cute) is that I know (from reprint requests, among other things) that the methdology, as named, is in wide usage globally by psychologists and user-computer interface designers. I have often been asked about the origins of it. I did not take the time to add subsequent references and implementations. I will do so, and, perhaps provide further grist for this interesting debate. P.S. It wasn't my intention to violate any protocols for WP; I thought that the topic, by virtue of the publication in peer-reviewed journals and the wide-spread adoption of the methodology, it warranted encyclopedic coverage. And, vanity considerations notwithstanding, who better to document it than the guy who invented it? In any event, I'd like to ask for a <b>Hold</b> while I attempt to make these enhancements.

<li><b>Comment</b> As the person who originally submitted the request, I'd have no problem putting the issue on hold. That said, have you considered the merge then delete option? To put it another way, the concepts between the (experiment) article and the (methodology) article are basically the same, right? I can't entirely be sure, but if that seems reasonable, then might I recommend doing that? I'll also add that adding references isn't the only thing needed. While short, the (experiment) article is simply written and "gets to the point." Now, more detail is great, especially from a person who helped originally research it, but the article isn't entirely clear with what the extra detail <i>means</i>. What were the other systems of the day like? Why did having a human experimenter make it easier to do the keyword recognition for vocabulary-building? What were later experiments able to do other than calendar/date syntaxes? I guess I should probably go read the original linked research to find out, but it seems like there's some work to be done on the article as well. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 20:00, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Response</b> I like the idea of a merge. I'm embarrassed that my newbie search failed to pick up on the Experiment article when I wrote this one. I'd just go ahead and do it now, but I'm afraid of another blunder, so I propose to study the instructions on the merge instruction page and get everything right (for one thing, I'll have to find examples of the referring link that they speak about). I will also try to explain what the extra data means (I'll start by addressing your specific questions). I will try to do so concisely and in "encyclopedic" fashion. Thank you all for taking the time to contribute your feedback. WP is an amazing resource! Jfkelley 20:29, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Follow-up Response</b> Ok, I think I did the merge correctly. I merged this article with the prior one <a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizard_Of_Oz_%28experiment%29_d7a2.html" title="Wizard Of Oz (experiment)">Wizard Of Oz (experiment)</a> and left a referring link in the redundant article <a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizard_of_OZ_Methodology_e572.html" title="Wizard of OZ Methodology">Wizard of OZ Methodology</a>.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. Merge makes most sense, and appears the most popular view, but, as TheMadBaron says, the information already exists in a much better form within the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> article. A quick note, if you will, on "merge and delete": it <i>is</i> possible to merge and delete, since we have things like history merges and the like. However, these things are bloody difficult, and not one user has given a good reason for it to be done. If the article wasn't a straight-out delete, no admin in their right mind would merge then delete the resultant redirect just for the heck of it. Please be a bit more sensible. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 06:37, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Please note that despite Stifle's comment above, <i>merge and delete</i> really isn't a valid vote for AfD. That being said, is there any harm in a merge and redirect? Will Wikipedia be harmed if this article were to redirect to <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a>?

<li><b>Delete</b> First, <i>merge and delete</i> is permissible, inasmuch as there are other ways to retain contribution history; nevertheless, we look with disfavor on <i>merge and delete</i> because, FWIK, the requisite work is arduous, and because redirects such as this aren't really harmful. Second, I agree with Stifle that the list is such that, were the text even slightly reworked in a merge, no attribution would be required. On the whole, though, this information already exists in the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> article, and I can see no reason for which we ought to have a separate page enumerating the universities at which one studied/taught. While the information is notable as part of a biographical article (or even an article apropos of the education of an individual, where such education is of particular importance to the subject overall [as, for example, in <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_James_Sidis_693f.html" title="William James Sidis">William James Sidis</a>]), where it exists solely as a list, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is certainly dispositive; a redirect, further, is wholly unnecessary--as Tyrenius says, it is exceedingly unlikely that one would ever search for this phrase. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 17:49, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The fictional metal inertron was first used in 1928 by <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Francis_Nowlan_3a19.html" title="Philip Francis Nowlan">Philip Francis Nowlan</a> in his <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buck_Rogers_0fd2.html" title="Buck Rogers">Buck Rogers</a> stories. These stories are an important part of science fiction and cultural history. They helped popularize the genre and essentially had the same cultural impact in the early 1900s that Star Trek had in the late 1900s. In essence inertron was the <a href="../../../d/i/l/Dilithium.html" title="Dilithium">Dilithium</a> of early 20th century science fiction. As such it's clearly notable from a historical literature standpoint, even if younger generations are unfamiliar with it.</dd>

<dd>There are dozens of Wikipedia articles on <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_elements%2C_isotopes_and_atomic_particles.html" title="Fictional elements, isotopes and atomic particles">fictional substances</a>. Most have less impact on literature, history and culture than inertron. Deleting inertron is pulling a string that's attached to a large ball.

<li><b>Comment</b> If Wikipedia adopted a Limbo namespace, this article could be moved to Limbo during the discussion on deletion. Moving an article to Limbo would remove it from the article namespace and prevent search engines from delivering suspicious content while the community decides whether to keep or delete it.

<dd>Well I did read it and I'm not the only one who was confused by what you were trying to do. I imagine that the result of this will either be delete or move to template space (is that possible directly or would it reuqire an admin anyway?). Even if it is delted then there's no reason why it can't be recreated as a template.

<li><b>Move to template space</b>, unlikely to be a search term because of its length, and hence not useful as a redirect. If Marianocecowski had read further down the same talk page he links to, Oldelpaso says, "this sounds like an overlap between article space and template space, which I'd have reservations about. Can this not be solved by using templates?" Marianocecowski probably doesn't know about the template namespace yet, where information to be included in multiple articles can be put in.

<p>This suffers from the same faults as the recently-deleted <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_7_7_Truth_Movement_0fd2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/7/7 Truth Movement">7/7 Truth Movement</a>, which is to say that there does not seem to be any evidence that this movement actually exists. (As one user says on the talk page, " Every time I stumble across this article, I'm confused about just what exactly is the "Movement"?") The article cites numerous books by various authors, speeches by various politicians, studies by various academics, protests by various groups, and even famous individuals such as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Sheen_87eb.html" title="Charlie Sheen">Charlie Sheen</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Flynt_1649.html" title="Larry Flynt">Larry Flynt</a>. What it does not cite is any evidence that these people belong to any common organisation, or even that they are in sympathy with each other. This article appears to be very carefully written, constructed to give the impression of impartiality, while in its very existence it promulgates the idea of a single "movement". As such, it violates Wikipedia guidelines on original research and opinion. The most notable groups and individuals questioning the official 9/11 narrative are listed at the category "Alternative theories of September 11, 2001 attacks". In making this nomination, I am explicitly not questioning the validity of questioning the American government's description of the events surrounding 9/11, but I am urging the community to <b>delete</b> this specific misleading article. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 10:46, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Either keep or merge it with the article "Alternative theories of September 11, 2001 attacks" (maybe as a re-direct) but <b>Do Not</b> delete it. If it is merged or re-directed, then all of this information should be in the "Alternative theories" entry (maybe a sub-section of that page can be called "9/11 Truth Movement" and all of this information can be copied accross.).

<li><b>Comment</b>. For me, the sole real requirement of a movement is that it is moving in a definable direction. According to this article, half of the 9/11 Truth Movement believes there were no terrorists, half believe there were but the government helped them. Half are communists, half are right-wingers. Half want a Congressional enquiry, half want a revolution... you get the picture. I don't think this is a question of notability, just existence. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 20:43, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Movements can have fairly diverse beliefs and goals. The Civil rights movement encompassed MLK and Malcolm X. The <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro-life_movement.html" title="Pro-life movement">Pro-life movement</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-abortion_movement.html" title="Anti-abortion movement">Anti-abortion movement</a> encompasses people opposed to ending all life (fetus or adult) and those who would bomb abortion clinics. I can't really speak for the 9/11 truth movement, but the unifying belief seems to be a desire for more information about 9/11 than is currently available, not conspiracy theories about what happened (although that defines a segment of the movement). I think it's reasonable to expect that sources other than WP refer to it as a movement. If not, that may mean the article should be retitled and/or refocused, not necessarily deleted, although that could be an option. An Amazon.com search brings up <i>9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made in USA</i> <i>Inside Job: Unmasking the 9/11 Conspiracies</i> and <i>9/11 Revealed&#160;: The Unanswered Questions</i> using the phrase, though these would all seem to be ones written from advocates for it.

This means that Wikipedia is the 6th most popular place to check it out, and that people rely heavily on the entry. Please also note that the 9/11 Truth Movement has formally organized groups of people from various countries, walks of life, and especially, those who were directly impacted, including families. There is also a veteran's 9/11 truth group. As a movement, they hold local and national meetings within the United States and in other countries. It would be an insult to all these people to not respect them as belonging to a movement, which they claim to do, in the Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment:</b> The 9/11 truth movement's common goal is to question the official account (which <i>is</i> the media account) of what happened on 9/11. According to Princeton University's <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=movement" class="external text" title="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=movement" rel="nofollow">WordNeta lexical database for the English language</a>"movement" may be defined as "a group of people with a common ideology who try together to achieve certain general goals". <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/45/M0454500.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bartleby.com/61/45/M0454500.html" rel="nofollow">The American Heritage Dictionary</a>defines "movement" as " "an organized effort by supporters of a common goal". The 9/11 truth movement has held many national and international meetings since 2002, with a common goal to answer the many and disturbing questions which were not addressed by the 9/11 Commission Report. Therefore it would be an act of censorship for Wikipedia to deny this entry in the encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPureLogic_0f7c.html" title="User:PureLogic">PureLogic</a> 21:55, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The so-called movement, according to this article, have no common ideology. They have no common goals. They share a scepticism about official accounts, but for wildly differing reasons. The example of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_King_d548.html" title="Martin Luther King">Martin Luther King</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_X_92fd.html" title="Malcolm X">Malcolm X</a> given above demonstrates this - they may have had wildly differing personal beliefs and ways of achieving their goals, but they also shared a common drive towards a more equal society, where "black" did not mean "second class". The people gathered together in this article do not share a clear perception of the current state of affairs, or a common goal (at least according to the article), and they are not working together to acheive anything. The 9/11 truth movement, as a formal organisation, does not exist and has not held a single national or international meeting since 2001. Specific groups have. It is an example of the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> bias of this article that these groups are being lumped together as a non-existent movement, when some of them deserve their own articles, and some are just, if you'll excuse the term, a couple of loons with a photocopier and/or access to email. All verifiable information on individual groups from this article should be kept in some form or another, just not in this one, POV-pushing place. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 08:39, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's just silly. How do people talk: "The rank-and-file among protesters are becoming more interested in the 9/11 truth movement." Or: "The rank-and-file among protesters are becoming more interested in the 9/11 truth demographic." This is a widely recognized term, much like "<a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_media.html" title="Mass media">mass media</a>". Let's call a spade a spade. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaimiddleton_a602.html" title="User:Kaimiddleton">Kaimiddleton</a> 17:44, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Belive me when I say that I understand the anger at the massive POV pushing by some users who follow this movement here. I've had to deal with alot of it and am quite frankly tired of some administrators who do nothing to stop it because of fear of "looking like a bad guy" because the users are organized here and would gang up on them calling them "unfair". But this, unlike the "7/7 Truth Movement", actually has some backing in the U.S. and does name itself by the name "truth movement" which in my honest opinion does not make the title "POV". If the administrators and users actually want to do something about the mass POV pushing in 9/11 articles, instead of deleting articles that reasonably deserve a page on Wikipedia they should demand that admins do something about the revert wars/POV pushing that goes on in every single 9/11 article on wikipedia. Not just warnings and reverts but actual blocks and bans for POV pushing and refusal to adhere to the consensus. Otherwise we'll be at this forever.--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">Jersey Devil</a> 23:54, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Yes! I am a professional librarian with 30 years' experience serving the medical community, the last ten of which were Internet-based. Knowledge workers, including dictionary and encyclopedia makers, refer to "inclusion criteria" as guidelines for what is relevant or non-relevant to a particular topic. I am astounded and appalled that after working for an hour or two to make an evidence-based submission to these pages, I find that a "POV/original research" judgement can be applied to my work to demolish it with a single stroke of the pen. If the administrators continue to allow this to happen on Wikipedia, the encylcopedia will lose its well-earned international reputation AND the particpation of experienced people who have built that reputation and whose time should not be wasted by capitulation to the "POV/original research bullies". --<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPureLogic_0f7c.html" title="User:PureLogic">PureLogic</a> 03:00, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The most casual investigation is enough to show that this, in fact, is a grassroots 'movement'. This movement does have a diversity of points of view, but they all coalesce around an underlying conviction that the truth, far from being properly revealed, seems to be purposely hidden. Considering the immense change brought to our ‘post 911 world’, the truth about that day must be made plain and clear. The 911 Commission Report did more to raise questions than to answer them. Now, as more government secrecy and apparent deception comes to light each day, large numbers of people demand answers. All the elements of a ‘movement’ are therefore present; there’s a focus, a welling of popular interest, and a resistance by authorities to satisfy this search for truth. --<a href="../../../k/o/l/User%7EKolateral_339b.html" title="User:Kolateral">Kolateral</a> 04:24, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Seems to be a genuine (and growing) movement. Gets very large results on search engines, so the term is obviously in use quite a bit.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The movement is growing by the minute and does indeed exist. This page contains its history and key events which cannot be found anywhere else on the internet. Congress people have been involved, scientists, educators, political parties, actors, columnists, etc. and increasingly so over time. This is certainly a movement and whether the people on here agree or not, it exists and has a history and continues to grow. With the recent release of the Pentagon videos, and the new Zogby polls, interest is rising as never before.

<li><b>Keep</b> - We are at a crossroads now. Half the nation believes in the official story and half the nation doesn't- for exact figures see the latest Zogby Poll results at <a href="http://www.911truth.org/article.php?story=20060522022041421" class="external free" title="http://www.911truth.org/article.php?story=20060522022041421" rel="nofollow">http://www.911truth.org/article.php?story=20060522022041421</a>. There is an enormous attempt to drown out the most serious issues raised by the 9-11 Truth Movement with Straw Men attacks, disinformation, and of course heavily subsidized propaganda pieces produced cooperatively by the government and corporate interests. We don't know how long it will take for the 9-11 Truth Movement to come of age, but according to Bill Moyer's MAP of the Eight Stages of Social Movements, so well articulated in his book- Doing Democracy <a href="http://www.newsociety.com/bookid/3694" class="external free" title="http://www.newsociety.com/bookid/3694" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsociety.com/bookid/3694</a>, we are entering Stage Four- The Take Off Stage. After years of activism, street demonstrations, organizing, the mainstream television network news is interviewing 9-11 Truth activists on the evening news, and we are being featured on the front pages of newspapers. Another major international 9-11 Truth Conference will be held in Chicago June 2-4th. All social movements pave the way for those to come and build upon the work of those before them. Humanity has never been faced with so many serious problems; the Truth Movement's experiences/history will help the movements that follow it, if humanity is to learn, evolve, survive and thrive.``Carol Brouillet</li>

<li><b>Keep, absolutely</b> - The term "9/11 Truth Movement" covers any group of people who question the official story of 9/11. It does not signify a particular organization, such as the "9/11 Truth Alliance" or "From the Wilderness". An organization such as <a href="../../../a/n/s/ANSWER_Coalition_1a54.html" title="ANSWER Coalition">ANSWER</a> might have a faction that is interested in promoting the "9/11 Truth Movement". This is a term of discourse that is widely used. I can do a wikipedia search for <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_movement.html" title="Peace movement">Peace movement</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_literary_movements.html" title="List of literary movements">List of literary movements</a> and get a result. Similarly, it is of value to keep this topic, because I have a feeling the "9/11 Truth Movement" will be ongoing for quite some time and some folks might like to know about it even if others wish it didn't exist. As to the aspersion "POV Fork": has anybody noticed the incredible volume of content that is posted on this topic? There are folks who would like to document a cultural phenomenon and this is a legitimate place to do that. Wikipedia has room for these pages, it is not wrong to have them, except that some people, arguable with their own point of view, do not like this point of view and wish to quash it by resorting to every nasty wikipedia trick they can find. Even if the 9/11 Truth Movement is wrong, and 9/11 was in fact everything the mass media says it was--basically 19 Arab hijackers who were able to pull off the crime of the century, nothing more, nothing less--<b>why shouldn't the opinions of those people be documented</b>?

<li><b>Keep</b> There seems to be a misunderstanding, this group wants more information and a new investigation, that is their common goal. MLK and Malcolm X both wanted equality for blacks, though they believed it was possible via different channels. As stated the common goal of a new investigation and more information is what makes it a movement. It is errie how these are being put up for deletion so close in time, no insinuation meant. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0faults</a> 19:55, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The title is misleading. The word 'truth' in '911 Truth Movement' is a form of <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspeak.html" title="Newspeak">newspeak</a>. There isn't really any truth involved in the actual movement. Which really isn't a movement either.

<li><b>Keep</b> Though I've commented above, I hadn't actually made an explicit recommendation yet. I disagree that this article presents the same case as the "7/7 truth movement", that it is not a movement, and that it is not notable. I don't see strong reasons for deleting the article, only for improving it. I would recommend that the article be retitled <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_truth_movement_3d2e.html" title="9/11 truth movement">9/11 truth movement</a> (lowercase) though. While some might not like the name, movements, etc. are given the name they themselves use. For example, the article on the U.S. <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_spying_program.html" title="Domestic spying program">domestic spying program</a> is called by its euphemistic name <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorist_surveillance_program.html" title="Terrorist surveillance program">Terrorist surveillance program</a> since that is the more or less official name. My recommendation does not constitute an endorsement of the group, only a position on whether it warrants an article. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 07:07, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Do you really think that knowledge will always stay the same? What do you mean by non-wikipedia? If I am signed up as a member of WIKI...doesn't that make me a wikipedian? The authoritative structure of this website I might add seems to be run by trolls and gnomes...the endless list of people that make small or large changes to knowledge that is seen. Kevin in response to your comment-how much of what you consider real knowledge actually is untrue...what about the pages of history? How much is verifiable truth? What really is notable...as the very things to what people adhere to could very well be lies. Have you noticed in "google land" that mispelled words appear right along side of correctly spelled words? How much information on the net is regurgitated? Deathrocker...in your response to "spammer" there is no need in attacking me-it only makes yourself look bad..and the same for Adrift. If space industrial culture is not accecpted in as a musical genera, perhaps it will be accepted as a sub-culture in it's own article. We are peaceful people seeking to make aware new culture...I have not even been offered assistance by any of you in maybe helping to write an article about these subjects. Instead...attacks. Does that give a good name for trolls and gnomes? As you may or may not know, space industrial aside, It is the conduct of gnomes and trolls that is the greatest concern here. The reputation of gnomes that I have gathered so far is that Deathrocker is an outspoken gnome and has a mindset in his brain to what history of certian musical generas are. He also may have an issue with myspace as a verifiable source, or one that notes credibility...Myspace has become the standard for the underground and the mainstream worlds. Just like Bill Gates creating Windows...Tom maybe be on the verge of a monopoly...Look at X space for example...An X men myspace..modeling the myspace sucess...Will someone like to help me write a WIKI article about new cultures? -Keodrah</p>
<dl>
<dd>First off, personal attacks (like calling people trolls and gnomes) are against Wiki policy. Second, indeed MySpace is not a verifiable source. As absolutely anyone with computer access can create a MySpace page, it is therefore proof of nothing more than internet access and some spare time. It certainly doesn't illustrate a "movement" or a "genre" just because someone has a MySpace page. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 17:24, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He was quoted in the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> on a spat and defamation case between Dr Belinda Goodenough and South Coogee Anglican church (see <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/blog-sparks-talk-of-womens-subordination-in-church/2006/03/29/1143441215880.html" class="external text" title="http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/blog-sparks-talk-of-womens-subordination-in-church/2006/03/29/1143441215880.html" rel="nofollow">article</a>). Evidently the SMH believes he is a notable spokesperson for the Anglican church in Sydney. Gordon was also the former Pastor of St Matthias Centennial Park, the church that basically sets the agenda for conservative evanglical Sydney Anglicanism. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 13:26, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I looked at that link when researching my vote. Nowhere in the article does the Herald give the impression it thinks he is "he is a notable spokesperson for the Anglican church in Sydney". It quotes him because on the forum debate the article discusses, his was the lone dissenting voice. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 13:30, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>The <i>Herald</i> is not in the habit of just quoting non-notable bloggers and chat posters. The only time I have ever seen them do this was when a sport scandal erupted, and a riot happened in Cronulla. In those cases they <i>certainly</i> didn't call the posters and ask for their confirmation of their comments! Therefore, I stand by all my statements. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 13:32, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't know whether the Herald quotes unnotable bloggers as a matter of course, but it does so three times (apart from Mr Cheng) during the course of the article you cited. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 13:36, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>OK, you can believe that he isn't notable if you'd like. However, you haven't addressed any of my other points. Out of interest, are you familiar with Sydney Anglicanism? - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 13:38, 19 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your other points aren't backed up with proof. In this process, the onus is on editors who want to keep an article to provide proof of their claims. If you can provide a source for the statement that The Briefing generates sales of more than 5,000 (freesheets don't count), then I will change my vote. Otherwise, it sounds as though this person merits a mention in the article on Sydney Anglicanism, but not his own biography.<a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 13:48, 19 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The Briefing costs $55 for a years subscription. I'm afraid I don't have exact figures on circulation, but I have been informed by Matthias Media themselves (the publishers of this monthly magazine) that they have figures of about 6,000 subscribers. They are not a free newspaper. The Briefing is one of the main publications of the Sydney Anglican church, and is published by <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthias_Media_7157.html" title="Matthias Media">Matthias Media</a>. As I have said, the <i>Herald</i> quoted Gordon because he is quite outspoken and is a senior editor of the <i>The Briefing</i>. I'm sure if you would like to verify the circulation figures that they would be quite happy to confirm. Their email address is thebriefing at matthiasmedia.com.au (kept non email address format to reduce spam). - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 14:00, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless significantly expanded to explain his notability.

<li><b>Delete</b> I {{prod}}ed the article originally.

<p>I am a friend of Whitney's. Since she founded the first successful Green Party in the state of Maryland, I have met numerous people who have wanted to get information about her. Wikipedia is the place.</p>
<p>Plus, let's be honest. If <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_White_%28neo-Nazi%29_d02f.html" title="Bill White (neo-Nazi)">Bill White (neo-Nazi)</a> can get a page, then so can Whitney! (I asked why he has a page, and the editor responded that since he's been in the Washington Post several times, so he deserves a page; the conversation should still be up on the talk page. Well, guess what? Whitney has been quoted in the Washington Times several times, mostly for her work with the Green Party. Furthermore, she has given radio interviews, corresponded with Ralph Nader, edited a book that is to be distributed nationally ("The Cost of Freedom Project"), and so on. Bill White's page was written by a bunch of neo-Nazi friends (or maybe parts by himself), and is replete with extraneous personal information. Whitney's page is succinct, and provides the sort of relevant information that people curious about her public activities are looking for.) <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnaptime_10bf.html" title="User:Carnaptime">Carnaptime</a> 14:31, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>And when this article is as well-sourced as the White article, including sources for Washington Post and radio interviews, when said book actually <i>is</i> distributed nationally and meets the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> bar for editors, then I would vote to keep it. Until then, <b>Delete</b> per nom. I suggest that if you want to put out information about your friend, she either have a website or use the Green Party website, if she is a founder. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 14:37, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am working on the citations now. And acutally, she already has a book published. I'll find a link for that too.</p>
<p>And yeah, Bill's page is really well-sourced. I mean, he's got a video that a friend took of him being wrestled to the ground. And the Washington Post mentioned him a few times. That is well-sourced (check out his own website - or check out Whitney's!), and definitely relevant. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnaptime_10bf.html" title="User:Carnaptime">Carnaptime</a> 14:45, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Reluctant <b>delete</b> from me. She sounds like someone with a fascinating future ahead of her (and having gone through five pages of Google about her I feel well informed enough to make that comment!), but the Green Party of Maryland don't credit her as their founder, her book hasn't been independently published, her band isn't yet signed, Wikipedia doesn't do bio's of individual Harry S Truman scholars, and her website doesn't get the necessary billions of hits. So, all good luck to her, but no entry yet. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 14:59, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>So you saw the front page of the Hood paper? What does "No vote BECAUSE I actually go to college with her" mean? If I were to say "Vote because I know her," would that cancel out your comment? Try giving a reason (like she only has 500 google entries with her name) for deleting other than going to college with her!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Um...if you read my comment, it says I'm not giving an opinion either way period, that doesn't mean I'm voting for deletion because I go to college with her. I'm choosing to abstain from this since I'm attached to it on a personal level which I don't think should drive people's motives in discussion in creating an encyclopedia. Oh, and yes, I saw the front page of the Blue and Grey today. I've been on the front page of it before, do I get my own article? <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 15:19, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete</b> Neologism. What Mattabat is describing exists but is called <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtualization.html" title="Virtualization">virtualization</a>. Please note a Google search for "translation emulation" will return a lot of results, but most of them are talking about "tranlation OR emulation" not "translation emulation". Also please don't recommend redirect as we don't want this to start being linked and then appearing in Google searches. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 16:30, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Never heard the term used this way myself, and if I heard it, I thought it would refer to <a href="../../../e/m/u/Emulator.html" title="Emulator">emulators</a> that do some sort of translation (such as <a href="../../../j/u/s/Just-in-time_compiling.html" title="Just-in-time compiling">just-in-time compiling</a>, or plain <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interpreting.html" title="Interpreting">interpreting</a>) to run the code -- i.e. the <i>exact opposite</i> of what the article is saying. Google, for all that I can see, seems to basically agree with me. <a href="../../../l/j/l/User%7ELjL_5e2c.html" title="User:LjL">LjL</a> 19:41, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b>. The term is sound and not virtualisation as virtualisation a generalised term can apply to a range of emulator types. Translation emulation is specific, comparable I suppose to native virtualisation but not necessarily in isolation. See the article I linked, and the examples I highlighted (especially Shapeshifter). Goodonya Google, I'm glad someone knows how to use you..&#160;:) Mattabat 12:09, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Oh, and if I remember correctly, any published author can become a Pulitzer nominee, if someone fills out the nomination form for them. It's only when you become a nominated finalist (ie, when the Pulitzer committee actually says "OK, that's a nomination to consider") that you approach the kind of stature that we call "notability".

<li><i><b>Do Not Delete</b></i> I have contributed extensively to this article and I believe that notability has been established according to Wikipedia's policy. I have included several links to major local publications (Mainly The Savannah Daily News. You will, however, be required to register to read the publications and it is free to do so) and the band's debut album (High Impendence Of The Majesty Of Super Horse, 2005)was voted as one of the best albums of the year according to Georgia Music magazine. The band has been together for over 12 years and is a well known "undreground" indie rock band (The links to The Savannah Daily News will verify my claim).</li>
</ul>
<p>The band has been voted as "The Best Of Savannah" for 2005 and has performed for the St Patrick's Day Parade, which is the second largest in the country.</p>
<p>Below are excerpts from Wickipedia's policy for notability for performing artists:</p>
<p>"<i>Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (excludes things like school newspapers, personal blogs, etc...)."</i> <b>- The article in question meets this criteria since the band has been cited on major publications (see links on article) over 50 times over the course of 12 years.</b></p>
<p><i>"Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both, as in British hip hop); note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability."</i> <b>- Again this requirement has been satisfied. The links on the page will direct readers to various publications reconizing the band as one of the most influential (If not the most influential) indie rock band of Savannah, GA.</b></p>
<p><i>Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable).</i> <b>The band's debut album (High Impendence Of The Majesty Of Superhorse) was released under Blast-O-Disc, which is related to Elevated Basement recording studio. This studio has worked with major regional and national acts such as Greg Allman (Allman Brothers) and The Atlanta Rythm section (Major rock band from the 70's and 80's)</b> I vote for this article to stay. &gt;<a href="../../../m/e/a/User%7EMeanax_a306.html" title="User:Meanax">+</a>&lt;/19 May 2006 (UTC) User = Meanax <a href="../../../m/e/a/User%7EMeanax_a306.html" title="User:Meanax">Meanax</a><sup>(<a href="../../../m/e/a/User_talk%7EMeanax_35af.html" title="User talk:Meanax">&amp;Meanax;</a>)</sup> 19:49, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> unless Meanax can provide more critical sources. You have four articles about the band, but they're all from the same paper, and I couldn't find anything on the Georgia Music Magazine web site (BTW, said magazine has only been around for a year, which means it probably isn't a highly recognized source) about albums of the year. At this point, the band simply does not have enough notability. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 22:14, 19 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The article is also <i>highly</i> POV, not just about the band but about each individual member. That has to change if this article survives the deletion voting process. It also needs to be wikified ({{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikify_3cf0.html" title="Template:Wikify">wikify</a>}}). -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 22:17, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><s><b>Do Not Delete</b></s> I have added more links to news papers from Charleston SC, as well as radio interview from the Georgia Gazette (GPB). Also remember that under Wikipidia requirements for notability, one or more members of the band must be notable. The lead singer Keith Kozel has won best supporting actor for an indie movie and was recognized by the Savannah Morning News. Kozel's GAM (His main band until recently) was voted "The Best Band In GA" by a public poll conducted by Creative Loafing Magazine in 1999 (Link on article's page will direct readers to Creative Loafing's archives. Creative Loafing is a weekly magazine with circulation of over 40,000). Creative Loafing in Savannah has changed its name to Access Savannah.</li>

<p>I have added two additional links to the page, one of which will direct readers to a radio interview broadcasted by the Georgia Plublic Broadcast radio. As of now I have provided articles from 2 major paper publications with circulation of over 40,000 (The Savannah Morning News and The Charleston Gazette), along with a state wide half hour long broadcast. I am claiming notability under "regional" standards and I feel that I have satisfied Wikipidia's requiremnts thus far.</p>
<p>All articles and radio broadcast will reveal that the band has somewhat chosen to remain low key and underground. All articles and broadcast will also reveal that the band has an enourmous, and loyal regional following despite its lack of ovewhelming media exposure.</p>
<p>I invite you all to read the articles and listen to the broadcast and ask you to please allow this article to remain. The information provided seems satisfy the two Wikipedia requirements listed above for regional notability.|+]]&lt;/22 May 2006 (UTC) User = Meanax <a href="../../../m/e/a/User%7EMeanax_a306.html" title="User:Meanax">Meanax</a><sup>(<a href="../../../m/e/a/User_talk%7EMeanax_35af.html" title="User talk:Meanax">&amp;Meanax;</a>)</sup> 19:49, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>DO NOT DELETE&#160;!</b> If all worthiness requirements have been satisfied...why is this article being offered up for deletion? I certainly hope prior justification can be provided before removing.|+]]&lt;/22 May 2006 (UTC) User = Amyjo75231 19:55, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><i><b>Keep</b></i> After carefully reviewing this article and the supporting sources it appears that this article deserves to be permanently included on Wikipedia. I am familiar with the region and the publications and given the sheer amount of bands in the Savannah area to be mentioned on its largest publication repeatedly is somewhat unique. Also it is very unusual for GPB (Georgia Public Broadcasting) to grant air time to bands. For them to have been interviewed by GPB and had their show broadcasted is a huge accomplishment not achieved by the vast majority of bands in the region. If notability is all that is in question to keep this artcile I believe that criteria has been clearly established. User = Silvah 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Do not delete. This band is a known entity and is of consequence.

<li><b>Delete</b>: Despite attempts to claim notability, this still seems like just your run of the mill local band. Also, if you can't afford your own website, that says something about your band's notability. --<a href="../../../h/e/t/User%7EHetar_0d92.html" title="User:Hetar">Hetar</a> 19:10, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: My understanding when I decided to contribute to Wikipedia was that there was an eitiquette in which editors were not supposed to attack or belittle new contributors. This rule appears to not apply to Mr./Mrs. Hetar.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have written this article according to the policy of notability written by the scholars and academics of Wikepedia, not mine. To answer to Mr.Mrs. Hetar's comments (which I find completely innapropriate and bordeline that of someone who is completely closed mind an uninformed)having a web page does not denote "notability". Not by common standars and definitly not by Wikipedia standards either. Had Superhorse had the most glamourous site on the internet and nothing else I am sure that would not be acceptable. I have looked up for Aunt Teresa.com,.net, .org and found nothing no such a domain. According to Hetar's (absurd) remark that implies that Aunt Teresa is a less notable than Jimmy Swagart, who not surprisingly has a domain of his own.</p>
<p>Another comment from M/M Hetar is that he uses the words "seems to me" to discredit my article. Am I trying to satisfy Hetar's or Wikipedia' standards for notability. If it is Wikipedia's I have pasted them on my comment above and presented verifiable documentation to satisfy those standards. If it is Mr/Mrs Hetar' standards that I must satisfy, then I would like a copy of such standards so that I may attempt to satisfy them as well.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the article is not being deleted for lack of notability as required. I sense a strong bias toward a subject that so far all editors seem to have not fully considered all the information presented. It appears from all the votes for deletion that the editors are requiring that notability be proven as one would that of an internationally known band.</p>
<p>Wikipedia's policy on notability has a room for "regional" bands, and this is where I think the direction of this discussion should be focused. For regional standards, media and type of media coverage, Superhorse is without a doubt a "notable" regional band. This fact is not argued by our local radio stations, public radio stations, paper print, internet media, but to somehow it is being contested over here. It is as if all of us who live here and rely on our local media to determine what is is not notable are incapable of telling the difference between the two.</p>
<p>All I ask of all editors is an unbiased discussion based on facts and Wikipedia's policy. Nothing more, nothing less. As of this moment I feel that the article is being deleted just because... Just because no one heard of the band. Just because someone didn't find information about it in some source that he or she considers "the ultimate" determining factor for a band's notability (i.e. Allmusic.com). Just because the band does not have a web page???? Please tell me that this vote/comment will not even be considered! Most bands,epecially regional bands are opting for pages at MySpace.com over their own domains because it allows them to interact with their fans at no cost. This is exactly the case with Superhorse. On the same note, if Mr./Mrs Hetar had taken his/her time to go over the information presented he.she would've noticed that Superhorse indeed has a web page. It just is not called Superhorse.com. Why is it not? Well... Let me see... I guess we all have watched the news lately and we all have heard of a "notable" (And by God I hope you will agree at least with this statement) horse called Superhorse, who has been around since the band has been around. Ahhh... Perhaps that domain name was taken. What do you think? Hetar's remark on web presence is without a doubt the most absurd remark I ever heard in my life, especially coming from someone who is suposedly 100 times more intelligent than I am. Hetar's remarks on my opinion cast a huge dark shadow of doubt on his reasoning, research of the material presented and his/her ability to make an unbiased up or down recommendation.</p>
<p>I personally believe that if this articles survives this discussion that it should be re-written. I agree with one of the editors where the POV language should be removed and the article reformated. But to overlook the facts and facts are: "The band has received media coverage over the years from various sources", and therefore is "notable" by common and Wikipedia's policy on notability is to deliberately delete an article that otherwise should've been included in this encyclopedia.

<dd>Sir, you've already stated your position at least twice before.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Mr. Zeta, I cannot accept the comment from Mr.Mrs, Hetars. I will look for his or her articles because I refuse to accept "It seems to me", as an argument to discredit my article. I am sorry!</li>
</ul>
<p>I will continue to speak my mind everytime an editor brings a new objection (i.e. Lack of a web page). Had this editor researched prior to nominating this article for deletion he/she would know that the band has one. I only continue to speak because you (The editors) continue to discredit the article on different basis. Thank you for your understanding. I am not doing this for fun or anything, but this feels much like our legal system. Ultimately this article will remain or be deleted based on someone's interpretation of the Wikipedia's policy, not what is clearly written on the policy.</p>

<li>If he is notable, it's for this event only. Nothing else at all is even said about him other than that he comes from the Congo, so the article is much more about the event than the person.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This has had enormous news coverage in the UK and worldwide. I'm really puzzled by the assertion that it might not even merit a mention in the BBC's article - "major news network interviews the wrong guy entirely live on air" isn't a story that is going to be forgotten, in my view. Whilst it probably would be more appropriate to put it at BBC News 24 wrong interviewee event or some such, his <i>name</i> has been widely reported and it's likely people looking for the article will search for it - <i>I</i> did. So in conclusion, I say more Guy Goma, <a href="../../../m/o/r/More_cowbell.html" title="More cowbell">less cowbell</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattley_a310.html" title="User:Mattley">Mattley</a> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMattley_ace2.html" title="User talk:Mattley"><sup>(Chattley)</sup></a> 10:41, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. No doubt Mr Goma will fade from public view in the next few weeks but the incident, and what happened immediately afterwards will cotinue to resonate. I've read a number of articles in newpsapers/websites this week which have detailed people who had a brush with fame and have faded away, no doubt Mr Goma will be resurrected some time in the future. <a href="../../../y/o/r/User%7EYorkshiresky_ee54.html" title="User:Yorkshiresky">Yorkshiresky</a> 10:46 20 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Could you expand on how he his notable? As it is, the article actually says nothing at all about <i>him</i>, other than that he comes from the Congo. This seems to imply he's not notable, except in the context of this incident, which would imply that he, himself, does not warrant an article. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 12:19, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Is it really necessary to add the afdanons template to this afd, and then "mark" every editor with only a few edits behind them? That isn't usual practice, and this afd discussion doesn't seem any different than normal (I don't see it flooded with anon users who have come from a user board). The votes are mature and well-worded on both sides. -- <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterHand_55c4.html" title="User:MisterHand">MisterHand</a> 12:38, 20 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was just concerned at the large number of votes from people with very few other edits - as of now 1/3 of the people who've posted here have less than 100 votes, which seems very high. Are you sure noting which voters have few edits is not normal practice?

<li>It's not unheard of, but its usually only done in cases where there appears to be an attempt "ballot stuffing" (typically, a lot of anon users coming <i>en masse</i> and voting one particular way).

<li><b>Keep</b> As noted by others above, this delete request is part of a rampage to delete Jewish-related articles. If it is a stub, then expand it. Perhaps there could also be a merge with other pages on Jewish summer camps into a general article on Jewish summer camps and how they are different from "run-of-the-mill" US summer camps (i.e., their role in ethnic identify of Jews, history re: Jews being not welcome and/or proselytized by Christians in other summer camps, use of Hebrew and Yiddish languages at these camps, etc.) But simply deleting all Jewish summer camps as "not notable" smacks of a hidden agenda against Jews. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERooster613_e82f.html" title="User:Rooster613">Rooster613</a> 23:52, 21 May 2006 (UTC)Rooster613<a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERooster613_e82f.html" title="User:Rooster613">Rooster613</a> 23:52, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>False. These are articles that have been caught in a stub sweep through a particular category.

<li><b>Keep</b> As noted by others above, this delete request is part of a rampage to delete Jewish-related articles. If it is a stub, then expand it. Perhaps there could also be a merge with other pages on Jewish summer camps into a general article on Jewish summer camps and how they are different from "run-of-the-mill" US summer camps (i.e., their role in ethnic identify of Jews, history re: Jews being not welcome and/or proselytized by Christians in other summer camps, use of Hebrew and Yiddish languages at these camps, etc.) But simply deleting all Jewish summer camps as "not notable" smacks of a hidden agenda against Jews. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERooster613_e82f.html" title="User:Rooster613">Rooster613</a> 23:54, 21 May 2006 (UTC)Rooster613<a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERooster613_e82f.html" title="User:Rooster613">Rooster613</a> 23:54, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The article was created to get the listcruft out of the original <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Coast_Plaza_ce97.html" title="South Coast Plaza">South Coast Plaza</a> article. I thought that removing the directory as a whole might be too <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a>, so that's why this page was created. It is notable, as are its tenants - and the question of maitenance isn't one that I often see in question - anyone can edit it, therefore anyone can maintain the correctness of this list forever. Therefore, I ask if it might not be better to <b>merge</b> back to the original page in an abridged form (see <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_Prussia_Mall_d7c6.html" title="King of Prussia Mall">King of Prussia Mall</a> or <b>keep</b> and expand lead-in (which I'll go ahead and do right now for the sake of argument)
<ul>
<li>"Anyone can edit", but why would anyone want to? In don't think there is a crowds of volunteers to edit, unlike <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Bush_24e4.html" title="George Bush">George Bush</a> or <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">Penis</a> articles. I can see it from the amount of red links on the page (and 25% of blue ones point to irrelevant pages, being non-disabmiguated). I bet my moustache that 40% of them will be out of business in next 6 months. This information is bound to be outdated, not to say of dubious notability: are we going to list every <a href="../../../p/i/z/Pizza_Hut_33d0.html" title="Pizza Hut">Pizza Hut</a> and every <a href="../../../n/o/r/Nordstrom.html" title="Nordstrom">Nordstrom</a> outlet all over the world?

<li><b>Comment</b> — Restricting this list to extraterestrials with significant roles in their respective fiction would help winnow it down to a manageable group.
