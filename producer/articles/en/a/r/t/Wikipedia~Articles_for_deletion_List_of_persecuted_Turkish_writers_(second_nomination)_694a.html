<p>There was some problem with this AfD. I am merely substing the templates properly. Have copied the original nominator's reason below. <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a> - <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_Review_Aksi_great_4751.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor Review/Aksi great">review me</a>) 09:49, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Original reason by <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">User:BigHaz</a></b> - Renomination of a previously nominated page. All contributors to the previous AfD were invited to participate in a discussion on the article's Talk page about where the information was best placed. Consensus was to move those charged under Article 301 to that page (they already were) and those charged for insulting Ataturk to that section of that page (the one who was explicitly charged in that manner was redlinked, <s>which implies a lack of notability</s> - the section of the article in question also doesn't seem like the greatest place to put the names of those charged for insulting the man). Thus, we're left with an article which I'm not quite sure what to do with. I stress again that the overwhelming majority of useful information is in fact duplicated elsewhere on Wikipedia, which seems like as good a reason as any to delete this. That said, arguments were made during the AfD and the discussion about a possible rename, so that may be a worthwhile thing to bring up here. I'm in favour of a delete based on the rationale that the information is either duplicated or (in the case of the redlinked people still listed) just not there, but I'm only one man. BigHaz 08:59, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The title is inherently NPOV. There is no clear criterion for inclusion. Not all people mentioned are normally considered to be writers. The article lists people who are dead and alive indiscriminately, and makes no distinction between old cases and new cases, or between the cases in which the accused were convicted and acquitted or only charged. Those listed are often much less notable than those not listed. As such the article is not informative and serves no purpose. I do not agree with what BigHaz wrote above that being redlinked implies a lack of notability. Several if not most of these people <i>should</i> have an article. Actually there is a page <a href="../../../r/a/g/Ragip_Zarakolu_cbad.html" title="Ragip Zarakolu">Ragip Zarakolu</a>; its page title differs from the (proper) spelling in the redlink in this article. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 16:13, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I guess at a pinch we could tree it out from Article 301 as "List of people who have been charged under Article 301", and use it as a place to list the "notable prosecutions" or whatever that article calls them. There's then the question of whether any individual who's not listed there (i.e. the redlinks we still have on this article) is notable enough to <i>be</i> listed for that - presumably there'd be a lot of stubs to be created running "X is/was a Turkish journalist/poet/author/other who was prosecuted under Article 301". <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 10:17, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although possible, I'm not sure it is an ideal solution. If you take the information away from our article <a href="../../../a/r/t/Article_301.html" title="Article 301">Article 301</a>, I'm afraid it will become rather lame; the Article derives its <s>notoriety</s> notability from these prosecutions and attempts at prosecution. But it is better than leaving the article under discussion be. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 16:37, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So do you have a suggestion for another name?

<dd>Assuming that they're all being prosecuted and haven't had the charges dropped before they got that far (yes, I know it's in the references, but I've got a splitting headache and wouldn't be any use looking at them), then that makes sense to me. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 03:19, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Should they then actually be writers? Do publishers count as writers? Any limitations on the nature of the alleged crime?

<dd>Valid point. I'd forgotten we had some ring-ins (the Mazlum Der head being probably the most ringing). Perhaps get rid of all bar living authors (as against publishers) who were actually charged under things like Article 301 or other serious parts of the criminal code. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 07:07, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not quite sure I understand the meaning of "ring-ins" in the preceding sentence. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 08:06, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, it must be more of an Australianism than I realise. It means "something which is in a place where it doesn't normally qualify to be", so in this case the people who aren't necessarily "writers" in the normal sense of the word are ring-ins. From memory it's a horseracing term. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 10:07, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>If it is only current cases, then a question is: How do we <i>keep</i> it current. For example, the article states: "Ibrahim Aksoy, ..., imprisoned ... since October 1995". This sounds like the man has been subject to the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midnight_Express_%28film%29_a39c.html" title="Midnight Express (film)">notorious brutalities of Turkish prison wardens with atrocious accents</a> for almost eleven years now. But the reference given is from 1996. I further have some problem in making the criterion "other serious parts of the criminal code" concrete. (It would actually seem worse to me if writers are prosecuted by dint of frivolous parts of the criminal code.) How can we deal with this in an NPOV way? --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:14, 18 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Good point again (and I'll admit to not having checked those references, I'm not in great health at the moment so I give up on research a bit more easily). Perhaps the idea of rolling this into a subpage from Article 301 as "notable prosecutions" (and zapping anyone who we can't verifiably say was prosecuted under that article) is the best. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 23:19, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
