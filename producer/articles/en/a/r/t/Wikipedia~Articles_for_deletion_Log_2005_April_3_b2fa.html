<dd>This updates a previous comment.</dd>
<dd>I have split the article. Apparently the librarian-blogger's full name is Jessamyn Charity West and differs from the Quaker novelist's, so I'm decided to avoid the dab page and just have split out <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessamyn_Charity_West_a059.html" title="Jessamyn Charity West">Jessamyn Charity West</a> and cross-reference the articles to each other. This way, at least <i>some</i> users‚Äîthe ones that want the novelist‚Äîwill get what they want without having to follow a link.</dd>
<dd>The naming convention says "Use the most common name of a person or thing that does not conflict with the names of other people or things." Jessamyn Charity West is not the librarian-blogger's most common name, but her most common name does conflict with the author's name, and the author was there first.</dd>
<dd>I'm now inclined to think the librarian-blogger is notable enough for an article. (But working on a page will do that to you). Actually I just found out that she's one of three dozen bloggers who were issued press credentials for the 2004 DNC, which clinches it for me anyway.</dd>
<dd>Since the article nominated for VfD was about the blogger, I've put a duplicate VfD notice referring to <i>this</i> discussion on <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessamyn_Charity_West_a059.html" title="Jessamyn Charity West">Jessamyn Charity West</a>.</dd>

<li><b>Keep both.</b> Blogger borderline, but her mention in the New York Times, in Library Journal as a "mover and shaker," the DNC's issuance of press credentials to her at the 2004 convention, her Google listing <i>above</i> the novelist (good example of Google systemic bias but still), and her status as an opponent of the USA Patriot Act (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22patriot+act%22+%22jessamyn+west%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22patriot+act%22+%22jessamyn+west%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">800 Google hits</a> on <i>"patriot act" "Jessamyn West"</i>) put her just on the "keep" side of the border, IMHO. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:25, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Though my vote is still to keep both, candor compels me to add a new data point. I called my local public library, and asked a librarian if she'd heard of "a librarian named Jessamyn West, not the author." She hadn't, and she referred me to the library director, who hadn't either. I explained that she was a librarian with a blog, and noted for opposing library-related provisions of the USA Patriot Act, and it still didn't ring any bells with her. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:01, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep both.</b> Both are influential enough to warrant mention. As noted above Jessamyn Charity West is more than just a blogger‚Äîor just a librarian, for that matter.

<li><b>Comment</b> Nothing to make of it. I apprear to have accidentally stumbled into something I shouldn't have, and if that is the case, please delete. My "history" is that I have only occasionally poked around here, and maybe should have played in the sandbox a little more (hence the multi-edits to this page) before commenting. But these recent comments seem to be more focused on me than the agenda item, so please forgive my intrusion. I came to this wikipedia page because I was looking for information on Jessamyn Charity West, and I was only somewhat familiar with Mary Jessamyn West (bad English major, I know), so I voted accordingingly (room for both, I still think). I am very familiar with the online presence of JC West and the work she does in online communities and with freedom of speech issues, and library work, etc. User:RickScully

<p>The <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Vicefield_16ce.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Vicefield">Vicefield</a> article reminded me of this one which I saw a while ago. It is partly about <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johan_Palmstruch_6994.html" title="Johan Palmstruch">Johan Palmstruch</a>, Swedish 17th century financier, and partly about the bank he founded, which was the origin of the present <a href="../../../r/i/k/Riksbank.html" title="Riksbank">Bank of Sweden</a>. I am not sure if it is intentionally anti-semitic, but it claims that both Palmstruch and an unnamed Chancellor of Sweden at the time were Jewish, which appear to be the type of claims often made to reinforce the idea of the unproportional influence of Jews over finances and politics. Palmstruch, originally (before he was raised to the nobility) called <i>Witmacker</i>, came from a family of Dutch protestant origin which had been settled in <a href="../../../r/i/g/Riga.html" title="Riga">Riga</a> for a generation or two. No chancellor of Sweden in the 17th century was Jewish or of Jewish origin. The article has other POV issues as well, but very little factual content. <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palmstruch.html" title="Palmstruch">Palmstruch</a> might be used as a redirect to <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johan_Palmstruch_6994.html" title="Johan Palmstruch">Johan Palmstruch</a>, when that article is written or as a disambiguation whenever somebody writes a real article about the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palmstruch_Bank_c1c5.html" title="Palmstruch Bank">Palmstruch Bank</a>, but I see no reason to keep this in the history or to further distribute it to Wikipedia mirrors. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 05:05, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>That surely goes to <i>verifiability</i> (and why I nominated it for deletion), not notability.

<li>This person probably exists but I seriously doubt he won the VC. There are Google hits for "James Bathgate". If he was "unverifiable" there would be <b>zero</b> Google hits.

<li><b>Delete</b> sorry but this band still isnt that notable. BEC Recordings is not Epic or Warners - its a specialist label for mostly Christian bands many of them very obscure. A fair slice of those Google hits are by fans leaving messages on blogs about the band. As has been pointed out on vfd before, the Google Test is not a good indicator of notability for music or pornography. Their "national" tour seems to be mostly confined to churchs, religious festivals and small stadiums. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesBurns_5f2a.html" title="User:JamesBurns">JamesBurns</a> 04:12, 1 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't want this to sound like a personal attack, but... if every band that is on this site has to have a page full of #1 hits and several national tours in which they sold out every <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_18f8.html" title="NFL">NFL</a> stadium, should we delete all the others (including those who started some of the more obscure musical genres)? That's a strict criterion; Christian rock basically is on the fringes of mainstream rock, so its bands don't sell a lot of records and are mainly stuck in the church culture. Pretty much any Christian artist that isn't <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Day_0bc9.html" title="Third Day">Third Day</a> doesn't crank out #1 hits in the general market or sell out a very large stadium in every show. (Also just a side note: several Christian festivals - see <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornerstone_Festival_4f45.html" title="Cornerstone Festival">Cornerstone Festival</a> for one of the examples - draw tens of thousands of guests.) Falling Up is also featured on <a href="http://www.xthealbum.com" class="external text" title="http://www.xthealbum.com" rel="nofollow">X 2005</a>, a compilation of Christian rock hits from 17 bands, most of which have articles on this site that have been accepted without question. If you'd like to go through and delete all of those bands too, go ahead and do it. But keep things standard across the site. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 05:09, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>I never mentioned #1 hits. Should we make exceptions to Christian bands just because they wish to be identified in that genre? I dont think so.

<ul>
<li>That depends. The Billboard Christian Rock and Heatseekers charts aren't based on many tens of thousands of unit sales a week like the rock and pop charts. Making #1 on those charts would still be a little bit notable. Merely showing up on the genre charts (Top Ten albums of the year? Top 100 albums of the week?) is not notable by itself. How meaningfully they "charted" isn't shown in these comments. Having one release on BEC Recordings doesn't make a band notable; they have to do that themselves.

Granted, if you added up all of Britney's albums she'd certainly outperform Falling Up, and this is only a statistic on amazon.com, but for them to outsell one of Britney's albums probably means that they're notable enough for listing on the wikipedia.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>No consensus</b>. Thus, the article is kept. It is now clear that this VfD will not reach consensus. Deletion is supported by slightly over half of the voters. Many voters expressed concern about POV problems and this should be discussed in the article's <a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnti-globalization_and_Anti-Semitism_39b0.html" title="Talk:Anti-globalization and Anti-Semitism">talk page</a>.

<p>This article consists of content that was at <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalization.html" title="Anti-globalization">Anti-globalization</a>, where the general opinion was that it was a load of rubbish added just to try to slander the anti-globalization movement. It was disproportionately long compared to the rest of the criticisms in the article. People such as myself wanted to shorten it to a summary. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">User:Sam Spade</a> had the bright idea of saving this by creating a spin-off page. Our policy discourages the creation of spin-offs consisting of the controversial bits of other articles. This content was not good enough to be a section in another article, and its not good enough to be a full article.

<dd>If I could briefly respond to that note: This isn't about notability, it's about it being a pov fork in that the phenomenon is too marginal to be written on outside the main article (and when it does, pov is the result).

<dd>El C, I'll answer you in full below. Suffice to say here that this is not, in fact, a marginal topic.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I was about to post a VfD myself, but it looks like <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChamaeleon_1199.html" title="User:Chamaeleon">User:Chamaeleon</a> beat me to it. Good to know I'm not alone. This was originally a section of the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalization.html" title="Anti-globalization">Anti-globalization</a> article created by <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">User:TDC</a>. It was overwhelmingly rejected on the Talk page for that article on NPOV grounds, and reverted multiple times. Since TDC continued to revert it back, he was eventually given a 24-hour block for violation of the 3RR. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-globalization&amp;diff=10340138&amp;oldid=10337479" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-globalization&amp;diff=10340138&amp;oldid=10337479" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> shows, TDC was clearly writing with the intent of furthering a specific POV. After several more reverts by various users, <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">User:Sam Spade</a> unilaterally spun this section off into a separate article. This article should be deleted: it consists entirely of content that was rejected for NPOV reasons, the article title is inherently NPOV, and the topic is not broad enough to warrant an article. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 12:09, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> delete this article, it dresses itself up as informative but is totally biased. It does not define anti-globalization, or anti "neo-liberal" policies, which are about opposing richer countries using indebtedness and trade law (and war) to control smaller economies and enrich a very tiny fraction of the world's population at the expense of the rest. To the extent that this is being imposed on the middle east, yes, people in those countries will oppose it, but this article has nothing to do with explaining those policies themselves.

</ul>
<p>I think a good place to start my argument it to examine what the prereqresites for a Wikipedia article are.</p>
<p>One generally recognized qualification is the topic in question notable? In the case of Anti-Semitism in the Ant-globalization movement a Google search turns up 12,300 on the subject <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=anti-semitism+anti-globalization&amp;spell=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=anti-semitism+anti-globalization&amp;spell=1" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. This is certainly much more notable, at least by this commonly used standard, than many articles in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Secondly, is the material well sourced. Even a cursory look at the material in question will show that all opinions are very clearly stated as such and all opinions are sourced back to the individuals who made them. These individuals are, I might add, not obscure kooks, but are relatively prominent individuals.</p>
<p>There have been articles about this written in the Financial Times, Washington Times, National Review, The New Republic,</p>
<p>Now with this in mind, ask yourself this question&#160;?even though I may not agree that the anti-globalization movement is rife with Jew haters, is there a significant number of people in the world that do believe this??, if you answered yes, and I think that by the Google citation alone we can see that there is a significant number of people who believe this to be the case, then there really is not other option then to vote to keep.</p>
<p>How fucking ridiculous is this, anyways? Some Wikipedians do not like a certain segment in an article so they work to have its content banned from Wikipedia all together?</p>
<ul>
<li><i>For example, a couple of right-wingers can only revert an article a total of four times before violating the three-revert rule. Ten progressives each committing to voting just once can easily overcome this and more. By working together, we can stamp out certain POVs.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Chamaeleon/Sandpit5" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Chamaeleon/Sandpit5" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Let me be a bit more specific who I am talking about here, Chamaeleon. Here we have a contributor who sees it as his mission to band together with likeminded folk and marginalize&#160;?certain POV?s?. Not all POV?s, not dishonest POV?s, but POV?s that he sees as representing&#160;?bad stuff?.</p>
<p>First the information is stripped from its original article, and shoveled into a new one which then can be speedily deleted.</p>
<p>They have a term for tactics like this, its called airbrushing, and has no place here.</p>
<p>Vote to keep! <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">TDC</a> 13:36, Apr 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This does seem to be a legitimate topic judging by Google searches. I've tidied it up a bit, have added a couple of extra sources, have found links for the quotes already there, and have added a references section. The article needs to be expanded, and examples should be given of actions or statements by anti-globalization protestors that are regarded by others as anti-Semitic. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:12, Apr 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>How do you distinguish "main criticisms against anti-globalization" from other criticisms? How do you decide which ones are more "notable" than others, and which are mere "smear campaigns"? The article itself seems remarkably "resistant" to any sort of criticism; a perusal indicates that fully half of the small "Criticisms" section is itself devoted to "counter-Criticisms" defending the movement. Furthermore, a review of the edit history indicates that the excision of this material was done after it had existed there for over a month, and after an apparent consensus to leave it in by the very editor who decided weeks later to excise it. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 04:10, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Copied from above: If I could briefly respond to that note: This isn't about notability, it's about it being a pov fork in that the phenomenon is too marginal to be written on outside the main article (and when it does, pov is the result).

<ul>
<li>It's clear from <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalization.html" title="Anti-globalization">Anti-globalization</a> that there was an attempt by several editors to delete all mention of anti-Semitism from the article, or drastically reduce it, which is worrying. Therefore, that section was moved to its own space and has been extended and referenced, and if it stays, will be extended further, so it is no longer appropriate to move it back. This is a legitimate topic, much discussed in Europe by academics and journalists, and is part of the drift of the far Left to the right, focused in particular on the anti-globalization and anti-war movements. I've yet to see an argument, as opposed to an assertion, from anyone that this topic or the title is either non-notable or is <i>inherently</i> POV, which is what would have to be shown for it to be legitimately deleted. Here is a paper <a href="http://www.axt.org.uk/HateMusic/Cohen_essay_October_04.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.axt.org.uk/HateMusic/Cohen_essay_October_04.pdf" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> (pdf) on "The British Left and the Jews" by Ben Cohen, a journalist and broadcaster who has served with the United Nations Protection Force. He argues that "the delegitimisation offensive against Israel presently pursued by sections of the anti-globalisation movement, the far Left and certain periodicals of the moderate Left&#160;? many of whose themes are shared by Islamists and parts of the far right&#160;? can reasonably be said to have begun in the aftermath of the 1967 war. It was then that the difference between the anti-Zionism of the <i>ancien</i> Left and that espoused by its new incarnation was established. As Robert Wistrich has argued, in becoming a&#160;?code word for the forces of reaction in general,? Zionism assumed a global importance for the contemporary Left that not even Marx and Lenin could have foreseen. Consequently,&#160;?[t]he extreme Left in western societies not only denigrates Israel and Zionism in a systematic manner, but its irrational hostility frequently spills over into contempt or antipathy towards Jews and Judaism as such." Perhaps if we want to continue this, we should go to the talk page so as not to take up more space.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is not an article. It's a completely superfluous list of "A wrote this, B wrote that, but C wrote <i>this."</i> I think <i>any</i> article that has "and" plus an "-ism"-word in the title is bound to the become a POV-edit war ground. Strongly reminds me of the fiasco at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_and_Nazism?redirect=no" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_and_Nazism?redirect=no" rel="nofollow">Socialism and Nazism</a> (moved to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism_and_socialism?redirect=no" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism_and_socialism?redirect=no" rel="nofollow">Nazism and socialism</a>; both are today simple redirects). We don't need such articles. One can find X-haters <i>anywhere</i>, in <i>any</i> group. Discuss the phenomenon in general at an article "Anti-X", give a few pertinent examples there, and don't try to denounce any group that was ever accused by somebody of being "anti-X" or of having members behaving "anti-Xish". Substitute your favourite POV/religion/sex/doctrine/... for X. If the "X-hate" in a group G dominates other aspects of that group, and is reported by various sources, discuss the phenomenon at length in an article on group G. But do <i>not</i> create "articles" entitled "G and Anti-Xism" or similar. BTW, I think <i>all</i> the proposed renamings below fall under "similar".

<dd>As I've said above, regarding article titles, the sources describe it as "Anti-Semitism", not "Anti-Zionism"; you can't just decide they meant something else. As for the name, "Allegations of" or "Alleged" are, as far as I can tell, not used in article titles; rather, the topic is cited neutrally, and the pros and cons are hashed out in the article. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:08, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Disagree - sources may discuss "anti-semitism" instead of "anti-zionism", but all of the discussion relates to opposition to Israel/support of Israel.

<dd>OK - I tried to track this down on Google: <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Hanwell+Beer+Festival%22&amp;filter=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Hanwell+Beer+Festival%22&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> points only to Wikipedia and a site which no longer holds the relevant page. But the festival seems to be held each Easter at "The Fox Pub, Green Lane, Hanwell". That was enough to then find a cider wiki <a href="http://ukcider.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Current_events" class="external autonumber" title="http://ukcider.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Current_events" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> saying that at Easter 2005 they had 17 beers and 2 ciders for drinkers to try. This looks very minor and local with little prospect of expanding to be encyclopedic. Are you really suggesting that every regular marketing event in every pub should have an article? --<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">Henrygb</a> 23:03, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Mention of it is also in <a href="http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/holland/holland.html" class="external text" title="http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/holland/holland.html" rel="nofollow">Frederick Douglass The Colored Orator: Holland, Frederic May, 1836-1908</a>. To wit: "But on every steamboat, in every omnibus, railroad car, where Douglass was tabood, solely because of color, there was Wendell Phillips ready to take his seat beside his 'despised and rejected' brother, vastly to the annoyance of conductors and agents, who couldn't help feeling the scandal and disgrace of the miserable colorphobia, so pointedly rebuked." Basically, this term was in wide use during the nineteenth century and common knowledge of it makes it worthy of an article signifying that it as notable. Colorphobia is not a dicdef it is a scientific <a href="../../../p/h/e/Phenomenon.html" title="Phenomenon">phenomenon</a>. An empirical statistical analysis of the facts will bear that statement out. A google search will probably produce the same level of trivia as would a search for afrophobia on google. However, a search for "colorphobia and douglass" or "colorphobia and grimke" or "colorphobia and garrison" will produce results demonstrative of the substantial facts supporting the article. I welcome the challenge this VfD represents. Any attempt to repudiate the facts presented as to the historical nature of the term colorphobia will only reveal further support for this article.</li>

<p>Absoutely nonsense. Do a search on "Clunky cartridge button." Nothing. Then copy/paste "cartridge button" with "NES" on a search engine form. Nothing related to what the contributor was typing.

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't think it's absolutely nonsense, I just think the contributor has weak English-language writing skills. The article is about the NES cartridge eject button. But I just don't think that an article about an allegedly unreliability in the cartridge connector system of a long-since-obsolete video game system has any potential to become encyclopedic.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm quite familiar with the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_Entertainment_System_c10f.html" title="Nintendo Entertainment System">NES</a> and with the phenomenon he's describing, but this article is misnamed, and the topic is not broad enough to warrant an article of its own. What he is referring to, I think, is the weak <a href="../../../z/i/f/ZIF_8edb.html" title="ZIF">ZIF</a> cartridge connector used in the NES, which often made poor contact with carts and resulted in the cartridge failing to boot and the red power <a href="../../../l/e/d/LED_53e0.html" title="LED">LED</a> on the front of the system flashing on and off. Many of you who used to own a NES are probably familiar with this. I should insert a paragraph in the original NES article about this phenomenon, as it is not currently listed, but it doesn't deserve a separate article. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 00:48, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I wrote a discussion page about this; plus the eject button on the SNES is not as cluncky plus we insert cartridges right into the SNES and on the NES, there is a physical clunky on/off switch for the cartridge insersion.

<li>'<i>Rewrite</i> NPOV - this is an excerpt based upon a 1975 Law Journal Article. This is the basis for the <i>no fault</i> divorce reform but must be rewritten since this is a source article.</li>
<li><b>Rewrite</b> There is very little material that I have been able to find about the true events that occurred when the soviets banned the bourgeoise institution of the family. This article contains some useful references that should be followed up, i.e. not deleted, and the contributor encouraged to share more of his knowledge, particularly if he has books at his disposal. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Stannard_9e17.html" title="User:Matthew Stannard">Matt Stan</a> 23:56, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I suspect that the primary reason you haven't found material about "the true events that occurred when the soviets banned the bourgeoise institution of the family" is that the Soviets never did any such thing. The USSR committed enough actual atrocities that we don't have to charge them with made-up ones. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 06:31, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>KeeP</b> Simply because one does not want to read the truth about the actions of the Bolshiveks does not take away the legitimacy of this article. This is not the place for revisionist history.</li>
<li>This excerpt was moved out of the Fathers' Rights discussion. It is missing the reference to the peer-reviewed law journal article by Bolas, D. A., ‚ÄúNo-Fault Divorce: Born in the Soviet Union, Journal of Famly Law, Volume Fourteen, Number One, pp 31 ‚Äì 59.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Woohookitty, please don't write such silly things in public. I change "Soapboxish" to "Excellent!" Bolas' article is <i>the</i> definitive history of no-fault divorce. It was published in a reputable, referreed law journal. What you object to are the facts. The Bolas law journal article is not POV. This is clearly an area in which you do not know the facts and are only echoing your social prejudices.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>By the way - I know this is probably the wrong place to ask, but can we get neutral parties to overview the content of the main <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fathers%27_rights.html" title="Fathers' rights">Fathers' rights</a> article? While the movement is newsworthy enough to deserve an article, the existing article is hopelessly POV, consisting largely of propaganda couched in weasel words. (Examples: "This has led to speculation by fathers' rights campaigners that there are elements in society that would rather have a child brought up in a single parent household by the mother even when the father is available to share in the upbringing of his child." And "The issue for fathers' rights activists is not one of mens' rights versus feminism, as some would suppose, and fathers' rights activists have been at pains to point out that the adversarial family law system can occasionally operate as badly, if not worse, for mothers who are separated from their children by hostile fathers". Both of which I have removed, along with unsourced comments trying to tar no-fault divorce by comparison with Leninist atrocities.) I'd like to see this entire article rewritten from a NPOV. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 18:24, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> This is a patchwork article comprised almost entirely of copypastes from three or four other websites, and a quick Google search found two distinctly different sides of this issue.

<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b> The source is a refereed Law Journal. As even my 9 year old knows, a Google search does not constitute research. There are not different sides to the facts - this is not an opinion piece. Would you argue so emotionally if the topic were "Russian Communist attempt to abolish war?" I think not.

<ul>
<li><b>Vote Change to Merge and Rewrite</b> - The article's title itself is loaded, and while the facts don't change, the presentation spins them towards a direct, distinct POV that is at odds with several other equally or more prominent sources. Here's one: <a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1984/women/09-revrus.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1984/women/09-revrus.htm" rel="nofollow">International Struggle and the Marxist Tradition, Vol. 1</a> Yes, the writer is a Marxist. However, the writer of the source the article cites is a Russian woman, the group most affected and thus the most likely to be biased, as can be seen <a href="http://www.lbduk.org/russian_effort_to_abolish_marria.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.lbduk.org/russian_effort_to_abolish_marria.htm" rel="nofollow">Here.</a> Both sources are likely biased in opposite directions, but the article is very clearly POV favoring the second article. Thus, perhaps it can be saved, but it needs a serious overhaul to be able to do that. Trylobyte 01:59, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>What I want to know is why this article has had so many deletions and edits. It is only about half the size that it was on April 1st. Please, someone revert this article and protect it on the BJADN.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm torn between BJAODN and Wikipedia:, but clearly, it doesn't belong in the article namespace. Equally clearly, it shouldn't be deleted permanently, and *the history shouldn't be lost, either*. Comedy by committee is always suspect, and the original should be visible. Let us note *also*, though, that many places (including me) probably *linked* to it, and the links shouldn't die. If it was originally in the WP namespace, and I think it was, let it be removed henceforth to the space time from which it came... --<a href="../../../b/a/y/User%7EBaylink_cb4a.html" title="User:Baylink">Baylink</a> 15:27, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Is Wikipedia really being taken over by Britannica? If not, then the article is a bad waste of our space. Delete. Changed my mind, now that I know what BJAODN stands for. I specially liked actually the references to spirit's such as <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis</a>. <b>BJAODN</b> "<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntonioMartin_6aa4.html" title="User:AntonioMartin">Antonio one a Wikipedian Always a Wikipedian Martin</a>"</li>

<p>Guys, are you serious with redirect? Are you sure that "roach hotel" is used in the same sense as "roach motel"? And by the way, there is a direct, original meaning of the term "roach hotel". And what about a (lousy) computer game "Roach Hotel" by Micro-Lab? What about doing some research before voting? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 18:15, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I say redirect to roach motel because I believe that the term "roach hotel" is itself a neologism. Since it bears a close resemblance to the term <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roach_motel.html" title="Roach motel">Roach motel</a>, it should be redirected there. If you know of a real use of the term "Roach hotel", independant of "roach motel", please inform us of what it is. If you believe that the computer game deserves an entry, you are entitled to write one. However, a google search for "Roach hotel" + micro gets 84 hits, so I'm inclined to think the game is not notable. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">Dave the Red</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDaveTheRed_011a.html" title="User talk:DaveTheRed"><i>(talk)</i></a> 22:20, Apr 5, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I second... er fifth the <b>redirect</b> - if there's anything to be said about the term "roach hotel", it can be said on the roach motel page anyway - no one would bother calling something a roach hotel unless they were trying to sound like roach motel. -- <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">8^D</a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="DarkGreen">gab</font></sup></a> 07:53, 2005 Apr 6 (UTC)</li>
