<p>The subject of the article is a young actress who has so far only appeared in one movie where she is a minor named character; this does not sufficiently pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> for an actor/actress. Internet searchs provide nothing reliable besides mention of her minor role in <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_of_Rock_0488.html" title="School of Rock">School of Rock</a>. The page has also been subject to extraneous and trivial information added by IPs. If reliable, third party sources can be provided that further her notability, this shouldn't be a problem. I have not problem with there being a page if and/or when she takes part in more movies, or at least a larger role in a notable one. -- <a href="../../../m/o/e/User%7EMoeron_c492.html" title="User:Moeron"><font color="darkblue" size="2" face="Constantia"><b>moe.RON</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoeron_169b.html" title="User talk:Moeron"><b><font color="red"><i>Let's talk</i></font></b></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Moeron_ba14.html" title="Special:Contributions/Moeron"><b><font color="green"><i>done</i></font></b></a></sup> 19:09, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think it should stay, for various reasons. Firstly, she has more than a few lines in these films, and I'm sure people would like to search up on her! As well as this, she is likely to be in films more in the future, meaning that her popularity is only going to improve, and then this will already be here, like it should anyway with her being an actress. And she isn't that minor at all really. I can't really explain it too well, so I'm not making it sound as good as it really is, but it should really stay here though, and a lot of people do actually like her also!</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> although I love the movie and love the character, she <i>really</i> doesn't meet WP's notability criteria (yet).

<li>I think it should stay. Wikipedias goal is to have as much knowlege as possible correct? Well by deleting this it would limit the knowlege and show decreases. Plus if you look back on any actors or actresses career a lot of them do one commericial when they are 11 then stay out of Hollywood until they are 22 (finished University) then they work there way up to the top with smaller roles than this. She had around 20 somelines which is pretty big, plus she had to act without roles constinatnly. For example; when she Was listening to Zach's song, or when she was with Franky when he told Miss Mullens "your the man", or how she had to act enthusiastic at the end. She may not have been the star of the scenes but imagine Zach singing to nobody "that would be weird". Ok, directors will also most likely use her as tributes to Schoool of Rock. This can boost her popularity tremendously and thus make her the next Star. And wouldn't want you to have her a site on WP when that happens?

<li>No, Wikipedia's goal is <i>not</i> to have "as much knowledge as possible". That's why we have a policy about <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, guidelines about <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">notability</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, and a whole list of things (policy again) that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a>. We don't (for example) want articles about <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">things made up in school one day</a>, even though that is, technically, knowledge. Anyway, the verifiability policy means that we're not "limiting knowledge", because everything in Wikipedia has to be traceable to other sources, which means the information is still available. If you want to create a fan page, there are plenty of free hosting services out there that will allow you to do so, but Wikipedia is not the place for it. As I said, I loved the movie, and thought Ms. Afflerbach did a fine job in it, but until she actually <i>becomes</i> "the next Star", she shouldn't have a Wikipedia page. But she can certainly have as many fan pages <i>elsewhere</i> as the traffic will bear. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 21:15, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I say we keep the page and merge it with other the Other School of Rock Groupie to make a "school of Rock groupie page" or you give her or her fan base several days to create a fan hosting page which when created will be given 2 days on wikipedia saying this site has been moved away from wikipedia to a new website. Then after the 2 days delete the site. Again the merge is preferable but creating a free hosted site is quiet easy. And me and my collegues would be willing to help create and run it.

<li>I rekon this page should be kept. I agree that in the future, and even now, she will get bigger as a star, and therefore it would be better if the article was kept, and a lot of people seem to like her in SOR, where her part is definitely what I wouldn't call small! It's important, and really, quite big, it just ain't one of the main ones, but they're not just the big ones, and more importantly, they're not just the important ones. Veronica is an important one, and an important person. I reckon it should be kept on Wikipedia like it is now. I know she ain't the biggest of stars (yet, at least), but that can, and probably will, change as the time continues; Wikipedia is good for finding things out, and I actually am very surprised it's up for possible deletion. Something like this must surely be here. I say keep, for sure! And although this is just one entry, it's the opinion of many of us, here at the college.

<li><b>Delete</b> I think it deserves to be deleted. Her role in the movie is very peripheral. If she was one of the main characters then you can argue that an article about her should exist. But that's not the case. She is not notable enough for an article on wikipedia, at least for now. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFighting_for_Justice_4e45.html" title="User:Fighting for Justice">Fighting for Justice</a> 04:35, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
