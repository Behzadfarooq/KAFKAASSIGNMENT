<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>. Discounting socks and newbies, the consensus seems fairly solid. As Jayjg points out, lists of this sort implicate fundamental questions of NPOV; at the very least, selectively permitted some "terrorist by nationality" lists and not others is problematic. As suggested also, imprecise definitions of "terrorist" and "Pakistani" call into question whether the list is meaningful and maintainable. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 15:17, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> This is not about Pakistani terrorists operating within Pakistan. This is about terrorist of Pakistani origin (most of them not Pakistani citizens), operating outside of Pakistan. <a href="../../../v/i/r/Viriditas.html" title="Viriditas">Viriditas</a> has been vandalizing the article, he has been removing the contents withought justification. This is an article containing a list and not a category. The information used for the article is widely published and readily available. Just click on the Wikipedia and external links provided.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobcotton_e6ca.html" title="User:Robcotton">Robcotton</a> 05:43, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The list you created is original research which duplicates an already existing category. Your definition of who is or isn't Pakistani is subjective and open to interpretation, and in the case of Haq, you list him as a terrorist based on your beliefs and not on reliable sources. Furthermore he was US-born, so how does that make him a Pakistani terrorist? Ramzi Yousef's nationality is disputed, Hasib Hussain was born in the UK, as was Shehzad Tanweer, Mohammad Sidique Khan, and Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh. The article as it stands is not based on objective criteria and reads as original research. You've also added speculative content to the article; Wikipedia does not engage in forecasting the future, as the "Yet to be named" news section you've added implies. And, who are the "Murderers of Indian diplomat Ravindra Mhatre", and if they can't be named, how do you know they are Pakistani terrorists? Also, the external links you provide do not seem to substantiate the article you created. Just because a UK-born terrorist might have a Pakistani father, does not imply that such a person is a "Pakistani terrorist"; that is your original research. More importantly, Wikipedia convention appears to categorize terrorists after their place of birth, not by the ethnicity or nationality of their mother or father as you are doing. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 06:32, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment: Question of nationality</b>&#160;;<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a>'s text justifies why the article is called "Terrorists of Pakistani origin" (and not "Pakistani terrorists"). There is a common thread among them, and yet most of the persons listed are not Pakistani citizens. This is an useful article with an appropriate theme.--<a href="../../../i/s/k/User%7EISKapoor_fb2c.html" title="User:ISKapoor">ISKapoor</a> 19:45, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We use nationality for categorization for the sole reason that it is verifiable. How do you even begin to verify "descent"? This is completely absurd and serves no useful, informative, or encyclopedic purpose other than to push POV and original research. What does it mean to be of "Pakistani origin" and how do you verify it? We don't list occupations in this way for that reason. What's next, List of engineers of Indian origin? <a href="../../../i/n/d/Category%7EIndian_engineers_fc74.html" title="Category:Indian engineers">Category:Indian engineers</a> exists because it is verifiable and helps sort the engineer category. Why is "descent" notable, and what usefulness does it impart? —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 05:07, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

In its present form it pushes a POV that "descent" is a notable feature of a person being a terrorist.

<li><b>Keep</b> it is a notable list and one that shouldn't be hard to source. If it is not possible to source the ethnicity then it's OR and will have to go but otherwise there do not appear to be any reasons to delete. Ethnicity is a valid descriptor, the US for instance would describe Pakistanis who are American citizens as Pakistani-American. The article does not duplicate category:Pakistani terrorists as that only refers to those with Pakistani citizenship. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 11:24, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On the contrary, the list duplicates <a href="../../../p/a/k/Category%7EPakistani_terrorists_549d.html" title="Category:Pakistani terrorists">Category:Pakistani terrorists</a> with two entries, <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Hakim_Murad_%28terrorist%29_779f.html" title="Abdul Hakim Murad (terrorist)">Abdul Hakim Murad</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramzi_Yousef_e892.html" title="Ramzi Yousef">Ramzi Yousef</a>, with the rest belonging to other categories as Kaustuv Chaudhuri and myself point out above. Articles should follow the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_of_people_2346.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization of people">Wikipedia:Categorization of people</a> guideline. Terrorists are categorized by their nationality, not by "descent", "origin", or ethnicity. For examples, see Category:Nationalities by occupation and Category:Occupations by nationality. While there is nothing stopping anyone from adding these terrorists to the appropriate subcat under <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_by_ethnic_or_national_origin_6af9.html" title="Category:People by ethnic or national origin">Category:People by ethnic or national origin</a> (such as adding <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naveed_Afzal_Haq_168c.html" title="Naveed Afzal Haq">Naveed Afzal Haq</a> to <a href="../../../p/a/k/Category%7EPakistani_Americans_b512.html" title="Category:Pakistani Americans">Category:Pakistani Americans</a>) occupations are not categorized in this manner. This ignores the fact that <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobcotton_e6ca.html" title="User:Robcotton">User:Robcotton</a> added Haq as a "terrorist" for no other reason than he thinks its the right thing to do, sans sources.

<li>That would be a good reason to expand the category then. The list is longer since a lot of it seems to be crystal ball gazing, and who counts as "Pakistani" or even a "terrorist" is ill-defined. --<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinjaCharlie_3773.html" title="User:NinjaCharlie">NinjaCharlie</a> 15:10, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>With no exceptions all articles on these terrorists mention their ethnic roots. The question here is one of categorisation, not political correctness. (PC is itself a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> in any case.) The situation here is akin to creating a list of criminals who play video games or list of opponents of same-sex marriage with gay children.

If you want to talk about research in these matters, why don't you follow the research being done that shows that none of the people mentioned by the CIA and US Govt had anything to do with it, you can look at Loose Change video for a very very thorough treatment of 9/11. The term Pakistani origin is v v much debatable, you can also say the person was from an Indian origin as Pakistan used to be part of India, you can also say British empire origin as India was a colony, you can also say more. I'd rather stick to the present nationality and beleifs of the person.

2. The article using only well known sources, articles with similar theme have been published in newspapers. The topic has also been addressed in books. It has been widely discussed that ethnic links are often used for recruiting.<br />

<li>The article duplicates <a href="../../../p/a/k/Category%7EPakistani_terrorists_549d.html" title="Category:Pakistani terrorists">Category:Pakistani terrorists</a>, as we categorize terroists by nationality, not by ethnicity. It appears you created the article to attack Muslims and people of Pakistani descent, and this is not acceptable, nor encyclopedic. For the most part, the article consists of original research, since many of the terrorists you list cannot be accurately described as "Terrorists of Pakistani origin", either because their nationality is disputed, their ethnicity cannot be verified, or in some cases they may have dual nationalities and multiple ethnicities. You have engaged in crystal ball gazing many times, the most notable being your repeated inclusion of <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naveed_Afzal_Haq_168c.html" title="Naveed Afzal Haq">Naveed Afzal Haq</a> on the list, even after it was explained to you that he is not officially classified as a "terrorist". There is absolutely no reason why this article should exist as it does not adhere to any known Wikipedia policy, and only serves your personal agenda. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 00:38, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

Terrorism is not longer contained within the borders of individual nations. We are considering aspects of international terrorism here. Pakistanis in UK often marry their relatives from Pakistan, they visit Pakistan frequently (nothing wrong with those), but these ties are exploited by recruiters. Many UK Pakistanis also interact with militants in Pakistan when they are there.

<li>Er, did you even bother to look at the links? Just because Rob adds so-called refs, doesn't mean they support his case. Why don't you look at them? Rob claims that Pakistani ethnicity is an important component of terrorism, but this pet theory is <i>not</i> supported by any one reference he has posted, nor can those who have emigrated to other countries be accurately described as Pakistani in all cases. Since when has Wikipedia become a platform for Rob's pet theories? There are many things that have contributed to terrorism, and ethnicity does not happen to be one of them. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 20:28, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>So, asking a relevant, topical question is now considered badgering? That's very interesting. Call it whatever you like. Nids explicitly offered more reasons for keeping this artice. I'm taking him up on his offer. Question for nids: Why should we keep articles composed of unverified original research related to racial "descent"? The page lists Hamid Hayat as a terrorist, although he's never been one. The page lists the Heathrow ammonium nitrate case, although this is a case of suspected terrorism, not actual, with the suspects coming from Muslim family originally from Pakistan. Ramzi Yousef says he was born in Kuwait, and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed says he spent time in Kuwait as well, so why are they listed as Pakistani terrorists and not Kuwaiti? Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh was born in the UK, and details about his racial "descent" are not mentioned. How is an article composed of original research and unverified information useful to an encyclopedia? —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 20:09, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>viriditas, you are right in saying that unverified claims should not enter the articles. But are you also rejecting the verified claims. And what about the books mentioned above.

<li>What is the nature of Sheikh's "descent" and how is it applicable? You are arguing that ethnicity is an important part of Terrorism, so surely you should be able to provide details, such as the name of his particular ethnic group and a citation showing a clear correlation. You can't and you haven't, except for posting a link to a book that mentions the word "Pakistan" once, and a link to an article in <i>The Guardian</i> about the relationship between ethnic groups and religion.

NPOV and fact-research problems in an article are not usually grounds for deletion. You have grounds for deletion when these problems are intrinsic to the nature of the article.

However, have any reliable sources actually conducted an analysis of the relationship between Pakistani <i>origin</i> (as opposed to <i>nationality</i> or <i>social affiliation</i>) and terrorism? If not, this entire article is original research because it is the first to conclude that there is such a relationship.

<li><b>Comment: I have to say that Viriditas is skilled in arguing and sophistry. Let us look at what Viriditas has been trying to do</b>.
<ul>
<li>Right at the beginning (near the top of this page,) he argued: <i>"definition of who is or isn't Pakistani is subjective and open to interpretation"</i> . <b>cleverly conflating individual of "Pakistani origin" and those of "Pakistani citizenship" by using the term "Pakistani"</b>. Then he goes on to argue whether some of individuals can be called "Pakistani" because of their being born in UK etc. Note that the article is clearly named <b>Terrorists of Pakistani Origin</b>, it is not <b>Pakistani Terrorists</b>; and I had clearly referred to that right before his note.</li>
<li>Also note that he made a suggestion about the article which is incompatible with his objections. A classic technique <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catch-22_%28logic%29.html" title="Catch-22 (logic)">Catch-22 (logic)</a>. He wants the article to be merged with the category "Category:Pakistani terrorists" ( see article with the tag he placed) and however then then goes on to argue that the people listed are not "Pakistani".</li>
<li>Note that I have added a couple more refereces. For those who have access to today's Wall Street Journal, read the detailed article "Terror plot exposes flaws in how UK tackles extremism", Aug. 18, 2006. It also includes a map of London area showing Walthamstow (see <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,6-2318083,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,6-2318083,00.html" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>).--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobcotton_e6ca.html" title="User:Robcotton">Robcotton</a> 20:20, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Tell us then, how you determine someone is of Pakistani origin and why it is an important part of terrorism? Take a look at <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_groups_in_Pakistan_fe8a.html" title="Ethnic groups in Pakistan">Ethnic groups in Pakistan</a>, too. The category mentioned above covers Pakistani terrorists, and guidelines specifically mention how to categorize people. Occupations such as "terrorist" are not categorized by ethnicity, but by nationality. You are trying to make the case that ethnicity is a notable part of terrorism, when in fact, there is no evidence that it is. You are doing this because you read the words "of Pakistani descent" in an article about a terrorist, not because there is any relationship between the two: that's where your original research comes in. If you want to make the case that there are Pakistani terrorist organizations, you can add them to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_terrorist_organisations.html" title="List of terrorist organisations">List of terrorist organisations</a>, or you can describe the roots of the problem in <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism_in_Pakistan_98e9.html" title="Terrorism in Pakistan">Terrorism in Pakistan</a> and related articles. You cannot, however, create an article based on ethnicity and then claim there is a notable relationship. You have not posted one single, credible source that directly makes this claim about people of Pakistani origin. You have, however, added citations that describe the relationship between ethnicity and religion. Your thesis has nothing to do with people of Pakistani descent, and everything to do with Pakistani Muslims. Perhaps you should create an article entitled Pakistani Muslims as an offshoot of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_Pakistan_5b21.html" title="Islam in Pakistan">Islam in Pakistan</a>, or add referenced information to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_the_United_Kingdom_642f.html" title="Islam in the United Kingdom">Islam in the United Kingdom</a>. There is no need for this article, but categories such as <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBritish_Muslims_d736.html" title="Category:British Muslims">Category:British Muslims</a> could be expanded. If you know the particular Pakistani ethnic group that the person you are writing about belongs to, I don't see any reason why you can't add them to a subcat within <a href="../../../e/t/h/Category%7EEthnic_groups_in_Pakistan_922f.html" title="Category:Ethnic groups in Pakistan">Category:Ethnic groups in Pakistan</a>. As it stands, the term "Terrorist of Pakistani origin" is meaningless and uninformative. You need to quantify exactly what you mean by the term, and categorize accordingly. If you feel a list is needed or required by the list guidelines, then there is nothing stopping you from adding notable people of those particular ethnic groups to ethnic group lists if the category doesn't already suffice for your purpose. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 21:21, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
