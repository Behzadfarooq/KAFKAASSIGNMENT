<li><b>Strong, speedy, super punk rock keep</b> - First, thanks to trials for making this AfD, which is preferable to the speedy delete another editor inflicted upon it. I have been encouraged not to make any aspersion about the editors who tried to knock this down, so I will say this... we have an article on <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximumrocknroll.html" title="Maximumrocknroll">Maximumrocknroll</a> and on <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_Planet_e401.html" title="Punk Planet">Punk Planet</a>, and this zine is in that category. I'm not entirely sure what verification is needed. HaC has just always been around, just like <a href="../../../e/b/u/Ebullition_Records_1b8d.html" title="Ebullition Records">Ebullition Records</a>, it's an establishment within the <a href="../../../d/i/y/DIY_03f9.html" title="DIY">DIY</a> scene. Do you need distribution numbers? Letters from all the record stores that have sold it? Personal notes from the notable bands that pay attention to it? I am open to including or finding whatever you need, but this article was targeted in bad faith because the zine itself is being used as a source in another article up for AfD. This is an attempt to discredit HaC as a credible and notable zine, and therefore jeaopardize any bands with listings on Wikipedia that are made notable in part by their inclusion in this zine. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 21:19, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Keep by equivalent is never a strong argument. Just because the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Kennedys_1621.html" title="Dead Kennedys">Dead Kennedys</a> have an article it doesn't mean any punk band that strives to be the next Kennedys should get one. Especially with self-published zines what matters is if they themselves have been the subject of media or literary attention. So if any of the references in <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_scene.html#Bibliography" title="Punk scene">Punk scene#Bibliography</a> mentions HeartattaCk that's a good keep argument. "But <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximum_RocknRoll_6740.html" title="Maximum RocknRoll">Maximum RocknRoll</a> got an entry" isn't. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 21:32, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is, Kent STARTED the zine, but it's a collective of people who ran it and made it known. The zine is notable on its own, Kent is notable for other reasons besides the magazine, so it's two different articles (maybe I'll write one about him after this one passes AfD).&#160;:) <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 21:57, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Suggestion: how about providing a (verifiable, e.g. by issue number) list of notable bands HaC has interviewed?

<dd>Down that road lies madness. Who defines a notable band? Does every zine that bothers X number of bands that later become successful need an article, even if nothing else verifiable can be said about them? Let's stick instead to the applicable-to-every-topic standard of "Has the subject recieved nontrivial coverage in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> independent of the subject itself?" - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 21:53, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Isn't its publication, national distribution, and citation as a notable critical sources by several bands and zines who have been reviewed in it's pages, non-trivial enough?

<dd>I agree with you, MiB, that something you self-publish and mail to a few friends is not notable; however, if you did it 50 times with significant distribution, and if it had an impact on the subculture, it <i>would</i> be. On the other hand, the relationship between the subculture and the mass media is such that I wouldn't expect the <i>New York Times</i> to cover it; how often does the mainstream media write about <a href="../../../n/m/e/NME_8ba4.html" title="NME">NME</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximum_RocknRoll_6740.html" title="Maximum RocknRoll">Maximum_RocknRoll</a>? We've got to find a way that a significant contributor to the culture is considered important, even despite the biases of the mainstream culture. I agree that we're heading towards madness, for sure, but I think a weight-of-evidence approach here is appropriate.

<dd>Well, I don't know where you expect to find these kind of things when we're talking about a subcultre that keeps itself deliberatly marginal. Sorry, I would find it disappointing if articles about something like this were deleted for "technical" reasons while there are 10,000 articles about pointless aspects of TV shows, videos games, websites,etc. I vote for keep, is everyone voting to delete at least familiar with the magazine?<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan_Carkner_13c4.html" title="User:Dan Carkner">Dan Carkner</a> 02:51, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I don't deny that there are some real challenges for someone who wants to make a good article here. I've added some sources and some notes to the talk page. Much of the article is based on claims by the publisher--which is not unusual for a small periodical, but secondary sources would be better. Unfortunately the marginal nature of the publication results in secondary sources being mainly blogs and websites that don't normally meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. If, however, these sources are accurate (and they don't seem to be controversial) then this thing may have had a circulation of ~10,000 and represents a large enough community that this should be covered in the 'pedia. -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 04:05, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> the claims to notability made in this article just don't cut it. I'm open to being convinced, Sean Scallen photos move me, the zine <u>may</u> be notable. What is really lacking is other media commenting upon the influence of this zine. Back in the day (mid 80s for me) we knew that the zine Urgl-Orp was having an impact because <a href="http://www.factsheet5.org" class="external text" title="http://www.factsheet5.org" rel="nofollow">FactSheet5</a> said it was the best of it's genre (political punk zine). What does FF5 say about HeartattaCk? That would carry some weight. An earlier editor commented that a list of bands interviewed may demonstrate notability, I don't believe that. (For the second issue of my totally NN zine, I interviewed Dick Lucas, I'll be stunned if anyone can figure out it's name, it was "distributed" as far as Australia, the UK, etc). (will watch for further evidence) <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 05:55, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Pete.Hurd. I'm quoting <i><a href="../../../o/u/r/Our_Band_Could_Be_Your_Life_8606.html" title="Our Band Could Be Your Life">Our Band Could Be Your Life</a></i>: "Some of [the zines] grew quite large and influential — including <i><a href="../../../f/l/i/Flipside_%28fanzine%29.html" title="Flipside (fanzine)">Flipside</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximumrocknroll.html" title="Maximumrocknroll">Maximumrocknroll</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../f/o/r/Forced_Exposure_b355.html" title="Forced Exposure">Forced Exposure</a></i> — but there were literally hundreds of smaller zines that collectively framed the indie aesthetic." From the discussion here it's becoming clear that HeartattaCk was one of the hundreds. I'm happy to be contradicted though and recommend keep voters go <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=punk" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=punk" rel="nofollow">here</a> and search the books for mentions of HeartattaCk as a major influence on the punk scene. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 06:50, 12 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There seems to be a misconception here about the assertion of notability... there is no claim this zine was an influence on 70's 0r 80's punk. No, this zine was a staple of 90's and 00's hardcore and DIY punk. I think that has been proven with the sources that MrFizyx has provided. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 15:57, 12 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The only thing even approaching a reliable source I can see is a four-liner in Metro Santa Cruz (a free weekly), and that doesn't even establish the claim to notability, it just says HaC exists. What I said has nothing to do with era, it has something to do with our policies on outside sourcing, and the sheer lack of them in this article. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 17:21, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hey t&amp;e, you should update those articles with your quoted source since currently those don't meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> either. We have lots of articles on music magazines in the same situation, this isn't easy to fix. E.g. every Barnes &amp; Noble carries <i><a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitar_World_8675.html" title="Guitar World">Guitar World</a></i>, but if you want to describe its coverage and circulation the easiest thing to do is to go to the source itself (though in this case there are likely trade publications one might find, but not without serious effort). This scene is outside of my expertise. My concern has been that we were deleting this out of ignorance--perhaps some of you have enough punk cred that that I'm wrong about this though. -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 19:17, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article needs clean-up but this publication is certainly notable, well-known, and foundationally important to the American Hardcore scene. This is one of a handful of very important zines with good distribution (including maximumrocknroll, punk planet, under the volcano, and flipside) that functioned as a clearinghouse of information for punk, hardcore, and the DIY movement before (and while) the internet became so widespread.<a href="../../../c/d/a/User%7ECDaniel_7b46.html" title="User:CDaniel">CDaniel</a> 21:03, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> HeartattaCk is reasonably notable because it sold 10,000 copies of almost 50 different issues over the years. The issues that are still available will be gone shortly. Only a handful of punk zines have ever been able to achieve this feat. Those other zines include Flipside, Maximum RocknRoll, and Punk Planet. In an interview in 2000, Aaron Elliott was quoted as saying his Cometbus publication was being printed in quantities of 8,000, so at the time, even that legendary zine wasn’t selling as many copies. My point is that you can’t repeatedly sell 10,000 copies of a punk zine over a 12 year period without being a notable publication. Furthermore, this zine was a self-sustaining project after the first few years, so it wasn’t being run by a scam artist who was purchasing a bunch of stamps and inventing print run numbers since 1994 with the sole purpose of being included on Wikipedia in 2006. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartin062_6dac.html" title="User:Martin062">Martin062</a> 09:38, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>So you got a source for that? ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 00:52, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Take a look at the print run numbers source for yourself on <a href="http://www.operationphoenixrecords.com/archivespage.html" class="external text" title="http://www.operationphoenixrecords.com/archivespage.html" rel="nofollow">my site</a>. The HeartattaCk print run numbers are listed on page 2 of issue #3, page 2 of issue #5, and page 8 of issue #6 (upper right hand corner for all). The scans were taken from the original zines. The source for these zines not being available at this time is HeartattaCk’s official site, which is listed in the external links section. The source for the Cometbus print run number is Maximumrocknroll issue #200, and a copy of that interview can be seen <a href="http://www.operationphoenixrecords.com/archivespage.html" class="external text" title="http://www.operationphoenixrecords.com/archivespage.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Once again, a zine can be notable and relevant even if some of you haven’t heard of it. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartin062_6dac.html" title="User:Martin062">Martin062</a> 01:13, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Me haven't heard of it doesn't really mean anything. I've ok-ed many articles on subjects that I haven't heard of before, because others have and have reported on it in reliable sources. That's the whole concept behind Wikipedia, and as I've posted above there are in fact punk zines that have been covered. The literature on punk is actually quite large (although most of it is on 1976-87). So the numerous evasive arguments here ("why isn't the NYT article sourced?") and the reliance on personal experience makes me doubt the arguments that this zine was notable. Otherwise folks would've come up with quotes from now notable bands claiming that HaC was the first zine to review them, etc. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 16:49, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There’s nothing evasive about my argument. A rational person can easily argue that a zine selling so many issues over that length of time was notable and relevant. If it wasn’t, the zine would have ceased to exist many years ago. The lack of a mainstream news source reporting on the existence of HeartattaCk doesn’t diminish its importance or negate the facts surrounding its history. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartin062_6dac.html" title="User:Martin062">Martin062</a> 17:33, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I wasn't referring to your argument specifically. You actually cited a source, even though it's a primary one. This has also nothing to do with "importance" but with Wikipedia policies, which ask for backing of claims by reliable sources and prohibit original research. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 21:14, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why? WP is an encyclopedia for <i>all</i> people. Less than 100% of the people who read this article are into punk zines, so why should apparent canvassing occur? How would people "in the know" help? If they can add info to the article, then by all means, they should do so. But I'm sorry, PT- with this and Andrew Jackson Jihad, you do look as if you're trying to solicit&#160;!votes.
