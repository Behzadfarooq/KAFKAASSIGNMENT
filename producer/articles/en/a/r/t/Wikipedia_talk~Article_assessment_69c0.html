<p>The title here is confusing, but the idea is right. The focus should be on identifying a set of related works, and finding which ones are best among them; not on whether it is by 'rating' or whether it is about articles or lists or...</p>
<p>I would love to promote a weekly "content fair" where people submit articles related to a given subject, and they are rated; the collective can note whether some of them should really be flagged as "Good", sent to Cleanup or a suitable WikiProject, or <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">Featured candidates</a>, or sent to <a href="../../../p/r/_/WP%7EPR_690c.html" title="WP:PR">Peer review</a> for one reason or the other... and which are just ok, and which quite good. All the articles will benefit from seeing where they fall in comparison with related articles, seen through the eyes of third parties who care about (and perhaps even garden) the subject. The archive of the November 2005 <b>content fair discussion</b> about "Biographies of 18th century Astronomers" would be a useful historical record, as well.</p>
<p>Knowing in advance what topics will be covered, we could target the relevant <a href="../../../w/p/r/WP%7EWPR_d0a6.html" title="WP:WPR">Wikiprojects</a> as well.</p>
<p>We could start by having fairs focused on a single topic, though eventually large topics can start to hold their own booths at the fair, and the whole could scale quite nicely to hundreds of reviewers focusing on their favorite subfields. What do you think of that? <a href="../../../s/j/_/User%7ESj_7824.html" title="User:Sj">+sj</a> <a href="../../../s/j/_/User_talk%7ESj_d037.html" title="User talk:Sj">+</a> 19:26, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That all sounds great. To be honest I'd forgotten all about this idea - thanks for reminding me about it! With some of those suggestions I believe this could be a great project.

<dd>Interesting idea, but since Wikipedia is always changing, how will the ratings be anchored in any particular point? For instance, someone rating an article '7' at the beginning of the week might rate it '9' at the end of the week after changes are made. And am I correct in saying that an article receiving all 10s would be FA-level? --<a href="../../../d/m/u/User%7EDMurphy_2da6.html" title="User:DMurphy">DMurphy</a> 06:51, 13 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is a point, and I think it would be great to see such improvement. Hopefully this process will help improve articles, and if all it does is advertise an article then that would be a positive thing. I would think that an article with all 10s should be placed on peer review or FAC as it is going to be pretty damn good. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 18:49, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Would this encourage or discourage article improvement?

<dd>I think it will encourage article improvement. I've considered linking to the diff of the article as it stands as assessment begins, but I think that might discourage people from improving it. Perhaps someone that improves the article midweek could inform those that have assessed the article already, asking if they would kindly reevaluate their opinion. That's fine, and I think it would be a nice way to get some discussion going about what's needed in an article. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 15:01, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a good idea, and developing assessment guidance is something I would hope to introduce at some point. I wouldn't like to be as prescriptive as a marking grid, but to give a description for a few of the levels would certainly help ensure consistency. I would encourage people that assess an article to give at least some justification for the marks they give. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 19:06, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>violetriga, glad you came back to this&#160;:-) I really like the name, and will help out as I can. Drumming up support for a topic a week until there are regulars monitoring this talk page is probably a good idea before running proper contests.

<p>Thanks for taking the initiative and getting this started, Violet/Riga! I hope that I will be able to participate most weeks. I think this project is an excellent complement to some of the other assessment work going on, and as such I think we should make sure that everything is well coordinated with the work here.</p>
<p>At <a href="../../../1/2E/0/WP%7E1.0_7d3d.html" title="WP:1.0">WP:1.0</a>, we considered that assessment was a prerequisite before we could even consider producing a print/CD/DVD version of Wikipedia (the ultimate goal of WP1.0). We set up four sub-projects ,two of which use <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_Assessment_0e4d.html" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment">this assessment scheme</a>:</p>

</ul>
<p>We hoped that contacting the WikiProjects might stimulate interest in article assessment (by subject experts!), and we have been very pleased to see this beginning to happen.

<dd>There is certainly some great assessment work going on so far. Perhaps we should look at adopting that assessment scheme, if only to assume that there are equivalents (such as articles achieving a score of 9 or 10 are "A-Class").</dd>
<dd>Perhaps we should create Wikipedia:Assessment to list all the ongoing assessment projects.</dd>
<dd>Some of those "must have" articles could be included - it would be easy to choose languages as a topic, for example.

<p>I just discovered this article, and in all honesty my initial impression of it is that what you people do is pick a cluster of articles each week and appraise them. I've no doubt you mean well, but what it comes down to is that you really ought to do some actual work, like the <a href="../../../a/i/d/WP%7EAID_5121.html" title="WP:AID">WP:AID</a> or the <a href="../../../c/o/t/WP%7ECOTW_227d.html" title="WP:COTW">WP:COTW</a>, instead of going to a page and saying 'you know, you're not doing a very good job.' And that <i>is</i> what the dedicated purpose of this project is, too; I read the summary at the top of the page. Now, I have nothing against constructive criticism - hell, I'm a movie critic, being critical is my <i>job</i> - but Wikipedia allows more. Anybody sufficiently qualified to say 'you're not doing this right' is by definition someone who could do it better. -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 00:39, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This project praises good work and points out areas for improvement. It helps people to see what needs to be done to an article and helps to give wider attention to articles that would otherwise have a very small editor base. I've helped out loads of articles that I would not have even looked at previously. Your criticisms could just as easily be aimed at peer review and at todo boxes.</dd>
<dd>Any wikiproject that deals with the topic being assessed is welcome to use the information, and I've also considered the idea of a group of editors that go through the articles after the assessment period and fix them up, though that might be more difficult to arrange. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 00:54, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have also improved many articles from stubs to full-length articles, and I often find myself staring at a long article, wondering what to do next. Having an outsider (from this project) spend fifteen minutes providing some fresh, independent insights is IMHO very helpful for editors. I'm a chemist, so I wouldn't presume to make significant edits on the <a href="../../../a/u/r/Aurochs.html" title="Aurochs">Aurochs</a> article, but I hope my comments on it will guide an expert who can. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalkerma_c63c.html" title="User:Walkerma">Walkerma</a> 04:42, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Have any talk page templates been created for this process? I would think that a notification on article talk pages that <i>"this article is currently undergoing assessment"</i> and <i>"this article has an assessment that has been archived"</i> or something similar would help to involve those contributors that have been actively working on the articles being assessed. If none have been made and people agree they are a good idea, I can cook something up easily.

<p>When each article assessment is archived, would it be possible to make the date clearer? I found the date of each assessment on a side-box, but can the dates be added to the archive summary as well? Also, not everyone is aware that the assessment comments refer to the article as it was at that date, and not as it appears when reading the assessment (maybe years later). Could a standard blurb be added to the appropriate place for each assessment/archive explaining this? There is the option of linking to the actual version that was being assessed, but the disadvantage of that is that people can accidentally hit edit, miss the warning NOT to edit, and end up saving a <b>very</b> out-of-date version. My preference would be to link both the assessed version and the current version. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 08:56, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A <a href="../../../s/c/i/Wikipedia%7EScientific_peer_review_e9e6.html" title="Wikipedia:Scientific peer review">scientific peer review</a> has been started and we're looking for Wikipedians who are members of the scientific academic community to run for the board. If you want to give it a shot come over and post a little about yourself. New nominations are being accepted until the 00:00 on the 17th March.</p>
<p>The project aims to combine existing peer review mechanisms (<a href="../../../p/r/_/WP%7EPR_690c.html" title="WP:PR">Wikipedia peer review</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">featured article candidate discussion</a>, <a href="../../../a/a/_/WP%7EAA_0b5a.html" title="WP:AA">article assessment</a>, &amp;c.) which focus on compliance to manual of style and referencing policy with a more conventional peer review by members of the scientific academic community. It is hoped that this will raise science-based articles to their highest possible standards. Article quality and factual validity is now Wikipedia's most important goal. Having as many errors as Britannica is not good–we must raise our standards above this. --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldakQuill_3b15.html" title="User:OldakQuill">Oldak</a> <a href="../../../o/l/d/User_talk%7EOldakQuill_6507.html" title="User talk:OldakQuill">Quill</a> 17:58, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This project is great, as it helps to identify which articles are in need of improvement, but what could be really helpful is if the reviewers added a permalink to the version they're reviewing. For example, the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_assessment_Natural_disasters_Hurricane_Nora_%281997%29_f9b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Article assessment/Natural disasters/Hurricane Nora (1997)">assessment</a> on <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Nora_%281997%29_d5ba.html" title="Hurricane Nora (1997)">Hurricane Nora</a> states that the article does not have a single reference, and for someone who stumbles upon that page and compares it with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hurricane_Nora_%281997%29&amp;oldid=44604326" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hurricane_Nora_%281997%29&amp;oldid=44604326" rel="nofollow">current</a> version of the article will be confused, to say the least. It also helps identify improvements in articles after the assessment is done, which helps weigh the overall impact of assessing articles to begin with.

<p>I've wandered back here after a few months, hoping to find a growing collection of assessments, but find that things have, to say the least, died down a bit. What happened?</p>
<p>I think the idea of permalinking above (which I also suggested somewhere) is a good idea to get people contributing here more. It allows reviewers and later readers to see how something changed before and after the review period. I'm guessing that CotW, FA, GA all have similar "before" and "after" links to show how their processes have contributed to improving articles, and allows reviewers to take some of the credit for pointing out these improvements (while obviously not taking anything away from the editors who did the actual rewrites and improvements). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 16:08, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Maybe this is completely goofy. However, it seems to me that it would make sense to use any existing standards of "importance" in this process. Two ideas which come to mind are the books published by Carroll &amp; Graf listing what the editors found to be the 100 best books in the mystery, fantasy, modern fantasy, science fiction, and horror genres, the various other awards including general literary awards, that a book might have been considered for (like maybe the Booker Prize) and any other similar books ranking various books and/or other works. Queen's Quorum, a list of the most important mystery short-story collections, comes to mind hear, as does the recent BBC <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Read_e0e5.html" title="Big Read">Big Read</a> competition. Would it be of any use to include these lists somewhere here? Also, regarding the Carroll &amp; Graf and similar books, would including such a listing be potentially a violation of copyright, even if the titles were only listed in order and no "review" material were included? <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 15:24, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
