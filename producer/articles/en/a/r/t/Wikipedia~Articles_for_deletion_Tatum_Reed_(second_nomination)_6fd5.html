<li><b>Comment</b>— These porn star AfD discussions go on continuously on Wikipedia; somebody goes to quite a bit of trouble producing some rather well written articles; somebody values this material (I enjoy pornography as much as the next guy- actually I'm not sure that's true since I've not done a careful study on enjoyment of pornography - but there clearly is a constituency for this material). Is it time for a sister wiki, perhaps titled Wikiporn? We could get great sponsorships and might subsidize the main sites. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg (Bill)</a> 17:12, 27 August 2006 (UTC) <small>And, although humorous, this is a semi-serious question.</small>
<ul>
<li>There's a whole sub-industry of the Internet pornography industry that is devoted to <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googlebombing.html" title="Googlebombing">Googlebombing</a> porn actresses. Moreover, that someone has "gone to a lot of trouble" is not really relevant. Editors have written lengthy, well-wikified, articles about completely new made-up languages, before now. The appropriate things to discuss here are whether this person satisfies <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and the appropriate things to be looking at are whether the coverage in the <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Chronicle_5d76.html" title="San Francisco Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a></i> constitutes a non-trivial published work, and suchlike.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. The person is not a porn star - she's a $4,000 prostitute, as her site clearly indicates, and the movies are incidental to the sex-for-pay business. She fails PORNBIO, her business fails CORP, and she fails BIO absolutely. This person also contacted me after I closed the first deletion, admitting that the article was part of an orchestrated campaign of self-promotion, and asking me to reverse m decision. There was concsensus to delete in the first AfD, and nothing new have come up. We shouldn't even be here. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 18:46, 27 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The first AFD discussion didn't make any mention of sources at all. The article on her in the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> was not discussed, for example. The existence of multiple non-trivial published works from sources independent of the subject indicates notability, and two such works are cited by this article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:45, 28 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Eh... the SFChronicle is trivial - it's her restaurant picks for crying out loud, the other two are from PORNBIO land, and in the spirit of PORNBIO I would require 100, not "multiple". The Bio is OR, anyway - there just aren't reputable independent published sources detailing her biography that we could cite here. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 03:03, 28 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The <i>Chronicle</i> article has a paragraph of good, solid, biographical information at the start. The <i>AdultFYI</i> article has similar content, from which we can know that the subject studied ballet, is married, teaches Pilates, and so forth. Are you saying that the second isn't a reliable source? On what grounds? This person has a lot more information published about her, by a reliable source, than most porn actresses. Most porn actresses are <i>wholly unverifiable</i>, because the only biographical information for them is the potted blurb that comes along with the pictures — which is almost always a complete fiction created by some editor somewhere. Even the names aren't reliable. Whereas this person has interviews in newspapers. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:29, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, ballet. Not reliable b/c likely promotional, as is everything in the porn world, down to the googlebombing. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 11:00, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Relist</b> Here's the thing. I don't often visit wikipedia, unless Stephen Colbert has a new grudge against the bear population or I'm in need of some really trivia information. But I thought that pretty much anything that is relevant in pop culture could have a place here? No? I mean, CrazyRussian seems to think not, but so what? One guy gets to make the rules?! And on what grounds? That Tatum Reed isn't really a porn star but a prostitute who in some way is using wikipedia to score dates?! Well, that makes total sense, because when I'm really lonely, the first place I turn to is an online encyclopedia! Listen, if you want to argue that porn stars shouldn't be on here, that's one thing. But I don't even think Tatum is simply a porn star. She's currently having a documentary shot about her life and her business and completely blurs the line between pornography and art. And as a last grasp of an arguement, I thought I look up another porn star and see if she's on here...so I typed in "Bella Donna." And you know what came up? THIS: <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bella_Donna_eb91.html" title="Bella Donna">Bella Donna</a> No, that's not Bella Donna, the porn star...that's Bella Donna, the COMIC BOOK CHARACTER! If we're going to allow fictious, z-rated comic book characters on wikipedia, can't we leave Tatum alone?!Thefoxymoron 06:26, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. I'm not convinced that anything has changed since the first AFD. She's still not notable and the article is still an ad. <a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMystache_ac31.html" title="User:Mystache">Mystache</a> 12:47, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Being the owner of a film production company, a porn star, and a pop culture critic is plenty notable. Sources such as the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Chronicle_5d76.html" title="San Francisco Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a> more than meet our standards for reliablility.

<li><b>Keep</b> Reluctantly. Tatum Reed is indeed a minor celebrity in the San Francisco Bay area. There are a number of independant articles about her written and easily accessed.
