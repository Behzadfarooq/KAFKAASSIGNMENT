<li>Longcat extends beyong merely the realm of 4chan. Longcat is not exclusive to one site only. I truely believe that there should be an article explaining what Longcat is so that when they here mention of it, they can find information on the subject.

<li>And a little known fact: Longcat is so long that he can dig from Ohio, through the center of the Earth, and just almost reach China, not quite but almost, by about 2 miles lacking.

<li>Since several "Keep" voters here can't seem to express themselves without making personal attacks on their opponents, let me ask this: Why is it so bloody important to all of you to have Longcat in Wikipedia?

<li>I'm not trying to imply that you're a sock, I don't think that you are, only that you're new. There are some who prefer a higher margin of edits to determine suffrage, I'm not sure if that debate ever got settled or not. I'll have to check on that 25 votes thing, I couldnt remember what the stated minimum was when I posted the comment, thanks for reminding me. I'm simply trying to unravel a lot of confusing posts to this discussion, and anytime I have found a user that is not an established editor, I have noted that in this discussion. If you'll note a bit further down, I tagged one other editor similarly to how I tagged your vote, and that editor was voting Delete. I'm not trying to be partisan, only reflect the truth behind every vote to this discussion. In your case, you seem to have enough to count for a bare minimum. The closing admin may not take your edit count into consideration at all.

Stop being such elitist pinheads. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 132.239.142.229 (talk ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_132.239.142.229_bf3b.html" title="Special:Contributions/132.239.142.229">contribs</a>) 22:23, September 15, 2005.</small>

<li>Yes, we generally are all like this. We are interested in facts, and articles of encyclopedic interest. There is disagreement on whether this article is notable enough for inclusion in the encyclopedia. That is why we have the current <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">deletion process in place</a> for Wikipedia. Our goal is to build <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a> on what should be done with questionable articles. If you'd care to look around at some of the other articles being discussed, you'll note that some will probably be deleted, while some will be kept. It's all part of the process. If you want to voice your opinion, you're welcome to, but be aware that we frequently delete articles about various internet forums, and are frequently flooded with anonymous edits from members of that forum seeking to keep the article. That certainly seems to be the case here. We're not really elitist, <i>anyone</i> can get a username, <i>anyone</i> with a username can vote, and votes from established users are considered, no matter what side of a discussion they are on. Votes from anonymous users are not. That is longstanding Wikipedia policy. If you feel there are holes in Wikipedia's coverage of Internet phenomena, I would encourage you to join the site and participate in the process of building an encyclopedia. However, some of the behavior that has been seen in this discussion, such as engaging in sockpuppetry, is quite frowned upon. As far as 4chan, <a href="../../../4/c/h/4chan.html" title="4chan">4chan</a> does have an article, but this discussion is not over that article. Personally, I've heard of Something Awful, but not 4chan. But that is not what this discussion is about, this discussion is about whether Longcat is notable enough for it's own article.

<p><s>*<b>Keep</b> Even though I have an incredibly low chance of being accounted for in this vote, I would like to offer my vote anyway as well as propose a topic for discussion. Why, exactly, are anonymous contributors to this site held in such low regard? Does one's opinion become effectively null when its source is unknown? Whatever happened to the concept of judging one's opinions on their own merit rather than the eminence of the name of the one who speaks? It seems a bit counterintuitive to me to have anonymous posters able to speak their mind freely and yet be completely disregarded. Why are the posters here so dead-set on furthering the perceived values of their internet identities, which at their very core are indeed effectively anonymous?

<li>Anonymous contributions are welcome at Wikipedia, but anonymous users are just as likely yo have their contributions to articles edited as regular users. That's the nature of a wiki. Our policy is to allow established Wikipedia users to vote. Why? Because we are trying to establish a consensus, and we want each person to be able to express their opinion. We do not want that distorted by one person trying to appear as several people. If we allow anonymous votes, what is to stop someone from posting multiple votes from different IP addresses? We have no way at all of trying to ascertain if ten anonymous votes are posted by ten people, or two. So, if you want to vote in RfA discussions, feel free, but you will need to have a username at Wikipedia, and not merely be coming in because of one particular article. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">√ãvilphoenix</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvilphoenix_c095.html" title="User talk:Evilphoenix">Burn!</a></b></small></sup> 21:20, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

But the article cites no sources and no sources can be found that show that there's any such concept. This article is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">unverifiable</a>. The only things that Google Web turns up are mis-spellings of "generalization". We usually only do mis-spelling redirects when someone has actually made the mis-spelling and created a duplicate article, which is not the case here. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:42, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. As FCYTravis said, it's nothing personal. It ain't a bad article, either, but there's a difference between "newsworthy" and "encyclopaedic" in many opinions. I've been in the newspaper, like many people, but that does not make me encyclopaedic either. Until "gets in unnecessary flamewars on AfD" becomes a criteria for notability.

<li><b>Delete</b>. There's nothing personal, mind you, and the article is written better than other articles on Wikipedia. However, there needs to be something notable about the club. Simply being in the newspaper does not make something notable.

Yet this seems to be a list of sports people - most of them men, and therefore not really having busts as such. Can someone explain what it's meant to be?

<li><b>weak delete</b>. The name has to be changed, because "bust" is too ambiguous. The contents have to be changed -- the article should start with a definition, or we will have a "list of people in sports that failed at least once". All entries need a comment explaining why they got on this list. So, better to start over.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Far too subjective - was Ankiel a bust when he had one outstanding year? should we equate players who got hurt with players who just plain stank?

<li>I may rename it into List of athletes that didn't live up to expectations and expand into why the player was a bust if the page surives VFD which so far looks like a no consuesus.

<li>Aranda, I don't see how that revision solves the core problem that most of the Delete voters have identified: The subject, regardless of name is <b>inherently</b> POV. It's a commentary, not an article. That's why I think we're better off deleting the page. If you believe Player X failed to live up to expectations, then I would suggest going to Player X's article, documenting the high expectations (e.g., he was named the best prospect in his sport in 1995 by Some Sports Publication), and then documenting his performance subsequent to those expectations, thus letting the reader decide for him/herself whether those expectations were met. | Keithlaw 23:47, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>If someone put any of the flops articles up for VfD, I'd probably vote Delete there as well. Subjective articles don't fit Wikipedia's mission, esp. not the NPOV policy.

<li>What do you see as a good standard for notability for a webcomic? I have useful standards for books and people, and for bands there is <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Surely some webcomics are noteable enough that an articel makes sense, and others are not.

<li>Good point. Don't know how reliable it is, but I found <a href="http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/comicstats.php?id=1395" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/comicstats.php?id=1395" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>, which gives stats for webcomics. If it's to be relied upon, at the time of writing Gemini Bright has been viewed 15 times this month. Not sure how real-time the stats are, but two of those should be me today, giving a total of 13 views. And some of them are bound to be the comic's creator, and a couple more would probably be fellow Wikipedians investigating an article listed on AfD. If this is basis for making a judgment, I'd say this made it nn. <a href="../../../c/l/w/User%7ECLW_0ab3.html" title="User:CLW">CLW</a> 16:55, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I visited that site, adn read their FAQ. I am note sure, but it looks to me as if they only record "views" made after they refered a user to a webcomic site. viewers who came in by a direct URL link or say from wikipedia, will probably not be included in their totals. Since they can add a listign without havign a change made to the content of a listed page (such as a hitcounter requires) I am prety sure this is the case. If that si so, these stats are not a good method of judging notability. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:16, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good question. I'm against simple "x hits per month" (or similar) metrics, as such are easily cheated at and don't mean much anyway. I think webcomics for inclusion should have a decent Alexa score and some recognition outside the webcomic crowd or otherwise impact on the outside world. For example, Penny Arcade is well known among gamers who aren't also webcomic buffs, and appears in gaming publications on occasion. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:11, 17 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Another question would be whether or not a site is notable outside the webcomic community, or merely within it. <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghastly%27s_Ghastly_Comic_bccd.html" title="Ghastly's Ghastly Comic">Ghastly's Ghastly Comic</a>, for example, isn't very significant in a cultural or pop-culture sense, but it and its creator have been involved in a <i>lot</i> of feuds and controversies within the webcomic community. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 05:54, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I had a look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_webcomics.html" title="List of webcomics">List of webcomics</a> yesterday and it is just a webcomic advertising portal, I randomly clicked on some, and then google/alexa checked them, and so much there is non-notable. It's going to be a chore to dig through all those webcomics and find out which ones are actually notable, but I think it's a job that has to be done, or it'll just get worse, with wikipedia being the first port of call for webcomic advertising.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The article is not clearly nonsense, but it seems to give a rather narrow definition of an idea that could admit a much broader one, and it is not so clear that the concept of "algebraical quantity" is really needed. "Everyone" needs to know what <i>terms</i> are (things that get added or subtracted) and what <i>factors</i> are (things that get multiplied) and what polynomials and rational functions and various other sorts of expressions are, but I don't see any clear need for this concept. The word "algebraical", as opposed to "algebraic", seems archaic, and I suspect it came from a somewhat out-of-date book ‚Äî maybe published in 1840 or so? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 01:47, 16 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Comment</b> I find <a href="http://www.learningmatters.co.uk/education/a_to_z/maths/l.html" class="external text" title="http://www.learningmatters.co.uk/education/a_to_z/maths/l.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>: "like terms" are defined as "Multiples of the same algebraic quantity. Hence if terms are not of the same algebraic quantity they are unlike terms." For example, n, 2n, 0.5n, 4n, are like terms and thus presumably are "of the same algebraic quantity" while 2, n, n<sup>2</sup> and n<sup>3</sup> are unlike terms and presumably of "different algebraic quantity." In other words, "algebraic quantity" is the answer to the question "what is it that is 'alike' between 'like terms?'" This resonates with me, because I think that in physics‚Äîspecifically, in the context of units, dimensions, and metrology‚Äî"quantity" has a similar meaning. Feet and inches express the same "quantity", namely length, while feet and acres do not. I think. I could have that garbled. So, ok... my vote is...</s></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. There are tens of thousands of people who have run or office of this caliber, and even those who get elected weild little power individually. While anyone who serves as in a national Parliament or similar assembly warrants some sort of article, there is little of note to be said about most of them. Those who didn't even make it that far are insignificant. Are we going to see an article on the guy who ran for the Parliamentary seat of Twiddle-Upon-Spry in 1732? No? Then why his contemporary equivalent? Really why is the fact that he "was responsible for a successful campaign to refurbish the common room facilities available to students at the college" in an encyclopedia?

Frankly, I don't see how the present article could hope to be more than this, as the individual revolts have nothing in common except the dictionary definition, but as a first effort to see if anyone might have more imagination than me, I applied the {{Move to Wiktionary}} template to the article, only to have it repeatedly removed, so I'm bringing this to AfD sooner than I otherwise would have, as I would have preferred to give it longer for someone to make a real article of it if possible. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 14:03, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>‚Äîan important historical phenomenon that must have an article. The fact that the article is presently so poor is shameful, but now someone's trying to get rid of it altogether?

<li><b>Keep</b> and make it a Disambiguation page. Lists of Revolts are handled by Categories. Essays about Revolts are handled by articles where revolts have common features (such as the medieval period). Other revolts (Latin American, Russian, SE Asian) should have their own articles. The topic is very wide and this should disambiguate the reader to the correct location. <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 14:26, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>List of dates for 1000+ years of European history with no qualifier. Too open-ended, allready handled in the <a href="../../../1/0/0/1000.html" title="1000">1000</a> AD style pages. Any dubious notion of significant or important date is POV, Medieval history is as complex as modern history (ie. its not just politics).

<li><b>Keep</b> Medieval history is complex, and this page can be expanded to include more artistic and scientific breakthroughs. I did not create the original post, but updated it significantly (I did not realize pages could be deleted, actually). I am prone to such lists, as that is the way I order my historical studies. I don't agree that such a thing is handled in the AD pages, as suggested by the first user (above), in that I find them to be woefully inadequate and difficult to follow. I also agree that an intro be added describing the medieval period, as well as delineations for the Low, Middle and High ages. <a href="../../../e/g/t/User%7EEgthegreat_8a3a.html" title="User:Egthegreat">egthegreat</a> 18 Sept 20050</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The problem is there is no universal agreement of what should or should not be on the list. So, I might add the birthdays of 45+ <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_art.html" title="Gothic art">Gothic artists</a> from the 12-14th century, doubling the size of the list. Or, perhaps the founding date of 100s of Crusader state castles. Does that make it a better list? What should <i>not</i> be on the list? It is so open ended as to be of no value. These types of lists are usually personal in nature, dates that are important to you. <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 14:14, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>While you make interesting points, I don't think that they are enough to delete the article.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I know it doesn't fit the actual definition of nonsense, but some admins are willing to interpret CSD liberally. It seems clear that there will be no serious discussion of keeping this, so a speedy would certainly save time and effort.

<li>I don't disagree, but I'm simply going on general interpretation of CSD criteria. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">√ãvilphoenix</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvilphoenix_c095.html" title="User talk:Evilphoenix">Burn!</a></b></small></sup> 20:07, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I know what you mean. There is a distinction between "patent nonsense" like random characters/words, and "nonsense in the context of an encyclopedia" which contains actual sentences, but they are more or less incomprehensible in the context of being a WP article. The former is apparently what is meant in the CSD, but there should be a way to refer to the latter as well, and streamline its deletion. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 21:59, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am Anseynol. As there is already a blog page for the religion with far more information, a brief note on Wikipedia would not be essential for the future of Laruunash. However, it must be clear that 'gaining legitimacy' is clearly not something that laruunis seek, especially when they are required to question and challenge the authority of nation-states and existing churches.</li>
<li>I openly admit that the religion has not gained 'any kind of currency'. If this is indeed a prerequisite for a half-page entry on Wikipedia, by all means delete it. As a philosopher and a scientist, I understand that some encyclopedists emphasize the need not only to report the present level of knowledge, but also to give an impetus to some readers to rethink (matters of science, morals, aesthetics, etc.) and to advance the existing pool of knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>delete</b> looks like a vanity religion page, the only thing this religion has going for it is the blog linked to in the (advertising-copy-like) article. maybe in a few years, we'll see if the blog/religion lives or dies, but right now this looks like vanity advertising in order to get a new religion off the ground, or improve blog rankings. Sorry Anseynol, legitimacy *is* a standard for an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> 19:52, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Anseynol writes: Please do not feel sorry for me Mr./Ms. Editor. I feel very fortunate in many ways, and I do feel an obligation to serve those who are less fortunate. My religion makes it clear that this is not a 'habit' on my part, nor an unexamined remnant from my Muslim past. I am aware of the sense of the word 'vanity' in publishing lingo. I hope it is clear that there is no vanity in somebody's declaration of readiness to improve the lot of humankind --which, in the midst of electronic affluence, appears pretty miserable to me.</li>
<li>As I state on the blog site, many people will understand our religion better 'by the fruits of our work'. You can choose to be a facilitator of that kind of service, or you can do otherwise. Not only are good and evil options available to us, but also the sublime and the ridiculous --among others. Regards, Anseynol</li>

<p>A bunch of fake shades of red. You can make up plenty of names (e.g. cherry red, lipstick red, strawberry red, rhubarb red, etc.) but that doesn't mean there is an objective, notable color by that name.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chili powder (color) (Supposedly the color of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chili_powder.html" title="Chili powder">chili powder</a>. I don't think a redirect is appropriate here.)</li>
<li>Feldspar (color) (Supposedly the color of <a href="../../../f/e/l/Feldspar.html" title="Feldspar">feldspar</a>. Of course, feldspars have varying colors; I don't think a redirect is appropriate here.)</li>
<li>Fire brick red (Supposedly the color of a <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire_brick.html" title="Fire brick">fire brick</a>. No evidence the name isn't simply made up, and of course fire bricks vary in color. I don't think a redirect is appropriate here.)</li>

As far as I can tell, "fire engine red", when used in English, isn't a particular shade of red, but simply means "bright red".)</li>
<li>Metallic Rose (It's a color.)</li>
<li>Olive-yellow (It's a mix of <a href="../../../o/l/i/Olive_%28color%29.html" title="Olive (color)">olive</a> and <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow.html" title="Yellow">yellow</a>.)</li>
<li>Pale gray-red (A pale mix of gray and red.)</li>
<li>Persian Sunset (I can't find any evidence that this color name exists.)</li>
<li>Pink-cerise (It's a mix of <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pink.html" title="Pink">pink</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerise.html" title="Cerise">cerise</a>.)</li>
<li>Red-pink (It's a mix of <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red.html" title="Red">red</a> and pink.)</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/a/s/Raspberry_%28color%29.html" title="Raspberry (color)">Raspberry (color)</a> (Supposedly a color that resembles <a href="../../../r/a/s/Raspberry.html" title="Raspberry">raspberries</a>.)</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/o/s/Rose_%28color%29.html" title="Rose (color)">Rose (color)</a> (Supposedly a pinkish-red color.)</li>

<li><a href="../../../t/e/r/Terra_cotta_%28color%29.html" title="Terra cotta (color)">Terra cotta (color)</a> (Supposedly the color of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terra_cotta.html" title="Terra cotta">terra cotta</a>. I know people use this phrase as a color name, but I doubt it refers to a specific shade, and more than "tomato red" does.)</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomato_%28color%29.html" title="Tomato (color)">Tomato (color)</a> (Supposedly the color of a <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomato.html" title="Tomato">tomato</a>. I don't think a redirect to Tomato is useful here.)</li>

<dd>Look, I could care less about RGB coordinates - red, green, and blue existed long before there were agreed-upon numerical standards to measure them by. The fact is, when you say someone's car was fire-engine red, it evokes a particular shade of red (or range of shades) based on our common experience with fire engines (even tho those in my town are light green). Same thing with Raspberry - the fact that its used as a descriptor in a hit song is verification enough for me that it deserves an article. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;<i>BD2412</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 19:53, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

In psycholinguistic literature "fire engine red" is frequently used to refer to the "focal" red color, i.e. the kind of red that most people would agree is the reddest red. I've always thought of "fire engine red" as being more like FF0000. The color on the page is more like maroon.

<p>The result of the debate was actually somwhat ambiguous. Despite the clear vote count showing a lot of "deletes" vs. only two "keeps", things are not all that clear, because there are two different reasons given to delete.</p>
<ol>
<li>Saleha Zhowandai is not notable.</li>
<li>The content establishing notability in the article is not <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no consensus that the subject is not notable, had the article been fully verified, so the issue of whether to delete or not boils down to one of verifiability. I have done a bit of searching for other sources about Saleha, and I have not found any other sources except Wikipedia and its mirrors either. Because of that, I am going to call this a <b>delete</b>, but if any other sources verigying the content can be provided, an undeletion request might be in order. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:25, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>With all due respect, Mel, there are Afghan women in the post-Taliban era who have obtained much greater achievements, like being appointed at both public and private institutions and organizations. A person who has just graduated and has not made anything significant other than teaching at an university and publishing one paper is not notable enough to deserve an article, not even taking the circumstances that you mention into consideration. This is specially true when nobody on the web seem to have knowledge of her other than from WP. My two cents. - <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShauri_a242.html" title="User:Shauri">Shauri</a> 20:31, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>weak delete</b> per Shauri. If there were any sources, or even where she teaches, or any stronger reason for noteability than graduation, then I would say keep, but right now we are speaking of keeping the only source, undocumented and unconfirmed, about this woman's achievements at all. I don't mean to disregard her accomplishment, but as an encyclopedia, *some* source/confirmation is necessary. --<a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> 20:44, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Shauri. The "first Fullbright scholarship for an Afghan woman" part actually says "first Fullbright scholarship <b>in Economics</b> for an Afghan woman" and that's just too weak to confer any notability. The first Fullbright scholarship overall for any Afghan woman might be encyclopedically notable, but this isn't. I don't want to see "first Fullbright scholarship in field <i>xxxx</i> for a woman from country <i>yyyyy</i>" articles for all fields <i>xxxx</i> and all countries <i>yyyyy</i> in wikipedia unless the subject meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> standards for other reasons. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 21:27, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am the author of the article. The article was created as part of an effort to put the artist and his works on the internet, largely to provide presence and factual record for anyone seeking further information having seen his works, or otherwise. The artist does have his own home page (which I created for him), but that home page may not survive indefinitely, whereas the Wikipedia will, and the artists works will. In 10 years time, someone seeking more information on the artist, based on one of his many works, may find nothing other than a Wikipedia article - which is far better than finding nothing at all. The article is not an advertisement (it does not induce or solicit trade, etc - it merely states fact). I agree that the article lacks detail, perhaps in 5-10 years time, it will also lack detail - and then it may be more relevant to remove the entry, but deleting the article within 12 months of its existance seems shortsighted. Perhaps in 5-10 years time, the artist will have grown in stature and relevance. In terms of "notability", the artist does have a reputation, admittedly not as large as other artists, but probably larger than some of the trival news events and detail in other articles.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> What <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a> fails to consider, [personal attack removed], is that this is not an English dictionary, this is an encyclopedia, the purpose of which is to inform and entertain. Individuality is encouraged, and users are even encouraged to spell creatively as stated on the front page. I have been working hard making contributions, while <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User: Zoe</a> apparently (from a superficial glance at his discussion page) has been working hard vandalizing others‚Äô contributions. There are many words that are not English, but were borrowed from other languages because they are important concepts that are impossible to substitute, such words as dacha, perestroika etc. ‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôAn intelligent‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô is a unique irreplaceable concept, and therefore deserves a place in this resource. I am qualified to make this assessment because I was raised in the former USSR, and my family belongs to the intelligentsia class. I am also an English writer and poet. The authors of the intelligentsia article are students from India, whose idea of the term is extremely vague and superficial, and frankly the article is amateurish. But unlike <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a> I appreciate various perspectives, that give the reader more food for thought. An intelligent (like serf for example) is a type of person, that does not exist in English speaking countries, the term was not widely known here. And the purpose of an encyclopedia is to inform, not to reiterate already known facts. I believe <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a> came here with the wrong motives. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by LevKamensky (talk ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LevKamensky_fc02.html" title="Special:Contributions/LevKamensky">contribs</a>) 23:32, 15 September 2005 (UTC).</small></li>

<dd>You would censor me for not using "he or she", your gender was not evident to me, maybe that's why. Vandalizing my own work, can't beat logic! The point is this, Wikipedia's policy is very flexible and you are running around, looking for a problem to fix where there is none.

<b>Keep</b>. People have been arguing about this place for as long as I've been alive, and if nothing else, I'd like to see the article kept if only because it looks like the Terre Haute House won't be around much longer, and eventually there just won't be that many -- if ANY -- references to it, so it would be nice to have a place where people could learn about what "used to be." I would encourage anyone with info on the place to add it!!!</p>
<p>I lived in Terre Haute in 1996-97 and actually came to love the old place, since you just don't see buildings like that in cities like Terre Haute! I now live about 2-1/2 hours from T.H., so I can be a bit more objective. Somewhere I read that gangsters like Al Capone and others stayed there, wish I could find that article again ... I do know that Tony Hulman's mother lived there in her final years. I've been told she was quite an interesting lady.</p>

<li><b>This question is for Doc, but anyone can answer:</b> Would it have been better if I had rolled the content of this article into the general Terre Haute article? I considered that before writing the article, given the fact that the THH has been a subject of great debate in the city for at least as long as I've been alive, probably longer. If you think that would be preferable, I'm pretty sure I can condense the info in the THH article down a bit. I'm new here, and still learning the ropes, so I'm more than happy to get all the good advice I can get!!!

<li>I think it's best to make a quick mention in the main article with an explanation of why it's noteworthy, and then let users follow the link to this article if it seems interesting. Since it's a historic building there's no reason not to have this much detail, but it wouldn't fit on the main page. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 12:11, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think the first bit's the key. If it is notable in the city - then it merits mention there, and if there is enough <i>notable</i> detail pehaps its own article. But just being an old hotel is IMO not notable - perhaps if you added a paragraph to the article explaining why it is locally notable that might help. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 12:26, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>OK, this will be my final entry in support of my article unless someone asks for more. Demolition of THH is scheduled to start next week, so as soon as that's under way, I plan to edit the article and change everything over to the past tense (as needed). Once demo starts, there won't be any need to refer to it in the here and now, it'll be history ... which was basically my point for writing the article anyway. <a href="../../../j/_/n/User%7EJ_newkirk_a61f.html" title="User:J newkirk">J newkirk</a> 21:42, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Zoe, who put this article up for deletion, did a google search for "Antioch Arrows." Haha. Would you look at that everybody. Don't you know anything, Zoe? It's singular; shows how cool you are.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>But don't you see?! It's precisely because you haven't heard of Skram that Skram is so cool! That's how it works! The less you know, the greater the entry's worth. It's like Newton's laws about gravity! Skram = Value x (People Who Know)^2. Booyah.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>And don't try to be all like, "Well, then you should be happy I want to delete it so nobody will know about it" or "why did anybody even write about it then" either. Because, my friend, what's the point of value if it can't be cashed in!? How will people know that we know something they don't if they don't KNOW that we know something they don't?!?
