<p>It's a truck. An individual vehicle. Yes, I realise that it is part of a project concerning the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Hot_Rod_Association_aefc.html" title="United States Hot Rod Association">United States Hot Rod Association</a>. But any way you look at it, individual vehicles are not notable. Makes, models, types yes, but not one single vehicle. Do we want articles for every show-jumping horse or every dog at crufts? There are lots more of these, but I'm only nominating one to see what the consensus is. I say delete the truckcruft. --<a href="../../../a/o/r/User%7EAoratos_7a12.html" title="User:Aoratos">Aoratos</a> 23:34, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

A vast majority of these trucks are viewed by large numbers of people in the US and worldwide. This particular truck races on the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monster_Jam_4d56.html" title="Monster Jam">Monster Jam</a> circuit, which sold more than 3.5 million tickets last year alone, and that does not count TV viewership. I do agree with Aoratos that these trucks need to better explain their notability, although I think the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monster_Jam_4d56.html" title="Monster Jam">Monster Jam</a> page does a good job of doing that for them in general and it's not the only circuit. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibofh_f636.html" title="User:Wikibofh">Wikibofh</a><sub>(<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikibofh_5845.html" title="User talk:Wikibofh">talk</a>)</sub> 23:56, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: the previous decision was over a year ago, and involved only 5 voters, so I hardly think it is definitive. Yes, 3.5 million tuckets is a lot, but no-one is arguing the circuit is non-encyclopedic, obviously it is. Perhaps a few competitors are - perhaps a combined article on its vehicles, or even a list. But individual articles for each seems waaay over the score? Incidently, how many vehicles are there potentially? --<a href="../../../a/o/r/User%7EAoratos_7a12.html" title="User:Aoratos">Aoratos</a> 00:01, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Another question is, can these all fill up into articles without becomeing far too crufty. Perhaps they should all be merged into a list (ot the currentlist expanded).--<a href="../../../a/o/r/User%7EAoratos_7a12.html" title="User:Aoratos">Aoratos</a> 02:04, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Some of them are actually pretty large. The three that come to mind are <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grave_Digger_%28truck%29_0e10.html" title="Grave Digger (truck)">Grave Digger (truck)</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot_%28truck%29.html" title="Bigfoot (truck)">Bigfoot (truck)</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximum_Destruction_%28truck%29_1232.html" title="Maximum Destruction (truck)">Maximum Destruction (truck)</a>. That being said, I think that some of them can be merged and it is one rationale behind lists. I think some of the inactive, less notable trucks could go into a meatier sublist. Determing which those are is kind of tough, because despite being active with the subject matter, I only have a passing interest in it. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibofh_f636.html" title="User:Wikibofh">Wikibofh</a><sub>(<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikibofh_5845.html" title="User talk:Wikibofh">talk</a>)</sub> 03:26, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>: This trucks article does not even claim to be notable to any degree. The one link with information on it does not even contain an image of it. Unless someone can show some proof of notability I think this article should be deleted. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 14:27, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Arachnaphobia was made into a <a href="http://stores.musictoday.com/store/product.asp?band_id=1142&amp;dept_id=8453&amp;pf_id=1CAM3M64AA&amp;sfid=2" class="external text" title="http://stores.musictoday.com/store/product.asp?band_id=1142&amp;dept_id=8453&amp;pf_id=1CAM3M64AA&amp;sfid=2" rel="nofollow">Hot Wheels toy</a>, and is a regular competitor on the Monster Jam circuit. To Aoratos' comments above: there are only roughly 100 competitve monster trucks in the world currently. They are vehicles but can also be considered personalities much in the same vein as (I hate to say it) <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling.html" title="Professional wrestling">professional wrestlers</a>, of which there are <i>hundreds</i> on Wikipedia of varying notability. While I myself believe some trucks are inherantly unnotable, ones that compete on a regular basis with the largest promoter of monster truck shows in the world should qualify as notable. I just worry that this is a slippery slope that would lead to the deletion of articles like that of <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_Slinger_%28truck%29_1ebf.html" title="Gun Slinger (truck)">Gun Slinger</a>, which, although not a champion, is well known by literally millions of fans in the United States. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EArenacale_187c.html" title="User:Arenacale">Arenacale</a> 15:37, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If they are individually notable and popular, why no fan sites? Why can I find no discussion of 'Archnaphobia', not even on bbs? Why no media interest? Why the Google blank? I'd wager I could find all of that on most professional wrestlers. I'm willing to set a fairly low bar on notability, but I see no evidence that this particular truck even gets of the ground. One plastic toy, is that it? My local church badminton team has its own printed mugs.

<li>Try searching for "Arachnophobia" and "Monster truck". There's quite a bit of links there. Still, there doesn't seem to be a website dedicated to the truck. The idea of having an article on a particular truck still seems a bit absurd to me. Where we do we stop? Do we include articles on individual NASCAR race cars too? Formula 1 cars? I'd like to see that this truck was used in a number of victories, or at least one particularly noteworthy victory.

<li>As to "where do we stop?", I'd like to see some specific guidelines laid out for monster truck notability. <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grave_Digger_%28truck%29_0e10.html" title="Grave Digger (truck)">Grave Digger</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot_%28truck%29.html" title="Bigfoot (truck)">Bigfoot</a> are obvious for their notability (and status in pop culture), but I can see where someone doesn't know much about <a href="../../../e/r/a/Eradicator_%28truck%29.html" title="Eradicator (truck)">Eradicator</a> and why exactly it is notable. Unfortunately, Wikibofh and I have been doing most of the work on the Monster Truck articles, and have been somewhat hampered by <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeystuff_da79.html" title="User:Joeystuff">User:Joeystuff</a> who has been creating new articles that only say "<b>(This truck)</b> is a monster truck on the USHRA circuit." The Archnaphobia (sic) article is one of those, and neither of us have gotten to it yet. Whether or not this article is deleted, I'd like to see some more people helping with the Monster Truck category (maybe start a WikiProject), which would at least allow us to establish agreed upon notability standards and organize the category better.</li>
