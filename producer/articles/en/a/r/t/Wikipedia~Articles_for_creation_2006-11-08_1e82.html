<p>Nikolai Kulemin (July 14, 1986-present) is a Russian ice hockey player. He was drafted in the second round of the 2006 NHL Entry Draft, 44th overall, by the Toronto Maple Leafs. He was born in Magnitogorsk, Russia, and currently plays for Metallurg, that city's team in the Russian Super League.</p>
<p>Kulemin first became well-known to scouts and fans with his solid performance at the 2006 World Junior Hockey Championship, when he played right wing with young phenoms Alexander Ovechkin and Evgeni Malkin on Russia's top line.</p>
<p>Critics have said that Kulemin's success was due mainly to playing with Malkin, but the latter is playing in the NHL with the Pittsburgh Penguins this season and Kulemin's play has not suffered.</p>

<p>Iain Mclennan, is a 17 year old boy who attends St. Josephs Gregory Terrace. His time at terrace has presented Iain with many achievements, such as being named in the Australian Schoolboys team for Rugby. Though there are also many achievements which have gone unnoticed, including flicking Andrew Iu's ear, calling S**** M***** a grand final loser and many other little comments about a certain person's mum.</p>
<p>Iain has recently been celebrating his recent song release 'Pufferfish'. This song debuted at number 1 and has been topping the charts for a number of weeks. The song itself has has a sweet melody as it represents the life of Kelly Chu.</p>
<p>If you are a fan of Iain's then I recommend watching the EPL dreamteam league where Iain (stormtroopers) takes on S**** in this weeks fixtures. Recent betting reveals that Iain is set to win with a bid of 0.55c to S**** coming in at $110.75. Should be a one sided match.</p>

<p>Maldonado's parents were don Pedro Antonio Maldonado Sotomayor and doña María Flores Palomino, both of whom were from high economic and social standing. He completed his primary education in Riobamba, the city of his birth, and in 1718, traveled to Quito where he attended the Colegio San Luis, where, under the supervision of the Jesuits, he learned arithmetic, geometry, Latin, astronomy, and music. On May 19, 1721, he received his teaching degree from the Gregorian University and later returned to Riobamba to be an educator at the Jesuit school.</p>
<p>From an early age, Maldonado was interested in the mysteries of nature, and between 1722 and 1724 undertook many explorations of unknown regions to study the land's geography in great detail; he completed his first map in 1725. He again returned to his birthplace to care for his estate and remained there until 1720, when he moved to Quito. On February 5, 1730, Maldonado married the daughter of the Governor of Popayán, and gained the advantage of being related to a powerful, influential family. He returned to Riobamba in 1724 and was elected mayor of Cabilde in his first election; he was later named Lieutenant of the Magistrate. In spite of occupying these administrative positions, Maldonado did not neglect his scientific observations. That same year, he presented a proposal before the virrey of Peru to link the Royal Audience of Quito with Panama. It was the first of his many projects involving commerce routes and transportation.</p>
<p>In 1736, he collaborated with the Spanish-French Geodesic, whose primary objective, until 1743, was the decision of the value of a degree of terrestrial median in the proximity of an equinoctial line. Maldonado befriended many of its members, most notably Charles Marine de la Condamine. Two years later, he assumed the position of Governor of Emerald Province on January 20, 1742, and elevated his brothers to a position of political power so that they could take part in the government. After being widowed by his first wife, Maldonado again returned to Quito, remarrying doña María Ventura Martínez de Arredondo in 1743.</p>
<p>In 1744, Maldonado visited Europe. In Spain, in 1746, he was received by Philip V, who bestowed upon him the title of "Gentleman of the Royal Camera" and proclaimed him Governor of Atacames, with a state-sanctioned pension to last for 2 generations. From Madrid, he traveled to Paris, where he was received as a member of the Academy of Sciences on March 24, 1747 based on reports about his merits from other geologists that knew him in Quito, giving him the opportunity to print his "General Map." That same year he traveled through the Netherlands and in August of 1748, was transferred to London, where he was invited to participate in meetings of the Royal Scientific Society as one of its members, but passed away before he could be inducted. His remains were interred in the St. James Temple, leaving behind a vast legacy of scientific study and research.</p>

<p>The Queens International Film Festival was established to provide a forum in which burgeoning and celebrated filmmakers alike could present their creations to a global audience. The devoted founders seek to build an entertainment community for not only their local artists, but for the world. Unlike other film festivals, QIFF very actively seeks to empower young talent, finding beauty in unique collaborations while educating international lovers of film.</p>
<p>Since its inception, this festival is honored to receive thousands of submissions every year from applicants from countries such as Canada, India, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Turkey, Greece, the Czech Republic, Taiwan, Hungary, and more. The festival is hosted at seven different venues: The Museum of the Moving Image, Kaufman Astoria Studios, Charter School, PS166 Auditorium, The Gallery, and Cinema Paradiso.</p>
<p>Each year features over 200 films, including new music videos, exciting animation, and thought-provoking documentaries. 50 films boast their world premiere every year. The status of films that will be screened range from the novice filmmaker to Academy Award contenders.</p>
<p>The Queens International Film Festival has gained an admirable reputation for discovering master works among indie film productions. In previous years, QIFF has screened "Perhaps Love," an Academy Award contender for Best Foreign Film, directed by Peter Chan ( The Love Letter and He's a Woman, She's a Man) and produced by Andre Morgan (Million Dollar Baby). "I am David" (starring Jim Caviezel) "Down to the Bone" (Winner Best Dramatic Acting, Sundance 2004) and "Brooklyn Bound" (Winner Tribecca Film Festival, 2004) among many others.</p>
<p>Ground-breaking movies that provoke revolutions in thought, highlight women, and showcase underexposed countries set the stage and give voice to independent filmmakers. In addition to screening films, the festival program will also include exciting events to celebrate community, pay tribute to great talent, and educate the youth.</p>

<p>She met DiMaggio in 1937 — she was 19, he was 23 — on the set of <i>Manhatten Merry-Go-Round</i>. DiMaggio had a minor speaking role in the film; Arnold had no lines.</p>
<p>When Arnold visited her home town of Duluth on July 13, 1939, she was showing off her engagement ring. She married DiMaggio on Nov. 18, 1939 at SS Peter and Paul Cathedral in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. A UP report about the wedding noted that “San Francisco’s North Beach Italian population turned out in a carnival spirit that jammed streets and broke police lines.” Thousands of people (estimates vary from 10,000 to 20,000) gathered outside the cathedral and overflowed into Washington Square. The wedding party had to battle the crowd for 15 minutes to get inside the church. The bride and her father, Victor Arnold Olson, needed a police escort to fight the crowd.</p>
<p>The couple honeymooned in <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honolulu.html" title="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>, and lived in an apartment in the Upper West Side of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>. On Oct. 23, 1941, the year of DiMaggio’s famous 56-game hitting streak, Dorothy gave birth to their first child, Joseph DiMaggio III.</p>
<p>The couple split up in 1942, but later reconciled in front of the press. They separated again on Oct. 6, 1943. DiMaggio enlisted in the [U.S. Army] and was sent to <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii.html" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>. Arnold filed for divorce, which was granted on May 12, 1944. She received $500 a month in alimony, custody of Joe Jr. and $150 in child support. Despite the divorce, they spent Christmas together in 1945.</p>
<p>She married stockbroker George Schuster in 1946. The two were divorced within five years.</p>
<p>In 1951, she told Hollywood gossip columnist <a href="../../../h/e/d/Hedda_Hopper_43db.html" title="Hedda Hopper">Hedda Hopper</a> she was thinking of “getting back with Joe,” but in early 1952 DiMaggio met <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Monroe_4162.html" title="Marilyn Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a>, whom he would marry on Jan. 14, 1954. They divorced after nine months.</p>
<p>In 1991, a piece of fruitcake from the DiMaggio/Arnold wedding was auctioned off for $1,100. It was incorrectly reported to be from DiMaggio’s marriage to Monroe.</p>
<p>Arnold married Gary Peck in the late 1960s. Together they owned a supper club in <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palm_Springs%2C_California_6f8b.html" title="Palm Springs, California">Palm Springs, California</a>, called Charcoal Charley's, where she performed.

<p>As part of one of LA's few natural streams, "Rick E Lake" is located in Nichols Canyon approximately one mile north of Hollywood Blvd. Established in 1941, the property first served as a real estate office for the pre-war residential development of the area. Converted to residential use in 1943, the unique property features nearly 150 ft of waterfront frontage from the year-round stream; Four waterfalls attract local wildlife including deer, red tail hawks, coyotes and the occasional bobcat. Remodeled several times, the home was first published by House Beautiful in their 1976 Spring Edition of Home Remodeling magazine. In the late 70's, the home was represented as a red-roofed white house in the center of David Hockney's painting " Nichols Canyon". Almost 1/2 acre in size, "Rick E Lake" currently features the original structure that has remained a 2 bedroom/2 bath residence, with an antique heart-pine interior inspired by James Cagney's 1930's cabin in Lake Arrowhead, CA. ( Itself published in "Cottage Retreats" by Lisa Jill Schlang/ FriedmanFairfax Press 2002.) "Rick E Lake" is privately-owned and not open to public use.</p>

<p><b>Jose Ettiene Ortiz Medina, known to everyone simply as Ettiene, is a superstar activist for animals. In his hometown of Ponce, Puerto Rico, Ettiene never misses an opportunity to encourage friends and family to be compassionate.</b> <b>Name:</b> José Ettiene Ortiz Medina Hometown<b>: Ponce, Puerto Rico</b></p>
<p><b>Do you have animal companions? If so, were they rescued, adopted from a shelter, etc.?</b></p>
<p>We have two dogs: One’s name is Shaggy—he was rescued off the street. He was starving when we rescued him. The other one doesn’t have a name yet because he just recently came to our house.</p>
<p><b>What made you become a vegetarian/vegan?</b></p>
<p>For a long time, before learning about PETA (wwwpeta.org), I felt guilty eating meat. One day I saw an ad in a magazine, with some chicks and a caption that said, "We are not nuggets." The ad made me curious to check out the Web site, and I found out about the abuses committed against animals raised for food. At that moment, I decided that I no longer wanted to be part of that abuse. I am proud that at my age, I have made a change that will affect the rest of my life.</p>
<p><b>What are your favorite vegan foods?</b></p>
<p>Veggie burgers! And vegetarian lasagna.</p>
<p><b>What is your favorite PETA2 band, and why?</b></p>
<p>Good Charlotte is one of my favorite bands, and I liked them a lot more once I saw that they agreed to take part in a PETA campaign. I love how they take advantage of every chance they get to spread the word about animals and why we should not eat meat.</p>
<p><b>Tell us about your favorite PETA campaign.</b></p>
<p>My favorite campaign up to now has been the one against KFC. I love to inform other people about how terribly KFC treats its chickens. I have distributed leaflets on several occasions about KFC’s terrible treatment of its chickens, and on one occasion I organized a protest. I feel very proud of myself because I know I have done a lot for this campaign. Every chance I get, I send a letter to KFC officials, asking them to improve their chickens’ living conditions, and a short time ago, I found out that KFC and PETA are negotiating for the animals’ well-being. I hope that this will be the end of this cruelty and that the two years that PETA has been protesting and fighting will achieve the goal of a better future for these birds.</p>
<p><b>What is your favorite PETA pamphlet and what is your favorite way to use it?</b></p>
<p>I love "Question Authority." I think it is the best pamphlet for explaining why we should not eat meat. Since I always carry a few with me to pass out, I have used them at school, and I’ve distributed them to my family and anyone I happen to meet who is not aware of the cruelty behind meat.</p>
<p><b>What is your personal message to the more than 60,000 Street Team members of PETA2?</b></p>
<p>Even though it sometimes seems that our actions are fruitless, there are always people who realize how badly the world treats animals. I haven’t been a PETA activist for very long, but for as long as I’ve been involved I’ve tried to do the best I can. I’m always sending PETA postcards, always sending out e-mail messages to my friends with information on animal abuse, sending letters to big companies, protesting, and educating others. Never give up, because just by forwarding a PETA newsletter, you are getting other people interested and helping them learn about animal abuse. If you are determined to create change, there will be change! We have to fight for what we believe in because we can make the changes that will change the course of the world.</p>

<p>The Transylvania Motorway (Romanian: Autostrada Transilvania; Hungarian: Erdely Autopalya) is currently the largest ongoing road project in Europe. Started in 2004, and scheduled for completion in 2013, the project involves constructing a 416-km motorway that crosses Transylvania from Bors (near the Hungarian border) to Brasov (towards Bucharest). The motorway will cross Transylvania from west to southeast, on the route Bors - Oradea - Zalau - Cluj-Napoca - Targu Mures - Sighisoara - Brasov. It will have 16 interchanges, and will be continued with the 173 km Brasov - Bucharest motorway, currently under tendering. The motorway will also connect to the M35/M47 motorway in Hungary. Contractor of the project is Bechtel Corporation, and as of November 2006 4% of the civil works have been completed. The motorway has been subject to extensive debate, both because the way the contract was awarded (direct negotiation) and because of its inconsistency with the priority European road projects.</p>

<p>Earthfoods Cafe is a non-profit, student run cafe located in the Student Union of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. This is among the few collectives in the world to be run by all students. Earthfoods serves ovo-lacto vegetarian food with vegan options at economical prices during regular school sessions.</p>
<p>The cafe is a student-run business and RSO founded on April 12,1976 by a group of students concerned with the lack of economical, healthy food on campus.

<p>Founded in the Fall of 1966, Mountain State Christian School (MSCS) was the first Protestant Christian school in the state of West Virginia. The school is located in the small town of Culloden, about halfway between the two most populated cities in West Virginia—Huntington and Charleston. MSCS was originally open to grades 1 to 12 and grew to an enrollment of well over 100 students. In more recent years, the school has added kindergarten and preschool departments.</p>
<p>Planning for Mountain State Christian School began in the late 1940’s when insightful Christians (the vast majority from the Church of God Holiness movement) in the Tri-State area of West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky saw the need for Christian education and worked together to obtain a donation of property and funds to build a school. This group of Christians from holiness churches in the three states affiliated together under the name Tri-State Regional Educational and Hospital Association. It was the intention of this group to develop a Christian school that could be attended by students from all three states. They planned to have dormitories so high school students who lived too far away to travel to school daily could still attend. In fact, MSCS did have a dorm for high school students for the first several years with students attending from as far away as Beckley, West Virginia and Ironton, Ohio.</p>
<p>At first the school was called Mountain State Bible School as a way of emphasizing that the Bible is the real basis of all learning. Later the name was changed to Mountain State Christian School to eliminate the confusion in the minds of some who thought that the school was just teaching a Vacation Bible School curriculum and/or classes about the Bible. Regardless of the name, the Board of Directors has gone on record that MSCS is dedicated to God for the biblically mandated education of youth to prepare them for a balanced life of service to their families, their churches, their country, and God.</p>
<p>Some of the founding and/or legendary leaders of MSCS include Dr. Kenneth Powell, Rev. E. R. Houck, Rev. E. W. Roy, and Rev. John Hathaway.</p>

<b>Esio (pronounced Ĕs-ē-ō)</b> is a consumer hot and cold beverage system that prepares single serve, any size, coffee, tea, juice, vitamin fitness water beverages for the home or office. The Esio utilizes a patented technology in the system that works with the special proprietary “pump” on one end of each beverage package called an Esio-Pak. The system also allows you to select the strength and choice of your hot or cold beverage and each Esio-Pak will dispense 14-18 servings of each product selected. The Esio Beverage System was developed by Esio Beverage Company LLC., and can be used with bottled water or “plumbed” directly into your waterline or existing R/O system. The Esio will be available in the United States from local home and office delivery companies in the first quarter of 2007. www.esiobev.com</p>
<p><i><b>Technology</b></i></p>
<p>The Esio utilizes exclusive beverage paks called Esio-Paks which are produced and distributed by Esio Beverage Company. Each has a special “pump” on one end and allows the end user to easily drop it into the Esio. Once inserted into the system, the user presses either the hot or cold button, and the beverage is dispensed instantly. There is zero brewing or mixing time, because the water and beverage product are actually mixed in mid-air as the cup or glass is filled. The “interchangeable” Esio-Paks are as easy to change as a CD. There is NO cross-contamination when changing between Esio-Paks because it seals airtight between uses and it is completely disposable and eco-friendly. A unique feature of the Esio is the Strength Selector Dial. At the top of the Esio is a dial that allows the user to select the strength of his/her beverage. This feature provides ultimate convenience as each user can select the strength of his/her individual beverage. In the center of the strength selector is a child protection “lock-out” button to prevent injury to small children.</p>

<p>Mind Necrosis factor is a Dark Ambient/Neo-Classical/Industrial french project. Menber of Audiotrama (www.audiotrauma.org), this stuff also works on video composition.</p>
<p>Distributed by AudioTrauma and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant-Zen" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant-Zen" rel="nofollow">Ant-Zen</a>, the first album of "Mind Necrosis Factor" features melodic soundscapes through electronic and industrial ambiences. <a href="http://audiotrauma.music.free.fr/releases/entropy.htm" class="external text" title="http://audiotrauma.music.free.fr/releases/entropy.htm" rel="nofollow">"Entropy"</a> describes a dark world where minimalist and depressive voices flutter on distorted rhythms. The 9 tracks mix crystalline textures and corrosive patterns within atmospheric themes. Based on additive and repetitive constructions, these tracks reveal one long and expressive rise, leading to an explosive climax.</p>
<p>Mind Necrosis Factor explore the biological and cognitive aspects of human mind. That's why his name comes from immunology field. Indeed, the Tumor Necrosis Factor is a paradoxical molecule of the immune system. At the beginning of cancer, it supports the protection of the human body by killing the cancerous cells. But, when the disease crosses a certain threshold, [TNF]alpha intensifies the illness. This molecule does not have concept of good and evil, however it can be both according to the circumstance. The fickleness of the moral message is one of the aspects explored by this project. The [TNF]alpha embodies this paradox at the immune system level, this biological structure defining the self and non-self. Mind Necrosis Factor is focused on the spirit, this fuzzy function clamming to be one ego...</p>
<p>Based on cyber-punk visions and biomedical elements, the video works of Mind Necrosis Factor depict one dark and poetic world.

<p>Solar Death Ray is a website about an array of mirrors taking the form of a parabolic reflector focused on a specific point to burn anything there. Both the death ray and the website were created by Louis Giersch, who lives in Seattle, Washington, USA. The website primarily features humorous descriptions of the destruction of death ray "targets" such as plastic army men, a shoe and an "Xbox-box."</p>
<p>According to the website, "The Solar Death Ray is made of 112 mirrors mounted on a platform 4 feet wide and 6 feet tall. Each mirror is a square roughly 3.5 inches on edge. All these mirrors focus the sun to a single spot 5 feet, 6 inches from the mirror platform. A wooden fork extends from the mirror base to the area near the focus and serves as a mounting point for Solar Death Ray targets. The mirror platform is mounted to the support frame on a pivot that allows the platform to be angled. The whole system is mounted on a set of wheels."</p>
<p>Another destructive feature, the Gravity Death Log, was added to the site because weather in Seattle is not always conducive to powering the Solar Death Ray. The Gravity Death Log is a log raised approximately 50 feet into the air with pulleys and rope and then dropped onto a target. Thus far, it has been used on a broken fax machine and some ceramic dishes both of which easily destroyed. Its latest exploit has been making root beer float, by being dropped on a 6-pack of Root beer topped off with a carton of vanilla ice cream.</p>
<p>The TV show Mythbusters built a mirror such as this to test a myth.</p>
<p>Recently, Louis Giersch announced that there would be no more further updates to the website.</p>

<p>Ibrahim Ajibode, was born and raised in Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria. He is the first of four siblings. He left Nigeria, and moved to the U.S. at the age of 18 to attend college.</p>
<p>At about age 11, his mother gave him a book titled "So Long a Letter" by Mariama Ba. It was a book about an African woman, who wrote a letter to a friend about her struggles. This was the book that inspired his debut publication "Diary of an Immigrant; In pursuit of the American Dream", which is currently creating a buzz among college students.</p>
<p>Currently, he is planning to enroll in law school and specialize in Intellectual Property &amp; International Human Rights law.</p>

<p>Diary of an Immigrant; In pursuit of the American dream is a memoir, in form of a letter that a young immigrant, Ibrahim Ajibode, wrote to his parents about his first year in America. It is a humorous but yet truthful account of experience as a young immigrant in America. The book details different events and it is critically acclaimed in the student community.</p>
<p>An interesting note though, is that, Ibrahim Ajibode's tone of writing the book is consistent with that of an immigrant who speaks English as a second language.</p>

<p>The Ethan Ryan Atkinson is a large flightless bird native to Iowa in North America. It is one of the few animals in the kingdom with an entirely English name. The ERA bird has four stages of being which you would come into contact with, as the seasons change.</p>

<p>The ERA was discovered in 1990 by a group of women on a picnic. They were heading down a trail in the amana colonies when this large flightless animal attacked one of them. The women claimed after it had pounced their friend they heard the song "The Land Down Under"- by Men At Work playing and their friend was being "taken".</p>
<p>As could be expected scientists flocked to the woods after these claims. They began looking for any evidence for the actual exsistence of this horrid beast. After several months of scouring the woods they turned up nothing, and the other two women where hung for lying.</p>
<p>Then not three days after their execution the ERA made its appearence again when it attempted to enter a local convinence store. This time the witnesses to the bird claimed it was able to speak and kept screaming "I want the one with chesties!" The bird was shot with gun, wounded and captured.</p>

<p>After his capture the ERA was studied extensively by the scientific community. The proding and poking and tests show that the ERA is one of the more intelligent creatures of the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>It stands at just about six foot, has extremely baggy skin and small beedy eyes. It is also very light and thing. It often has trouble standing up, many scientists believe that this is because the blood incontains actually has an element of alcohol to it. Because the scientist was that bombed.</p>
<p>Many science labs found that the ERA responded to music, light, sound and to human females in the buff. "We believe this to because of where the genetics come from", says now ERA expert Trevor Stanerson Trevor Stanerson</p>
<p>We know now that the ERA came from a cross of humans and dodos done by a scientist in 1989 when he got drunk. He mixed his DNA with that of a dodos and got the creation we have now.</p>
<p><br />
This appears to be nonsense.</p>

<p>The ERA was named this because of his genetics being partially human.</p>

<p>The reason the scientific community believes that ERA is a intelligent being is because of its rituals. The ERA is a bird of rituals. The most obvious ritual is the one that takes place every Sunday. In the after noon the bird consumes certain mushrooms that cause a narcotic effect, it then wanders around until it hears the song "Land down under". Then it will rape a human. It is believed that this is the only way to keep the species alive.</p>
<p>Then when there is a female ERA (see Derrick Shwarting) the mating ritual takes place. The male ERA makes a nest out of what it can, often using human garbage, and rolls in this nest. The other ERA dances around the garbage rolling one until either of them passes out. Once one is out they take advantage of each other.</p>

<p>There is a small group of people who are working to make the ERA a legally huntable animal. The two incharge of the commission are Trevor Stanerson and Jake Harney. The two believe it would be the closest they could come to hunting a human.</p>

<p>When ever you come into contact with and ERA take EXTREME caution. They are often disease ridden, and recent scientific studies suggest that this bird can transport aids mearling by touching you. If you notice one is loitering around your house, make sure to warn your wife and children, or their lives could be in danger.</p>
<p>Never try to catch an ERA it is more of a burdon than a plus, and do NOT try to coax it with little debbies snack cakes. There are chemicals in there that make it go off the handle.</p>
<p>Iowa DNR has request if anyone finds a living ERA to eliminate it quickly, before it gets them.</p>

<p>Jchaumont 18:16, 7 November 2006 (UTC) Cancer screening through sophisticated blood test : to screen cancer and recurrences.</p>
<p>CancerSafe, a Swiss based company, and MyMedLab.com, a Direct-to-Consumer provider, today announce the formation of a new partnership. The new relationship will provide U.S. consumers direct access to the most comprehensive screenings for various types of cancers. The arrangement will include new screening tools that, though used extensively in Europe and Japan, are not currently available from any U.S. lab.</p>
<p>Joplin, MO (PRWeb) October 4, 2006 -- As the number of treatment choices continue to increase for all types of cancer, none can match the huge benefits of early detection. Identifying all types of cancer early continues to be the single best way to increase the success rate of any treatment and recovery.</p>
<p>We’re excited to announce that Cancersafe® has agreed to offer our consumers more testing options. Screenings will be available both as a complete package (looking for multiple types of cancer cells) and individually as CancerSafe, a Swiss Oncology Lab, is Europe’s premier provider of comprehensive cancer screenings. Unlike the field of Genetics (DNA) that only identify an individual’s predisposition for cancer, CancerSafe uses a combination of molecules called Tumor Markers to identify the actual presence of disease. The CancerSafe process combines an evaluation of multiple tumor markers with 25 years of experience identifying what combination of values warrant a closer look. Patients who show abnormal results are automatically referred to an American doctor specializing in the interpretation of CancerSafe results.</p>
<p>Dr. J. Chaumont, Oncobiologist and CEO of CancerSafe SA, Switzerland, explains, "Strong evidence exists for the benefit of using a combination of tumor markers for both early detection and follow up of many types of cancer. Our partnership with MyMedLab.com provides a convenient and affordable way for American consumers to access our expertise through yearly cancer screenings. Report shows figures AND OPINION from four cancer specialists, basing their opinion on exclusive algorithms. This report is available directly on website, within 2 to 3 days after blood drawing".</p>

<p>Wim Statius Muller was born in Curaçao in 1930. There he studied with the pianist and composer Jacobo Palm. In 1949 he continued his music studies in New York at the Julliard School of Music, where Josef Raieff became his piano teacher. In 1953 he received a Bachelor's Degree, and in 1954 a Master's. After another year, during which he followed postgraduate courses in composition, orchestral conducting, and orchestration, he was appointed to the music faculty of the Ohio State University. In his student years he already appeared in concerts in Manhattan and in the New York City area, in Curaçao and Venezuela. As a teacher in Ohio he was also active on the concert stage, in recitals, as a harpsichordist in the Collegium Musicum, and as piano soloist with orchestra. Subsequently Wim Statius Muller switched to a career in government, which took him back to Curaçao, then to Holland and finally to a diplomatic appointment at NATO headquarters in Brussel. Since his retirement from NATO Mr. Muller, who now lives in Curaçao, has performed in New York City a number of times, notably in Alice Tully Hall at the Lincoln Center in a Chopin memorial concert, sponsored by the Kosciuszko Foundation. In Europe he regularly appears on stage as a soloist and in chamber music ensembles in the Netherlands and Germany.</p>

<p>Search Engine Image Protection (SEIP), also known as online reputation management, combines the expertise of <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_engine_marketing.html" title="Search engine marketing">Search Engine Marketing (SEM)</a> and PR, and is designed to protect a company or brand against incorrect negative publicity via the Internet.</p>
<p>By using SEIP strategies to push potentially damaging information out of the top search engine rankings, marketers hope to protect their brand image and make a good impression on Internet users who may be researching a future purchase.</p>

<p>SEIP draws on a combination of SEM and <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_relations.html" title="Public relations">public relations</a> strategies to supplant unflattering online content with brand-friendly content. Typically this involves regular monitoring of search pages, <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blogs</a>, news sites and discussion pages for negative, false or out-dated information on a company or brand.</p>
<p>Marketers produce web releases, blog entries, articles and other fresh content for online submission. If well designed and distributed, this content will be picked up by the search engines, pushing the older, less desirable information out of the top rankings on the search engine results pages (SERP) and out of the view of most search engine users.</p>
<p>This process takes advantage of the natural turnover of Internet content. If out-dated information is ranking highly on the search engines, it may not be replaced until newer content is introduced. In addition to protecting their brand, marketers are helping consumers by providing relevant product information and assisting Website administrators by offering fresh content.</p>

<li>This could be a worthwhile piece for Wikipedia. However, the tone of the article makes it sound like a PR piece for the orchestra. It is suggested that you rewrite the piece in a more neutral, encyclopedic tone and provide more information about the orchestra, such as conductors past and present, any orchestra alumni who have become well known, seasons and concerts played, etc. Also provide any external, third-party sources concerning the orchestra. Please rewrite and submit again. •<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 02:43, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>"The R$B In Me" is an upcoming album from "new" R&amp;B crooner Don P. Ofcourse Don P is a creation from music mogul Paul Delgado which also happens to be Hit Rapper P-Gunna. In interviews when asked about the album P has been Quoted as saying " its just straight R&amp;B..." adding "ive always wanted to do this project, i think it shows that ive always leaned toward an R&amp;B beat then a regular hip hop beat... its not a puplicity stunt or none of that shit its just me doing me if u like it then cop it if not dont bash it (laughs) but in all honestly i think people will be surprised when they finally hear it and they'll be like WOW dudes done his homework but its not really doing homework when you've gone thru alot of the things you put on wax..." others who have herd cuts from the album say he is bringing back the R&amp;B feel ...</p>
<p>In a San Fernando Valley interview he had this to say "When i finally sat my ass down and started working on the album i had really finished about 10-13 songs and i was already done with it becauses i never really thought about a second album for Don P so when i was thinking i said to myself shit am i gonna do the Don p thing for awhile of is it just a one off thing... so i decided to pack the album with songs... not to say i just threw a shit load of jams in the album but i was happy with how it all came out so by the time the album hits shelves fans will be 17-21 songs and im thinking of adding a few bonus songs too"</p>

<p>Miracle of Love® (MOL) is a religious organization based in San Diego, California with centers in San Francisco, CA; Colorado Springs, CO; Austin, TX; Costa Rica, Germany and Australia.</p>
<p>Members of MOL believe that an incarnation named Lord Gourasana manifested in the person of David Swanson in order to give devotees a means of breaking the cycle of birth and death in a single lifetime.</p>
<p>From an article called [Miracle of Love] in the Pacific Sun by Jill Kramer <a href="http://www.pacificsun.com/story_archives/love_cult.html" class="external free" title="http://www.pacificsun.com/story_archives/love_cult.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pacificsun.com/story_archives/love_cult.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mythology of Miracle of Love, as put forth in another organization-published book, Breaking the Cycle of Birth &amp; Death, is that Carol Seidman’s husband, David Swanson, underwent a transformation in 1987, when an incarnation of God named Lord Gourasana took over his body and began speaking through him. Seidman, taking the name Kalindi, and a friend of theirs named Gayle—now known as “The Lady”—received his teachings and became “spiritual masters.” In 1995, the story goes, the energy emanating from Gourasana finally overwhelmed Swanson’s body and he died. That’s when Gourasana began speaking through Kalindi. The Lady rose to second in command. In the past year, a few more members of the inner circle have been elevated to “spiritual masters.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Together, Gourasana, Kalindi and The Lady developed a system of workshops and a meditation practice called the Gourasana Meditation Practice or GMP™ and hold workshops at centers around the world called The Intensive.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-08_1e82.html" title="Edit section: Southgate Mall, Elizabeth City, NC">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Southgate Mall, Elizabeth City, NC</span></h2>
<p>Southgate Mall is a regional enclosed mall in Elizabeth City, NC with approximately 215 to 250,000 square feet of total sales area, 2 main anchors, 30 shop spaces and capacity for over 1,100 cars. The mall was constructed in the late 1960s (1968-1969). Original anchors were Belk Tyler, W.T. Grant and a Winn-Dixie supermarket.</p>
<p>The sketchiness of available information suggests that W.T. Grant would be immediately replaced by Roses in 1976 and would last until 1993, when competition from Wal-Mart would leave the space vacant for some time. JCPenney later relocated to the Roses space in 1996, ironically not using the entire space. Part of the unused space, including the former Roses cafeteria would be partitioned off into another retail space that would later become a popular Chinese buffet from 1998 to 2005. The rest of the space would be rechanneled back into a widened section of the mall corridor, with plans to turn it into a future food court. The food court has still not materialized as planned.</p>
<p>The Winn-Dixie anchor supposedly occupied what would later become the JCPenney space from 1969 until circa 1981, where it then moved to nearby and newly-built K-mart-anchored Holly Square Shopping Center. JCPenney was a late-bloomer when it relocated from downtown in 1985. Belk had done so in 1969. JCPenney would remain in that location until 1996, moving into the larger Roses space next door. The space would later host a Roses Express by 2002 until 2004, in what seemed to be the company's last ditch effort to hold on to the Elizabeth City market. Goody's took over and performed an extensive remodel in 2005, incorporating the former Chinese buffet, which had recently moved to take over the CVS location near Belk.</p>
<p>What might be called the fourth anchor was originally People's Drug, supposedly in the mall from its inception. People's Drug was later bought out by Revco and in the late 90s, was bought out in turn by CVS. CVS moved to consolidate its two Elizabeth City locations, both of which were not well-trafficked, with this one seriously outdated and still located in a mall, the other close to Wal-Mart. A new location was built near downtown in late 2004, and Dragon Buffet immediately acquired the mall location, performing an extensive overhaul. The restaurant's success appears to have been key in revitalizing the mall, seemingly attracting more traffic than Belk and Penney combined on Fridays and weekends.</p>
<p>The mall suffered from high vacancy rates for a number of years, but has since regained a nearly 100% occupancy. Threats on the horizon do abound, as a new business district centered around a new Wal-Mart Supercenter west of town on US 17 Bypass is just getting started. Plans for a 'City Center West' development, supposedly operated by Chesapeake, VA's Greenbrier Mall is in the works. The mall has only received the most minor of improvements during its lifetime, mainly in the form of fresh paint. The facade of the building does not reach to the rear parking area, giving way to bare cinder block with the exception of Belk's. Plans to place a food court have evidently collapsed, as have plans to build a new wing with a multiplex and/or third main anchor (ex Sears or comparable).</p>

<p>Gillford Park are an English non-league football club from Carlisle, who compete in the Northern Football Alliance.</p>
<p><b>HISTORY</b></p>
<p>The Gillford Park upon whom we lay our support today, is infact the second incarnation of the guise, and were founded originally as Gillford Park Spartans. The original ‘Park, formed in 1989, entered the Northern Alliance Premier in the season beginning 1990 in place of Wigton (who themselves had competed since only 1980), and finished 3rd twice in their eight years in the league using the Gillford Park appellation, before disparity between the football committee and that of the stadium necessitated a move to Harraby in the north of the city, and a change of name to Harraby Catholic Club.</p>
<p>It was a further eight years until a conversation in a pub between Steven Skinner and Mike Linden resulted in the return of football to the land nestled between the mainline railway, farmland and a housing development in southern Carlisle. In the intervening years, rugby had taken premier place at Gillford Park Stadium, with the Carlisle Spartans playing Sunday League at the lesser Gillford Park next door. It was here that, in 2005, the newly formed Gillford Park staged their first competitive game. As a conformity of the sub-leasing of the land for Saturday use from Carlisle Spartans (who in turn held lease of the land from the Railway Club), the Spartans suffix was added to the name, but this lasted but one season as Gillford moved into the rugby league stadium for the season beginning 2006, with whom they had previously shared changing rooms.</p>
<p>The first season in the Northern Alliance was very much a learning curve – just, a very very successful learning curve, as Gillford systematically walked through the season, scoring 99 goals and finishing in the runners-up spot despite a three point deduction after being stuck in traffic and failing to make a match on time.</p>
<p><b>GROUND</b></p>
<p>Gillford Park is primarily not a footballing venue, with Carlisle RL having been resident for a number of years. There is evidence of this in abundance, the low roofed stand that sits on the near touchline, contrasted with the upward roof on the stand behind the goal, and the decaying scoreboard that still sits forlorn in the far corner. Nevertheless, it is still a wonderfully evocative ground suited ideally for football, and by far the best in its league.</p>
<p>Although it will never be described as a beautiful stadium, a group of volunteers have been and continue to work to tidy the ground up and carry out renovation works. New turnstiles will soon be in place as well as an executive lounge above the main stand, behind the goal. This stand seats just over 200 as well as a small disabled area toward the front.</p>
<p>Along the far touchline is the long terrace. This area of cover is, as you would expect, a long terrace, and I suspect it contributes in no small amount to the grounds 4,000 capacity. It runs for almost the whole touchline, with the supplementary area being just over grown hard standing that continues behind the far goal.</p>
<p>On the near touchline there is further cover in the raised, all seated stand. The large dugouts are situated directly in front of this, though below the 'line-of-sight', and a good view is to be had from this raised vantage point. The rest of the ground is plain hard standing (save for a small area in the near corner left), though is fully railed on all four sides, and there is a large clubhouse and bar set back from the pitch.</p>
