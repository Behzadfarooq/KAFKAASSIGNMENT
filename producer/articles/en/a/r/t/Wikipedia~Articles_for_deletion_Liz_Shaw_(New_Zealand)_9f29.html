<dl>
<dd>Correction: Wikipedian <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a> was kind enough to double-check the counting, and noticed that <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a>'s vote was incorrectly attributed as a "delete". This mistake has been corrected, and the numbers above reflect the new changes to the vote count. Of the 8 valid votes cast, 62.5% is for delete. This is marginally below the threshold of around 66% required for deletion, so the article "Liz shaw" will be undeleted and reinstated. "Liz Shaw NZ" contains the same content as "Liz shaw" as stated by 203.173.189.162. A disambiguation page <a href="../../../l/i/z/Liz_Shaw_%28disambiguation%29_8589.html" title="Liz Shaw (disambiguation)">Liz Shaw (disambiguation)</a> will also be made as a result. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 02:22, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Was first deleted before by me, but subsequently restored by me as well. There is sufficient content in here that probably should not have been speedily deleted, but I suspect this is not a notable subject and worthy of deletion. Would very much like a second opinion. Thanks very much! <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 05:54, 28 August 2005 (UTC) -- 02:21, 30 August 2005 (UTC): I added the other link to Liz Shaw NZ. Wikipedia shouldn't need two pages on this person? Perhaps I should notify the anonymous IP not to paste two copies of the article in Wikipedia. However, I think the reason why two pages exist is because I deleted one, and the IP created the other, and this sort of went back and forth... --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 02:21, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is - one of the more active Country-specific WikiProjects, too, complete with portal. But I digress.

<dd><a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a> - seeing as you live in Dunedin, there is a write up about the Liz Shaw phenomenon in a recent Critic issue.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Which isn't to say she's an uninteresting character. But <i>one</i> episode? <i>One</i> Idol crash-and-burn? <i>One</i> magazine? (Sigh.) Maybe I should submit all my rejection slips and see if I can get a 'pedia article about me&#160;:) --<a href="../../../k/j/p/User%7EKJPurscell_1583.html" title="User:KJPurscell">KJPurscell</a> 06:10, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Annon Edit; This above point is irrelevant as William Hung has a Wiki entry, for one bad audition he did. And Liz's subsequent publicity led to an invitation to do a porn movie with Ron Jeremy. Liz's publicity, while not on the same scale as William Hung's is still prolific considered New Zealand's size. I support the renaming to "Elizabeth Joan Shaw".</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> The Liz Shaw Phenomenon is actually quite widespread here in NZ. She is reasonably (in)famous, and has featured on several NZ websites and magazines (including one of the adult variety). With all respect to <a href="../../../k/j/p/User%7EKJPurscell_1583.html" title="User:KJPurscell">KJPurscell</a>, she has used her rejection as a springboard to more infamy (the same kind you'd get if you posed with your rejection slips in an erotic fashion). --<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a> 06:16, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>No vote yet</b></s>. I'd like to hear from more experienced Kiwi Wikipedians on this issue. On the one hand she seems "notable enough" but on the other hand everything I can find online about her looks like it is sourced from the same group of Internet forums; so it feels like this might just be an attack article by some very tenacious haters. Also, the "links" section on this article is of tragically poor quality, although VfD is not cleanup. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 12:29, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>RENAME</b> to "Elizabeth Joan Shaw" and disambig. Arguably outside of Kiwi-land, Dr. "Liz" Shaw, a character from <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Who_d5fc.html" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a> is more notable. 132.205.3.20 21:00, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>rename</b> per previous comment - my first thought was "why are they deleting Dr Who characters?". <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllegrorondo_9648.html" title="User:Allegrorondo">Allegrorondo</a> 21:04, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Annon: She is notorious amongst the student and youth pop of NZ but Dr Who would have arguably more world-wide relevance. However this does not mean the New Zealand Liz Shaw is not worth a wiki.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I've just tidied up portions of the page. I believe the article's worthy of retention, since she is now extremely well-known online in NZ and is becoming so in the wider population as well. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamf-nz_b14e.html" title="User:Samf-nz">samf-nz</a> 14:45, 30 August 2005 (NZT)<small>User has less than 10 edits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Samf-nz" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Samf-nz" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I smell socks. Take the above vote, for example. Two edits, both to this page. Naughty sock. I found maybe three relevant Google hits for this individual. I'd say a disambig of the "Liz Shaw" version to the Doctor Who character is a good choice. - Lucky 6.9 02:59, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>rename</b> I originally posted this article, and wanted it to go under "Liz_Shaw_NZ" to avoid ambiguation wiht the Dr Who Liz Shaw. Due to an error on my part it was posted to "Liz_shaw" instead, and when HappyCamper deleted it, I reposted it to Liz_Shaw_NZ because I thought that it should go to a vote, rather than speedy deletion. I would be happy for the article to be moved to Liz_Joan_Shaw, or left at Liz_Shaw_NZ with the Liz_shaw entry deleted. Also, I would like to mention that I am none of the people refered to in the article.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> While she apparently has some notoriety, it's not nearly notable enough for Wikipedia (IMHO as an NZer, of course). One concern is that the Wikipedia article itself is intended as a springboard.

<li>I've lost track of the asterisks, so someone can reformat this if necessary. I've heard of her, despite having read no student mags, hardly any blogs, and very few newspapers in the last 12 months. Eurekster.com search engine has not heard of her (and has only one entry on the fictional one). She's not the best advertisement for New Zealand, but there's enough public knowledge of her to keep the article in WP, preferably with a properly styled page name such as "Liz Shaw, New Zealand". I think she is more encyclopaedic than US college football coach <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Hines_ec98.html" title="Paul Hines">Paul Hines</a>, for example (nothing personal, Paul and friends!). <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobin_Patterson_109a.html" title="User:Robin Patterson">Robin Patterson</a> 05:59:17, 2005-08-30 (UTC)</li>

I'd agree with making <a href="../../../l/i/z/Liz_Shaw_1af5.html" title="Liz Shaw">Liz Shaw</a> a dab page though. The good doctor's companion (the first one with the Pertwee Doctor, IIRC) is well known here too. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 04:16, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></li>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In addition this topic is also relevant to anyone interested in the effects of popular media on young adults. The "Liz Shaw" phenomenon is a (IMO) facinating look at how far some people will go to get noticed - whether through fame or infamy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I support namming the topic as Liz Shaw NZ or Liz Shaw (New Zealand) as she is not known as Elizabeth Joan Shaw - as well as a dab page from <a href="../../../l/i/z/Liz_Shaw_1af5.html" title="Liz Shaw">Liz Shaw</a> to the correct pages for both the "Liz Shaws. I suppose that if the topic WAS to be renamed Elizabeth Joan Shaw that could be handled through a <a href="../../../l/i/z/Liz_Shaw_1af5.html" title="Liz Shaw">Liz Shaw</a> dab page also - would that mean that the current <a href="../../../l/i/z/Liz_Shaw_1af5.html" title="Liz Shaw">Liz Shaw</a> page is renamed to Liz Shaw (Dr Who) or similar? Maybe. A topic merge of both the <a href="../../../l/i/z/Liz_shaw.html" title="Liz shaw">Liz shaw</a> and Liz Shaw NZ entries is an excellent idea.</dd>

<li><b>KEEP</b> She is a well known person in New Zealand, with her appearing in adverts that screen daily, a documentary last week, many discussion forums, and NZ Idol (albeit only in one show).
