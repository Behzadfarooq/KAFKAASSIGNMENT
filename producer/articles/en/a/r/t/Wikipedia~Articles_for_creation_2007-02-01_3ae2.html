<p>Dear Wikipedia editor,</p>
<p>I noted a missing word in the wikipedia. Though it was previously possible to add an article, and your reasons for more regulation from the wild internet population are understandable: no I do not quote sources; this article is about a general term that I described in my own words, being an (amateur) specialist on the subject. I came here because a link was added by someone to another article that I submitted some time ago ("Encirclement"), but the link was void to the subject.</p>
<p>Thank you. &lt;&lt;article follows&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>A breakthrough occurs when an offensive force has broken the enemy defensive line, and is rapidly exploiting the gap. Usually, large force is employed on a relative small portion of the front to achieve this. While the line may have held for a long while prior to the breakthrough, the breakthrough marks a relatively small timeframe where the pressure on the defender leads him to "snap" in a very short timespan. As the first unit breaks, the adjacent units suffer adverse results from this (spreading panic, additional defensive angles, threat to supply lines) and, since hey were already pressured as well, leads them to "snap" as well, causing a domino-style collapse of the defensive system. The defensive force thus evaporates at the breakthrough point, giving the attacker the option to rapidly move troops into the gap, exploiting the breakthrough in width (by attacking enemy units at the edge of the breakthrough, so widening it), in depth (advancing into enemy terrritory and strategic objectives), or a combination of both.</p>

<p>Morgan was born in 1986 in the small town of Leitchfield, KY.</p>
<p>Since childhood she had dreams of becoming a Congresswoman or Senator, embracing such icons as Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>Teenage pregnancy and drug addiction threatened to shatter her dreams. But Morgan refused to become another statistic and with the strength of Christ and the support of an amazing family she continued to pursue her aspirations.</p>
<p>After earning her diploma, Morgan immediately enrolled in Jefferson Community College (JCC), where she is a political science sophomore. The moment she set foot on campus, Morgan's passion for politics was set ablaze. She began writing for her campus newspaper, covering local elections and writing opinion pieces.</p>
<p>Jefferson Community College did not welcome her conservative view points and certainly didn't encourage her active participation. Morgan had no qualms about calling out liberals and soon her articles began to cause controversy on campus.</p>
<p>During her first year of college, Morgan saw the need for more conservative organizations on her campus and was inspired to create Lost and Found, a campus bible study that has thrived on the Jefferson Campus. Never satisfied with the world around her, Morgan wanted to bring the conservative views she held, to a place where political diversity was nonexistent. So, she created a Young Americans for Freedom (YAF) Club and a College Republican Chapter.</p>
<p>For the past 2 years, Morgan has struggled against all odds to promote conservative values and help Republican candidates get elected. In addition to spending countless hours volunteering for Republican candidates, Morgan worked for the College Republican National Committee (CRNC) as a field representative. The CRNC deployed her to Michigan for the 2006 elections where she recruited over 350 new College Republicans in less than 6 weeks. She also created several new chapters.</p>
<p>Morgan became the focus of a controversial news story because she discussed an anti-illegal immigration event with a campus reporter. The event was one that had been taught by the CRNC, but through the assistance of biased media reports, Morgan's statements and actions became headline news. After much pressure from the media, Howard Dean, and a handful of leftist organizations, Morgan was asked to leave the CRNC.</p>
<p>Left jobless, homeless, and far from Kentucky, Morgan was not willing to give up. In a situation that would have caused many to simply bow out and admit defeat, Morgan kept her head up and stayed in the fight. She understood how important the 2006 elections were and she continued working enthusiastically for Republican candidates, even when it meant sleeping on victory center couches and eating volunteer pizza.</p>
<p>Then the Leadership Institute (LI) contacted her.</p>
<p>The LI decided to hire Morgan as a Campus Service Coordinator, which meant she would travel the nation creating conservative organizations, publications, and training young conservatives to be leaders and activists. In December, LI gave Morgan the opportunity to travel to London, England where actually met her life long icon, Margaret Thatcher.</p>
<p><br />
A considerable amount of Morgan's time was also spent volunteering for the Senator George Allen campaign in Virginia and Senate candidate Michael Steele's campaign in Maryland.</p>
<p>Morgan now lives in Louisville, KY with her 4 year old son, Jonathan, whom she is convinced will one day be President of the United States!</p>
<p>Morgan is thankful for all of her experiences. Morgan's troubled youth has allowed her to reach out to countless young people whom, like she once did, think that their dreams are shattered. Morgan has given, and continues to give, many speeches at churches and schools in hopes of inspiring young people to never give up on themselves.</p>
<p>Morgan is currently serving as Chapter Chair of the JCC College Republican chapter, working as an ambassador to the Leadership Institute, and serving on the Students for Brownback board as KY State Chair.</p>

<p>Balldinho grew up Sandy's, the most Western Parish in Bermuda. Upon birth, his parents had just purchased a luxurious beach mansion, so Wayne had split time between both his Grandmothers houses. He is an only child but comes from two families with very large backgrounds in Bermuda (His twin aunt and uncle are the heaviest twins in Bermudian History). Wayne attended West End primary school, he was a boisterous yet sensitive young man, often found in trouble because of his mouth. Here is where he established himself as a young aspiring cricketer in extra-curricular and student of excellence in Bermuda's education. From here he graduated with Honors and moved on to Sandy's Secondary Middle School. Where he would develop his skills as one of the most talented basketball players Bermuda ever produced. At Sandy's is where his nickname Balldinho "Rose to Prominence"</p>

<p>Balldinho is of Brazilian/Portuguese origin, it's primary meaning is "Little Ball". Wayne was blessed with this name due to the fact he is of brazilian descent amung his ancestry and also that he is named after his father, Allan Wayne Ball Sr. The fact that they both went by the same last name allowed him to take on this title. Wayme also followed in his fathers footsteps on the football field, where the talk of the name 'Balldinho' first came to life. Balldinho was quick and nimble on the football field but could never establish himself in one position. Quick and skillfull, yet not a prominent scorer, solid tackler but not a great clearer. Balldinho later gave up football for his current passions, Basketball and Cricket. Balldinho has represented on the international level in both Basketball and Cricket, and is currently a member of both Under 21 teams.</p>

                Utilities Development Co., W.L.L.
</pre>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This project has proved with no doubt, the important role of the Private Sector in the development process through activating the local investments as well as attracting the foreign investors.</p>
<p>Mohammed Abdulmohsin Al Kharafi and Sons Group through its strong alliance with Ionics Inc., USA started together in 1998 with the Pre-qualification for the Sulaibiya Wastewater Treatment and Reclamation Plant Tender. In May 2001, both established Utilities Development Co., as the first Special Purpose Company (SPC) in the State of Kuwait, to execute the Concession Contract under the Build Operate and Transfer (BOT) scheme.</p>
<p>On 7th May 2001, the Concession Contract was signed between the Government of the State of Kuwait represented by the Ministry of Public Works and Utilities Development Company.</p>
<p><br />
Sulaibiya Project</p>
<p>The Sulaibiya Wastewater Treatment and Reclamation Plant is a groundbreaking project, not only in the Middle East where it is the first infrastructure facility of its size to be executed as BOT but also worldwide as it is the largest of its kind using the reverse osmosis (RO) technique in domestic wastewater reclamation.</p>
<p>The Plant initially treats up to 375,000 cubic meter of raw domestic wastewater per day when it begins operations. The capacity would eventually reach up to 600,000 cubic meters per day during the 30-year concession period. The Plant treats around 60 per cent of Kuwait’s total domestic wastewater.</p>
<p>The Concession Period started on the 7th of July 2002. The Plant was constructed in less than 29 months and the Concessionaire is now operating and maintaining the Plant and until the expiry of the Concession Period.</p>
<p>The specifications of the Reclaimed Water produced from Sulaibiya Plant exceeds the World Heath Organization (WHO) standards for potable water. However, such use of the Reclaimed Water is limited to agricultural and industrial applications and possibly in a variety of other usages such as gardening, car and building washing. In addition, it could be re-charged in an underground aquifer to become a strategic water storage.</p>
<p>The Government of the State of Kuwait will buy all the Plant production of Reclaimed Water.</p>
<p><br />
The Start</p>
<p>The Project Journey started in 1998 with the pre-qualification of consortia that include local and foreign investors, in addition to specialized contractors for building a wastewater treatment and reclamation plant under Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) scheme in line with the State of Kuwait Government’s plan to target the effective participation of the private sector in building up the national economy, through the execution of infrastructure projects. Such projects were previously restricted to the Governmental Sector. In addition, the Government plan targets the local Private Sector to participate in strategic projects and at the same time encourage foreign investors to participate in the development process. This has been achieved in Sulaibiya Plant Project.</p>
<p><br />
Development Period</p>
<p>Signing the Concession Contract on 7th May 2002 was the start of a series of meetings and extensive communications between more than 10 cities around the Globe. However, most of these meetings were held in Kuwait and the working hours during this 14-month development period exceeded 300,000 man hours. This period ended on 7th July 2002.</p>
<p>During that period, the basic design of the Project was completed, and on 24th June 2002 the Facility Agreement was signed with National Bank of Kuwait, Gulf Bank and the Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East. Also the Engineering, Procurement and Construction Contract (EPC); and the Operation and Maintenance Contract which continues until the end of the Concession period, were also signed.</p>
<p>On 7th July 2002, both the Ministry of Public Works and Utilities Development Company signed a document announcing the commencement of the Concession Period and the start of the Construction.</p>
<p><br />
The Construction</p>
<p>During 29 months, several Kharafi Group companies, among them Mohammed Abdulmohsin Al-Kharafi for General Trading, Contracting and Industrial Structures (MAK), The National Company for Mechanical and Electrical Works (Kharafi National) and the Kuwaiti-British Readymix Concrete Company, in addition to the German Company Philip Holzmann and the Italian company Italba, all have joined their efforts in order to execute this groundbreaking mega Project, which is really considered a source of pride for the State of Kuwait.</p>
<p>By mid 2004, preparations started for the testing, commissioning and operations and on 14th August 2004 the diversion of the wastewater commenced from the old treatment plant at Ardiya to the New Pumping Station at Ardiya, from where it was pumped through the transfer pipelines to Sulaibiya.</p>
<p>After long and intricate series of testing for treatment and reclamation processes, the first drop of reclaimed water was produced from the Plant on Thursday 4th November 2004.</p>

<p>Sulaibiya Plant Project includes the Preliminary Treatment and Pumping Station at Ardiya, the Transfer Pipelines from Ardiya to Sulaibiya and the Treatment and Reclamation Plant at Sulaibiya.</p>
<p>The preliminary treatment of the wastewater starts with sand and grease removal upon its arrival at Ardiya Pumping Station. After which, the wastewater is directed to two Buffer Tanks each 67 meters diameter and 7 meters depth. These tanks regulate the flows arriving to Ardiya before being pumped to Sulaibiya. The Pumping Station contains 8 pumps of which 2 are standby, to transfer the wastewater through three pressure pipelines, 1400 millimetres each extending over 25 kilometres from Ardiya to Sulaibiya.</p>
<p>In order to safeguard the environment at the Ardiya Pumping Station in view of its proximity from residential areas, all facilities in this Pumping Station are covered. In addition, all those facilities are furnished with state-of-the-art odour control and removal equipment and odour monitoring systems. The Facilities are also surrounded with a green belt of trees to enhance the environment.</p>
<p>The biological treatment at Sulaibiya starts in 9 Aeration Tanks each 147 meters long, 28 meters wide and 8 meters depth. The Aeration Tanks are supplied with air from the Blower Building which contains 5 blower units.</p>
<p>From the Aeration Tanks, the water flows to 9 Circular Secondary Clarifiers each 56 meters diameter and 8 meters depth. The secondary treated water then flows to a Collection Basin in order to start the reclamation processes. The suspended solids are directed to the Gravity Belt Thickening Building, after which they are sent to 4 Aerobic Digesters each 58 meters long, 24 meters wide and 7 meters depth. These Aerobic Digesters are supplied with air from 3 blowers in a Blower House. After completing the digesting process, the remaining sludge is directed to the Sludge Drying Beds. The sludge is then stored in a special area for around 6 months in order to be suitable for use as a natural fertilizer.</p>
<p>The reclamation process starts after the arrival of the secondary treated water from the Collection Basin to the Ultra-Filtration Building, which contains 5 trains containing 8704 filter units in total. These filters secures the complete removal of the suspended solids and microbes. A periodical fully automated backwash process cleans the filters regularly.</p>
<p>From the Ultra-Filtration building, the water flows to the Reverse-Osmosis Building which contains 6 independent trains for reclamation. Each train contains 7 skids and the total number of membranes in these skids is 20,832, through which the water passes to the Permeate Basin. From this Basin, the reclaimed water flows through pipelines to the Ministry of Public Works’ Data Monitoring Centre (DMC) at Sulaibiya.</p>
<p>Most of the treatment and reclamation processes in the various Plant facilities are fully automated and use the latest state-of-the-art computer and control systems.</p>
<p><br />
Plant Operation &amp; Maintenance</p>
<p>After producing the first drop of reclaimed water on Thursday 4th November 2004, and upon the early commencement of the commercial operations of the Plant on 1st December 2004, The National Company For Mechanical and Electrical Works (Kharafi National) started to operate and maintain the Plant until the expiry of the concession period, with the participation of United Utilities company of the UK.</p>
<p>Ionics, remains involved with the operation and maintenance of Sulaibiya, not only as a shareholder in UDC, but by having Italba, one of its subsidiaries, operating and maintaining the ultra-filtration and reverse osmosis part of the Plant.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Major Project Benefits</p>
<p>• Save the Government the financial burden of huge investments. • Curb marine environmental pollution as no partially treated wastewater would be disposed off in the Gulf. • Reuse of the reclaimed wastewater in a safe manner that preserves the environment. • Eliminate the current problem of proliferation of unpleasant odors from the now abandoned conventional wastewater treatment plant at Ardiya. Those odors started to disappear with the commencement of the new Plant operations. • The Project has a strategic objective that is to re-charge the reclaimed water into the underground aquifer to be a strategic water reserve for the State of Kuwait. • Transform sludge into natural fertilizer suitable for all agricultural purposes. • The State of Kuwait buys the reclaimed water from the Concessionaire at a competitive price agreed upon in the Concession Contract. • When the Concession Period expires, the Plant ownership will be transferred to the State of Kuwait, free of charge. By then, the total savings to the State will be around KD3.2 billion ($11.00 billion) over the lifetime of the concession.</p>
<p>Sulaibiya is the first in a series of similar projects in the region through which problems related to the scarcity of water resources could be solved. Similar projects are also beneficial as they reduce the need to build more expensive seawater desalination plants.</p>
<p><br />
Sulaibiya Plant in numbers:</p>
<p>Plant capacity at start of operations 375,000 cubic meters per day = 82.5 million imperial gallons per day Plant capacity after expansion 600,000 cubic meters per day = 132 million imperial gallons per day Ardiya site area 60,000 square meters Sulaibiya site area 850,000 square meters Three transfer pipelines (Ardiya Sulaibiya) Diameter of each 1400 mm Length of each 25 km Concession Period 30 years – started 7th July 2002 EPC Turnkey Contract Duration 29 months - started on 7th July 2002 Operations and Maintenance period 27.5 years Working man-hours for EPC works 7,000,000 man-hours.</p>

The collective label given to a number of exciting new bands which began emerging from the Hastings area in 2006. Spearheaded by NME darlings Mumm-Ra and indie-punk trio Youngplan, Rotherbeat began as a tongue-in-cheek name. According to Youngplan guitarist Dale Weeks: "All the Liverpool greats were Merseybeat, and more recent London Bands like Jamie T, Mystery Jets and Larrikin Love have been throwing the word Thamesbeat around for a while now. "Members of Mumm-ra and Youngplan felt you didn't have to move to the city to join a trend or get yourself heard." The term has now become widely used in the local press, most notably by journalist Richard Morris in The Hastings Oserver who wrote: Music has a new buzz-word. Merseybeat, Madchester, Bristol Dance and Mackem Rock have all their stint at the top - leaving their indelible mark on the charts and live venues across the country. "Now a group of bands, spearheaded by NME darlings Mumm-ra, have set about spreading the word of a new music gospel - Rotherbeat. "From the rehearsal rooms of Ashburnham, Robertsbridge and Crowhurst to world domination. The word was Rotherbeat. And it was good." The term Rotherbeat has also been used by East Magazine and various music fanzines and its popularity has spawned the phrase "If it ain't Rother, don't Bother."</p>

<p>Peter Manor (1778 - 1847) was probably most well known as the founder of the town of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Providence%2C_Ohio_ad70.html" title="Providence, Ohio">Providence, Ohio</a>. Manor was of French decent and initially made a living travelling and trading with Native Americans in the areas of present day cities Detroit, MI, Toledo, OH, Lima, OH, Sandusky, OH, Cleveland, OH, Columbus, OH, and Fort Wayne, IN starting in the late 1700's (Rettig, 12). Manor was considered by the Native Americans to be a friend, resulting in good relationship. He continued to trade with Native Americans until approximately the early 1800's, when the US government ordered the removal of Native tribes, which was completed in approximately 1839 (Rozick, 10-11). In 1822, Manor constructed a sawmill and gristmill in what is now the ghost town of Providence, OH (Rozick, 12). Manor's decision to begin construction was based on two reasons. First, with the Native American removal, his trading business was begining to slow (Gillespie, 5). More importantly, though, with the conclusion of the War of 1812, in which the Natives fought, the area of Northwest Ohio had become more secure and subsequently, was beginning to become settled (Huffman, 10). Since the nearest mill to Providence was almost a full day's travel, the decision was to construct a mill was logical to Manor (Rettig, 15). In 1835, Manor platted the town of Providence, essentially founding it (White, Kiess, 138).</p>
<p>Things did not slow for Manor, though. The state of Ohio decided that it would construct the Wabash and Erie Canal through the town of Providence. Specifically, the state decided that the canal should run right through the location of Manor's Mill. Consequently, in 1838, the state of Ohio demolished Manor's Mill for the purpose of constructing the canal (Rozick, 12). Manor rebuilt the mill approximately ten miles down the river in an area that both was more densely populated and would better serve the communities of Providence, Grand Rapids, and Texas, Ohio (Rettig, 16). Manor continued as a pillar of the community of Providence, which was seen as a haven from the problems of drinking, gambling, and prostitution which typically plagued canal towns, until his death in September of 1847 (Rozick, 13).</p>

<p>Nadia Abu El Haj is an Assistant Professor at Barnard College who became the center of an a controversy over archaeology in the land of Israel.</p>
<p>Her 2001 book (a version of her Duke University doctoral thesis,) Facts on the Ground: Archaeological Practice and Territorial Self-Fashioning in Israeli Society is a post-colonial analysis of Israeli society a settler-colonial community that has “invented” an ancient history in the region by the use of archaeology. Abu El Haj “Reject(s) a positivist commitment to scientific methods…” instead, the book is “rooted in… post structuralism, philosophical critiques of foundationalism, Marxism and critical theory… and developed in response to specific postcolonial political movements.” She attempts to demonstrate how "(social) science generates facts or phenomena, which refigure what counts as true or real. One news story summarized criticism of the book, “the book's aim is to undermine the historic connection between the Jewish people and Israel… the critique of Israeli archaeology is poorly researched and written, and … the author's anti-Israel bias undercuts her work.” <a href="http://insidehighered.com/news/2006/11/21/disputes" class="external free" title="http://insidehighered.com/news/2006/11/21/disputes" rel="nofollow">http://insidehighered.com/news/2006/11/21/disputes</a></p>
<p>A separate controversy arose when Abu El Haj charges a prominent archaeologist, David Ussishkin of the University of Tel Aviv with “bad science” on the grounds that “bulldozers are used in order to get down to earlier strata which are saturated with national significance, as quickly as possible” because of “nationalist politics guiding research agendas.” Abu El Haj based her charges on the word of anonymous “archaeologists and student volunteers” who “recounted (the incident) to me after the fact.” <a href="http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/3031" class="external free" title="http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/3031" rel="nofollow">http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/3031</a> <a href="http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archives/009599.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archives/009599.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archives/009599.shtml</a> David Ussishkin has denied the accusation. <a href="http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archives/009649.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archives/009649.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archives/009649.shtml</a> <a href="http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/3032" class="external free" title="http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/3032" rel="nofollow">http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/3032</a></p>
<p>His denial is supported by the distinguished archaeologist Aren Maier of Bar Ilan University. “...by the way, despite what Abu el-Haj repeatedly states, Israeli archaeologists do not only excavate archaeological remains relating to "their heritage". In fact, as any one can see from the excavations at Tell es-Safi/Gath for example, we deal with, excavate, study, publish and relate to finds from various periods, including "Pre-Israelite", "Post-Israelite" etc.” <a href="http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/3032" class="external free" title="http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/3032" rel="nofollow">http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/3032</a> <a href="http://gath.wordpress.com/2006/12/06/re-discussion-of-nadia-abu-el-hajs-book-on-israeli-archaeology/" class="external free" title="http://gath.wordpress.com/2006/12/06/re-discussion-of-nadia-abu-el-hajs-book-on-israeli-archaeology/" rel="nofollow">http://gath.wordpress.com/2006/12/06/re-discussion-of-nadia-abu-el-hajs-book-on-israeli-archaeology/</a></p>
<p>Reviews by anthropologists were mixed: “Abu El-Haj provides an important and timely look at some of the politics of self-representation behind the Israeli government's public face, within a broader argument about science's capacity for political involvement and for maintaining and even advancing colonialist policies. However, I reiterate that her failure to present either official Palestinian or public Palestinian/Israeli opinions and attitudes within the context of Israel's (settler) nationalist-archaeological discipline means that answers to the excellent questions she raises are never made clear.” Kimbra L. Smith , University of Notre Dame American Ethnologist Volume 30 Number 2 May 2003 <a href="http://www.aaanet.org/aes/bkreviews/result_print.cfm?bk_id=592" class="external free" title="http://www.aaanet.org/aes/bkreviews/result_print.cfm?bk_id=592" rel="nofollow">http://www.aaanet.org/aes/bkreviews/result_print.cfm?bk_id=592</a></p>
<p>She moves a step forward and examines how the issue of the nation enters the arena of scientific practices. This is probably the primary contribution of the book in relation to other studies of nationalism and archaeology: the focus on archaeological practices as the main object of study…. Nadia Abu El-Haj highlights the continuities between the colonial and the national periods in terms of archaeological reasoning, and claims that there is a "dynamic relationship between empiricism and nationalism ... and the former gave credible form to the latter, not just in narrative, but, even more powerfully, in material cast”…Facts on the Ground offers a unique and pioneering approach to examine the politics of archaeological research. Apen Ruiz, The University of Texas, Austin H-Gender-MidEast (May, 2004) <a href="http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=315181094215190" class="external free" title="http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=315181094215190" rel="nofollow">http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=315181094215190</a></p>
<p>Reviews by historians have been negative:</p>
<p>“El-Haj is not a practicing archaeologist. She hardly knows the Hebrew in which many Israeli archaeological debates are conducted. She has taken part in very few actual digs. Yet she confidently condemns Israeli archaeology as a tool of the Zionists. With only gossip to go on, she accuses one archaeologist of bulldozing non-Jewish strata to get to the levels that might offer details about ancient Israel. Bizarrely, she then concludes her book by reversing herself on such desecration, asking us to "understand" sympathetically the Palestinian mob that destroyed Joseph’s Tomb on October 8, 2000. I guess it all depends on whose narrative is being bulldozed.” Jonathan Burack, The Family Security Foundation, December 28, 2006 <a href="http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/homeland.php?id=537580" class="external free" title="http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/homeland.php?id=537580" rel="nofollow">http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/homeland.php?id=537580</a> “The huge amount of evidence and scholarship demonstrating that ‘an ancient Israelite social collectivity emerged,’ becomes in her hands ‘a tale best understood as the modern nation’s origin myth… transported into the realm of history.’ ” Diana Muir and Avigail Appelbaum, History News Network, May 31, 2006, <a href="http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/25976.html" class="external free" title="http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/25976.html" rel="nofollow">http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/25976.html</a></p>
<p>Archaelogists have criticized the book harshly:</p>
<p>The reception by archaeologists was harsh. The dean of Middle Eastern archaeology, William Dever of the University of Arizona, “who has authored more than 20 books on Middle East History, said Ms. Abu El-Haj seems intent on writing Jews out of ancient Middle East history, and demonizing a generation of apolitical Israeli archaeologists in the process. Barnard should deny Ms. Abu El-Haj tenure, he said, ‘not because she's Palestinian or pro-Palestinian or a leftist, but because her scholarship is faulty, misleading and dangerous.’ ” <a href="http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/2946" class="external free" title="http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/2946" rel="nofollow">http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/2946</a> "At the heart of her critique is an undisguised political agenda that regards modern and ancient Israel, and perhaps Jews as a whole, as fictions… "Abu El Haj's anthropology is undone by her... ill-informed narrative, intrusive counter-politics, and by her unwillingness to either enter or observe Israeli society... "The effect is a representation of Israeli archaeology that is simply bizarre... Filling in what is missing from her text becomes fatiguing. In the end there is no reason to take her picture of Israeli archaeology seriously, since her selection bias is so glaring… "Abu El Haj has written a flimsy and supercilious book, which does no justice to either her putative subject or the political agenda she wishes to advance. It should be avoided." Alexander H. Joffe, Lecturer in Archaeology, Purchase College, SUNY Journal of Near Eastern Studies. Chicago: Oct 2005. Vol. 64, Iss. 4; p. 297 <a href="http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archives/008510.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archives/008510.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archives/008510.shtml</a> "This book is a deceptively well-written, well researched monograph that superficially bears all the signs of a state-of-the-art contemporary social science study…"Alas, a detailed reading reveals that this book is a highly ideologically driven political manifesto, with a glaring lack of attention both to details and to the broader context... In this review, I will try to focus on several points that I believe point to three cardinal weaknesses of the book: the anti-Zionist/anti-Israeli agendas that taint its very foundations; a glaring misunderstanding and lack of intimate knowledge of details; and the exasperating "tunnel vision" that assumes that Zionism and the State of Israel exist in a vacuum... "Abu el-Haj's anti-Israeli ideology pervades the book. An outstanding example is her reference to "the indigenous Arab inhabitants (some of whom were Jews)" (p. 4). Such terminology simply denies the right of Jewish national self-determination. Coming from a "postcolonialist," this is surprising, but revealing. One cannot escape the conclusion that Abu el-Haj's problem is not the misuse of archaeology in the State of Israel but, rather, its very existence… "Perhaps the most astonishing part of the book is a discussion on the last page of the text (p. 281). Abu el-Haj describes and condones the attack, and subsequent ransacking, by a Palestinian mob on what is known as "Jacob's Tomb" in Nablus in 2001. Several people were killed as a result of this attack; the gleeful tone in which she describes this act of vandalism exemplifies how her political agenda completely overcame her duties as a social scientist… "This book is the result of faulty and ideologically motivated research. One can but wonder how the 1995 dissertation on which it is based was authorized at Duke University and how a respected publisher like the University of Chicago Press could have published such unsubstantiated work.” Maeir, Aren, Professor of Archaeology, Bar Ilan University, Isis, volume 95 (2004), pages 523–524, www.solomonia.com/blog/archives/006114.shtml "Discussing Israeli archeology as a cultural phenomenon requires an in-depth understanding of Israeli society and, above all, a working knowledge of scholarly Hebrew. Abu el-Haj indicates she studied Hebrew in a desultory fashion, and although her bibliography and footnotes do contain references to Hebrew publications, she appears to have invested lightly in the multitude of Hebrew sources that could have informed her study and made it compelling… As it stands, Abu el-Haj's reading of Israeli academic culture and its relationship to the politics of statehood politicizes the work of Israel's scholarly establishment in a way that can be misleading. Even when granting certain Israeli archeologists their academic integrity, she tends to describe their findings as bent by the state for its own political purposes. This is inaccurate. In fact, Israeli archeology is characterized by lively discussion that values independent scientific inquiry and often undermines conventional wisdom, be it the previous wisdom of peers or that of the nation's foundational narratives. Both the print and electronic media give extensive coverage to archeological digs and displays. The broad outline of that lively debate is well known among those many Israelis who follow archeological developments… Given her interest in cultural studies, it is not surprising that Abu el-Haj casts an exceedingly wide net, and that leads to problems. Her discussion of archeological practice conflates the statements of tour guides, the claims of museum displays, the design of archeological parks in Jerusalem, and the assertions of Israeli political figures—particularly those politicians with strong links to the settler movement—with the research and writing of a highly demanding scholarly discipline... Abu el-Haj misrepresents the Israeli passion for archeology. Its purpose is not to legitimize the national ethos. To the contrary: archeology appeals to Israelis because it offers a visual dimension to a past otherwise firmly anchored in oral and literary traditions. For professionals and amateurs alike, the archeology of the land of Israel is not a vehicle to authenticate the nation's existence or its distinctively Jewish character or the passionate attachment of Israelis to the land they claim as their state. All that is taken for granted by Israel's Jewish citizens and by most of the world as well. Rather it is only those who deny Israel's right to exist or contest the legitimacy of its current borders who deny altogether or compromise Israel's links to the historic past." Jacob Lassner, Professor of History and Religion at Northwestern University, Middle East Quarterly, Summer 2003, <a href="http://www.meforum.org/article/560" class="external free" title="http://www.meforum.org/article/560" rel="nofollow">http://www.meforum.org/article/560</a></p>
<p>Methological criticisms: “Abu El-Haj speaks not with archaeologists who are excavating, but with archaeologists on tours given in conjunction with international archaeological congresses.

<p>The story follows Sleeve McDougs, who dreams of one day becoming the world's greatest samurai. He takes on adventures as a mercenary, and bounty hunter, in order to increase his skill. With his companion Neko Dare, a talking cat, he learns alchemy, and sword skills. Other characters are brought about in the series, including Train Usagi, Teru Shimauma, and Frost. The series keeps a balance between action, and comedy. Several comical villians are fought, such as Akira "Steelwall" Gelantium, who uses alchemy to control Jello, and Chris Gamer, who controls opponents with a video game controller. Alchemy is a common practice in A Philosopher's Alchemy, being used to cast spells to aid daily life.</p>

Malcolm McFee, an English actor born on 26th August 1949 in Forest Gate, Newham, was best known for his role as Peter Craven in the hit TV series "Please Sir!" (1968) and "The Fenn Street Gang" (1971). "Please Sir!" (1968) was set in a south London secondary school called The Fenn Street School, the situation comedy assayed the travails of a naive school teacher played by John Alderton and his unruly class of students. McFee, who turned 19 when the program was first broadcast in 1968, played one of the mob of rowdy adolescent boys and girls. McFee also was in the 1971 movie of the same name, Please Sir! (1971). He appeared in the anti-war satirical musical Oh! What a Lovely War (1969). In 1971 he played the role of a young soldier in the BBC's Elizabeth R and also that year he was cast as a travel clerk in The rivals of Sherlock Holmes. In late 1971 aged 22, he married Barbara Kearnan who gave birth to their daughter Victoria in 1980, they were later divorced.</p>
<p>After series star John Alderton left the show in 1971, the series was renamed "The Fenn Street Gang" and focused on the kids after they had left school. "The Fenn Street Gang" lasted until from 1971-1973, McFee was unavailable for the first series but returned in 1972 as Peter Craven for series 2 and 3. The shows were popular, consistently ranking in the top five during their entire runs.</p>
<p>McFee's career went disintegrated after _"The Fenn Street Gang" (1971)_. He made guest appearances on other TV shows such as Bless this House in 1973, The Sweeney 1978, Goodnight Sweetheart 1996, Birds of a Feather 1997 and The Detectives 1997. He turned to the stage, where he made a career as an actor and director. As a theatre director, he worked in small theaters in Greater London and the provinces, he directed and starred in more than 250 shows. He was diagnosed with cancer in 1999 and in June 1999 married Jacqueline Marsh. McFee held a range of charity events to raise funds for the Oncology Unit at Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford, including a Rick Wakeman concert at the Braintree Institute and a number of celebrity golf days which raised £3,400. He was a familiar face to regulars of the Wagon and Horses pub in Braintree Essex, which he ran.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-02-01_3ae2.html" title="Edit section: Pakmusic - Pakistani Music Sites">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pakmusic - Pakistani Music Sites</span></h2>
<p>There is no doubt that Pakistan's underground and pop music industry is the best in Asia. We produce almost a band a day, with many singers by the hour. Much junk as it creates, you are bound to come across one good band and singer at least every other month! The result: a long list of really awesome singers and bands who are now catching international attention, from Bollywood to the Middle East, Europe, North America, and the Far East. Pakistani music is catching on and, as we keep stressing, can be our answer to Bollywood for promoting Pakistan's culture on a global level, if managed well!</p>
<p>Remarkably, and aptly, our young musicians and music producers are making full use of the Internet to get the world into the Pakistani groove. In addition, a lot of creative minds have developed websites dedicated to Pakistani music - featuring new releases, album reviews, interviews, and more. For those concerned about downloading Pakistani songs, please note that most, if not all, contemporary Pakistani artists have made their own songs available for download on their websites at no charge. So there are no royalty issues involved in most cases.</p>
<p>In this article, we have compiled a list of Pakistani music websites that we found to be the best, based on their cosmetics, content, and quality.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
<b>#1 Pakmanzil.com</b></p>
<p>Pakmanzil is not just a music download site, but it is a site about Pakistani music and musicians.</p>
<p>A relatively new site, Pakmanzil has a jazzy interface and good navigation. You can play as well as download MP3s.</p>
<p>Since this is a new site, there are not that many songs available on it yet (107 MP3s at the time of this article in Nov. '06). However, you will find most of the new hit songs by popular Pakistani bands on Pakmanzil.</p>
<p>The bonus feature of this site is exclusive, original interviews with upcoming and popular artists. Other extras are lively forums, an up to date blog with gossip about the music industry, and guitar tabs to a lot of popular new songs.</p>
<pre>
<b>A New Project DesiRockerz</b>
</pre>
<p>Pakmanzil and Mast Fm 103 have collabrated to bring you a radio show "Desi Rockerz" , they promote new bands and artist.</p>
<p>Also, In 2006 this site has been sucessful promoting Roxen, a Pakistani rock band which had the best selling album "Rozen-E- Dewaar" in Pakistan in 2006.</p>
<p>Bottomline, this is a good first stop to check out what and who is new on the Pakistani music scene.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>#2 Muziq.net</b></p>
<p>Offers Pakistani music playback (no downloads). You can create an online CD (playlist) and listen to your selection. Requires a decent connection speed (have not tested on dial-up).</p>
<p>Muziq.net has a great selection of new and old music in audio and video format. We counted over 300 artists/albums and over 2,000 songs.</p>
<p>The sound quality is very good in most cases.</p>
<p>It also has bonus features like TV shows including PTV dramas and some excellent music shows, including tributes to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Noor Jehan, and Faiz Ahmed Faiz.</p>
<p>The main weakness we found in the website is its overall look and feel - there's a lot of information to process and takes a while to get used to the navigation.</p>
<p>It's a good site if you kind of know what you are looking for!</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>#3 Pakistanimusic.com</b></p>
<p>This site's navigation is really good. A clean layout, easy on the eyes, simple to find what you are looking for!</p>
<p>You can play the songs and create your "favorites" lists, but cannot download them. You have to go through free registration to listen to the songs. The site has over 200,000 members.</p>
<p>The song selection is really good, especially in the "golden era" section. You will find a wealth of oldies, from ghazals to film songs, right from Saleem Raza and Ahmed Rushdi to Naheed Akhtar and Mehnaz. This is the biggest attraction of this site as their collection was definitely the best and widest.</p>
<p>There is a great concept in the site to create artist home pages, but not all of them are updated. There are some good articles on Pakistani actors and singers but not too many.</p>
<p>The big weakness in this site is that the artists and songs are arranged alphabetically but the navigation is not alphabetical, e.g. you jump to songs 1-120 instead of all songs beginning with A.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
<b>#4 Pakmusic.net</b> This is a good site.</p>
<p>The site has songs, videos, a forum, and lots of news and updates. You have to register to access most of the areas.</p>
<p>The site has a huge library of songs available for download...but there is a fee starting from $9.99 to $19.99 per year. It used to be free once, but because the site has over 65,000 members probably hitting it every day to download something new, they charge a fee (money goes to the admins) Navigation is not great but if you stick around long enough you will figure it out. Bad thing is they support piracy, But overall its a very good site.</p>

<li><b>Redirect created</b>. I decided to create a redirect rather than a separate article since the article <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herding.html" title="Herding">herding</a> is very small, and it's better practice not to create separate articles for subtopics until the article on the topic is long enough. When the article on <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herding.html" title="Herding">herding</a> becomes a full article, then we can separate this material back out to make it into its own article. You can add material to <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herding.html" title="Herding">Herding</a>, but please be aware that Wikipedia cannot accept copyrighted material, so material copied from websites is not allowed, even if it's just a sentence. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelldot_cc92.html" title="User:Delldot">delldot</a> | <small><a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDelldot_82a5.html" title="User talk:Delldot">talk</a></small> 21:52, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
