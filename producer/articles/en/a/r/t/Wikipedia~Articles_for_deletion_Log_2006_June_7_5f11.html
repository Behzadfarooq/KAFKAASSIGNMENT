<li><b>Keep</b> 3corridors.com is NOT the home of the a map carrying the same name, but the home of the Kali 3c community. The community is now small and in stagnation, but was once much larger. Larger communities do exist, Warguilds has over 5000 registered members. But since when was publishing an article on Wikipedia based on popularity(even more, on current popularity)? From what I have read, this article breaks no rules. The map is however very significant to the Warcraft III mapmaking community, as it spawned countless versions of it and inspired other maps, such as the already mentioned DoTA. It is probably true that this map is dying, even most of the old sites are gone(such as the original 3 Corridors page or Ray's forum), but is that really a valid reason for deletion?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The lack of popularity on Battle.net does not diminish it's significance and can easily be explained by the nature of the game. For proper enjoyment of 3 corridors, prior knowledge of the game is needed, making it unattractive to new players. As an extreme example take RE, where several hundred plays are expected from a player to become valuable to his team, much of the Kali community consists of people playing RE/TE for several years. And Battle.net certainly isn't a place for a 3 Corridors map to thrive, where even the usual 3 minute revival time results in players quitting upon death. --Leto

<dd>I can repeat the same arguments that I placed on the article's talk page here. I'm the creator of the article. I understand the concerns regarding this term as a buzzword, but I'm convinced that enough organizations and mission statements refer to it to warrant definition as a unique term. A Google search for the exact phrase returns over 1,100,000 appearances of the exact term on the Internet. Since the PROD, I've added external links to the most prominent organizations that consider the philosophy to be part of their mission statement, and I've referred to concerns about the term's "buzzword" status within the article. Clearly, I'm in favor of <b>keep</b>ing the article. skeeJay 22:01, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd love to, but don't really have the expertise. I do think it's possible, so deleting the current (incomplete) article is not the best course of action.

The topic is unquestionably of suitable academic value. HOWEVER - take a look at the history. Nobody has tried to modify the article in two years. Having a stub that absolutely nobody is interested in expanding isn't helpful.

<li><b>Keep</b> Mike Gurrie is a renowned figure in student politics at the London School of Economics. His election campaign and involvement in issues pertinent to students means he has a high level of name recognition (the vast majority of a student body of 8,000 know him by both name and face). The transient nature of student politics, and the poor documentation of them due to the logistical limitations of student media, means that it is important that this individual, who made a significant contribution to local politics and wellbeing, should be remembered. Mike Gurrie satisfies the requirements of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> as he has both made a widely recognised contribution to his specific field (which requires enduring historical record) and is a major local political figure who received significant press coverage. Surely the purpose of Wikipedia is not just to include information which is contained elsewhere, but to incorporate and preserve unique articles which would otherwise be forgotten. Mike Gurrie has no connection to the article, which was in fact envisaged and written by a senior reporter at The Beaver, the student newspaper at the LSE (which is itself worthy of an article). Consequently, the article is not convoluted by vanity. May I add that "detailed obscure topics hurt no-one because it's pretty hard to find them by accident, and Wikipedia isn't paper" (from <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Wikipedia:Importance</a>). Please, preserve the article- it is inoffensive and will bring laughter to those from the LSE from years to come as they recollect events otherwise forgotten. Chriswarnock 00:38, 8 June</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Categories work beautifully for this. List of schools in Canada: A (etc...) is really unmaintainable. List of schools in Nunavut might work, but List of schools in Ontario wouldn't, so let's not do the 13-list approach either.

<li><b>Delete</b>, Canada is not Singapore. In Canada, there are thousands of schools, a list will not make sense. But in Singapore, there are less than 500, so a list will make sense.

<li><b>Keep</b>, but only as a parent list and the thing needs some heavy restructuring. Trying to sort these list <i>alphabetically</i> is a bad idea, as it is redundant with categories. However, trying to sort the schools by <i>location</i> (e.g. sublists like List of schools in Alberta, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_New_Brunswick_9fcd.html" title="List of schools in New Brunswick">List of schools in New Brunswick</a> and List of schools in Newfoundland) should work and those lists are no more unmaintainable than the list we have at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_Norway_a11e.html" title="List of schools in Norway">List of schools in Norway</a>. The fact that we have some "list of schools by country" entries, indicates that we should not present the readers with a redlink at this title. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 11:34, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> In my experience, lists like this start off with great fanfare and are kept up-to-date with the latest changes. Then after awhile the list author loses interest and the list slowly decays until it is so out of date it is no longer useful. Categorization, although it doesn't show the non-articled list entries is still a better way to go. While the hierarchical structure is a little cumbersome, the dynamic nature is a major strength. --<a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EAtrian_4bb8.html" title="User:Atrian">Atrian</a> 16:41, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>School deletionists are very often uncivil. That is one of the reasons why they lost out so totally on high schools: people who are sneered at and demeaned often fight back. One of the objectionable traits shared by many deletionists is that no matter how many times they lose, and the number of different users who vote against them, they declare their opponents to be a small minority.

<li><b>Generalise</b>. It's POV because there's no Yahoo Censorship or MSN Censorship, or even Baidu Censorship; singling out Google for something every search engine does is clearly biased. However, a general article on Search Engine Censorship, discussing the censorship practices of other search engines as well as those of Google, would not be biased. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 17:42, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This is an issue for cleanup or revision, not a wholesale deletion! Haeleth has a valid point but until then, there is no requirement for deletion and I fail to see how it even came to be brought up as such. -- <a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvanx_e026.html" title="User:Evanx"><sup><b><font color="brown">Evanx</font></b></sup></a><small>(<a href="../../../e/v/a/User_talk%7EEvanx_162a.html" title="User talk:Evanx">tag?</a>)</small> 17:53, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> Reaks of POV; a future article on "Search engine censorship" would likely be focused on Google, since it is the most popular service of its kind today. The <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Google_253d.html" title="History of Google">History of Google</a> already provides sufficient information on the company's controversies. --<a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadchester_c727.html" title="User:Madchester">Madchester</a> 18:23, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The practice is notable and well documented, so no issue there. The only issue I see is regarding merging into other articles, such as mentioned above by William Pietri, but I think Google's prominence and the wealth of sourced info here justify the independent article. As far as POV accusations, to make that claim one would have to argue that the censorship does not exist, and I think Google freely admits it. Overall the article seems fairly factual, IMO. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 23:39, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, I appreciate the effort put into the article, but the website is not notable enough, yet. I suppose it could be userfied if it isn't considered overly promotional. On this article, I am confident in my decision and don't think more time will help. However, in general, I'm reluctant to wait a while and renominate, since many people seem to reflexively recommend keep after the first nomination fails. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 07:38, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There doesn't appear to be a "line of succession to the President of Pakistan": the President is elected for a five-year term by the electoral college.

<p>I don't think this "theorem" is in fact being used in mathematics. As the nominator said on the VfD page, it seems to be a "pretty feeble math joke". The article lists four references. The first reference is a one-liner in another online encyclopaedia (and we all know how reliable online encyclopaedia are, don't we?).

<li><b>Keep/Merge</b> I'd like to respond to some of these comments if I may... it is maintainable and it is very useful, given the emphasis on Israel in American foreign policy. I agree it is not as exhaustive a list as I would like but it is a beginning, it would help if organizations like The New York Times (as an example) would release the names and ethnicity of their editors, for instance. Whether or not something is potentially a vehicle for anti-Semitism isn't relevant, unless you can cite official Wikipedia policy on this for me. Moreover, anti-Semitism isn't as clear cut a topic as many of you would like it to be. As for the list being moved previously, this appears to be false, it appears to have been recreated from scratch and now excludes all of those names which actually control these many news organizations, which of course is the more interesting aspect of the list. I think that if you delete you will call more attention to this issue than if you just leave it alone. Kirkswig 06:31, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Again it seems we are applying a different standard to this list than we do other such lists, unless of course the vote is that we delete ALL of these lists, but since we've already had that AfD vote... Kirkswig 20:52, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If this other list didn't exist, I might not say delete, but this is a subject of obvious and high potential for controversy.

<li>I'm working on getting this more verifiable. As far as "promotional", can anyone point me to the wiki policy on what is promotional and what isn't. The deletion policy page does not mention the word "promotional" at all: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy</a> so it's not clear to me that promotional is a valid grounds for deletion, but I'm a newbie and want to learn.

<ul>
<li>The relevant policy is <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, which requires content be neutral (by nature, that which is promotional is not neutral). Being promotional, alone, does not require deletion if it can be fixed. The only way to provide neutrality, is to have multiple independent reliable sources discuss the topic. I don't see that, and don't see how this article is fixable. Also, message boards, blogs, and personal web pages, are not adequate secondary sources, you'll need to find some reliable publications that have written about this, which may be difficult. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 17:46, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As I was writing the article I attempted to take the neutral POV. I attribute assertions to others. I present a range of points of view, both woven through the article and in 4.18. I am having trouble seeing how the article diverges from neutral POV. I do understand that the NPOV issue is secondary to the NV issue but I'd like to know what about this article violates NPOV if just for my learning. --Sprexumn 18:28, 7 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I haven't read the article in detail, but for future reference, FAQs aren't a good idea. They lend an unencyclopedic tone of voice to an article, and that generally implies some kind of POV.

<li><b>Very weak delete</b> Wooooah there, people! Yeah, that sockpuppet is an idiot, and the stuff he was making up was idiotic. But we should be judging this article as a one-sentence stub, and not as a false video game. I saw this doc twice, and it is not just real, but incredibly interesting. However, a quick Google test will show that not many people saw/cared about/talked about it, and it's not listed on IMDb, so I'm still voting delete. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 11:59, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> yeah, it's the notability. By a quick count <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discovery_Channel_ee82.html" title="Discovery Channel">Discovery Channel</a> alone has 14 channels that show documentaries. Stubs for every non-notable program they show is not terribly useful. Articles about series are much better (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_programs_broadcast_by_Discovery_Channel_ddfc.html" title="List of programs broadcast by Discovery Channel">List of programs broadcast by Discovery Channel</a>), or if there is a particularly famous single program that would be different. <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 13:37, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, it's not deleted yet. Maybe you can demonstrate the notability of the documentary before the vote is finalized. And don't forget about The Girl Who Turned to Stone.

<dd>Oh, well... I'm not really familiar with The Girl Who Turned to Stone, so I guess my vote only applies to The Smallest People in the World.

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b></s>. A google search shows some web campaigning, some links from charitable index sites but currently little else. Whilst I don't see that the Foundation would need to be any more notable than any other, it does need to establish its notability in the article.

<li><b>Comment</b>. TunaHAKI has been a registered charity in Tanzania since 1998 and it has rescued over 100 orphans from the streets which may not be notable in Wikepedia world, but is quite notable in the real world? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Sfifer (<a href="../../../s/f/i/User_talk%7ESfifer_f7a4.html" title="User talk:Sfifer">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sfifer_ff78.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sfifer">contribs</a>) 2006-06-07 16:46:52.</small>
<ul>
<li>I'm confused — the article says that the Foundation was founded in 2006. Are there two different entities called TunaHAKI? If you can provide <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> references for the 100+ orphans claim, that <i>may</i> cause some reconsideration for some editors on this list. — <a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEstarriol_Esperanza_23fc.html" title="User:Estarriol/Esperanza"><font color="green">Es</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEstarriol_eb96.html" title="User:Estarriol"><font color="blue">tarriol</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/t/User_talk%7EEstarriol_4f49.html" title="User talk:Estarriol">talk</a></sup> 16:56, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Taking a quick look around on google they do appear to be two separate, but loosely connected, organisations. The original TunaHAKI (based in Tanzania) was founded in 1998 and its official website can be found <a href="http://www.tunahaki.com/About%20us.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.tunahaki.com/About%20us.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The TunaHAKI foundation (based in California) was founded in 2006 and though it <a href="http://www.tunahaki.org/links.html" class="external text" title="http://www.tunahaki.org/links.html" rel="nofollow">says it supports</a> the original TunaHAKI, it appears to be an entirely separate entity.

<li>I would certainly support an article for TunaHAKI, which could have a section on the new foundation. That would require a TunaHAKI article to merge into though.

<li><b>Comment</b> The phrase was used in the movie <i>Aliens</i> before becoming a primary point of the <i>Starship Troopers</i> movie (which differed greatly from the novel that, I think, didn't use the phrase at all). So it is at least evident in two films, rather than one. However, the article doesn't provide compelling enough evidence of there being enough films, books, comics or videogames in existence that could qualify it as a genre. I certainly don't think that three is a large enough number! <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 12:45, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Excuse me, you sir are a moron. I am insulted that you have not heard of "Deutsch Vagin Club". It is a fairly small organisation started by this great man Mano..and still today helps underprivledged children walk to school every morning. Mano is a great man. Sure, the picture may not be of him exactly, but it is the vibe that is given off that is important. There was no opportunity for photos when Mano enterd the olympics. Do not insult Mano by removing this page.</p>
<p>I agree whole-heartedly with the above comment. If you people cannot simply accept the magnitude of Mano's character, and try to bring him down with false claims then that is just proposterous. I am dissappointed with the ignorance of viewers of this website. How one can not be aware of the Deutsch Vagin Klub is just beyond my comprehension. If this article is taken down, it will be read as no less than a personal prejudiced attack. Mano is a vengeful character, I urge careful consideration to take place.</p>

<dl>
<dd>I hate to rain on this obsessive-compulsive parade, but couldn't this article include every work of fiction ever produced, in some form or another, especially speculative/science fiction and fantasy? It took me a moment to even think of one useful purpose such an article might serve, but there is one: to simply outline the conceptual differences between such fictions, as this does to some degree by detailing the different categories of fictional universes that can exist. There is absolutely no function served by creating a repository in which everyone can note their favorite fictional universe. Examples are useful, sure, but I think some limits should be in place. I put my opinion out tentatively--clearly someone is interested, if so much has been done here, but I think this is more a case of interest on the part of the creators than on the part of potential readers. No one can really gain any kind of knowledge from these "shout outs" to our favorite works of fiction. Fearwig 03:52, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am confident that this article can serve no worthwhile purpose, and should be considered a good reminder that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. (Please note - <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> "received only agreement" from <i>one</i> user, Peter S.) Fearwig mentions one purpose the article may serve: "to simply outline the conceptual differences between such fictions, as this does to some degree by detailing the different categories of fictional universes that can exist." Please remember that everything here is a work in progress, and per the talk page of the article in question, there are many hands and brains pondering how to make the article accessible and informative. I take exception, also, to the claim that "no one can really gain any kind of knowledge" from something, simply because one person (or two) doesn't see its wor th. As you may have already guessed, I have learned something from the article and think it should be kept. <font color="green">♥</font> <a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegship_9306.html" title="User:Pegship">Her Pegship</a><font color="green">♥</font> 21:22, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I did not pretend that agreement was in abundance--only that no one cared about the article in that period of time save the one individual who agreed in its worthlessness. I am not sure why a "strong keep" would be the immediate result of the consideration that "not enough people have agreed with the deletion yet".

<li><b>Keep</b> – this list (and it analysis) does provide a useful purpose. Firstly it provises a place to review the various fictional universes (and yes that will mainly mean SF and Fantasy). Secondly it provides a grouping of types, particularly for anyone wanting a read of a similar kind to one previously enjoyed or one of a dissimilar kind (for variety). This is not just a listing. All I would say is that it does need work to improve this information.&#160;:: <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinalewis_f9e4.html" title="User:Kevinalewis"><span style="color: #33C;">Kevinalewis</span></a>&#160;: <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevinalewis_47c9.html" title="User talk:Kevinalewis"><span style="color:#CC9900"><sup>(Talk Page)</sup></span></a>/<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinalewis_Desk_00cd.html" title="User:Kevinalewis/Desk"><span style="color:#CC9900"><sub>(Desk)</sub></span></a> 08:01, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think there is an argument for having an article on the types of fictional universe that can exist. That is, the current section organization of the article is itself of interest, though I think the list is potentially infinite and that is a serious problem. Unless the infinitude of the list is fixed I can't see a way out of deleting this article. But if the list is restricted to notable examples, and the article reviews the types and gives early and important examples, that could be worthwhile. However, I'd then suggest it be merged with the <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_universes.html" title="Fictional universes">Fictional universes</a> article. The category already exists, after all; either the list duplicates it or it supplies analysis, and I'm not sure why that analysis wouldn't belong in the <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_universes.html" title="Fictional universes">Fictional universes</a> article. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> 01:27, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree completely, I think the analysis (if it is in fact not OR--I'm not sure whether it's taken from secondaries) should be retained. I only suggest that this page be deleted, not the <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_universes.html" title="Fictional universes">Fictional universes</a> article (though that should perhaps be changed to <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_universe.html" title="Fictional universe">Fictional universe</a>, to meet naming conventions, if I'm not mistaken).</li>

Apparently some people think the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernstein_Bears_20d6.html" title="Bernstein Bears">Bernstein Bears</a> series is set in a "notable universe". Also, are you using Wiki standards of notability, because Wikipedia does have well over a million articles, a great number of which are based on works of fiction (and thus set in fictional universes). <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 14:06, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>—We'd started a lazy process of organizing a consensual method of tackling what is admittedly a daunting task, and had a general agreement on how to make the thing better. Splitting it was one initial thought, then Peg came up with the table. Agreed the scope of the beast needs narrowed, but the telling point to me is not what 'use' the article may have to someone like Ferwig, but that there had been a lot of people that put their valuable spare time into building it in the first place. That also shows a certain amount of love and care to take the effort of putting up the data in the first place; D'ya hear a winsom echo of Jimbo here—that's somewhat like the answer he gave the interviewer about what surprised him most about the encyclopedia. In sum, you need not help, but do respect the time others <u>devoted</u> to putting this nascent seed together. There is a fun factor to remember as well, not everything in a e-publication need be limited like a dead tree publication. Sneer at it as listcruft if you like, as I do when people go ga-ga over so called celebrity entertainers who are just doing their jobs in something they love. But you can blame those same entertainers for the population of this list. Deleting it is only consistent with a vow to be a lifelong ascetic and never ever enjoy anyform of entertainment. The converse is also true, if you are a fan of anything at all in the realm of entertainment, integrity and respect for others, and especially perhaps, respect for others donated volunteer time clearly demands it be kept — least you know yourself for a hypocrite and insensitive uncaring person. I'd rather you didn't inflict that wound on your psyche, and thought about why the list came to be in the first place! Is love and affection so unworthy so as to be unnotable on it's very existance? No, they are the most precious commodity of all. (danged edit conflict!

<li>I have some sympathy with this view; I understand that this can be a labour of love for many editors. I'm not suggesting that the work be destroyed, but it does have to be consistent with Wikipedia goals. It has to be encyclopaedic. My criticism is not of the idea of documenting fictional universes within Wikipedia -- that's clearly within Wikipedia's scope. The problem is that the article, in its current form, is absolutely unmaintainable. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this is a key problem for several who have voted Delete here; and it has not been addressed by the responses or the Keep votes. If this can be corrected I would be likely to vote Keep. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> 15:56, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Pegship, Quiddity, Heretohelp, myself, and even (the traitorous &lt;g&gt;) Peter S had all begun to look at it.

So I agree the thing has big problems, but I started the ball on improving it by looking for ideas on how to procede... such is in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_fictional_universes_8073.html" title="Talk:List of fictional universes">talk page</a>. (Specifically: <i>See the Motion to Revise section below for details. --FrankB 14:34, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</i>, just a month back when I went to make an add to the thing.) Being disorganized, simply by trying to parse it's organization (which seemed inconsistant), I don't believe I ever did edit in it then. Shrug... I yelled for some help and advice; we just haven't gotten to it fast enough for y'all. Shrug (&lt;g&gt; Care to guess 'why'??? &lt;g&gt;)</dd>

<dd>Now some of ya'll want to kill the item instead of improving it. Shrug. 'twould be better if we all just pitched in a half-hour a week morphing it into the table format suggested by Pegship... That cuts the redundancy to a mininum, cross references the occurences across media, and keeps what is a fair archival tool. Some of us get strangely inspired by such cross-fertilizations, and if one is browsing (translation <i>playing</i>) stumbling across such can be a fun read. Last time I looked, the foundation and such were delighted when we got accessed for any reason. Any text containing 'keywords' increases our hit count and exposure on the various search engines, and I'm quite sure the foundation wants those as high as possible. A <i>everything but the kitchen sink</i> article like this helps achieve that, as does all the 'Pop culture' stuff I care less than a plugged-penny for personally, save as an editor of this project. That requires a professional hat that looks at such pop factors, search engine factors, etc.</dd>

And while two or three people might enjoy seeing essentially random articles on R-named people, absolutely nothing beneficial would come of the article itself. While this article outlines several hundred "universes" (potentially including say, the Smurfs "universe" or the Friends "universe"), the list doesn't actually <i>say anything</i> or provide any new information at all.

<dd><b>Comment</b> — The categories all should have a 'Main' Article giving them scope. This is the one for that useful category. I do tend to think of it as <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_universe_%28fiction%29.html" title="Parallel universe (fiction)">Alternat(iv)e Universes</a>, especially for written and screen fiction, both 'Arts'.
<dl>
<dd>Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't that main article be <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_universe.html" title="Fictional universe">Fictional universe</a>, not <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_universes.html" title="List of fictional universes">List of fictional universes</a>? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> 12:44, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But here's a news flash for those that think this category name is too long. Get used to it. The common category naming scheme from metawiki via the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commons.html" title="Commons">commons</a> uses A LOT OF LONGISH technically specific category names. (e.g. <a href="../../../m/i/d/Category%7EMiddle_Ages_7ee0.html" title="Category:Middle Ages">Category:Middle Ages</a> has categories like these shorties:</dd>

:{{see also||:Category:Maps showing the history of the High Middle Ages|:Category:Maps showing the history of the Late Middle Ages|:Category:Maps showing the history of the Middle Ages|:Category:Old maps of Europe|:Category:Maps of the history of Europe}} just for starters, and similar names by period, country, region, etc. Most short confusing category names will soon be tagged with {{tl|category redirect}}, and the sisterproject wide categories will be taking over. The good news is many of our basic article categories of a technical nature are a-Okay, but poorly worded ones that are more 'idiomatic' thus translating badly are being kicked out in favor of those that cross into the other language projects.

<dd>I would expect the only fictional universes to go in there would be the ones put in by someone who cares enough to do it. And for it to be a fictional universe and not just a fictional setting it would have to have criteria in place. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrineV_4d36.html" title="User:PeregrineV">PeregrineV</a> 00:32, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, your first point means that it is in the nature of the list to be incomplete, which is the <i>other</i> big complaint about it. The second point means (I expect) that criteria <i>should</i> be put in place... but even then, the nature (and thus the name) of the article would have to be changed, or else, again, it's an incomplete article. Really it's just a bad idea all around, the perfect example of listcruft. <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 03:46, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete/Merge</b> per Mike Christie: Instead of a list, I think the way to do this would be to translate this information: (1) categories and subcategories, plus maybe (2) an article explaining what fictional universes are and linking to the categories and subcategories. (I'm not sure if that counts as a "merge" - if so, then I guess I mean "merge").<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 03:53, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, per Motor. This case is hardly inconsequential; a family was torn apart and a man is up for trial on charges of murder.

<li><b>Keep</b> newsworthiness is not the criteria. These will be "newsy" again during the trial. Just like the long litany of articles about every executed person in the US during the last few years. Their fleeting fame has now gone but there is some value to the proposition that someone is notable if the state cares so little/so much about that person it puts them to death. If the perps stay, I suppose in fairness the victims should as well. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 00:46, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Maybe so, but the path here isn't to delete; there's enough meat to go with here to further improve the article and it provides sufficient context to identify who and what this person is. Yes, the article needs more content. No, it should not be deleted because it doesn't have that content yet. Else, we'd be deleting huge numbers of articles. We start articles somewhere.

<li><b>Comment</b> My point was not that the username was silly (though it is) but that user opinions on open forums don't make the case for notability.

<p>But isn't the whole idea behind Wikipedia that the opinions and contributions of unpaid volunteers and regular citizens are of equal, if not greater, value than that of some paid editor? Case in point: how many of you who voted for deletion actually <b>played</b> the game? Shouldn't the opinions of people who did play it hold some value?</p>
<p>And shouldn't the fact that Bubble Fun is available on many popular high-traffic game sites and the fact that so many users gave it rave reviews account for something and lift it above the countless pacman, space invaders, and tetris clones you usually find on game sites?</p>
<p>How about if I add this to the entry:</p>
<p>"Bubble Fun is noteworthy for its unique concept and being the first game to combine the satisfaction of popping virtual bubble wrap with a strategic element."</p>

<p>Being the first of its kind doesn't make it notable? Wasn't Tetris notable for being the first of its kind?</p>
<p>And I find these comments trying to disqualify the opinions of those people who actually played the game and gave it positive reviews a bit elitist. How are your opinions more valuable than their opinions? Isn't this the type of attitute Wikipedia is faced with so often, when people dismiss Wikipedia as nothing more than a bunch of unqualified volunteers? Isn't that exactly what you're doing when you dismiss the opinions of dozens of Newsgrounds users and webmasters who reviewed the game? If all those Newgrounds users became editors at Wikipedia, would that suddenly make their opinions more valuable?</p>
<p>Take a look at this list: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_puzzle_games" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_puzzle_games" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_puzzle_games</a> How do any of these games qualify to be listed in Wikipedia as "noteworthy" but Bubble Fun doesn't? Bubble Fun has a unique game concept. Most of the games on that list do not. They're mostly clones of each other or of older game concepts.</p>

<p>They're almost all clones of each other, yet they're listed in Wikipedia. By the same standard Bubble Fun should be listed. In fact it has more merit to be listed than a bunch of Tetris and Bejeweled clones, because it is not a clone but an original. But I guess presenting a logical argument for the inclusion of Bubble Fun is a lost cause, because you guys have made up your mind without ever even looking at the game.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> It would really help if you actually looked at Wikipedia's standards before posting the same argument over and over and over again. It would also help if you would actually read what people write before replying. <i>Originality</i> is not a standard for an article to be retained. <i>Notability</i> is. You could have the most original game in the world, played by six people, and it would not qualify for an article. Can you provide evidence on the number of people playing this game that would make it comparable to the other listed games? <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 19:16, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Frank6783 I listed a bunch of high traffic websites with very high Alexa ratings who all feature this game. Those sites get millions of visitors. The site Newgrounds.com is the source of the reviews I quoted, and it's listed as #596 in Alexa. How much higher do you want to set the standard for notability? And do all those other puzzle game clones listed in Wikipedia meet that standard?</li>
</ul>

<dd><b>Comment</b> but these Alexa rankings provide notability for the sites, not for the game hosted on them. I could upload software to download.com (which is one of the highest traffic websites there is) and 3 people might download it. Does that mean my software is notable? No. Please read Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability guidelines</a> and in particular look at the criteria for including <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">websites</a>. Can you provide <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a> that show that Bubble Fun meets any of these criteria? Has it for example "... been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself." or has it "won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or organisation."? If you can show it meeting one or more of the notability criteria then people will change their opinion. By the way, insulting the very people whose mind you seek to change is a highly ineffective approach to getting what you want...

<p>The game has been published on dozens of popular websites. You say the high Alexa rankings provide notability for those sites, correct? So we established that numerous notable sources have published the game.</p>
<p>I understand your analogy about uploading a file on Download.com, which is not downloaded by anyone, but the many player reviews prove that a lot of people have played the game. And the fact that many different webmasters commented on the game or published the game also shows that this is not just a file downloaded by only 3 people.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I provided you the link to the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">web notability guidelines</a> and a summary of the specific criterion that you quote. Please read it carefully. Appearing on a website like Newgrounds.com does <b>not</b> count as being "...the subject of a non-trivial <i>published</i> work" (emphasis mine). The criterion "includes newspaper and magazine articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations". In other words it is referring to reviews of work published in reputable non-web sources. Again, go back to what I said before: if your game had been reviewed in a major print magazine or on TV it would be notable. Simply appearing on a high-traffic website that is an indescriminate collection of web games does <i>not</i> provide notability for the game.

<p>There is absolutely nothing "notable" about any of the games listed there, with the exception of Tetris and Lemmings. Yet, somehow those hurdles, hoops and strict interpretations of Wikipedia guidelines you impose on Bubble Fun don't seem to apply to any of the other Flash puzzle games listed in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Now, if I were to strictly apply Wikipedia "notability guidelines" to all the games on that list, and deleted 95% of the games on that list, that would be considered vandalism, not proper editing, right? I have to admit, the logic here escapes me. I guess that's why I'm just a "newbie" and you guys are the "experts."</p>

<p>This article is redundant. The article on Transvestetic Fetismism is in fact about the same exact topic and is more reasoned and rational.

<li><b>Keep</b> As I already said on the talk page: I don't think this is a very good idea, because it confuses this humbug-diagnosis of autogynephilia with one that is indeed in the DSM. Both are completely different things, one dealing with an (admittely nutcase) theory, which encompasses more than just autogynephila, the other dealing with a current diagnosis; hence there is no redundancy whatsoever. The fact that the BBL theory is not exactly rational hardly is a reason to delete the article about it. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smythe_f953.html" title="User:John Smythe">John Smythe</a> 19:54, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If transvestitic fetishism were indeed the exact same topic, then merge and redirect.

<li><b>Delete</b> For the reasons I stated above. Plus autogynephillia seems to me to be the exact same thing as transvestetic fethisism. The argument that TV.f is different is not really a good one. I present to you the DSM IV's entry on GID.<a href="http://www.mhsanctuary.com/gender/dsm.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mhsanctuary.com/gender/dsm.htm" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>. Very importantly "The paraphiliac focus of Transvestic Fetishism involves cross-dressing. Usually the male with Transvestic Fetishism keeps a collection of female clothes that he intermittently uses to cross-dress. While cross dressed, he usually masturbates, imagining himself to be both the male and the female object of his sexual fantasy. This disorder has been described only in heterosexual males. Transvestic Fetishism is to be diagnosed when cross-dressing occurs exclusively during the course of Gender Identity Disorder.<a href="http://www.mental-health-today.com/gender/dsm.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.mental-health-today.com/gender/dsm.htm" rel="nofollow">DSM IV Gender Identity Disorder</a> ]" Diagnostic code 302.3 Transvestetic fetisism is listed as a paraphllia related to GID. What you are seeing in the DSM is that the real theory behind autogynephillia is more complex than was is presented in a book intended for a general audience. --<a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmartgirl62_afa8.html" title="User:Smartgirl62">Smartgirl62</a> 02:48, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is useful to explain the differences between psychiatric and sociological definitions of a phenomenon. (That DOES make sense if you read it carefully. I'm not just blowing smoke up your, OK, I'm out of time.) <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 05:37, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Sociological? The theory of Autogynephillia is psyhcological not sociological. Just as the diagnosis of transvestetic fetisism is. As a matter of fact I can settle this with the following link. <a href="http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309084180/html/169.html" class="external text" title="http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309084180/html/169.html" rel="nofollow">The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender-Bending and Transsexualism (2003), page 169, third paragraph.</a> The people who came up with autogynephillia are psychologist. If a transsexual is diagnosed with transvestetic fetishism then they are being diagnosed with autogynephillia. The link I provieded gives it to you straight from the lions mouth (discalimer: I do not by any means agree with all that is said in that book.)--<a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmartgirl62_afa8.html" title="User:Smartgirl62">Smartgirl62</a> 09:38, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I would suggest that "transvestetic fetishism" is less a psychological diagnosis and more a sociological phenomenon, as described in its respective article. It is simply someone who is aroused by wearing clothes of the opposite gender. Autogynephilia would be the diagnosis in this case, and while there's overlap for sure, I'd say the term has a negative connotation, whereas the former is more neutral. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 10:55, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I am a principal critic of this diagnosis, but I feel it merits a separate article. Both tranvestic fetishism and "autogynephilia" are attempts to pathologize socially unacceptable behavior. "Autogynephilia" does not necessarily involve clothing, according to those who promulgate the concept. The concept appeals to a few people who previously would have been rejected via medical gatekeepers as pseudotranssexuals or non-transsexuals. They see this term as a step up socially from "just a crossdresser" to "more than a crossdresser." The people promoting the concept are probably going to push very hard to get their ideas codified in the DSM-V. We have articles on <a href="../../../p/h/l/Phlogiston.html" title="Phlogiston">phlogiston</a> and <a href="../../../h/y/s/Hystero-epilepsy.html" title="Hystero-epilepsy">hystero-epilepsy</a>, so we should have something on this pseudoscience as well. <a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJokestress_f864.html" title="User:Jokestress">Jokestress</a> 15:54, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Very well. It seems the people have spoken and they want two different articles. (Thanks to whomever cleaned up my comments. I have little VFD experience.) But I will try to convince you all one more time. I have written up what I think the combined Transvestic fetishism/Autogynephillia article should look like. Here <a href="../../../t/r/a/Talk%7ETransvestic_fetishism_1d48.html#Transvestic_fetishism" title="Talk:Transvestic fetishism">Talk:Transvestic fetishism#Transvestic fetishism</a>. I think the article could do without the picture. Either way I really do not like the way the Autogynephillia article now reads. It's like more of an arguement than an encylopdic article. The argument against this theory will have to be done my other clinical psychology PhD's in peer reiewed journals.

<li>As I already said on the talk pages, bad proposal -- you are effectively deleting 99% of the article, which is not exactly an improvement. Oh, and there is absolutely nothing in WP policy that says hypothesis cannot be be refused on article pages, on the contrary. You might want to check out a few, like aether theory and similar outdated and/or nutcase crap. So you might actually stop your vendetta against this article, because, you know, you don't exactly have much in the way of arguments, and already quite a few people (and the WP policy) who disagree with you.

There are no connections between any of these crimes, no research has been done about crimes specifically on these campuses, and, lacking sources, even making a statement like "crimes periodically occur on Ivy-League campuses" is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. This is about as useful an article as, say, Pastries sold in Ivy-League dining halls, except that, because it's about crime, it's more sensational, which is why I imagine it's stayed around as long as it has. <b>Delete</b> as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">an indiscriminate collection of information</a> that aspires to be <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original reseach</a>. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 17:34, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, as it stands, as original research. However, the topic of "Ivy League suicide" can probably be better substantiated by cited sources, as something that gets a peculiar brand of media attention at least from time to time. An actual article on this topic would, to me, justify retaining the list of crimes, as it would no longer seem like an arbitrary collection of facts. If better substantiation of the topic as encyclopedic is provided, I'd consider the article rescued from AfD-worthiness. -- <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a>|<a href="../../../r/b/e/User_talk%7ERbellin_8a70.html" title="User talk:Rbellin">Talk</a> 17:45, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

The only AfD issue is whether it's just an indiscriminant collection of facts, an issue only recently brought up on its Talk page and via the addition of {{importance}} and {{globalize}} tags.

(I have attempted occasionally to mention in the MIT article that MIT's library is quite notably poor in relation to MIT's reputation, and it has never lasted for more than a day). But the problem is that this article groups things that are utterly unrelated. To rephrase seriously what I stated above as a joke, what, exactly, do suicides at Harvard have to do with suicides at Columbia, and why don't suicides at MIT belong in the same article (MIT and Harvard sharing a locale, a high-pressure milieu, and a sanguinary school color?) What's the point of this article?

<dd>Come on. Really? The Ivies have a shared reputation, and the schools are often thought of collectively rather than individially. People often say, for example, "he has an Ivy League education" rather than "He graduated from Columbia". There's nothing unusual about considering them or people affiliated with them as a group. We in fact have an entire article about the Ivy League, where we list Harvard with Columbia, but don't mention MIT even once.</dd>

<li>Well, that will depend on the editors of those school articles, as they decide what's relevent and important information. If a well documented group of recent crimes at, say, Yale starts to grow lengthy, it could be split off from the <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale University</a> article as a sub-article...if that is, the editors of that page believe that information has encyclopedic value. The problem with the list as it exists, is that there's no meaning or purpose to it beyond making a list of crimes that are not particularly noteworthy except to the families of those involved (I don't mean that to sound cold or heartless)...but given an air of prestige because those crimes happened at the 'top schools'. As people have said, a similar list of 40 crimes from the last 3 decades at shopping malls would hardly excite this level of debate. It would just be deleted as listcruft. <b>Comment</b> All of that in mind, I *do* feel there is some encyclopedic value in knowing crime/suicide information about a school, as that is a determining factor in attendence for a student, hence the suggestion of merging to those school articles. Without the context of information about a school, this is a list of random events and should be deleted. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 22:22, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This is just a list, not an article. The intro says only what the conditions are to list something here. They are basically meaningless conditions, as employees killed at their off campus homes qualify. If we said to merge by school, the school editors would rightly say that everything has to go. The typical Ivy League school has a few thousand students, a few thousand staff and faculty. Among that many randomly chosen Americans over as many , statistics would say that there ought to be <i>more</i> murders and suicides than are recorded. This data could be a basis for OR saying that really, no, there isn't a problem, but until someone does that research and gets it published elsewhere, we can't use it. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 00:45, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I think that the Ivy League universities promote themselves as places of learning rather than places where violent crime and suicide intrude. It is the unexpected or contrary to the promotion that makes them notable.

A Harvard dean's secretary gets robbed and killed at her apartment. A Harvard student gets robbed and stabbed in the Combat Zone. A Penn student is involved in a murder in Delaware.

If the major criticism is that the material is loosely-related primarily because it includes not just at the colleges themselves but also "anyone connected with the campus", then would removing those that are not on campus (for some definition of "campus") make the article more coherent (good for the article and readers) and resolve this AfD? <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 02:40, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment (for DMacks)</b> not really. I wouldn't even support having a list of crimes occurring at any one institution, let alone a collocation of universities, because the incidents are not systemic or related to the institution. The only (rather tenuous) common nexus is caused by the fact that the victims or perpetrators are all connected to a university. Using the same principle, there could also be one list of murders or suicides on metros in different French cities, from skyscrapers in cities on the US Eastern Seaboard, a list of people been thrown from the 18th floor of any building in Denmark etc. There really isn't much logical difference as there is no causal nexus between a) any of the incidents at a particular place, and thus neither is there one b) between a particular institution and deaths cited as being related thereto and thus c) nothing connecting a death only tenously connected to one uni to another uni by virtue of the association of the unis. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247">Jammo (SM247)</a> 04:54, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Split or move</b>? The article already is tagged to globalize and set in context, so maybe expand and refocus to Crime on college campuses is the way to go? There's often a false sense of security, a feeling of being in an idyllic bubble on campus, where local communities don't intrude ("ivory tower"). Hrm, not sure a comprehensive list is useful there. Okay, how about expand and refocus to College suicide? Is there enough material about suicide among students, its effects on the fairly tight-knit communities that are found on campus, etc. to make an article (Epidemiology and methodology of Suicide is already fairly long and not focused on effects)? There might be few enough cases that a list of them would be appropriate as part of that article. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 02:43, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, I think there's a potential for a real article on College suicide, not based on anecdotes like this, but with real statistics. I know there is published research on the subject, and high-pressure schools (not just Ivy, but every top-grade school) have higher rates. As for crime, most of it (not all, but most) has little to do with the school and a lot to do with the neighborhood it's in. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 14:11, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

FWIW, Rbellin is, IMHO, right to say that an article apropos of general trends w/r/to college suicides, especially at highly competitive universities (where suicides, if not violent crimes, occur with a greater frequency, statistics bare out, than they do at other schools), would likely be alright, but surely there is nothing in this list that we could properly merge into a broader article. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 18:02, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Non-notable species. In the entire series, we meet one member of this species, only one time, in a 2-minute segment of one episode. There is no potential for expansion. Basically, the Zaldan bumps into Wesley, gets upset, and interprets Wesley's apology as an insult. Wesley raises his voice. The Zaldan walks off. Wesley explains that Zaldans have webbed fingers and don't like courtesy. End of story. No non-stub article could ever come from this topic.

<li><b>Comment</b>. <i>Time Tripper</i> was first released as an independent short film. See Jittlov's entry in <i>Who's Who in Show Business, 1989-1990</i> or the Jittlov interview in <a href="http://www.cultivatetwiddle.com/mjinterview.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.cultivatetwiddle.com/mjinterview.htm" rel="nofollow">Fantastic Films Collectors Edition #11</a>.

Both the linked articles on the shorts are basically one-line stubs.

<li><b>Comment.</b> We have articles on a number of early Jittlov shorts, including <i>Animato</i> (aka <i><a href="../../../f/a/s/Fashionation.html" title="Fashionation">Fashionation</a></i>), <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_tripper.html" title="Time tripper">Time Tripper</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../s/w/i/Swing_Shift_376f.html" title="Swing Shift">Swing Shift</a></i>. Allegedly, these (and others) were all shown as a compilation, also called <i><a href="../../../a/n/i/Animato.html" title="Animato">Animato</a></i>. To avoid cluttering the article on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wizard_of_Speed_and_Time_4337.html" title="The Wizard of Speed and Time">The Wizard of Speed and Time</a></i>, I think it would be best to merge and redirect all these shorts into the <i><a href="../../../a/n/i/Animato.html" title="Animato">Animato</a></i> article. 132.239.90.194 03:10, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> To rebut the points made above, he was Kucinich's Press Secretary, as you can clearly see from the following links: <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3130153/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3130153/" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>, <a href="http://www.denniskucinich.us/index.php?topic=General&amp;page=7" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.denniskucinich.us/index.php?topic=General&amp;page=7" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>. As the article makes clear, that was only for the 2004 election,so of course he's not listed on the current website. Also, he did write those books and they were published by an independent publisher, Context Books, which has subsequently gone out of business<a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA340451.html?pubdate=12%2F8%2F2003&amp;display=archive" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA340451.html?pubdate=12%2F8%2F2003&amp;display=archive" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, which is why you couldn't find the books on sale with your search. That doesn't change the fact that he wrote them and they received major independent reviews of them like the following: <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/writersoniraq/story/0,,921761,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.guardian.co.uk/writersoniraq/story/0,,921761,00.html" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. He also wrote another book with a separate independent publisher (not vanity press). He's also had articles written about him in major newspapers like the following:<a href="http://www.boston.com/news/packages/iraq/globe_stories/011503_teacher.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boston.com/news/packages/iraq/globe_stories/011503_teacher.htm" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> Add all that to that his online blogging presence, including his involvement with the <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Leopold_f5de.html" title="Jason Leopold">Jason Leopold</a> incident, and he's pretty notable. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximusveritas_5f31.html" title="User:Maximusveritas">Maximusveritas</a> 21:06, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Furthermore, deletion was rejected by a two-to-one margin with more than 20 Wikipedians commenting, and no new arguments are presented; the only real change since the first AfD is that Pitt has become more notable because of his involvement in the truthout.org controversy, a paragraph about which has been added to the article.

<li>The Leopold episode may have made him less <i>credible</i> in your eyes, but the attention it received made him more <i>notable</i> than he was at the time of the previous decision to keep the article. It's unfortunate that proposed deletions so often turn into referenda on the popularity of an article subject. The real issue is notability. Are you contending that the reporting of the Leopold incident and of Pitt's role in it somehow lessened Pitt's notability? <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 04:28, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree that it isn't particularly controversial, except for the bit on auto pointers (C++ programmers would almost always prefer TR1's smart pointers).

<li><b>keep</b> If you are well-familiar with programming, this is all common knowledge. This is certainly not original research (I wish it was).

<li><b>Comment</b> - basically yes. Please see <a href="../../../f/o/o/Help%7EFootnotes_8d93.html" title="Help:Footnotes">Help:Footnotes</a> for help with citing references. Basically, if I want to provide a reference for this statement, after it, I put &lt;ref&gt;Text for the references section&lt;/ref&gt;. Then, at the end in a references section , you put &lt;references/&gt;. Inside the ref tags, you can put just a straight URL or you can use one of the citation templates like <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_web_57d4.html" title="Template:Cite web">Template:Cite web</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_7db3.html" title="Template:Cite">Template:Cite</a>.

<p>This article is completely uncited expect for a page which itself states that it "...sets out the hypothesis that the Cornish people are being subjected to policies of genocide".

Deleting an article solely because its subject demands it would be a bad precedent; it would encourage others to get all <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> on us to try to manipulate our coverage. I'm not from the area where G.G. has his show, so I'm not prepared to pass judgment on its degree of notability (I've never heard of him or his show before now), but the deletion or not should be based on this rather than on his personal wishes. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 17:02, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Agree - the principle is to keep the article if it's notable and encyclopedic, <i>not</i> to keep it just to prove that Wikipedia doesn't buckle to pressure. <i><a href="../../../k/w/h/User_talk%7EKwh_7c75.html" title="User talk:Kwh">KWH</a></i> 18:19, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree with that; we should strive not to let grudges and personal feelings influence us either to keep or to delete an article where the encyclopedic course would be the opposite. Being human, we may not always follow this guideline (I suspect that in cases like this, a "reverse psychology" approach might work at manipulating Wikipedia editors -- if you really want the article on you kept, you should loudly and obnoxiously demand it be deleted, or vice versa), but it should at least be our stated goal. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 18:24, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The real test would be if this was put out / leaked by her or simply a DJ compilation. Some artists such as Jadakiss and Method Man, release music that the label would not permit on a standard album onto a mixtape. Is this a case of that or is this just a DJ compilation and can it be proven the artist released this with permission or at least may have been leaked by them. Ways to determine this would be original track of high studio quality, hints by the artist, promotion of the CD by the artist, references to mixtape only tracks by the artists etc. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_ecbe.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults"><i><font color="blue"><sup>|sockpuppets|</sup></font></i></a> 20:46, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - whilst some notable artist are involved, this album seems to be designed not to be released to the public at large, a common practice as Zer0faults points out. Except in very extreme circumstances, unreleased = nn. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 20:54, 7 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Its actually not a extreme circumstance, I didnt mean it to come out that way. Mixtapes have become a way for artists to connect to their audience through means not permitted by their parent companies and recording labels. For instance rapper Mos Def released a track called bin Laden, kind of accusing the Bush administration of knowing about 9/11 before it happened, this kind of track would never be released on an album as the label would never hear the end of it. Sometimes artists use mixtapes because contract limitations or label supression. In a more relevant example artist Lumidee releases her music soley on mixtape now as she resented her label turning her album into a R&amp;B type album, she is a self proclaimed rapper and her mixtape music focuses more on that since she can do it without label pressure. Its oddly enough becoming quite popular as means of expression without the label getting a say. Method Man released an entire album by this method in order to circumvent a force he felt in his label was destroying his music, removing all songs related to his favorite producer. Kanye West has released tracks on mixtapes before their release to find out how they will be taken by the public. Mixtapes are not as they started as DJ mixes that were unauthorized etc. This album <b>may</b> be as legit as any other album this artist has released, just without the support of her label/recording company. That is why I think more information is needed before classifying this. Sorry for the long statement, I just dont want people not to understand what I was trying to say, this phenomenon is actually very popular. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_ecbe.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults"><i><font color="blue"><sup>|sockpuppets|</sup></font></i></a> 00:03, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>*<b>Keep</b> I am voting keep because this artist meets the requirements of WP:MUSIC.

<li><b>delete</b> I changed my vote after finding out more information and reviewing the track listing, this is a DJ compilation as its not artist specific as I was under the original impression.

<li><b>Delete</b> Per Zero Faults.

<li><b>Keep</b>. There are many lists like this on Wikipedia (guitarists, drummers, violinists). Regarding gender, while many '90s bands did have a female bassist, I think it's still rare enough to warrant its own list. GentlemanGhost 16:36, 8 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Question</b> If we already have a list of bass guitarists, is there really any need to separate the female ones into another list also? Could not everyone seeking info on bass guitarists use one list, and those wishing for a gender breakdown derive that information? I am just wondering why this separate list is necessary.

<li><b>Keep</b> RE: "Main source is article starter's own blog." This only means the author has drafted the content earlier than posting it on WP. The phrase has been in use in numerous discussions I have been involved in, and it usefully expresses a concept. I don't think this author coined the phrase, but the fact he has used it on his own popular blog more than others does not seem to be case against documenting it on WP. josephpotvin

<li><b>Keep</b> What's wrong with an author or intellectual coming up with an idea or concept or phrase and then posting it to wikipedia after posting it to their own blog? Let alone as in the case of this where the author may not be the originator of the idea, but is certainly an active user of a new concept that is accurate and worth sharing. It is ludicrous to delete this entry, and if it were to be deleted I'm confident it would re-appear after a short period as it is indeed a legitimate word/phrase that should be documented and included... and yes, this is my first edit, as it would take something as alarming as this to provoke me to actually register and edit a page on this site...

<li>There is nothing wrong with someone coming up with a term, but a newly-and-self-coined term (called a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a>) does not belong in an encyclopedia, be it Wikipedia or any other.

<li><b>Keep</b>: The term software manufacturer has been in wide use for many years (easily many decades) by that subset of the software sector that believe that software can be "manufactured" as if it were a tangible/physical thing. It appears that some persons on Wikipedia incorrectly believe that I coined the term. It is no more a new or self-coined term than saying it is a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> to refer people that practise "capitalism" by the term "capitalist". If I were to start this process over I would have started a definition for software manufacturer rather than <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_manufacturing.html" title="Software manufacturing">software manufacturing</a> --<a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussell_McOrmond_db20.html" title="User:Russell McOrmond">Russell McOrmond</a> 16:47, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: This is a term that is part of the total map of the tautaology(sp?) of software marketing and creation methods. It could use some work to place it fully in that context. the first mover in creating this article is a well known activist in the free/open software movement, and his blog is one of the sites where the meaning of the term may have been clarified, but the standards of wikipedia don't exclude experts from starting articles- even if they are limited to published resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>The term is NOT a synonym for "proprietary" as there are closed source packages that are never the less distributed at no-charge, or bundled with other things. The method is also similar to the music industry who tends to associate the selling of plastic discs with the selling of music. cmacd 15:44, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - The sites owner (editor Abotnick) has made many attempts add a link to his forum site on the main <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiropractic.html" title="Chiropractic">Chiropractic</a> article as well. His forum site makes it known that they are focused on boosting the sites PageRank by getting inbound links (from prominent sites such as Wikipedia). As for the references by other publications below, it should be known that user Abotnick works with Neck911.com (organization that created the hate-message billboard) in publishing and promoting press releases. With the NCAHF reference, it should be noted that the anti-chiropractic circle is a tight ring (in fact they participate in a Skeptic Web ring). They all link to each other, again to boost PageRank. As far as the James Randi reference goes, the "anonymous ex-chiropractor" that it refers to is in fact Allen Botnick once again self-promoting his website. Doing a cursory web search for his name on Google, I am actually able to find that he has inserted links to his website and cause all over the Internet in seemingly odd and inappropriate places.

<p>Regarding WP:Web one of the criteria is if the site is referenced by other publications. This site has been referenced in three. The first is in print and online while the other two are online:</p>

<p>"Even many critics of chiropractic were put off by the viciousness of the attack. During a discussion of the billboard on a predominantly anti‑chiropractic Internet group (Chirotalk: The Skeptical Chiropractic Discussion Forum), one member called the sign "Fear mongering, nothing more..." Another stated, "It's a cheap tactic to hit the public with a sledgehammer that big." One member made an interesting point by saying: "What if we had one for 'Aspirin can kill you!' or 'Reading this sign while driving can kill you!' That is simply a sensationalized ad to get attention.""</p>

An online discussion forum for the critical investigation of chiropractic topics has been launched by Allen Botnick, DC, who voluntarily surrendered his chiropractic licenses after concluding that his education had not prepared him to practice safely. He started Chirotalk because other discussion groups have expelled people who posted critical comments. Chirotalk is open to anyone who wants to discuss the problems associated with chiropractic theory and practice."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Brian. We have here a note from last week’s anonymous ex-chiropractor who was involved, and I think it will be encouraging to others and give a new source of assistance. He writes:</p>
<p>Thanks for forwarding me the nice emails from your readers. While it will probably be a while before I "come out of the chiropractic closet" and use my real name, I do currently participate in an email discussion list called Chirotalk. The address is: <a href="http://chirotalk.proboards3.com/index.cgi" class="external free" title="http://chirotalk.proboards3.com/index.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://chirotalk.proboards3.com/index.cgi</a></p>
<p>The members of this list are mostly former chiropractors along with a few Physical Therapists who are chiro skeptics. The purpose of the list is to support chiropractors trying to get out of the profession (suggestions for new careers, encouragement, etc.) and to keep information on the web to discourage new students from enrolling in chiropractic college.</p>
<p>I have gotten a lot of ideas from this list as to how to move forward with my life. The main reason I wrote you is that I respect your opinion a lot and, also, I wanted to bring attention to the fact that there are students like me who have been ripped off by the chiropractic schools.</p>
<p>I agree that I have a moral obligation to help potential students see the full picture. Chiro college recruiters are very good at painting chiropractors as mainstream healthcare professionals based in science. This is fraud – as far as I'm concerned – since all chiropractic is still based on subluxation theory, although some modern chiros call subluxations different names, like fixations, spinal lesions, etc.</p>
<p>Allen Botnick, D.C., is the chiropractor who started the discussion list. He is also graduated from my college and has written, under his real name, about his experiences as a chiropractor. He has really endured a lot of hatred from the chiropractic profession for his honesty. It’s at: www.chirobase.org/03Edu/botnick.html</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for spreading the word. While I certainly wouldn't accept donations from anybody, I am inspired to consider telling my story in a more public way in the future. The kind messages from your readers have shown me that skeptics really have big hearts."</p>
<p>The site is volunteer and not for profit-unlike the chiropractors who are bashing it. It deserves mentioning. Abotnick 22:25, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>&gt;The sites owner (editor Abotnick) has made many attempts add a link to his forum site on the main Chiropractic article as well.</p>
<p>Levine has a problem with many of the skeptical contributors to the Chiropractic article. I have actually written two of the paragraphs in the current chiropractic article and edited and rewrote the lead. Please see discussion for more information.</p>
<p>&gt;His forum site makes it known that they are focused on boosting the sites PageRank by getting inbound links (from prominent sites such as Wikipedia).</p>
<p>Levine is referring to the writings of one individual member of the forum, not the forum itself. The forum itself is referenced by many individuals outside the forum itself as the statistics show. It is not simply self promotion.</p>
<p>&gt;As for the references by other publications below, it should be known that user Abotnick works with Neck911.com (organization that created the hate-message billboard) in publishing and promoting press releases.</p>
<p>I had nothing to do with the reference posted above. That was independently written.</p>
<p>&gt;With the NCAHF reference, it should be noted that the anti-chiropractic circle is a tight ring (in fact they participate in a Skeptic Web ring). They all link to each other, again to boost PageRank.</p>
<p>NCAHF is a legitimate skeptical newsletter. Levine is implying that any skeptical publication is a conspiracy.</p>
<p>&gt;As far as the James Randi reference goes, the "anonymous ex-chiropractor" that it refers to is in fact Allen Botnick once again self-promoting his website. Doing a cursory web search for his name on Google, I am actually able to find that he has inserted links to his website and cause all over the Internet in seemingly odd and inappropriate places. My feeling is that him creating a Wikipedia article about his forum Chirotalk is just another attempt at - as.</p>
<p>I had no part in writing the Randi article. Please back up your statements with evidence Levine and stop the conjecture. Chirotalk is either the number one or number two top chiropractic discussion forum on the web and has been cited in several publications. It certainly has the most uncensored content as the other sites actively censor skeptical opinions (as I suspect some people are trying to do here by suggesting that Chirotalk's wiki entry be removed). People are going to be curious about its history and goals and it's worth a few bytes on Wikipedia.Abotnick 23:32, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Based on my clinical experience with thousands of patients and based on similar experiences of well over a hunded colleagues of whom I have personal knowledge, I find Mr. Botnik's bitter remarks to not be credible. For whatever personal reasons, he failed in an attempt at practice and is conducting a bitter anti-chiropractic campaign in retaliation. I have never met Mr. Botnik nor have I personally corresponded with him, but based on his comments that I have read, he appears to be a bitter and immature person.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.57.51.102 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.57.51.102_8c2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.57.51.102">contribs</a>).</small></li>

</ul>
<p>The content of this website should play no part in this decision (i.e. it might be totally unreliable for all I know, but if extensively used and influential then it would still merit an article), WP should not engage in censorship. The only significant issues are whether the website is sufficiently notable for inclusion and that the content of the article is a NPOV balanced, verifiable account. The latter is I think now true. The former however is not clearly established; I would suggest that Abotnick consider merging the content with articles on related or similar websites (e.g. Quackwatch) and use redirection to direct searches to the composite article. <a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGleng_c015.html" title="User:Gleng">Gleng</a> 10:12, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Greng, I think the vandals and poorly qualified editors in the wikipedia process have greatly diminished the quality of the article. Further merging it with other nonrelated sites is no longer specific to the Chirotalk term so that doesn't work. This isn't chirobase-neck911-chirotalk. We are a separate discussion site with a history and individuality that deserves to be listed but was removed due to critical chiroprctors who don't want individuals to know that censorship is common at private nonprofit chiropractic institutions and that they have an accreditor who routinely doesn't enforce its own standards. Most likely we will need to just mount a PR campaign and get a reference in another media source to meet the WP guideline for notoreity. This is sort of ironic because of the biased chiropractors who are screaming that I am using wiki for self promotion. Anyway, wikipedia just isn't worth the bother if their major editors can't see the value of the entry. The information is available elsewhere on the net. Further, despite chiropractic's false assertions of growth they are running scams and it is simply a matter of time before the public hits critical mass and rejects them en mass. Utilization is already down 25% in just four years. So their reframing this as ad hominem attacks on me is really just a reflection of their inability to overcome the handicap. Chiros you can't build a house on a foundation of sand. Your scams won't win. Truth and knowledge have power. Abotnick 11:28, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Not sure that 'merging' in this way would be a bad solution. Disambiguation could redirect a search for chirotalk to a larger article on sceptical websites that includes, as a subsection on chirotalk, all the material that you presently have (and more). The case for inclusion on grounds of notability could then be decided by comparison with other websites rather than in isolation, as now.<a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGleng_c015.html" title="User:Gleng">Gleng</a> 11:52, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I do agree that the content of or the motivation for starting the web site should have nothing to do with whether it should be included as a wikipedia article. Does it have encyclopedic value.. possibly. The article can be cleaned up to be quite NPOV, though there is no guarantee it will stay that way. However, that means that every web site with similar qualities would deserve an article as well. Where to draw the line is apparently in notability. The line for this article would allow for other sites that are pro and anti everything, including medicine, politics, religion, vitamins, vaccination, phone systems, and most other web blog discussion groups. Is that what Wikipedia is? Is this what Wikipedia wants to be? I don't know. This is an important question that my level(two months of editing) is not qualified to answer.--<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDematt_b080.html" title="User:Dematt">Dematt</a> 14:52, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Gleng-The merge/subsections idea sounds like it might work. Would it still be under the heading of Chirotalk or another one? A list of Skeptical Sites could include: Chirobase.org, Neck911USA.org, "The Quack Files" and Chirotalk. How about "Skeptical Websites about Chiropractic"? Chirobase alone has a large amount of notoriety. Since this is a big revision can we put a pause on the deletion of this Chirotalk entry? Any suggestions for revision?Abotnick 15:13, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Agreed.

<li><b>Comment</b> Agreed.

I am not sure if that will fly either. Might I suggest that if he wants his POV heard, then he should keep on editting the main <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiropractic.html" title="Chiropractic">Chiropractic</a> article. But if this is all about trying to get a link to his website, then he should be submitting it to search engine; not Wikipedia. <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevine2112_645e.html" title="User:Levine2112">Levine2112</a> 18:58, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as a roll-out from main article, due to size/editing issues about the most honored film of 2005 (i.e., VERY large <i>non-trivial, worldwide topic</i>). Mark sections needing citations, then remove undocumented statements. Preserve "stub" status until more solid. I have added 50 citations within a few minutes; actually, this article had over 40 references to published reviews/interviews (the hysteria about "message board posts" was hyperbole). Keep, since it is a new <i>original article</i> (not <i>original research</i>): there is no need to survey viewers or re-interview the cast/crew; vast amounts of external information are already available as sources from prior research behind this article. No one who worked on the film has even posted in Talk yet. Much more detail needs to be added to this article.

<li><b>Keep</b> Believe it or not, some of you don't know as much as you think about this film.</li>
<li><b>Archived</b> for recovery. This secondary article might be deleted due to bizarre opinions, after being tagged for deletion within 10 days of creation, skipping the civilized process of potential cleanup. I have created an offline archive copy to recreate the article in another form, in case of deletion; feel free to create personal archives of the information, as well. A major point of misunderstanding is about removing a collection of opinions from Internet-forum participants, stated as such; as though forums contain no information, even as opinions, rather than citing a forum as a source of documented facts. The concept of a forum as a source of opinions, rather than a source of researched facts, seems to be over the head, beyond <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comprehension.html" title="Comprehension">comprehension</a> of several people. The <a href="../../../z/e/i/Zeitgeist.html" title="Zeitgeist">zeitgeist</a> of Wikipedia is quite primitive this year, and perhaps a revelation (or hard-fought <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epiphany_%28feeling%29.html" title="Epiphany (feeling)">epiphany</a>) might occur in future months. It might be a cosmic joke that Wikipedia contains little knowledge about some major topics: <i>Weakopedia</i>. As of today, Wikipedia still had no <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Riddle_fa1a.html" title="World Riddle">World Riddle</a> (German "<i><a href="../../../w/e/l/Weltr%C3%A4tsel.html" title="Welträtsel">Welträtsel</a></i>").

<li>Thank you for pointing out the questionable <a href="../../../c/l/u/Club_Ernies_6bad.html" title="Club Ernies">Club Ernies</a> article. I agree. I've merged the content of that article into The Catcher in the Rye, and prod'd the article.</li>
<li>The question isn't whether the statments of opinion attributed to the forum participants are accurate reportings of their opinions, it's whether these opinions are encyclopedic enough to be included in Wikipedia. If I picked up the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>, I wouldn't expect to see a movie article backed up by postings on USENET. This seems like a similar case. Forum postings are just not considered acceptable secondary sources, per the criteria at <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7EReliable_sources_20af.html" title="WP:Reliable sources">WP:Reliable sources</a>.</li>
<li>The very title of the article is Brokeback Mountain cinematic <i>analysis</i>, which suggests this article is intended to be a new systhesis of analytical material, which would make it original research.</li>
<li>I went looking for other critically-acclaimed films that have had similar treatment in Wikipedia, and could find none. Admittedly, my search was hardly exhaustive, but I looked at: <a href="../../../i/t/_/It_Happened_One_Night_2fdf.html" title="It Happened One Night">It Happened One Night</a>, <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Flew_Over_the_Cuckoo%27s_Nest_%28film%29_3833.html" title="One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)">One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gone_with_the_Wind_%28film%29_6d15.html" title="Gone with the Wind (film)">Gone with the Wind (film)</a>, and a couple of others. None have this sort of subjective discussion of their content.</li>
<li>I agree with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/user:Yanksox" class="extiw" title="w:user:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> above; this is a good review and analysis, but it's just not currently not Wikipedia material.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per eaolson's search on similar well-known and analyzed movies. None of them have this sort of article in the Wikipedia. I fear that the construction of this sort of article is too much of a walk down the path of synthesis of information and original research.

<li><b>Delete</b>: (recommendation from the author) to end senseless debate. I will submit details about <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> to other venues. [<i>No, <b>Re-Keep</b> (see "Re-Keep" above)</i>.] Of course, the Wikipedia contains vast amounts of subjective information on other topics: the very act of including, or rejecting, an article is a subjective opinion, no matter how well rationalized as being an "objective" choice. I don't see the Wikipedia community evolving beyond this point, any time soon. Perhaps the related policy in the 20th Century, for <i><a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_ecd4.html" title="Encyclopædia Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a></i> to not describe films at all, was based partly on avoiding such debates about motion-picture details. I prefer that Wikipedia continue to describe films in some detail, since storage space is no longer an issue as it had been with hard-copy <i>Britannica</i>; however, the Wikipedia <i><a href="../../../z/e/i/Zeitgeist.html" title="Zeitgeist">zeitgeist</a></i> is not yet ready to describe films in terms of musical composition, symbolism, film editing, cinematography, sound editing, etc. A motion-picture encyclopedia would be a more receptive and sophisticated venue for those details. It is very telling that the most honored film of 2005, some say of all time, cannot be described in detail within today's Wikipedia community: very interesting. -<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikid77_2576.html" title="User:Wikid77">Wikid77</a> 19:36, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>According to the guidlines, it is notable.</p>
<pre>
An article is "<b>important</b>" enough to be included in Wikipedia if any one of the following is true:
</pre>
<ol>
<li><b>There is evidence that a reasonable number of people are, were or might be <i>concurrently</i> interested in the subject (eg. it is at least well-known in a community).</b></li>
<li>It is an expansion (longer than a <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">stub</a>) upon an established subject.</li>
<li>Discussion on the article's talk page establishes its importance.</li>
</ol>
<p>If an article is "important" according to the above then there's no reason to delete it on the basis of it being:</p>
<ol>
<li>of insufficient importance, fame or relevance, or</li>
<li>currently small or a <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">stub</a>, or</li>

<ul>
<li>In what way does the article establish notability? Having written for various papers, being educated at Georgetown, and having covered "the war" does not in itself warrant an encyclopedia article (per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>). On top of this, I have a strong suspicion that this was originally an <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">autobiography</a> by Bushell himself (based on the POV tone and on phrases such as "One of his most important influences was..."). As such, the article as it stands reads like the prosified resume of a non-notable journalist trying to make a name for himself. (I should note that there is perhaps a conflict of interest in my contributing to this deletion proposal as I have met Bushell through a common acquaintance.) --<a href="../../../d/i/b/User%7EDiberri_3d04.html" title="User:Diberri">David Iberri</a> (<a href="../../../d/i/b/User_talk%7EDiberri_54fd.html" title="User talk:Diberri">talk</a>) 04:20, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>He's written significant amounts for notable papers. You don't exactly need to be Walter Cronkite to be notable. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 07:24, 8 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The Walter Cronkite point is a straw man. I have only stated that the article does not establish notability per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>, not that journalists must be as noteworthy as Cronkite to warrant inclusion in Wikipedia. However, biographies are commonly included in Wikipedia only for individuals with a reasonable degree of fame. This extends to journalists as well. Merely writing "significant amounts for notable papers" does not a notable journalist make.<br />
Implicit in my earlier argument above is a deeper concern that, owing to his non-notability, a sufficiently <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> article cannot be written about Bushell: as it stands, the current autobiography is unverifiable, relying almost wholly on original research. Extensive googling (which FWIW provides only a few dozen relevant results) reveals that neither he nor his works have been the subject of review. Thus, it would be impossible to elaborate on Bushell beyond his being an American journalist without violating <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. Non-notability, unverifiability, and the subsequent impossibility of writing an article without violating NPOV and NOR are sufficient reasons to <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../d/i/b/User%7EDiberri_3d04.html" title="User:Diberri">David Iberri</a> (<a href="../../../d/i/b/User_talk%7EDiberri_54fd.html" title="User talk:Diberri">talk</a>) 16:13, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>We seem to disagree on what the cut-off for notability is. I see he's written plenty for some prominent papers and won an award for his work on organ transplants. I think that's good enough. You apparently don't. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 02:36, 12 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You seem to have assumed that Google's results for "Andrew Bushell" all refer to the same person. As I alluded to above, this isn't the case. The individual who won an award for organ transplant work is Andrew Bushell, <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_doctor.html" title="Medical doctor">MD</a>. The individual who posted a vanity article to Wikipedia is Andrew Bushell, journalist. These are two different people.<br />
Now that we've established that, and given my additional arguments above regarding <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, can we agree that this article is not appropriate for Wikipedia and should be deleted?
