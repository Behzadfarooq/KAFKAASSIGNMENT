<li><b>Comment</b> the added info mainly duplicates the existing page, unfortunately.

<li><b>Keep</b> or at the very least <b>Merge</b>. Hi, Im the guy that started the article. I'd argue that there has been enough activity on the article to warrant its place. More research could be done to add to what is present. The band is notable in the sense that it really was the vehicle for Chris Envy which eventually got his band Showoff on Maverick Records. AYA effectively broke up around this time. AYA never had any full length LPs mostly 7" and split 7". Another reason for their notability is that they were one of the preeminent <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_punk.html" title="Pop punk">pop punk</a> bands in the Chicago suburbs during the early and mid 90s. This brand of music, mixed with the hardcore punk, indie, and art rock, scene which was more prominent, eventually lead to the forming of <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fall_Out_Boy_5bcd.html" title="Fall Out Boy">Fall Out Boy</a>, which Chris Envy was briefly a member of, during the beginning. Also check out #5 "Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such." Again, I would first recommend a KEEP and then later, I'd like to see the content merged with <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Envy_358b.html" title="Chris Envy">Chris Envy</a>. <a href="../../../x/s/x/User%7EXsxex_c215.html" title="User:Xsxex">Xsxex</a> 22:19, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A thought about media coverage: Rich communities have money to spend, which means advertisers can support more local newspapers, which means more articles get written about local high schools, making it easier to meet Wikipedia notability guidelines. Newspapers in poorer communities may not have a Web presence or have as many of their articles on the Web. That may not overcome the objection about notability, but it's something to keep in mind. The Web, and therefore to an extent, Wikipedia, tends to emphasize what the rich have, de-emphasize what the poor have. I don't know about Winfield, but it doesn't appear to be wealthy.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 16:40, 18 February 2007 (UTC) Additional comment: This school doesn't appear to be in a poor community at all (and wealthier than most of West Virginia) and it does have some coverage from several local papers) I've added a couple of small bits of information to the article. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 17:33, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, a school is just like a grocery store in the same way that a home is like a dormatory, a mother like a jailer, a father like a boss, a sister like a coworker. That's why we have grocery store yearbooks, homecoming celebrations for watermelon season and class rings for the store employees. Ah yes, I'll never forget marching down the canned vegetable aisle in my cap and gown to hear the commencement speech in the deli section. My point isn't that the metaphor is flawed so much as the idea is flawed: schools aren't school buildings just as homes aren't houses or apartments. Schools carry a lot more importance than that in the lives of students and communities. That's a good part of what makes them special. We allow Wikipedia articles for local communities because we recognize their importance to people, not because they're all significant far beyond their boundaries. High schools get seared into the memories of those who go there, whether they love the experience or hate it. They have a natural importance which I call inherent. When that basketball team won the state championship it was important to the community at large. How do I know that? Because it always is. Even to people who had no kids in the school at the time. Even to people who never went to the high school and had no children. High schools are one of the things that communities put their money, their interest and their hopes into. Take out the high school articles that don't identify some notability for people far beyond their borders and you really just diminish Wikipedia.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 05:04, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b><strike>Merge with global warming</strike>Keep</b> For those wondering why this is up for deletion I would like to explain a little about the edit wars around global warming which I mistakenly wondered into. There is a lot of ill fealing around the subject of global warming, and the result is groups of people who are simply deleting what others enter without comment. When there is debate it is almost impossible to find consensus on either the smallest issue (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Global_warming_controversy#Hockey_stick_controversy" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Global_warming_controversy#Hockey_stick_controversy" rel="nofollow">Hockey stick controversy</a> &amp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Global_warming_controversy#Hockey_stick_controversy_II" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Global_warming_controversy#Hockey_stick_controversy_II" rel="nofollow">Hockey stick controversy II</a>. I'm probably totally out of my depth! There are legitimate views being silenced and numerous complaints of not adhering to WP:NPOV - If anyone with a neutral stance on global warming can help both sides work to improve the various articles you will find it hard work but rewarding! <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 21:37, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

My problem with this article isn't the self-serving opening statement, it's that this is basically a link page to primary data available elsewhere on the web. The data itself has value certainly, but wikipedia's expression of that data should be a <i>summary</i> of the data as a tertiary source. Best example I see here is the three links to the Certification Censuses (Censi? What's the plural of census?) for 2003, 2004 and 2005 listing diver counts for those years.

<dd>38,000 hits warrants an article almost right off the bat. Whatever happens, Jordin Sparks should be kept.

<dd>Not quite. American Idol does get far, far more viewers every week than any other similar show, so it does have significantly greater notability right off the bat.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Looking at similar programmes, such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_X_Factor_90ca.html" title="The X Factor">The X Factor</a>, all articles relating to finalists, no matter where they finish, have been deleted/redirected. The X Factor is the top rating competition of this kind in the UK, so the same policy should be adopted for both, unless we are to say that they are more notable because they are American, which doesn't make much sense to me.

Judging by the precedents, appering on a reality programme, at any level, is not a criteria for notability. I think a review of the entire notability policy is required to determine where the borderline between notable and non-notable lies when dealing with these people, but it is my opinion that these people (or at least the ones in my original nomination on 18/02) are not notable enough for Wikipedia. --<font color="#116655"><b>GW_Simulations</b><sub><a href="../../../g/w/_/User%7EGW_Simulations_0716.html" title="User:GW Simulations"><font color="#000000">User Page</font></a> | <a href="../../../g/w/_/User_talk%7EGW_Simulations_2d1d.html" title="User talk:GW Simulations"><font color="#000000">Talk</font></a></sub></font> 21:47, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Population of the USA: 301,184,000, Population of the UK, 60,609,153. Obvious difference. If you do some simple mathematics, you will find out that in terms of the proportion or results to population, the number of American Idol links is about 0.5% of the population of the USA. The number of X Factor links is 4% of the population of the UK. American Idol contestants are not really of concern to many people in the UK, but they are possibly in the US. Equally, X Factor contestants are not really of concern in the USA, but they are in the UK. It is not fair to say that "If it is American, it is more notable than if it is British", and therefore, a uniform system for all articles, regardless of nationality, must be devised. That is why I am voting to delete these articles. Also, your searches are using the <b>US</b> version of Google, so obviously they are going to be misrepresentative and biased. Let's look at the UK results: <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=American+Idol&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryUK%7CcountryGB" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=American+Idol&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryUK%7CcountryGB" rel="nofollow">American Idol</a>, 805,000 results, <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=The+X+Factor&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryUK%7CcountryGB" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=The+X+Factor&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryUK%7CcountryGB" rel="nofollow">The X Factor</a>, 2,160,000 results.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Woohookitty, this AFD title is somewhat misleading. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yamaguchi%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yamaguchi%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Yamaguchi先生</a> 02:39, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Jordan Sparks article was here before she made it on American Idol. If it was good enough to keep then, it's good enough to keep now. Darrik2 03:01, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and provide sources</b> Agree with Darrik2, if the article preceded the appearance on the show, it should remain. Also agree with WoohooKitty, "According to the Idol Wikiproject, Semi-finalists can have their own page. And if you look at season 5, they had their own page until they were eliminated. What's the big deal folks?" Furthermore, Wikipedia has biographies of people with far less talent and career history; for example, 1984's <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clara_Peller_ffe9.html" title="Clara Peller">Clara Peller</a> featured in Burger King's Where's the Beef? ad campaign. My biggest concern is lack of sources for awards section. Wayfarers43 16:45, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Jordin Sparks article, <b>redirect</b> the rest. Due to her appearances on <i>America's Most Talented Kid</i>, etc., Sparks appears to have notability outside of <i>American Idol</i>. The others do not. -<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Smooth_ae06.html" title="User:Big Smooth">Big</a> <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBig_Smooth_1480.html" title="User talk:Big Smooth">Smooth</a></i> 18:01, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> excepting Jordin. When some get more famous later in the show, this allows for the pages to be un-redirected. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThepangelinanpost_f801.html" title="User:Thepangelinanpost">Jordan</a> 19:38, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I am sure some of these contestants have gotten more hits in the last week than have some articles posted here for a year. They are definately "notable." If dialidol has an article, why shouldn't the people the site is about. Most people who watch this show don't even know about dialidol, but sure know these contestants. KEEP KEEP KEEP. By the way, my username is p0wn, but I'm too lazy to log in.&#160;:P --74.130.71.74 21:06, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> These candidates have notability, being the top few remaining. American Idol is the most watched show on TV and as the season progresses hits for these people will only increase. Deleting the articles just draws people to Google and away from Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/a/z/User%7ECazador_0189.html" title="User:Cazador">caz</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/z/User_talk%7ECazador_359b.html" title="User talk:Cazador">speak</a> 02:08, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> unmaintainable list with no assertion of significance of why a chronology is needed.

<li><b>Keep</b> The list seems both useful and manageable; the question "who was the first villain to appear in [time period X]" is a reasonable one, and it is an unwarranted burden to ask the user to search all supervillain articles separately. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomCritic_f342.html" title="User:RandomCritic">RandomCritic</a> 21:06, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete.</b> Although I strongly supported keeping the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhero_debuts.html" title="Superhero debuts">Superhero debuts</a> article because it's specific, objective, and maintainable, I must acknowledge that the supervillain chronology is none of those things. Whereas the superhero debuts article inherently indicates what is noteworthy (the characters' debuts), the catch-all chronology lacks indications of significance. <a href="../../../w/r/y/User%7EWryspy_d7ae.html" title="User:Wryspy">Wryspy</a> 22:24, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm amazed by those above drawing a distinction between this and <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhero_debuts.html" title="Superhero debuts">Superhero debuts</a> since this article is clearly equally valid (or not valid, depending on your PoV) as that article is. The nomination is flawed because lists are NEVER redundant with categories (see <a href="../../../c/l/s/WP%7ECLS_1606.html" title="WP:CLS">WP:CLS</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>). Besides, as <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">User:Black Falcon</a> rightly points out, this list gives more, and different, information to that which the category provides, and gives line entries to villains who aren't considered notable enough to have their own Wikipedia pages: which (contrary to <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">User:The Way</a>'s apparent opinion) is a valid and appropriate use of a list, not a reason to delete one, and is an advantage over a category. As for <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, well, that can be a ground for deletion but where information is superficially accurate, and clearly verifiABLE, I consider that just a matter for a tag for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, to let the article evolve. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyJones_d8f9.html" title="User:AndyJones">AndyJones</a> 14:13, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> There are less than 1000 nonwiki Google hits of him, and he has received no independent press coverage. I will also respond to Kevin Murray's claim that a new user should not nominate articles for AfD. It's inappropriate to say that here. What it <i>is</i> okay to do is politely explain the workings of AfD on the user's talk page if the nomination itself is wrongheaded. In this case, regardless of the result of the discussion, the nomination was entirely appropriate. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 19:29, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

First designed in the 1960s for the ABC Television Network's five owned and operated stations (O&amp;Os), the logo, or a version of it, is currently being used by a number of TV broadcasters around the world," which certainly establishes the subject's notability.

<li><b>comment</b> advertising? well that could be discussed and removed without putting the article up for deletion right? You know you could find a thousand band articles on wikipedia that don't have the "in depth coverage" you are looking for sourced either nor should it be required if you have proof that they meet any requirements of notablity. Being featured on a magazine cover and being part of a large festival generally known to be for the top bands of their genre seems to be enough by itself in my opinion to prove that at the very least they are one of the more notable bands within their genres. Just because a band isn't mainstream shouldn't prevent it from retaining notability. When was the last time you heard <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_metal.html" title="Power metal">power metal</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_metal.html" title="Progressive metal">progressive metal</a> on the radio or read an article about them in the newspaper or saw a documentary about a band within that genre on tv? Nonetheless a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_metal.html" title="Christian metal">Christian metal</a> band within that genre? For that matter what about <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_metal.html" title="Black metal">black metal</a>? Hardly any bands in that genre are on major labels or recieve any kind of media coverage at all yet there are tons of them on wikipedia? and they should be because somone who is interested in that subject should be entitled to find information about them here, Just like anyone who is interested in reading about a band like Theocracy.--<a href="../../../e/_/t/User%7EE_tac_b17f.html" title="User:E tac">E tac</a> 06:43, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The source need not necessarily be a mainstream one! A magazine that does more specialized coverage in this area, or music criticism that focuses specifically on this genre, would work fine. As to the advertising, yes it can be, which is why I mentioned that as a secondary concern-that in itself is not a reason for deletion unless the whole article is a blatant ad, which here is not the case. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 06:48, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It has already been proven that they were the cover story for magazine who does just that which is somewhat hard to properly source since it is not an online article, also these may or may not be considered noteworthy under current policy but there are tons of metal sites that have reviewed this album or interviewed the band. I am not really sure what makes a internet publication noteworthy or not though.--<a href="../../../e/_/t/User%7EE_tac_b17f.html" title="User:E tac">E tac</a> 06:54, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I'm not convinced that one cover in a tightly genre-based magazine is enough to pass WP:MUSIC. This entry has been deleted for the same reason once before and I can't really see what's changed since. The creator's attitude doesn't help much either - I went looking for Ghits (found about 15 that weren't myspaces etc) but did find <a href="http://esoterik72.net/esoblog/2005/12/09/wikipedia-is-not-cool-at-all/" class="external text" title="http://esoterik72.net/esoblog/2005/12/09/wikipedia-is-not-cool-at-all/" rel="nofollow">this page</a>.

<li><b>comment</b> Funny that blog you brought up is over 2 years old, I didn't even know about this band then and I don't think I had begun to edit anything on wikipedia nor is my name Christopher and at that point they hadn't appeared on the cover of the magazine nor had they played at ProgPower. What is wrong with my "attitude"? I have been perfectly civil in this discussion and I think it was quite rude of you to refer to me as having one. Also isn't the fact that it is "tightly genre based" kind of the point? They are in a genre that doesn't recieve a lot of mainstream press so of course that is going to be where you would find them if they are notable within that genre, especially when they are feautured on the cover.--<a href="../../../e/_/t/User%7EE_tac_b17f.html" title="User:E tac">E tac</a> 08:03, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Apologies if the blog article wasn't you, but your reaction to the tags that were placed on the article today were poor. You wrote "please do not put this tripe on here again", and later "grow up moeron, I don't know what your beef is with this article". No-one likes their work being AfD'd, but without the procedures Wikipedia would sink under the weight of worthless articles. Despite this, having thought about it I'm going to change my vote to Weak Delete - I don't think the band has quite enough to pass WP:MUSIC yet, but it's not far off. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR">EliminatorJR</a> 08:22, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> ...and yes before anyone adds anything I understand that I can be one to, however my main problem is when people just go around quoting policy, posting templates about policy on my talk page without taking the time to really discuss the issue in actual words. Also normaly when I get confrontational it is because I am trying to better the project and rather than studying up on every single policy and treating it as canon and getting rid of everything not perfectly in line with it, I try and edit using <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUse_common_sense_cd4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Use common sense">common sense</a>. Also I realize some of my problems with the user have been with image copyrights, I really don't fully understand this policy and if rather than taging the image and puting a template on my page, Moeron would actually try and communicate with me like an actual person and not a bot it might actually help me understand the policy so I could no longer be violating it. Also it seems a lot of the band articles on wikipedia have images uploaded with similar tags which makes me feel like I am being unfairly singled out.--<a href="../../../e/_/t/User%7EE_tac_b17f.html" title="User:E tac">E tac</a> 08:59, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

If that doesn't count for something, then I don't know what does. They're a really new band, and they're rising quickly in the world of Progressive metal. The founder, Matt Smith, started writing the first music in 2002, the first albumw as released in 2003, and by 2006 they were esteemed enough to play in ProgPower USA... They're as relevant if not more relevant to hudnreds of bands on Wikipedia.

As for copyright issues on the photographs. . . I have taken most of the photos used by the band on the Web site, in the album booklet and so on. Matt and I are both more than happy to grant usage for these images on Wikipedia. I'd be happy to address any questions about the pictures used.

<li><b>Comment</b> He seems to just make notability if the assertions in the article can be documented by independent sources, especially the film award. He appears to be a serious filmaker and more than a guy with a camcorder and Youtube distribution. I looked through Google and the name is common. Even adding "film" to his name brings back several others by the same name, so it is hard to use this rule of thumb. Unless the author(s) can produce meaningful source material this should fail. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 19:09, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep, tentatively</b>. The novelty of this party's appeal stems from the absence of a narrow-issue focus (e.g., Greens), extremist orientations (e.g., Libertarians), and stated alignment on specific wedge issues (such as abortion). This makes the party a very odd creature on the bipolar American political scene, where the Democrats and Republicans use wedge issues to squelch "wasted" voting on other parties in much the same way adults use distraction to quiet petulant toddlers screaming at their mothers. In the highly unlikely event the Centrist Party ever begins to amass a voter constituency, it will face a barrage of incumbent-party rhetoric (here on Wikipedia and elsewhere) aimed at nipping it in the bud, as a party of its type poses the only conceivable threat to the two-party system. In theory, a centrist party could gain the broad support required to impose democracy on the U.S. (i.e., a multiparty system with proportional voting as a minimum standard). Because of the likelihood of suspect motives underlying "delete" recommendations, Wikipedia should adopt a protective attitude for now. The article should remain for a couple of years until this new party has failed to thrive; it should then be considered for deletion if any surge in interest was historically insignificant.--87.49.44.157 01:29, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'll reply here. Based on newspaper coverage cited by others, the Centrist Party has arguably attained a minimum level of notability to warrant inclusion in Wikipedia. However, this notability is temporal in nature: if the party grows, its notability will, too, but if it fails to do so, the currency of interest in it will pass, and it will fade into obscurity, joining countless others. I haven't "predicted" its demise, only noted that it, like any fledgling political party, has only the slimmest chance of success.--87.52.109.121 14:34, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The existence of other similar articles is completely irrelevant to whether or not this article should be kept; the issue is whether or not <i>this</i> article meets the requirements of Wikipedia policy. Indeed, the articles you mentioned probably <i>should</i> also be deleted and I may nominate them in the next day or two (several 'in popular culture' articles were nominated for deletion yesterday and the consensus in all those AfD's appears to support deletion. Popular culture articles are inherently POV and suffer tremendous original research problems; what defines 'popular culture?' This concept of 'popular culture' is US/Western oriented and, as such, POV. This is inappropriate for an encyclopedia article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 09:51, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> as sadly there is no current consensus (that I know of) regarding "X in popular culture" sections of articles on wikipedia, so my guess was this was a split-off article primarily intended to reduce article clutter. To that extent, I'd say it was an admirable split-off decision as most of the information is trivial to a primary subject, but of possible interest to the topic of how this scientist has been presented outside of his scientific field. Obviously no one is going to argue that Hawking himself isn't notable, the question is the relative notability of the details of how his celebrity personality (as opposed to his scientific contributions) has been presented. <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celebrity.html" title="Celebrity">Celebrity</a> is still a valid topic in it's own right, and I'd rather see this information in a sub-article than the main until or unless wikipedia decides that influence on pop culture is not encyclopedic. I agree <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Stevens_c046.html" title="User:Philip Stevens">Philip Stevens</a>' argument per <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a> is superficially specious, but in this case I'd say there's some validity to examples of the overall trend which this article represents. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 13:36, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I understand your reluctance to&#160;!vote to delete absent your seeing a consensus, but I would submit to you that&#160;!voting to delete these articles, if you don't think they should exist, is how consensus is formed. As noted, a number of "...in popular culture" articles have been nominated over the last couple of days and in each case sentiment is running toward deletion and in a number of cases the articles have been deleted. See for example the AFDs for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_References_to_Calvin_and_Hobbes_d237.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/References to Calvin and Hobbes">References to Calvin and Hobbes</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_appearances_of_C96_in_popular_culture_d90e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of appearances of C96 in popular culture">List of appearances of C96 in popular culture</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rush_in_popular_culture_2_7fae.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rush in popular culture 2">Rush in popular culture</a>.

<dd><b>Reply</b> I understand that some "in popular culture" articles have (quite correctly) been deleted, but I would suggest that your examples do not represent a consensus to delete all "in popular culture" articles but instead were case-by-case deletions of those specific articles. C96 or Rush certainly can't be compared to Stephen Hawking in a discussion of culturally pervasive individuals (in my opinion) so to my mind deletion of those articles (which I admit I did not read pre-deletion) wouldn't necessarily be representative of a larger consensus to delete by wikipedia editors.</dd>

<dd>Granting that some individuals have sociologically significant impacts based on a public persona larger than their personal accomplishments, and granting that some detail of how and when that state is expressed is of encyclopedic value, I went with a Keep vote based not only on the lack of consensus on the larger issue, but with an assumed acceptance that THIS individual is a clear exemplar of a significant pop cultural icon. In other words, lacking an existing consensus against <i>all</i> "in popular culture" articles occurs, Stephen Hawking is most definitely NOT a place to start building such a consensus. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 14:28, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that of the other articles Otto4711 refers to the AFDs of, this is by far the best article. But that's primarily because of a couple of useful bits and pieces scattered throughout the article, that show both Hawking's attitude to popular media and other people's attitude to him. I think this could (and should) be usefully condensed to a few paragraphs in the main article, which is why I feel deletion is appropriate). But for this article, it isn't as clear cut as for the others. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 14:31, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I would say that Rush is at least comparable to Hawking for purposes of this sort of pop culture article. There are other AFDs open which are also comparable, including <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cultural_depictions_of_Sammy_Davis%2C_Jr._946e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cultural depictions of Sammy Davis, Jr.">Sammy Davis Jr</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Who_in_popular_culture_1c82.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Who in popular culture">The Who</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aerosmith_in_popular_culture_d4ed.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aerosmith in popular culture">Aerosmith</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aleister_Crowley_in_popular_culture_e7af.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aleister Crowley in popular culture">Aleister Crowley</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cultural_depictions_of_Elvis_Presley_0d5c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cultural depictions of Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a>. The only one that's running close to being kept is Crowley. I would definitely say that Elvis has had a far greater impact on poular culture than Hawking and his pop culture article looks to be on the way out. I'm not saying there is no place for "...in popular culture" -style articles. There are some that are well done including one for Joan of Arc and one for of all things the Superman logo. But these sorts of data dump articles where editors play games of I spy for everything that might possibly be in some way connected to or inspired by a person, place or thing are worthless. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 16:16, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I cannot see this article serving any purpose that the current individual series articles of the Amazing Race do not already serve.

As the list serves no other purpose than to name those who participated in the Race, and because those lists already exist on the individual episode pages (and considering there may be a place in the future for articles such as <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazing_Race_5_contestants_7386.html" title="Amazing Race 5 contestants">Amazing Race 5 contestants</a>, currently up for deletion) I respectfully disagree with Evrik on this one. -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 07:09, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Despite the fact that she was in Hole for a short period and left after recording one album, we know nothing about this woman, who she is, and where she is now, there is also no information available about her from any sources besides being in Hole (I think). Nothing in this article can't already be said on "<a href="../../../p/r/e/Pretty_on_the_Inside_22ec.html" title="Pretty on the Inside">Pretty on the Inside</a>" or "<a href="../../../h/o/l/Hole_%28band%29.html" title="Hole (band)">Hole (band)</a>". I mean, the only reason way someone will look up this person is by clicking on a link on Pretty on the Inside or Hole out of curiousity on who this woman is. But once they click, they won't see anything they haven't already seen on Pretty on the Inside or Hole, I suggest a redirect to Hole (band). <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlareNUKE_315e.html" title="User:FlareNUKE">FlareNUKE</a> 06:02, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I agree with the nominator that there isn't much info on her. I found some verifiable references and posted them at the article, but even cummulatively the information is not significant beyind establishing her as a prominent member of a notable band. I found equally scant information that she was involved in one other band after Hole. I think that she was noticed, which is the definition of notability. Is there value to a separate article and can that ever be more than a stub? I see little harm in leaving what we have, and referencing readers on to Hole wiht the hope that more information can be found. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 19:55, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Pop culture keeps appearing across Wikipedia, so while it doesn't really interest me, it does interest lots of people. I suggest looking to <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_depictions_of_Joan_of_Arc_d22a.html" title="Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc">Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc</a> (featured list) as an example of how these lists/articles can be done well. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a>)</small> 22:53, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. You have given linking to an internet search. You can see that it is well known enough in that respect. Certain claims to notability made within the article are in need of citations. It does not follow that the article therefore qualifies for deletion.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. I initially tagged this for speedy, but the originator took the time and trouble to read our policies and was able to persuade me (see article talk page, mostly) that the article passes our criteria not just to avoid speedy deletion, but just about to pass AfD. Very prepared (!) to defer to a good argument for deletion, but currently I'm for keeping. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 20:59, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I appreciate the authors' contention that this article meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, but fail to see how we can write a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> article about a topic with no coverage in secondary sources. We can't, and are left with an article that is uncited promotional material and/or <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> by editors with an obvious <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>. I think in this case there is an inconsistency between the aforementioned principles of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>+<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>+<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>+<a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and the first four principles should trump. Of course, if this has been the subject of nontrivial articles in reliable sources, then by all means keep, but I don't see those citations in the article. - 71.232.29.141 22:56, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> 265 thousand registered users is enough, and the partnership they claim with the News of the World is V--to the extent anything connected with that paper is V. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:48, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> until sources provided. Unfortunately a claim to notability that isn't backed up with reliable sources isn't a claim at all on wikipedia. As long as they can provide information which meets the criteria in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> thats fine, but until its provided it shouldn't exist. Google hits and alexa traffic ranks are no longer sufficient to meet the requirements of notability, they can be used as an indicator that something might not be reliable and it requires investigation, but thats the extent of their usefulness. A user count, sourced or not, also doesn't meet the criteria laid out in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Multiple non-trivial coverage by sources independent of the subject (and the coverage has to be from a reliable source) is required. Right now I'm not seeing that. The sun article (if thats what you'd call it) appears to be only a brief description of the sites content. So some third party reliable coverage needs to be shown.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 20:41, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. The "keep" position depended on the idea that the BBC article could function as a source even though it (perhaps by misattribution) didn't mention the website in question. That strikes me as flimsy; we really can't keep articles unless they're verifiable through reliable sources. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 19:33, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I can find no evidence that this film is notable, but I may well be just not looking hard enough. Neither of the links in the article count as the needed reliable, third party, non trivial published sources. <b>Delete</b> unless notability can be established. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 12:08, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, I've added a review from the film festival mentioned in the article.

<dd>Please see my reply above. Two or three reviews are available for <i>every</i> published author -- they don't make up "multiple independent reviews". What matters is assertion of notability. Honestly, I think you're being biased because you put a lot of effort in saving the article from prod and wikifying it. Have an honest look at the article -- is there anything that establishes notability? Authoring a book that made it to No. 3 in the <i>weekly</i> best-sellers list of a single book store, in some category doesn't make one notable enough for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 16:35, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Her article doesn't mention being a notable actor or television personality. It <i>does</i> say actor, but no evidence of this is provided. It also says she's best know for being on a reality show, so she's apparently not gone far as an actor. It's possible that the host(s) of that reality show are notable actors or television personalities, but I don't see how this would extend to everyone who has even been on it. Until she starts popping up in sources which refer to her as a television personality and/or actress, I don't know why we would consider her one. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 00:52, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I see no reason to have articles for individual language editions of Wikipedia. None of them are particularly notable and they're all part of one site: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, for which we have an article.</p>
<p>Most of the articles do not go any further than providing minor statistics. Such statistics are derived from various tools such as toolserv already available for public use.</p>
<p>In the case of several of these articles (most notably <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_Wikipedia_aa3b.html" title="Chinese Wikipedia">Chinese Wikipedia</a>), that information should probably moved interwiki to meta/wikinews/whatever. The details about the infamous block is already explained in <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blocking_of_Wikipedia_in_mainland_China_975f.html" title="Blocking of Wikipedia in mainland China">Blocking of Wikipedia in mainland China</a></p>

<dd>My point is that the Finnish Wikipedia may be independently notable as it has been the subject of articles in newspapers and magazines such as <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helsingin_Sanomat_28bb.html" title="Helsingin Sanomat">Helsingin Sanomat</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/o/Suomen_Kuvalehti_fd0c.html" title="Suomen Kuvalehti">Suomen Kuvalehti</a> and has also been discussed on national television etc. Also, the different language editions of Wikipedia are usually not just translations of each other but largely independent projects with different editors and different audiences. --<a href="../../../k/f/p/User%7EKFP_849a.html" title="User:KFP">KFP</a> <small>(<a href="../../../k/f/p/User_talk%7EKFP_25da.html" title="User talk:KFP">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KFP_62c1.html" title="Special:Contributions/KFP">contribs</a>)</small> 13:07, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In a blunt way to put it: every language version is an online encyclopedia. Wikipedia is notable as a whole and individual language versions are not.<br />
Statistics of any language version is indeed interesting and can be presented at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Special%7EStatistics_969e.html" title="Special:Statistics">Special:Statistics</a>. Statistics on articles about individual language versions will become outdated in a matter of seconds.<br />
The social structure of any language wikipedia isn't notable, such a thing would also fail to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> as well as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.<br />

<dd>If the social structure of individual Wikipedia isn't notable, then why has the social structure of particular Wikipedias been covered in the press? When the New York Times covers AfD debates, they're covering the social structure of just one of the projects, as no project has <i>exactly</i> the same AfD policies and voting tendancies.

<li><b>Keep some content.</b> I don't think these can just be deleted. Some of these variants of Wikipedia (perhaps most importantly the German one) are notable in their own right, because of ways in which they differ from the rest of Wikipedia. Some of them are only notable because of the notability of Wikipedia as a whole, and could perhaps be deleted. But I suspect that many of them have information which, if they are to be deleted, should be merged to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>. So, I think anyone who wants to delete them is going to have a lot of work on their hands sorting out the useful from the unnecessary. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 13:17, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Project space isn't for encyclopedia articles, and Meta isn't an encyclopedia. The question is whether any of these websites is notable enough for an encyclopedia article, and some of them are. Cool Cat's claim above that the article <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> encompasses all the languages <i>could</i> be true in principle, but it <i>isn't</i> true in practice.

<dd>No, not project space. They have no business at all in project space, which is for housekeeping tasks of English Wikipedia, not for encyclopedic content.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Mass nominations are discouraged for a reason. Many of these are quite deletable, at least in the <i>English</i>-language Wikipedia (they might be more notable in themselves), but others are not - commenters will focus in on the most or least deletable of them. I suggest that instead of nominating them all, you nominate a borderline case, like maybe the Japanese Wikipedia, and see how that goes.

<li><b>Neutral comment</b> - although I understand why users are complaining about this mass nomination, I do think that the nominator was correct to nominate all of these together. Logic dictates that either foreign-language Wikipediae in general deserve their own articles, or they do not.

Now maybe the quality/content of these articles is minimal, but that doesn't mean any should be deleted. At the least, I'd say "Non-English Wikipedia" should be a section or article on its own, but I'd prefer each article be separate anyway, not just a table or list.

<li><b>Keep all</b> I agree with Yamaguchi on mass nominating things. Actually, it would be fun to nominate all cities of all countries for mass deletion and then ask "how about putting them all in the country's article?". If Wikipedia is a country, English Wikipedia, German Wikipedia, Italian Wikipedia etc. are its cities. For the same reasoning, all cities of all countries should be deleted as well. Then we should go on for mass deletion of all human beings that are from the same family. Such as George W. Bush, George H.W. Bush and all those other Bushes should be united under "Bush family" article. It wouldn't be right. Wikipedia is the name of this family, and the family name of all Wikipedia family members. Turkish, Indonesian, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish etc. are our first names. --<a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENerval_98db.html" title="User:Nerval">Nerval</a> 03:31, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This fictional character has appeared in a newspaper column, a play, and is still appearing on the radio, according to the article. However, I must question whether those appearances add up to notability: a Google search on "Wiley Quixote" turns up only 134 hits; several of those hits appear to be for other users of the name (such as a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Comics_b294.html" title="Marvel Comics">Marvel Comics</a> character created three years earlier) and when "entries very similar to the [ones] already displayed" are eliminated only 38 are left. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 20:37, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I got in the habit of putting my nomination and my not-a-vote into separate sections for a couple of reasons.

<p>There is a photograph of the amplifier - it is an actual product. It is also discontinued, which means that keeping it here doesn't serve to benefit the company - only historical preservation of knowledge of the product. The information seems objective. Why delete it? --I am nitrogen 06:08, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Photographs exist of a great many things that are not notable ebough for Wikipedia articles. Wikipedia's notability policy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and reliable source policy <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> require that something has been the subject of multiple nontrivial coverage in independent and reliable sources. The fansite listing equipment made by the company is neither of those. "IT IS HARMLESS" is not a valid reason for keeping an article about a piece of audio eequipment if it was not notable in its time. Perhaps someone can dig up a couple of reviews in an audio magazines from the days when it was for sale. That would help. Otherwise the articlew should be deleted. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 15:53, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> A famous piece of audio equipment doubtless has been the subject of multiple articles in independent, reliable and verifiable sources. If someone would add two or three such, as nominator I would be happy to keep the article. Right now it does not have such sources. It appears to have been extremely high priced equipment sold to audiophiles, so somewhere in an audiophile magazine there should have been articles.

Yandman, PlayRadioPlay is signed to Island Records, a major record label, and is one of the fastest up and coming new bands right now. You can't say a band isn't notable when they'll have a major label release on Best Buy store shelves all around the country in less than 6 months. I just spent 2 ours redoing this article after someone spammed it last night. Give it a rest and let the article be. And learn something about a 17 year old kid that's following his heart while you're at it. --~*LiSaSuArEz*~ 14:28, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, if this page gets deleted, thousands of others bands wiki's will deserve deletion as well, considering PlayRadioPlay! gets more traffic than most bands on MySpace. Sorry I won't post anymore, I feel very strongly about this subject.--~*LiSaSuArEz*~ 14:32, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

A MySpace page doesn't constitute evidence of notability, even if it gets a lot of traffic. <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> demands <i>third-party reliable sources</i>, i.e. sources independent of the band itself. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 16:29, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hello Lisa. Unfortunately, the dreams of a "17 year old kid that's following his heart" aren't a good reason for keeping an article. And per <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a>, the fact that he <i>may</i> have an album released in 6 months time, and that it <i>may</i> be popular, is not a good reason for keeping an article either. Most bands on MySpace don't deserve wikipedia articles, which is why myself and others spend far too much of out time deleting scores of them. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html" title="User talk:Yandman"><font color="red"><b>yandman</b></font></a> 15:47, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> PlayRadioPlay! IS a notable artist with thousands of fans, a MAJOR record label, national tours, an EP that will be released in just a few months, and an LP release that will be in about a year. Just because YOU haven't heard of a band doesn't mean it's not notable! PlayRadioPlay! is really in a bad spot, because the general demographic of his fans are teenage females, and most wikipedians are older males. Even though PlayRadioPlay doesn't have an official release YET, he still has gained the attention of thousands of people, gaining millions of MySpace plays and views. It's impossible to say this isn't notable. There are far worse wikipedia pages out there, go find them. --~*LiSaSuArEz*~ 07:09, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> PlayRadioPlay! is a big up and coming artist. He has a huge following and is a signed act. He has a EP that has a set release date and has played numerous shows. This is a band that will be huge in a few months. They already have a huge following underground but pretty soon he wil lbe more main stream. He is very noteable because of the amount of people he has listen to his music everyday.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia can't delete this page. PlayRadioPlay! is important. Maybe not to EVERYONE, but to SOME people. And those people count. Wikipedia was made to inform the masses on different subjects, INCLUDING bands. If you have an article on My Chemical Romance, you have to let PlayRadioPlay! have one too. Using the fact that PlayRadioPlay isn't 'mainstream' as your reason to delete it is wrong. Just because PlayRadioPlay! isn't favored by some wikipedians doesn't mean a thing. I could care less about your article on 30 Seconds to Mars, but it's there. I could care less about your information on The Killers, but it's there. PlayRadioPlay! deserves to have a page. PRP! helped me in times of need. Dan helped me, he really did. Information on him, and PRP! is important to me. Without him, i might not be here today. If you get rid of this page, you get rid of my help. Martin Luther King Jr. helped people and he has a page. Why can't Dan? He has the right for freedom of speech and, if you delete this, you are suppressing his right. AlixTheEskimo 07:57, 20 February 2007 (UTC)AlixTheEskimo</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> PlayRadioPlay! as they are a notable artist and they're becoming more popular by the minute. If people intruiged by the band come to wikipedia to read about the band, they will have no page to view, no information to read, nothing to learn. Even if a band is not 'worthy of a wikipedia page' why get rid of it just because one person thinks so? I'm sure there are people who do like that band, and they should not have the right of reading about that band taken away from them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> While you mat not consider the band notable does not mean that you can try to delete them. Although not hugely notable to some of the general public Dan or Play Radio Play is signed to a major label and is currently in studio recording a brand new EP to be released this year. He has thousands of fans, which if that isn't enough to prove notability. The deletion of this page would be closer to Wikipedia vandalism then cleaning up of the site. There are far worse pages on Wikipedia that deserve attention then this wonderful musicians. Wikipedia is an informative source and should not have articles deleted because thet have no significance to an insignificant individual. Thus why I vote KEEP on this article.</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> I don't understand why this is being deleted. It is becoming a very big band, certainly a lot bigger than many of the bands wikipedia has pages for. They are signed to Stolen Transmission record label, which has artists that have a wikipedia account. PRP has over 70,000 friends on myspace. He is playing at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bamboozle_e038.html" title="The Bamboozle">The Bamboozle</a> music festival in New Jersey this year. A full-length EP will be out this year, and it WILL be successful. If the problem with this is that there are no EP's out yet, you can solve that by just putting his upcoming EP under his discography section as an UPCOMING EP. There is certainly enough hype to do that. Also, there is a lot of information about how and where Playradioplay! came from in his blog section on myspace, so there is no lack of information. My main arguement is that there are many artists that have wikipedia articles and are not as popular as Playradiplay. <a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJunejo_acd9.html" title="User:Junejo">Junejo</a> 07:42, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Playradioplay is in fact a notable artist. Dan has an incredible talent, which makes his music very unique Just because there is no actual website for PlayRadioPlay! and only a myspace, shouldn’t be a reason, for deletion . He is signed to a MAJOR record label, an EP will be released within a few months. PlayRadioplay! may not be known to most adults, but teenagers word wide if haven’t listened, have heard of PlayRadioPlay! He is becoming more popular day by day, with well over a million plays. If that can’t be suitable for a wikipedia article I don’t know what can. -KaraOh kara 07:56, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

"#6 Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or of the local scene of a city; note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability."</b><br />
PlayRadioPlay! is the most prominent representative of a new genre of music called "Electro Pop" or "Synth Pop" in Dallas/Fort Worth, TX, as well as online.<br />
<b>"#8 Has won or placed in a major music competition."</b><br />
PlayRadioPlay! won a national competition to perform at <a href="../../../b/a/m/Bamboozle.html" title="Bamboozle">Bamboozle Left</a> on October 15th and 16th, a major music concert in Pomonoa, California with many notable acts, including <a href="../../../d/a/s/Dashboard_Confessional_df52.html" title="Dashboard Confessional">Dashboard Confessional</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brand_New_8cb8.html" title="Brand New">Brand New</a>.

<p>First of all (hehe), this is going to sound unusual... A few days ago I logged onto Wikipedia.com and defaced the PlayRadioPlay Wikipedia page by changing all of the text to neon green and pink font, and adding "Daniel often spams his own Wikipedia page", among other things. Being the power-hungry little boy I am, I then went to the George W. Bush article and changed all of the font to red, white, and blue, and added, "Anybody that takes down the patriotic font hates America!" (Joking, of course).</p>
<p>Well, serious Wikipedians didn't like this and the change to the Dubya article was quickly reverted. Also, the PlayRadioPlay page (as well as the Sky Eats Airplane page, which I posted a few funny pictures of Lee from my private collection on) was DELETED!!! A few days later, someone was nice enough to post a new LONGER PlayRadioPlay page, and the veteran Wikipedians are trying to get it deleted AGAIN. Thanks to everyone so far that has voted to "keep" the wikipedia article! I would vote but... I'm banned from wikipedia&#160;:)</p>
<p>In closing, I've learned my lesson, I'll no longer deface Wikipedia articles... however fun and amusing it may be. Someone should also remake the Sky Eats Airplane Wikipedia article since I was accidently responsible for it's deletion and I feel bad&#160;:(.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - seems to me that the Guinness Book of Records mention and the other external sources constitute multiple third-party coverage per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. As to calling him "Lord", the article does not <i>demand</i> this, it simply claims that he is sometimes credited under that title (although ideally this statement should be sourced). (For all we know it could be his actual title - hereditary titles do exist in Holland, and he would be entitled to use the stated form if he were the eldest son of a hereditary peer. Even if it's a false title, that doesn't make him inherently non-notable.) <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 16:20, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The externally sourced notability - film career - seems trivial, weighed against the strong possibility that we're on the receiving end of promo for some individual or collective hoax/fantasy. The fake nobility isn't a good sign; there have no real Holy Roman Empire titles for centuries, whatever the alleged <a href="http://imperialcollegeofprincesandcounts.com/_wsn/page4.html" class="external text" title="http://imperialcollegeofprincesandcounts.com/_wsn/page4.html" rel="nofollow">Imperial Council of Princes and Counts of Germany and Europe</a> says.

<li><b>Delete</b>, one minor accomplishment does not translate into notability, nor do friendships or business associations with notable persons. Almost nothing besides the Guinness record is remotely verifiable; my guess is that the aristocratic title is about as valid as <a href="../../../f/r/%C3%A9/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Prinz_von_Anhalt_aa97.html" title="Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt">Zsa Zsa's eighth husband's</a>. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 22:20, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> There is no need to guess about notability, it is clearly non-notable according to the article itself: his record for the longest film documentary was "featuring his grandmother actress Martha Stelloo," and then says "He has primarily been involved in packaging,promotion and the financing of US and European projects as well as low-budget independent European films," avoiding a direct reference to more than one--a film whose notability has not been established. Personally, my guess is that a hoax would make more extravagant claims. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 11:07, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is a case of prejudgment. If Miriam Shear lied she is getting an entry she doesn't deserve. Also it is being hijacked by only one opinion other than mine. When deletion has occurred for their side it was allowed by them but if by me it was labeled always as vandalism. I had to push for the little input I could. I say drop the article. yisraelasper</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> we cannot consider deletions just because somebody does not like the content of an article, and in this case it is properly referenced and verifiable though I don't know if it is really of interest to an encyclopedia <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> 00:58, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Complete total POV, full of lies. Article is constantly being hijacked by Italiavivi who has a very non-NPOV agenda. The fact that an article is written about a person in a newspaper does not say anything about the notability of that person. We don't have articles about every person who claims to have been the victim of a supposed crime.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Shmuel is not unpublished. I have seen his works in translation in Al Ittihad. His poems were certainly notable enough to gain the attention of the Israeli Internal Security authorities. The references at on the article are sufficient to demonstrate <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Protest poets are rare in Israeli society, and I do not know any other case of a poet who has made the transition from right wing Zionism to anti-Zionist communism. He is a contravertial individual and you may not approve of his political ideas.

<li><b>Keep</b>:I think that the testimony of a country´s Security Serice when they investiagate a radical activist and consider him dangerous and inform him that they keep an eye on him, and this is reported by reputable media both in the country itslef and internationally, is a reliable proof of finding him notable as an activist. The Security Service can be considered an impartical witness, they have no interest in Wikipedia, they only have an interest in which activists is notable and which one is negligable from their point of view, and they clearly consider yerushalmi notable. Adam Keller 23:11, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>Why delete this? Yerushalmi is a well-known poet and activist. His arrest and interrogation were widely noted around the world; his comments are frequently quoted; and his poems (in Hebrew at least) widely available.

<dd>Jaakobou's opinion above is prejudiced and uncalled-for. There are over 1.5 million articles on English Wikipedia, and I had not come across this one until I saw it mentioned on <a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Keller_adf3.html" title="User talk:Adam Keller">User talk:Adam Keller</a>; nobody canvassed me for support. I have, however, herad of Shmuel Yerushalmi, and have previously, off-Wikipedia, forwarded his poems to friends. So I agree that he is notable and deserving of an entry in Wikipedia, and I object -- quite genuinely and independently -- to deleting the article. In any case, Abu Ali's message to Adam Keller was transparent and available for all to see, so it can hardly be considered an underhand attempt to subvert Wikipedia. But whi knows how many off-wiki messages may have been exchanged by editors trying to delete this article. Any attempt to discount our opinions will be strongly resisted. <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERolandR_9641.html" title="User:RolandR">RolandR</a> 14:37, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

But they haven't put forward reasoned arguments for deletion beyond assertions of lack of notability (based on ignoring the citations in the article itself. More significant are the contributions of JoshuaZ and DGG who both changed their votes from delete to keep after examining the evidence and finding that the requirements for notability have been met.

<p>I put a PROD tag on this article, but someone removed it, so here I am. As it stands, this article is errant nonsense, suggesting that a machine might be constructed to navigate among alternate universes (many-worlds interpretation of QM). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCBryant_f1d6.html" title="User:DavidCBryant">DavidCBryant</a> 15:09, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Just to be thorough, I ran a google search on "probability control" and got 14,100 hits. I reviewed the summaries for the first 50 of those. The term "probability control" is used to describe a feature of Code Division Multiplexing (CDMA) in Electrical Engineering. It is also used to describe some sort of statistical procedure in a number of math papers (I suspect this procedure is connected with the theory of Error Correcting Codes underlying CDMA technology … I didn't take the time to read any of the papers to be certain). It is also used to describe a feature of a number of video games. This article's reference to QM was the only one of the 50 that referred to quantum mechanics, and it came up at the top of list.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In my opinion, none of the legitimate uses of the phrase "probability control" are notable enough to merit an article on Wikipedia, and the best thing to do is to put this article out of its misery. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCBryant_f1d6.html" title="User:DavidCBryant">DavidCBryant</a> 15:21, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>- Oakshade, can you come up with some evidence that the road is a primary road in London or even South Norwood? I ask because I happen to know the road and to me it's rather dull and unremarkable.

<li>Maybe "primary" is a subjective term and I respect your call on that. Certainly not "primary" for all of London, but it's also not "minor" in South Norwood. (former London resident typing here.)

<li><b>Weak delete</b> I am often going down or past Tennison Road and in fact did so tonight on my way home.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This article have been created because the lack of specifing among europeans in <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_Intelligence_9658.html" title="Race and Intelligence">Race and Intelligence</a>. So I do not feel that article cover this one. Whites and also Europeans are a large group. Why shall for example ashkenazi jews have an advantage of been divided from other jews and groups, while europeans/whites, blacks/africans, etc have not this advantage? Recently there was a discussion about the article <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashkenazi_intelligence.html" title="Ashkenazi intelligence">Ashkenazi intelligence</a>. That article was obviously created to make a point and for highlightning advantages, like IQs in various European countries have been critized for. That article "survived". Another thing about <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashkenazi_intelligence.html" title="Ashkenazi intelligence">Ashkenazi intelligence</a> is that 20 discussed/voted for deleting that article, while 15 discussed for keeping that article. Still the administration (read: <a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrown1023_a728.html" title="User:Cbrown1023">Cbrown1023</a>) choosed to keep it. Why shall we have disscussions/voting about the articles, if he and the administration already have decided what the results will be after the discussions??? This discussion about IQs in various European countries feels therefore hope- and pointless. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECangbush_8850.html" title="User:Cangbush">Cangbush</a><small>— <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECangbush_8850.html" title="User:Cangbush">Cangbush</a> (<a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECangbush_eefb.html" title="User talk:Cangbush">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cangbush_37c4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cangbush">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>
<ul>
<li>Cangbush, just because Ashkenazi Intelligence made it through, and you're not very happy about it, please don't nominate this article for keep because you feel there should be reciprocation with that article. The Ashkenazi Intelligence page is primarily about a study, this is a complete and utter mix of studies. It's almost like our very own original research because it is comparing studies that no professional has compared, probably for a reason. I'm imploring you to reconsider based on the article's own merit. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 00:54, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> There exist 3 sources on this subject, so it is some sourced. Vinko Buj and two of Richard Lynn, the one mentioned in this article and the other is the one from IQ and the wealth of countries. I think still that the one of Richard Lynn in this article is more actual for the article, since the studies there are newer/up-to-date scientific studies from Lynn. Since the average IQ is higher among some nations in the newer studies: it feels maybe more provocating for some people. The Ashkennazi Intelligence article is not heavily sourced. There is only one bigger studies on the subject. The others have very small numbers of testpersons.<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMannfred5_39fd.html" title="User:Mannfred5">SriKorange</a><small>— <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMannfred5_39fd.html" title="User:Mannfred5">Mannfred5</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMannfred5_53ef.html" title="User talk:Mannfred5">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mannfred5_97c7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mannfred5">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I can read here that the sources have been widely criticezed. Well there is an article called <a href="../../../i/q/_/IQ_and_the_Wealth_of_Nations_495d.html" title="IQ and the Wealth of Nations">IQ and the Wealth of Nations</a> inside here. If Richard Lynn is reliable there; He should be reliable when he do new studies too.

<p>Vanity page for a "backyard wrestler" (!) in a federation which turns out, in its 1 independent Google reference, to be a public-access TV program. Page may actually be a joke, but obviously fails WP:BIO anyway.

<li>'"This page is intended to give the community for which Jacc Felony (real name Jeremy Groves), a wrestler in the Sacramento area that had done much charity work for the community for which he is involved. He is in fact a wrestler with the TWF (Tracy Wrestling Federatoin) and they do in fact broadcast their show upon public access stations in the Sacramento Area. The TWF is not a large orginization such as the WWE, but I feel as though his story, and controbutions he has displayed to the community for which he wrestles in should be displayed, and told for people in the Sacramento area to observe and read. The sources can be proved by a contact with the American Red Cross, Sacramento Area.rhsxo 16:14, 18 February 2007</li>

<li>"This page is ment to be for informational purposes only. The people of the Sacramento area have attempted to find information regarding the wrestler that goes by the name of Jacc Felony (real name Jeremy Groves) so this page was created so they could learn more about this man. There has already been one page linked to a story posted by a Mr. Paul Harvey Smith who apparently observed Jacc's match back in 2000. More updates to make this page to make it conform to Wikipedia standards will be comming soon." 16:19, 18 February 2007</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Jeremy might be a great person, volunteer in soup kitchens, etc., but the fact remains that he fails EVERY criteria of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. I suggest trying to get a local paper, etc. to write about him before submitting to Wikipedia.

<li>"We are a local orginazation that serves the Sacramento area and I would like to inform [EliminatorJR] that this man is not a joke by any means. Jeremy has helped with local food drives on our West side food drives that the local churches have held. When I became informed that this article was up for deletion, we began to become upset. Jeremy has contributed so much to the community which he lives in. And yes he dose wrestler in the tracy wrestling federation which is broadcasted on our local tv stations here. He is actually only one of two wrestlers from the TWF that helps us out. I will make an effort to edit this page to the standards for which you have asked. Jeremy is an exceptional man with a story worthy of an encylopedia. Updates to meet the standards will be comming soon." 16:52, 18 February, 2007</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Please note I wasn't suggesting the subject was a joke, only the article which was light-hearted and had links which led to odd places. Unfortunately, as per the above, being a tireless worker for charity isn't in itself enough to qualify for a Wikipage. Please read <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, and if you can update the article to meet the standards, that'd be great. At the moment, though, it doesn't. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR">EliminatorJR</a> 01:44, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>"Comment" I will read through the entire wikipedia standards page for the posting, and ensure that what is posted in this article is in fact factual information. I will attempt to locate more up to date links so that this page dose not get deleted from wikipedia. It may take some time to compile these links, and rewrite this information, but the standards will be met to wikipedia standards. Charity016 19:23, 18 February 2007</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> - a listing of fictional works in which pianos appear is trivial beyond the point of usefulness.

<p><b>Keep</b>. I am taking an opposite view to that I have taken with Piano wire in popular culture below. This article is likely to keep growing as more and more people add more references.

However, <i>Popular culture</i> in the <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a> article needs to be promoted to a main heading there.

<li>It is a unique situation. Perhaps the redirect is appropriate although Stockbridge uses some of the UMass facilities and professors it maintains it's own professors and faclities as well as holds it's own classes (made available to UMass studens as well). Stockbridge students can live in UMass dormatories, utilize the library and eat at the dining commons. It is considered a seperate school within the University of Massachusetts system. Much like UMass, Boston is considered a different school. Stockbridge happens to be in Amhest but is a sperate school.

<p>Article went through AfD in June of 2006 and resulted in a No Consensus. Since that time no improvements have been made to the article, including dealing with cleanup and ref tags that have been around for eight months. This is still just a non-notable middle school.

<li><b>Delete</b>. No evidence of notability, except possibly the claim that institution is a "gifted and talented school". My own experience is that schools are seldom gifted or talented - they may be old and damp, or new and centrally-heated, but unless the article explains what particular talents the school has ( perhaps it plays the bassoon, or can tap-dance ) I don't consider this to be notable. Incidentally, if the school were "for gifted and talented children" I would still not consider this per se notable - there are plenty of such schools, so more is needed. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 13:41, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks to everyone who's contributed to this discussion. I thought I'd respond to some of the points that have been raised.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>It appears that the term "Pallywood" comes from a short amateur film by a Richard Landes. It's self-produced and distributed from <a href="http://www.seconddraft.org/movies.php" class="external text" title="http://www.seconddraft.org/movies.php" rel="nofollow">this page</a> on a website by an anonymous person or organisation (see <a href="http://www.seconddraft.org/about_us.php" class="external free" title="http://www.seconddraft.org/about_us.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.seconddraft.org/about_us.php</a> ). The website is patently not a reliable source. The film doesn't meet any of the criteria listed in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28films%29_a836.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (films)">Wikipedia:Notability (films)</a> - I've not found any reviews of it from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, though it's mentioned in a university newspaper at <a href="http://media.www.dailycollegian.com/media/storage/paper874/news/2005/09/23/News/Boston.U.Professor.Claims.Media.staged.Footage.Of.Middle.East.Conflict-1560107.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://media.www.dailycollegian.com/media/storage/paper874/news/2005/09/23/News/Boston.U.Professor.Claims.Media.staged.Footage.Of.Middle.East.Conflict-1560107.shtml" rel="nofollow">[54]</a>.</li>
<li>The term itself is a neologism. <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> applies: "To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers about the term — not books and papers that use the term."
<ul>
<li>Jjay cites some sources at <a href="http://news.google.fr/archivesearch?as_q=pallywood&amp;num=30&amp;btnG=Search+Archives&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_ldate=&amp;as_hdate=&amp;lr=&amp;as_src=&amp;as_price=p0&amp;as_scoring=" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.fr/archivesearch?as_q=pallywood&amp;num=30&amp;btnG=Search+Archives&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_ldate=&amp;as_hdate=&amp;lr=&amp;as_src=&amp;as_price=p0&amp;as_scoring=" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>. Of the 26 items listed, many appear to be blogs; some are press releases; some aren't even in English; and the only one which actually defines the term (as opposed to merely using it) seems to be a <i>Toronto Star</i> article of Aug. 31, 2006 which says: "Right-wing bloggers have dubbed that [alleged media manipulation] "Pallywood.""</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As Chrislk02 has pointed out, the vast majority of the article's content is someone's OR. If the OR, non-RS and non-notable content is removed from the article, there is literally nothing left to keep.</li>

<p>It appears that only a few of the references have anything to do with pallywood, and from what I can find it is mostly related to an article or something created by a professor Richard Landes.

<dd>So, except for one case (about Richard Landes) all of your examples actually disprove the case you are trying to make. These are all about largely dissimilar media events that are alleged to be hoaxes and fabrications. The irony is breathtaking - you engage in fabrication to prove that there is no fabrication, and then label the view opposite of yours as "original research." --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 14:36, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What I am saying is that the numerous articles that have no mention of pallywood constitue originial research. Sure, they may be involved with what the article is talking about, but the connection is made by the wikipedia editor, not the author of the article. This is orignial research on the part of the editor who makes the leap. If the articles contained something explaning pallywood and its connection, then it would not be. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 14:59, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In retrospect, upon google search, i think that fauxtography and pallywood (200,000 hits) should stay while hizbollywood should have gone (only 500 finds on google) - the reasoning to remove because people title the subject matter "pallywood" and don't repeat that word inside the article is quite silly in my own opinion - here's a sample article: <a href="http://newsbusters.org/node/6685" class="external autonumber" title="http://newsbusters.org/node/6685" rel="nofollow">[56]</a></dd>
<dd><b><a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">Chris's</a></b>, it would seem that by your definitions a movie/phenomenon becomes notable only if a reviewer continues to repeat the title name inside the review about the movie... personally, i think the movie becomes notable if people talk about the movie, about scenes from the movie and they share that movie on the net in quantity... here's yet another sample of "original research" - <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/51035704480@N01/310141366/" class="external autonumber" title="http://flickr.com/photos/51035704480@N01/310141366/" rel="nofollow">[57]</a> Jaakobou 15:36, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am slighly confused as to what you mean when you say, "the reasoning to remove because people title the subject matter "pallywood" and don't repeat that word inside the article is quite silly in my own opinion". There are many articles on a topic that may or may not relate to pallywood. That is not for you or I to decide in the context of the article. A majority of articles used as sources may describe something similar to pallywood etc etc. The fact is, they DO NOT MENTION IT, and it is therefore orignial research to make the conecntion yourself. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 15:39, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The fact is, that most people reffering to admitted fake photography and alleged fake photography by palestinians is using the term in some way or another as a descrpitive term to "the pallywood movie industry". either in the tag words of his article or in the actual text body. your "rant" about original research is on it's own some type of manipulation and feels like you cannot admit that the term is indeed prominent enough to get it's own atricle... please explain to me for example why you feel that the movie "jenin jenin" does not fall under the term <b>"admitted stagings"</b>... i'm pointing this out because your representation on the subject matter as if this article must have the word "pallywood" inside it is POV at best and Attempted Vandalism at worst.

<dd>yOU CLAIM, "that most people reffering to admitted fake photography and alleged fake photography by palestinians is using the term in some way or another as a descrpitive term to "the pallywood movie industry"". If this were true, the sources above would mention it. However you dice it, making the conncetion yourself is orignial research. Sure, it may be black and white in your eyes but, then again if we all wrote what we thought was black and white wikipedia would be filled with innacurate POV articles. I am not disputing that the content is not valid or the concept is not real, I however am challening the name that has been created and this article. There are actually arguments here that the content is already included in other articles and this is just a neoligism. I agree with this because none of the news stories above mention the term and the leap is made that each of these stories or incidents is related to pallywood when the only connection was made by a wikipedia editor. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 16:34, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>source above is an article about admitted staging about jenin (see: <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenin_massacre.html" title="Jenin massacre">jenin massacre</a>), the term is therefore not needed in the article where muhamad bakri admits his complicity in fraud since his is a single production within' the industry. i guess we shall remain without an agreement but i tend to think it's either because you don't know the subject matter or for other less noble reasons.

The simple fact is, the connection between the term pallywood and most of the references above (considering the term is not in the article) is originial research, plain and simple.

<dd>(Resetting indent) The term "Pallywood" refers to allegations that news events are staged for the benefit of the Palestinian side in the conflict, and then reported as "real" news. All the references illustrate this, whether or not they invoke the term "Pallywood." There is no question "Pallywood" refers to this phenomenon, and no question that the references discuss it. The connection is self-evident, so the OR accusation is unjustified. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 02:27, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure I agree with Chris' reasoning for the article being <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> but regardless, I don't think that a lack of good references is a good reason to delete an article. How about you give the editors some time to produce good references that satisfy all parties and then re-nominate it? From my experience, the term is notable (and google supports that). <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonatanh_cbfb.html" title="User:Yonatanh">Yonatan</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yonatanh_afb0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yonatanh">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../y/o/n/User_talk%7EYonatanh_729d.html" title="User talk:Yonatanh">talk</a>) 19:00, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I respect everybodys opinions, and the term may be somewhat notable. Should there be sources that are added that make the conenction in the source, I would not adverse to changing my <b>Oppose</b> nom to a <b>Support</b>. However, I still stand by the fact that making the leap that the articles are related to the phenomenon without an assertion of such in the article is orignial research. I can describe a boy to you. You may see a tall, muscular figure that appears to be a boy and you automatically assume it is the boy. If the person comes to you and says they are a boy, that is a different story. However, until such an assertion is made, it is realy just a guess or you making the connection in your head, which is what orignial research is. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 19:05, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In that case, anyone on wikipedia who hasn't been quoted as saying he is a boy (or the fact that he is a boy hasn't been said about him) cannot be described as a boy in every article. I do not see that as the case on wikipedia, although I'm more than happy to be enlightened. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonatanh_cbfb.html" title="User:Yonatanh">Yonatan</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yonatanh_afb0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yonatanh">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../y/o/n/User_talk%7EYonatanh_729d.html" title="User talk:Yonatanh">talk</a>) 19:31, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I guess the boy example is a much more simplified version for the sake of demonstrating what I mean. I have attempted to explain why it is originial research but nobody seems to understand that, unless the article claims that it is related to pallywood, you, the writer, make the connection. Will you not agree with that? That 7 out of the 9 articles listed above make no mention of the term pallywood? They may describe a phenomenon similar or exactly the same as pallywood however, you are making that connection. That is why it is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, if any of those articles stated something like, "this incident, related to the pallywoodmovement was blah blah and blah", I would have no problem at all. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 19:47, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So out sounds like you have no quarrel with an article about the (alleged) phenomenon, but only with whether the term Pallywood is the right short-hand term for the phenomenon? In that case, you should vote to rename it, possibly with a redirect, no? --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 21:37, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Shira, the media reports on many crazy things "extensivley" each day and then those reports get stored in cyberspace on the Internet and you can dig them up on Google at any time, but that does <i>not</i> make those items interesting or noteworthy (unless of course you have an agenda, then any crumb of "news" is worthy of being "noted") and in this case what you have is a barely functional congregation that, beyond a few headlines it has grabbed, is a totally unimportant place. There are tens of thousands of <a href="../../../s/h/t/Shtiebel.html" title="Shtiebel">shtiebelach</a> in the world, some with very important rabbis and members, and essentially NONE of them get an article on Wikipedia, nor should they, until such time as something REALLY significant can be connected to them beyond making a few local headlines that are carried by the Jewish news services. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 10:00, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>[Weak Keep]We need to draft some real guidelines for synagouges. In the past, we have left in unknown Conservative or Reform synagouges created by the rabbi of the congregation, that have never made the newspaper or done anything ntable. Here we have a congregation that is in the newspapers regularly. If this gets deleted, then all the little congregations have to go, and all the unknown kiruv rabbis and community kollels should be deleted. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayrav_83fd.html" title="User:Jayrav">Jayrav</a> 14:01, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>First off: <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In Black</a> nominated this for deletion <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_references_or_spoofs_cd12.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Pokémon references or spoofs">a few months ago</a>, and the result was "no consensus"; I didn't know about that debate when I decided to nominate this for deletion. I've had a problem with this article for a few months now. I discovered it back in December and, going against my initial instinct to nominate it for deletion, instead <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_references_or_spoofs&amp;diff=95651688&amp;oldid=95178293" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_references_or_spoofs&amp;diff=95651688&amp;oldid=95178293" rel="nofollow">deleted most of the list items</a>, leaving only the most "notable" items. The current page, though not as long as the one I purged back then, is nonetheless pretty bad. I can see a possible reason for having this page (separating this "trivia" from the main article to avoid clutter there), but that's a weak argument at best. The <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon.html#Cultural_influence" title="Pokémon">small section in the main article</a> is, with a bit of expansion, sufficient: it mentions a couple of the more notable references, and provides links to the appropriate pages. Additionally, unlike this page, the section of the main article that deals with cultural references is much more high-profile, and therefore easier to edit to weed out extraneous, fancrufty information. There is no reason to have this information anyway - it's not encyclopedic in any sense of the term. Who needs to know about a Pokémon card parody by <i>Nickelodeon Magazine</i> back in the late '90s? I saw that spoof, and laughed at it, and could probably even dig it out of my old magazine piles to verify it. But it's not at all notable or important, and neither are almost all the items on this page. This is one of the useless extraneous pages that the <a href="../../../p/c/p/WP%7EPCP_c57f.html" title="WP:PCP">PCP</a> often catches a lot of flak about; the fewer of them the better. ~e.o.t.d~ (<a href="../../../e/y/e/User%7EEye.of.the.dragonfly_c6de.html" title="User:Eye.of.the.dragonfly">蜻蛉の目</a>•<a href="../../../e/y/e/User_talk%7EEye.of.the.dragonfly_9f7c.html" title="User talk:Eye.of.the.dragonfly">話す</a>•<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Eye.of.the.dragonfly_c220.html" title="Special:Contributions/Eye.of.the.dragonfly">貢献</a>) 21:48, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. A textbook example of what's wrong with all "in popular culture" sections and articles: nothing but a non-notable, crufty wall of trivia. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep and improve</b> - While i agree with Krimpet's arguement that this is one of those lists that makes people want to crusade against <i>all</i> pop culture lists, both RobJ1981 and Jerichi need to remember that just calling something <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">cruft</a> is not an argument in itself and should be avoided at AFDs. First, the keep: Any subject that has become so well known that it is criticized, parodied, and referenced in a wide variety of media outlets deserves a section that appropriately details some of the more high-profile or notable cases (e.g. given <i><a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_326f.html" title="South Park">South Park</a>'s</i> ratings, the "Chinpokomon" episode would be high-profile). I could make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a> and go over to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_in_popular_culture.html" title="Wikipedia in popular culture">Wikipedia in popular culture</a> and delete the two rather lengthy lists found there. While there may be consensus for deleting the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_in_popular_culture.html#Miscellaneous" title="Wikipedia in popular culture">Miscellaneous</a> section, I doubt I would get away with rming the first one which are "Landmark references." I'm not trying to make a "two wrongs make a right" arguement, i just want to show how editors tend to say, "Well it's Pokemon, and so if it's not highly important or ref-bloated we should get rid of it." The result is "cruft, cruft, cruft." How to improve: If you take a close look at Otto4711's arguements you can see that this list <i>could</i> be improved if anyone wanted to take the time to provide the importance of said pop culture references - the Wikpedia related article justifies many of it's inclusions because they are the first examples within a specific media (of course 3 of them could be rm for not fulfilling this criterion), this list could follow suit with many of the entries. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">ΖαππερΝαππερ</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappernapper_cf32.html" title="User talk:Zappernapper">Babel</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zappernapper_a171.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zappernapper">Alexandria</a></sub> 16:05, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think anyone would argue that "<a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinpokomon.html" title="Chinpokomon">Chinpokomon</a>" or "<a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirty_Minutes_over_Tokyo_cd9e.html" title="Thirty Minutes over Tokyo">Thirty Minutes over Tokyo</a>" aren't notable - of all of them, they do definitely deserve to be mentioned. <a href="../../../l/i/n/Ling-Ling_8cf3.html" title="Ling-Ling">Ling-Ling</a> too, perhaps, though <i><a href="../../../d/r/a/Drawn_Together_fd54.html" title="Drawn Together">Drawn Together</a></i> isn't as well-known as the others. But these references and the few others that are relatively important can be contained easily in the section in the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon.html#Cultural_references" title="Pokémon">section in the main Pokémon article</a> (as they already somewhat are). And while pointing a finger and yelling "CRUFT!" is hardly an argument in itself, it's an allegation that can't just be waved aside. It <i>is</i> undeniably crufty, but another, more important argument that I was trying to put forward (which may not have come through as well) is that because all of the pertinent information can fit easily on the main Pokémon page, this article is simply unnecessary. ~e.o.t.d~ (<a href="../../../e/y/e/User%7EEye.of.the.dragonfly_c6de.html" title="User:Eye.of.the.dragonfly">蜻蛉の目</a>•<a href="../../../e/y/e/User_talk%7EEye.of.the.dragonfly_9f7c.html" title="User talk:Eye.of.the.dragonfly">話す</a>•<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Eye.of.the.dragonfly_c220.html" title="Special:Contributions/Eye.of.the.dragonfly">貢献</a>) 18:48, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>i'm not trying to say that merely sourcing the list will make it better. We <i>should</i> be discriminating in what is kept in the article. As in the example below, <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kids_Next_Door_00a8.html" title="Kids Next Door">Kids Next Door</a> spoofs hardly seem notable enough as the Pokemon allusions constitute OR unless someone can find a source saying the creators intentionally did it, and even then - it's such a unconsquential aspect of the show that it's <i>still</i> non-notable. e.o.t.d. is of the opinion that all the appropriate references after being properly sourced and having their notability and relevance expanded upon, would still fit nicely into the Pokemon article as a section, i'm disinclined to agree, as i managed to figure about eight entries that are notable, probable enough to be sourceable, and relevant to either Pokemon itself, the real-world, or the medium it was presented in (i.e. the KND episodes wouldn't have been changed much by <i>not</i> including the Ash look-a-like, however the <i>Doctor Who</i> novel makes some significant commentary that affects the overall impression of the reading).

<li><b>Comment:</b> Looking at the log, it seems that the reason the last nomination was "no consensus" even with a decent number more "deletes" than "keeps" is the fact that the "deletes" gave hardly any support to their opinions. It's of course not required, but please try to say more than "CRUFT!" or "USELESS!"; giving some reasons will help keep another "no consensus" from happening. ~e.o.t.d~ (<a href="../../../e/y/e/User%7EEye.of.the.dragonfly_c6de.html" title="User:Eye.of.the.dragonfly">蜻蛉の目</a>•<a href="../../../e/y/e/User_talk%7EEye.of.the.dragonfly_9f7c.html" title="User talk:Eye.of.the.dragonfly">話す</a>•<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Eye.of.the.dragonfly_c220.html" title="Special:Contributions/Eye.of.the.dragonfly">貢献</a>) 23:26, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Northern Nevada International Center and Nevada World Trade Council, which have him on their Board of Directors, are fairly well-known organizations. He was elected unopposed to the office of General Improvement District Trustee of Verdi TV District in Nevada in the November 2006 US mid-term elections. His activities/efforts in the inter-faith dialogue in northern Nevada, diversity initiatives in Washoe County School District, leadership in various ethnic organizations, volunteership and public service in social/cultural/other organizations, etc., show that he must be included in the popular enclyclopedia like Wikipedia.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 75.14.205.200 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.14.205.200_9347.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.14.205.200">contribs</a>) 19:24, February 21, 2007.</small></p>

<p>Not an official stable for one thing. For another thing: the name of the team is speculation. I've seen no evidence TNA has called them that. WWE certainly never called it that. This is original research and crystal balling. Originally a prod was on it: and was removed with no reason. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 22:24, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> If as stated she exhibited work at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago that would be a good start toward notability, but I could not find it in the references. "Natasha Wheat" only gets 22 Google hits, most not about the subject of the article.

<p>A Junior High school teacher who ran in the primaries for a seat in the House a few years back, getting only 1.5% of the vote (that's in the <i>primary</i>, mind you). We don't have articles for similar "politicians" (to use the term in its broadest sense) apart from this one district election. This was nominated before <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Tom_Bemmes_1e29.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tom Bemmes">here</a>, narrowly surviving, much like <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Eric_Minamyer_c5fe.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Eric Minamyer">this guy</a>, before a further precedent against this type of article was set by the unanimous deletion at at the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Eric_Minamyer_%282nd_nomination%29_e04f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Eric Minamyer (2nd nomination)">second nomination)</a>. I can't see how this guy passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, his existence as a teacher is of substantially more consequence than his failed bid for office, and we don't have articles on teachers.</p>
<p>I am also nominating the following related pages:</p>

<li>Peter Fossett - similar case, but got a whopping 2.3%.</li>
<li>Jeff Sinnard - got 2% (268 votes)</li>

<p>The article seems to be about a nearly non-existent controversy. There are no calls or movements to change the date of Easter to a fixed date that I'VE ever seen, and I've been actively involved in church life, including liturgical reform, for a long time, now. And the article cites no sources indicating that there actually is such a movement. I think it may be the article creator's personal controversy. <a href="../../../c/f/o/User%7ECfortunato_1679.html" title="User:Cfortunato">Carlo</a> 21:54, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The Aleppo proposal mentioned certainly is a matter of record. Some of the other suggestions I haven't heard of but none would surprise me. With a rewrite this could be a very presentable article. -- <a href="../../../b/p/m/User%7EBpmullins_987c.html" title="User:Bpmullins">BPMullins</a> | <a href="../../../b/p/m/User_talk%7EBpmullins_8769.html" title="User talk:Bpmullins">Talk</a> 00:19, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But the Allepo proposal is a proposal to bring the Eastern and Western calendars together. It has nothing to with making Easter have a fixed, yearly calendar date, which is the main thrust of the article. Have there been any such serious proposals? <a href="../../../c/f/o/User%7ECfortunato_1679.html" title="User:Cfortunato">Carlo</a> 00:27, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is one of the topics in the article. With a rewrite the article can be more clearly about Easter date reform in general. <a href="http://www.smart.net/~mmontes/ec-cal.html" class="external text" title="http://www.smart.net/~mmontes/ec-cal.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a web page that states that John XXIII apparently had no problem with fixing Easter to a particular Sunday. The topic's larger than pinning Easter to a particular Gregorian calendar date. I'll add more references in a bit. -- <a href="../../../b/p/m/User%7EBpmullins_987c.html" title="User:Bpmullins">BPMullins</a> | <a href="../../../b/p/m/User_talk%7EBpmullins_8769.html" title="User talk:Bpmullins">Talk</a> 02:00, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> — It is principally a historical article, although it does not mention several notable attempts to reform the date of Easter, such as the British Easter Act of 1928 which placed Easter on the first Sunday after the second Saturday in April (still on the books, but requiring an Order in Council that is vetted by both houses of Parliament).<a href="http://www.phys.uu.nl/~vgent/easter/easter_text5a.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.phys.uu.nl/~vgent/easter/easter_text5a.htm" rel="nofollow">[68]</a><a href="http://www.phys.uu.nl/~vgent/easter/easter_text5b.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.phys.uu.nl/~vgent/easter/easter_text5b.htm" rel="nofollow">[69]</a> — <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Kress_19e1.html" title="User:Joe Kress">Joe Kress</a> 05:50, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Contested prod, though no reason was given when prod notice was removed. Article is about a Three Kingdoms battle that never happened in history, not even in the novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. It's only a stage of the game Dynasty Warriors 5, and the article appears to describe a player's progress in that stage. So in a historical perspective, this article is complete nonsense. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeadkid_dk_3237.html" title="User:Deadkid dk">_dk</a> 22:58, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi i'm the writer of the Ne'er-do-wells article and also the frontman for the band. What can the harm be in leaving this article on. We are trying to release an album but it isn't that easy. We've performed in a variety of locations and every time have recieved a great reception. Just because we haven't yet released an album doesn't mean we are not a band, Enter Shikari are yet to release an album aren't they? Why do they qualify as a band? One article on Wikipedia is a big thing for our band it however barely affects you. Please consider keeping this article on, i find it unfair that we are removed due to not having an album, we are trying and we need some kind of way to express our band over the internet. Wikipedia, myspace and youtube are the biggest ways. A myspace page is being set up, we have submitted an article for here and we are going to record us at out next performance. Thank you for your time.</p>

<dd>Hello... One of the most common arguments for keeping articles is that they "aren't harming anyone." Wikipedia is intended to be a serious encyclopedia with information that can be relied upon for accuracy and neutrality. It is not an advertising space for new bands, or for anything at all, so the issue is not about "harm" to individuals (articles rarely harm people, people with guns harm people) but about maintaining the quality of the site. The reason people <i>want</i> articles on Wikipedia is because they know the public uses it... but the public only uses it as long as they think they are getting good information. In other words, keeping articles that violate policies of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiablity</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> <i>do</i> harm the project, if not the people. By saying that Wikipedia is one of the "biggest ways" to get publicity shows that you may have some misunderstanding of the purpose of the site, and I hope I've been able to clarify this for you. For example, the <a href="../../../e/n/t/Enter_Shikari_8e8d.html" title="Enter Shikari">Enter Shikari</a> entry indicates that they've been around for a while, have been included in a number of public events and have received a number of awards. I hope your album does well... if it does you will certainly be notable enough for inclusion. That way the encyclopedia will have a record of your work for information (not publicity) purposes. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">◄</font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel">Zahakiel</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">►</font></a> 03:32, 20 February 2007 (UTC) - P.S.

<p>This is not a vanity article at all and yes it is kind of for publicity and i understand what's being said about it being a place for notified information. Based on the rules of wiki my article should indeed be removed, but why is there need to call me vain? I'm far from it as has been stated in the article i wrote where i wrote something along the lines of having a lack of talent. The band is more of a statement and an attempt to show people if they try they can achieve any goal we are just a bunch of guys who enjoy music and entertaining. We have performed in a variety of places in Middlesbrough/newcastle and areas around. We have performed as a warm up to the lostprophets when they came to Middlesbrough. And thanks for the compliment regarding our covers on youtube, we are branching away from covers, they were in our early days when we weren't as good. Again i'll ask if you can not delete this article as it is valid and accurate as i wrote it so it is accurate even if there isn't much proof. The line-up of the band has been the same for nearly a year, the reason we don't have a singer is because we all enjoy trying it and switch around singing our own songs. Thanks</p>
<p>Ne'er-do-wells is the band name it is grammatically correct and if it isn't we don't really care its the name of the band regardless.</p>
<p>What's wrong with saying 2007 looks to be a good year?</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Response</b> - Try not to take it personally... the term "vanity article" simply means an article placed here for publicity, which you admit is one of your reasons (if not the primary one) for posting the information. It doesn't <i>necessarily</i> mean the person posting it is vain. You've realized that Wikipedia's policies would work against the article's presence here, and the discussion in this AfD is probably going to reflect the desires of our regular contributors to keep the policies fair by applying them equally to every entry. Your article's information may be accurate, I don't doubt that it is, but the standard for a band's inclusion in the encyclopedia is pretty well defined. You can check out <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> if you're interested in the specifics. As far as, "What's wrong with saying 2007 looks to be a good year?" The policy I mentioned above, <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a>, prohibits articles (and the editors who make them) from making predictions about the future without a high level of proof. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">◄</font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel">Zahakiel</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">►</font></a> 19:41, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So when will the article be deleted?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The norm is five days for discussion from date of nomination and then if it is decided that deletion is the case it will be a couple of days after the close of the discussion. Or in plain English, any time after Friday the 23 depending on how busy the Admins are. See the bottom of this page <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> for the explanation of the process. - <a href="../../../x/2/0/User%7EX201_1eb7.html" title="User:X201">X201</a> 21:18, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Well, Its a brand just like <a href="../../../a/x/e/Axe_%28deodorant%29.html" title="Axe (deodorant)">Axe (deodorant)</a> etc. I think there might be wiki-users who find this interesting, like fans of David Beckham who didnt knew he had his own fragrance! Seb88 08:22, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. It's <b>not</b> a brand like <a href="../../../a/x/e/Axe_%28deodorant%29.html" title="Axe (deodorant)">Axe</a>, Axe has worldwide <a href="../../../n/a/m/Name_recognition.html" title="Name recognition">name recognition</a> and consequentially, notability. If you think <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Beckham_f822.html" title="David Beckham">David Beckham</a> fans would like to be aware of this, it <i>might</i> rate a sentence on his own page. <a href="../../../n/i/p/User%7ENipokNek_2558.html" title="User:NipokNek">NipokNek</a> 15:01, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yeah, Axe is a more "well-known" product. You're right about that! But I still think that this brand is notable enough to have its own article.. Seb88 16:48, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>But</b>, If its <b>completely</b> unacceptable to keep this article, would it then be possible for an admin to edit the original <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Beckham_f822.html" title="David Beckham">David Beckham</a> page and add a few sentences about this brand for me!<br />
I am, as a new member, unable to make any changes on the Beckham article so for that reason I'd be happy if someone else made it for me.. Just to make it clear, I <b>still</b> think this article is worth saving!! Seb88 16:48, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Emo poetry is especially melodic and lyrical, and is in some ways perhaps a type of "folk poetry" (hows that for a terrifying neologism).
