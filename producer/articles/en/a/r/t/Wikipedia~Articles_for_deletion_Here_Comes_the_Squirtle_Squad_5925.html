<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>).

</dl>
<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b> -- sorry to say, but unfortunately, large "group" AfDs like this tend to turn into a mess. It looks like there are strong camps in all areas -- merge, keep, and delete. If I happen to have missed a particularly strong consensus to delete any two or three of these pages, I'd recommend starting a second nomination for just those, linking to this one. Other than that, I'd recommend giving the mergists some time to do their work, and then starting smaller group (or even individual) AfD proceedings. The other trick is to put one through as a "tester" to establish a general consensus, before putting in the group. So again, rather than objecting to this close on my talk page, please feel free to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">head to deletion review</a> or start second noms for particularly problematic or other individual pages.

<p>There's a number of pokemon articles that say nothing except a plot summary (something just a one sentence long summary, as in the case of this squitle episode), an info box, and sometimes a cast list (=indiscriminate collection of information, what Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. We don't need 500+ pokemon episode articles (only a matter of time before someone makes an article similar to this one for each pokemon episode, not hard to do either) if all they're going to contain only plot summaries and an indiscriminate dump of cast information.</p>
<p>This isn't a nomination for deletion for all pokemon articles (just the ones listed here). Some, like <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_Soldier_Porygon_85dd.html" title="Electric Soldier Porygon">Electric_Soldier_Porygon</a>, are significant for good reason. And has an article that does have commentary and real life context. With information which can be verified and sourced (although it currently is not). However, there is no evidence that the 500 other pokemon articles will ever reach this stage.</p>
<p>Actually, it seems like there just isn't anything to say about them - For example, even the very first pokemon episode <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon%2C_I_Choose_You%21_ba6b.html" title="Pokémon, I Choose You!">Pokémon, I Choose You!</a>, which is probably the most famous episode (being the very first) is just a plot summary. Although a far longer plot summary (which isn't a good thing. A scene-by-scene synopsis is something to be avoided as per <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Television_episodes_d747.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes</a></p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with episode articles if they're good and well developed, but that isn't the case here. <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Television_episodes_d747.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes</a> says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Once there's enough independently verifiable information to do so, create articles on each season, or some other logical division, of the show.</i>"</dd>
<dd>"<i>Once there's enough independently verifiable information included about individual episodes, spin the information from episodes out into their own articles.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>There's no indication of there even being enough "independently verifiable information" to write articles on each season, let along articles for each episode. If people really have so much to write about, they should start with good season articles, (or articles for part of the season, so like episodes 1-20, season 1. since pokemon seasons are LONG), and then expand into episode articles only when there is more to say about an individual episode.</p>
<p>These are the articles i'm nominating:</p>

<p><b>note</b> - the Ice Cave and Holidy Jynx articles do contain a "contraversy" section.

<li>Excellent point. There's an ongoing effort to <b>merge</b> these episodes (save for possibly <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_Soldier_Porygon_85dd.html" title="Electric Soldier Porygon">Electric Soldier Porygon</a> into lists, such as <a href="../../../b/a/t/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon%7E_Battle_Frontier_episodes_f603.html" title="List of Pokémon: Battle Frontier episodes">List of Pokémon: Battle Frontier episodes</a>. This was a recent consensus reached at the <a href="../../../p/c/p/WP%7EPCP_c57f.html" title="WP:PCP">Pokémon Wikiproject</a>, so the merges aren't quite done yet. Unless someone has some great desire to overturn the consensus formed there, I suggest withdrawing this and helping with the merges. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 03:18, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Only for the TV shows where the episode articles contain only summaries. And when they can obviously be merged into season (or other logical divisions) of episode articles. Defintely not planning to nominate everything. For example, i'm certianly not planning to nominate <a href="../../../b/u/f/Category%7EBuffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_episodes_fe04.html" title="Category:Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes">Buffy episodes</a>. Since the articles defintely have more than just a summary (See <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welcome_to_the_Hellmouth_%28Buffy_episode%29_1b8b.html" title="Welcome to the Hellmouth (Buffy episode)">Welcome to the Hellmouth (Buffy episode)</a>, especially note the section on "Writing"). It's obvious someone's made an effort to actually write an <i>encyclopedic</i> article, rather than just an episode summary. They're all well organized, and the summaries themselves are actually good - as in they're detailed but not a dry scene-by-scene recall. With like...these pokemon episodes. I don't think people can even squeeze enough out of them to make decent <i>encyclopedic</i> season articles, let along encyclopedic epidosde articles. As for Star Trek, i'm not sure. I'm defintely planning to go in there and clean out the mass of <a href="../../../a/v/t/WP%7EAVTRIV_0d64.html" title="WP:AVTRIV">trivia</a> when i find spare time. As for actually nominating the articles for deletion, i am tempted to do so. They are also just a mass of summaries, although they are quite obviously a step up from the kind of articles in this nomination and in the 4400 episodes nomination. Using season articles for summaries of that size will cause article length problems. Don't suppose you could point me to something that explains where wikipedia stands with huge long detailed summaries that provide no commetary and otherwise encyclopedic information? --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 04:21, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep All</b> TV episode articles are acceptable for most series, and Pokemon is more notable than most. At least one of these has been up for deletion before (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ash_Catches_a_Pok%C3%A9mon_97e1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ash Catches a Pokémon">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ash Catches a Pokémon</a>) and the result was a near-unanimous consensus to keep. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 04:24, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete All</b> The Wikipedia can't possibly be expected to have separate articles for every single episode of every TV show ever made; it would be ridiculous (not to mention the amount of server space required). Thus, allowing these to exist sets this as a precedent. Only the most notable episodes (particulary of highly notable TV shows, think I Love Lucy, Happy Days, etc) should have their own articles. The fact that full episode guides exist for other shows (including Star Trek, which I am a fan of) does not mean that these articles should be kept, rather it indicates those articles should be deleted as well. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 05:30, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment on Possible Compromise</b> I was thinking, this is an issue that seems to pop up here rather often and needs to become better resolved. Perhaps, rather than a simple total deletion (which is what I currently support) what about having, for television shows with many existing articles on their individual episodes, a number of pages dedicated to each <i>season</i>, rather than one page that has all the summaries (which would be too bulky) or many individual pages for each episode (which is too much and rather impractical)? It seems having the summaries placed in articles that discusses the season they occured in as a whole would be preferable and a good way of compromising what seems to be the two dominant positions here, plus it would have the added benefit of providing context for individual episodes. I also believe, but am not sure, that this is how the articles for the show <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost.html" title="Lost">Lost</a> are set up. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 03:39, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>This discussion is about only the articles listed in this AfD. Bringing up other television articles is off point. No one is saying that (insert your favorite show) should not have articles, rather that there is a process by which we build those articles. It starts with an article for the show, if the show is notable enough then articles on the seasons of the show, IF the seasons article warrants spinning off individual episode articles then we do that. Please read <a href="../../../e/p/i/WP%7EEPISODE_008d.html" title="WP:EPISODE">WP:EPISODE</a> for a more detailed explanation. The articles in this AfD aren't even stubs they all have little beyond a 1 or 2 sentence plot summary. If and when the season articles are developed then we can create articles on the almost 500 episodes. L0b0t 17:03, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Case by case basis</b>; for those short, stubby ones; <b>merge and redirect</b> relevent info into a season summary.

<li><b>Keep or Merge</b> (case-by-case) - Many of the articles contain valid information; certainly those with a Controversy section, even if duplicated elsewhere, cannot be said to be "solely plot summaries." However, if the articles cannot be expanded sufficiently (for my suggested qualifications, more than about two paragraphs, or 12 sentences) it may be better to merge them into a more generalized article, such as a "Pokemon Season 1 Episodes" or similar. Please note that by "Merge" I do <b>not</b> mean deleting a certain portion of the article and moving the rest; rather, I mean taking the whole content of each article, as most of the articles are what could be described as the perfect size for sections of a multi-episode article. Additionally, I would like to point out that just because one episode has its own article doesn't mean that every episode needs its own article. While it may look good for the sake of uniformity, I think it is highly possible that out of Season X (or however you want to break it down) only two or three episodes will have enough important content to deserve their own article, which can be linked to from the main episode list. Finally, one more time, for emphasis: <b>no content should be deleted</b>. Moved, perhaps, but it should definitely be retained. -- <a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">Y|yukichigai</a> 21:42, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, episodes that deserve their own article for whatever unique reasons should get their own article. Notice how i have not simply listed <i>all</i> pokemon articles for deletion.
