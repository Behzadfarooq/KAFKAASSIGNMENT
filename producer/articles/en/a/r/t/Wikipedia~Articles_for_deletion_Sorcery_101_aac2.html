<p>Both the readers and The Author would like to know why it was suggested for deletion?</p>
<p>It doesn't fall into any category under the wikipedia Deletion Policy, so Why Has it been nominated? <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChurba_f97b.html" title="User:Churba">Churba</a> 05:50, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>According to the edit summary that added the deletion text, "nominated for deletion due to non-notability". I'm not sure I could agree with that since every other comic on KeenSpot has a page too, no matter how small. Maybe the content of the article needs refocused more towards a particular goal, but that's not qualification of a deletion in my eyes. --Zimzat 10:04, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The nomination was from a drive-by anon who didn't even bother to complete the AfD. This comic was picked up by <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a>, which is the major syndicate for webcomics, meeting <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> 3. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 12:03, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> 3 would require that <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a> be "both well known and independent of the creators." Keenspot is not well-known in any sense outside of certain segments of webcomic fandom. I've also seen it, perhaps incorrectly, referred to as a "collective," which would make it less than independent of its artists. As it was founded by webcomics artists, it is certainly not independent of every creator under its umbrella. Finally, we can't use a notability guideline as a dodge around official content policies like <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 15:31, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Keenspot is a syndicate, not a collective, so I won't accept the assertion it's not independent.

With the exception of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, I am not inclined to immediately delete an article on what I feel to be a notable subject simply because it hasn't yet evolved into a well-sourced one. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 16:10, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: First, we can't keep articles based on the idea that someday they may be covered by reliable sources; if we did we'd have to keep every article made up in school one day. Second, as I understand it, <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syndication.html" title="Syndication">syndication</a>, whether in print, television, radio or the web, involves licensing content to multiple providers. As Keenspot's goal is to "provid[e] one steady place for readers to find what we believe are some of the finest webcomics,"<a href="http://keenspot.com/companyinfo.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://keenspot.com/companyinfo.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and they "claim[] to be the largest publisher of <b>exclusive</b> webcomics,"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenspot" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenspot" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (emphasis mine) they sound like the exact opposite of a syndicate. As I said, I may have seen them incorrectly identified as a "collective," and it is entirely possible that they function as somewhat of an independent publisher to some or even many of their artists. They clearly aren't an independent publisher of all of their webcomics, however (take, for example, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Crosby_d655.html" title="Chris Crosby">Chris Crosby</a>'s webcomics), and they're certainly not "well known" in any general sense. If you have verifiable information on Keenspot's business practices and decision-making which suggests that they are in most cases or in this case independent of the artists they publish, then I'd be interested in seeing that. But, as it stands, I am unsure if they are "independent," I am quite sure they are not "well known," and in either case we can't write articles on topics (even allegedly well-known and independent ones) without verifiable information from reliable sources. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 17:08, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not advocating we keep every article. I think I've sent enough articles to AfD and prod to establish that. However, if I believe a subject is sufficiently important for an article, I'm not going to advocate its deletion simply because it's not dotted its Is and crossed its Ts. They are policies and guidelines, not dogma. As far as Keenspot is concerned, I really don't think it's necessary to rehash this argument every time one of its comics is nominated for deletion. Bring it up on <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> instead. From prior discussions held there it's my impression Keenspot <i>is</i> considered an indicator for item 3, but of course that can always change. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 19:37, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I know you're not advocating keeping every article; I just think that's what we open ourselves up to when we encourage an environment where we make judgments based on "I believe a subject is sufficiently important [and may someday be covered by reliabel sources]" rather than "reliable sources believe the subject is sufficiently important to cover." Requiring encyclopedia articles to be based on widely respected, fact-checked sources is fundamental to what we're doing. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 06:27, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Keenspot was developed as an alternative to the print comic syndicates. It's not the only one, but by far it's the most successful. For a webcomic to be invited by Keenspot, it has to have achieved a degree of success beforehand. Among webcomic artists, to be "spotted" is like being asked to join the big leagues. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 16:20, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Without a doubt. However, as in every medium, there are different levels of significance. While the likes of Megatokyo and Penny Arcade have little use for Keenspot, there's also the second tier who aren't so dismissive. I believe that second tier is Keenspot inclusive, and though they may not have the influence the biggest names do, they're considerably more important than the thousands on Comic Genesis, Smack Jeeves and the like that have yet to distinguish themselves. Now, maybe you feel we should only have articles on the most significant webcomics, but that's not a sentiment I can support. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 18:12, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The reason we don't delete every webcomic article is because notable webcomics have actually received sufficient external notice to ensure that they can be covered from a <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a> based on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a> information from <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>, without straying into <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> (those are links to our official content policies).

Yes, sources are still required, but they don't have to be as strict as in other subjects. This webcomic, like many others, is simply not notable enough to warrant an article about it. It has, however, been invited to a major webcomics collection that's invitation-only, and is featured today in the KeenSpot NewsBox (<a href="http://www.keenspot.com/data/news-sorcery101-aug2006.gif" class="external text" title="http://www.keenspot.com/data/news-sorcery101-aug2006.gif" rel="nofollow">direct link to image</a>).

<dd>I didn't mean that we should delete this page, it was a tongue-in-cheek comment. Obviously Shakespeare is more significant than a webcomic, and I was pointing out the lack of sources in the article.

<p>Comment: I really don't see a reason for this entry to be deleted. The webcomic in question is viewed by albiet a small fanbase, but a fanbasenonetheless. Other Keenspot artists have their comics listed, such as Clan of the Cats. And there is no controversy over that. If the question of if entry is purely vanity is really that much of a difference, multiple fans of the comic have already come to edit it and prove that it means something to them. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Tin-chan (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tin-chan_c534.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tin-chan">contribs</a>) 17:31, 10 August 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>If "a small fanbase" does not mean notability on Wikipedia, then how do you explain other such articles like "Yiff" which does not list it's references or sources. It's not to my taste, I find it abhorable, and yet it's still on wiki. And no one has disputed it yet. While a "small fanbase" means nothing to you, or many users who have posted their tastes on this discussion, it means something to a different group of people. Sorcery101 has multiple visitors and daily readers, and it's wikipedia article is satisfactory to the comic and said readership. Just because it doesn't suit someone else's tastes does not make it wrong. (As for Clan of the Cats, at least someone listed detail on the matter of what Chealsea's favorite ice cream flavor actually WAS.) If we didn't care about small fanbases, we wouldn't be arguing over them on wikipedia in the first place.

<dd>Notability is a highly relative issue. While an article in a national newspaper would make anything notable it is sadly not so with the media of the various subcultures. For example, While cart racing monthly may be "the" authority on cart racing among the cart racing subculture, it isn't to me ( I am no cart racer ). The same goes for webcomics. If you would judge the notability of wikipedia articles solely from the view of Your Average Idiot ( err.. Citizen )you could remove a sizable part of her content and whipe the list of webcomics ( nearly ) clean. -Arsenic- 21:48, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see no reason for this article to be deleted. It was apparently written entirely independently of the author of the comic (thus not Vanity), and I feel that just because some people haven't heard of the comic, or don't like it, that it should be considered "non-notable". The comic is well-written, has an interesting world-concept, and actually updates regularly. And while I may not be reputable, I am reliable and a third party (not that this is verifiable as I have no Wiki account as yet) and I read the comic regularly and appreciate that there is another perspective published here in Wiki.

<li>The words "invite," "commercial," and "syndicate" are not in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. If this were a not-for-profit webcomic on a free host like geocities yet it had some reliable sources concerning its impact or historical significance then we would keep it. This comic has not been the "subject of multiple non-trivial published works," has not "won a well known and independent award," and is not "distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators," so therefore it does not meet the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guideline, which can't supersede <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> anyway. . -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 06:07, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators</i> , <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a> does not own the comics it hosts, the authors have only signed a hosting contract which gives rights to <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a> to host, distribute, and advertise on it. Additional contracts may be signed giving exclusive merchandising rights to <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a> which require minimum schedules to keep. <a href="http://www.keenspot.com/news.html" class="external text" title="http://www.keenspot.com/news.html" rel="nofollow">News article on Keenspot listing Sorcery 101</a>, <a href="http://www.comic-con.org/cci/cci06_prog_fri.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.comic-con.org/cci/cci06_prog_fri.php" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Comic-con page listing date and time of announcements]. --<a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKisai_fcf1.html" title="User:Kisai">Kisai</a> 06:46, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't think we can consider this publisher to be "well known." Generally, when a well-known publisher publishes something, reliable sources notice. And again, the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guideline can't be stretched so far as to supersede <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 08:31, 18 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This publisher is well known. Keenspot has been at <a href="../../../c/o/m/ComicCon_f993.html" title="ComicCon">ComicCon</a> for numerous years, even hosting some of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_Genesis_e932.html" title="Comic Genesis">Comic Genesis</a> artists at certian events. It has it's own syndicated comic page that has been printed in the <a href="http://www.turlockjournal.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.turlockjournal.com/" rel="nofollow">Turlock Journal</a>, a Californian newspaper. Many Keenspot books have been published through <a href="http://plan9.org" class="external text" title="http://plan9.org" rel="nofollow">Plan 9 Publishing</a>. I know of no other way of verifying Keenspot's status other than talking to tens of thousands of people who attended <a href="../../../c/o/m/ComicCon_f993.html" title="ComicCon">ComicCon</a> and the 6000+ people who use their <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_Genesis_e932.html" title="Comic Genesis">Comic Genesis</a> service. (and yes, I do have a bias, being one of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_Genesis_e932.html" title="Comic Genesis">Comic Genesis</a> administrators and part of Keenspot Entertainment) -- <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7ESTrRedWolf_887a.html" title="User:STrRedWolf">STrRedWolf</a>
<ul>
<li>I do think your association with Keenspot is clouding your judgment. Outside of Keenspot, being printed in The Turlock Journal, a tiny twice-weekly newspaper with a circulation of 6,000, is not a sign of being "well known." By this measure, each and every one of the completley unkown comics published by my college newspaper is about 5-10 times as "well known" as these comics. If the only possible method of verifying some possible historical significance of this comic (Sorcery 101) is by talking with its small readership, then we don't have the reliable sources for an encyclopedia article. This is an encyclopedia, not a blog; we write about topics with reliable sources, not just things we find on the internet. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 20:17, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I do wish the same wikipedia editors that keep nominating webcomics indiscriminately for deletion would stick to their own <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and not keep using <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> as the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> for deletion. If <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is to be invoked to justify deletion of webcomic entries, then it should be invoked to delete every page in wikipedia as a whole, seeing how every suggestion of a verifiable third party presented gets refuted with another <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> argument discounting the verifiability. This is nonsense. I don't see anyone recommending copying or moving to comixpedia. The problem I see is the same people nominating webcomics for deletion are also in violation of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> everytime with comments like "death to webcomics!". How is it the same people are always nominating webcomics for deletion and the same people are voting for a delete all within a short period of time? Sorcery 101 is Keenspot, Keenspot picked up Sorcery 101 and announced it at ComicCon 2006, Comic-con is A big comicbook convention in the USA. --<a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKisai_fcf1.html" title="User:Kisai">Kisai</a> 21:55, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
