<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> all losers. Actually, let me expand on that: these articles should <i>never have been created in the first place</i>. Reality show contestants are <i>not</i> notable: once the show is over, even the winner usually retreats to the obscurity form which they came. One or two, such as <a href="../../../j/a/d/Jade_Goody_d2c9.html" title="Jade Goody">Jade Goody</a>, become famous-for-being-famous, but the vast majority were never heard of before, and are never heard of after. I favour a minimum twelve month embargo on creation of <i>any</i> article on a reality show or contestant - it's not like we need to scoop anybody. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG"><span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span></a> 23:39, 20 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course if you did that, you'ld have to do it for most other types of articles. At which point, you would defeat the entire concept of a wiki, which allows for us to be vastly more up-to-date than most other publications. If we thought it was ok to be a year out-of-date, then we wouldn't have a system of instant publication. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 09:44, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I don't think so. I don't believe more than a tiny minority of articles document current events. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 09:56, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, a pretty high perecentage of *new* articles, and recent edits to articles in general, relate to new events. That's a reason for having a wiki. If we didn't mind being out-of-date, then it would make far more sense for us to have a system where edits are reviewed, and not published to the public immedidately. Anyhow, an excellent example of us creating articles on the "recently notable" is our coverage of the Olympics. Every single day, many such bio articles are being made and/or substantially updated. I and many, other editors have made bio articles for people who weren't known widely until this month. Do you wish to impose a 12-month freeze on Olympic athletes as well? Perhaps, we shouldn't make bio articles on athletes, until they're proven to be famous long after the games are over? --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 10:17, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> <s>all these</s> those without clear outside notability; <b>keep and cleanup</b> Tammy Leitner per Colin Kimbrell, <b>no vote</b> on Famie and Vartner. As in previous AfDs, I don't think notability attaches to non-winning contestants on such shows, and I question whether even the winners are notable unless they go on to sell records which are certified gold, sign major-label record contracts, get featured on TV appearances <i>other than promo appearances on the same network</i>, or otherwise generate evidence of meeting WP standards. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 19:45, 21 February 2006 (UTC) <i>(changed vote <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 14:16, 24 February 2006 (UTC))</i>
<ul>
<li>Today we're talking about Survivor contestants, not Idol contestants. The fact you mentioned gold records, and major labels, suggests you didn't read the articles, and aren't familiar with the show. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 14:39, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

Zero or one person, if I understand correctly, has become famous for being a <i>Survivor</i> winner. Clear outside notability can come from hosting a cable TV program, or <i>recording a chart-topping album</i>, or many other things that have nothing to do with whether their insufficiently-notable reality-show appearance was on <i>Survivor</i> or <i>Pop Idol</i> or some other. Read better before you accuse others of not reading or not understanding. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 19:06, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Look, we both know you mixed up different types of shows (I note, you have no explanation for the double-mention of music-specific criteria). You wrote as if you were in an Idol (or other musical talent) contestant AFD. I don't consider it a personal attack to point out an obvious mix-up, because I welcome it when people point out an obvious mix-up, on my part. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 10:32, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Famie, Varner, and Leitner for achievements that are independent of Survivor (notable chefship, status as TV anchor, and <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmy_Award_4d8c.html" title="Emmy Award">Emmy Award</a>-winning journalism, respectively); <b>Merge</b> the others to the relevant season of the show. The cases for the first two are borderline, but Leitner should be an absolute slam-dunk thanks the award. Discussions like the ones above make me wonder whether people actually read the articles before voicing their opinions here. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 05:34, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This will sound strange: the fact each one is different, isn't a great reason to vote differently on each, in this case. It's a good reason to not have an AFD, and to just let individual editors do merge/redirects where appropriate, or improve individual articles where appropriate. I think a case could probably be made for redirecting all the articles, even Leitner in the *short* term. Once, they're in a better state, stand alone articles make sense for some (especially Leitner). Even Leitner is in a terrible undocumented/promo state at the moment. I think a basic issue with AFD, is we're voting based on one static point in time, but which articles should be stand-alone, and which should be merged/redirected is something subject to continuous/dynamic change. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 10:36, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> all per precedent for comparable people on national hit reality shows. Given the poor quality of these articles, a better approach is to put in a <b>redirect</b> for the time being, unless/untill somebody turns into a proper article. There's really no reason for deletion here. I judge contestants on shows, like I would lead actors on a hit drama. The fact they're on a reality show, doesn't make them less notable. This shouldn't be a vote on whether people thing reality shows should be deemed noteworthy. Its whether they've been widely found to be, by others. It seems people are voting to delete because they *wish* these people were not notable. The great advantage of a redirect, is it can be undone easily, when the article is improved (especially with new information about the person). That's a better approach, than people making new articles from scratch (with new AFDs), or going to DRV. This whole thing could be taken care of in five minutes, with one person doing some redirects. That seems much more efficient. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 09:36, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This one's pretty cut and dry if you ask me. Imagine, if you will, an actor who appears in one season of a hit television show. One of the top rated shows of that season. Would we allow an article on that actor? Of course we would. Well, <i>Survivor</i> is a top-rated show, and although it doesn't use actors, these folks are the "stars" of the show. -- <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterHand_55c4.html" title="User:MisterHand">MisterHand</a> 15:02, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Reality show contestants aren't actors, but as particpants or contestants that undertake tasks (such as surviving or participating in activities) or answering questions. It's just like a game show, a large majority of those contestants fade back into obscurity once the show is over. Some may go on to be notable after the show such as <a href="../../../a/m/i/Ami_Cusack_17bb.html" title="Ami Cusack">Ami Cusack</a> or <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Hasselbeck_3176.html" title="Elizabeth Hasselbeck">Elizabeth Hasselbeck</a>. But the rest of them do not, thus not meeting <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> standards. <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnzy_60da.html" title="User:Arnzy">-- Arnzy</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/n/User_talk%7EArnzy_d126.html" title="User talk:Arnzy">Talk</a> 15:22, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>They are not just contestants, they are <i>personalities</i>. Many of these shows, <i>Survivor</i> included, has a full story arc based on the behavior of the contestants between tasks. It's a lot different than appearing on a game show for 30 minutes and answering quiz questions. Many actors fade into obscurity after their show goes off the air as well. Should we delete their articles? Assuming NPOV, we need to treat these contestants the same way we'd treat an actor on a similarly-rated show. -- <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterHand_55c4.html" title="User:MisterHand">MisterHand</a> 15:56, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>About 75% of "celebrities" these days would not be picked out from a line-up containing them and five holes in the ground, but that's an aside. There was a debate on failed political candidates a while back, and many people expressed the view that (a) they weren't notable before; (b) the primary source of information on them during their period in the spotlight is <i>themselves</i>, therefore not neutrsal; (c) after falling back to obscurity no further verifiable data is available. So you have an article which says in essence: "in 2006 X said this about him/herself and did this. X is now believed to be selling insurance in Mudflat, Missouri". Why not just embargo the thing for a year, come back and see if any of them turn out to be <a href="../../../j/a/d/Jade_Goody_d2c9.html" title="Jade Goody">Jade Goody</a> (i.e. famous for being famous) and how many were merely data points for the Warhol hypothesis? Trust me, there is no shortage of genuinely encyclopaedic topics requiring work! <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 22:28, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The "genuinely encyclopedic topics" is a non-argument if you ask me. It's not an either/or proposition. It's not as if the people editing articles about <i>Survivor</i> contestants are taking time that they might otherwise be using to write about Russian literature (or whatever topics you might find "worthy"). Really, this whole thing smacks of elitism to me...people who don't care for unscripted television deleting articles because they aren't personally interesting to <i>them</i>. I don't understand why a different standard is held for actors who appear on scripted series who get similar ratings...many of them are nobodies who become notable because of their appearance on those shows (for instance, <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangeline_Lily_d1e0.html" title="Evangeline Lily">Evangeline Lily</a>. -- <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterHand_55c4.html" title="User:MisterHand">MisterHand</a> 00:25, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Question: I understand the reasons for not wanting a stand-alone article on some of these people, given the poor state of content today. So, I would like to ask the delete voters (as opposed to merge/redirects) why they prefer deletion (with permanent removal of content) over merge/redirect. We'll continue to have content written about all of them in the Survivor/season article, so why not redirect readers to this content? I think the Emmy case highlights the danger of deletion, since we could have lost that information, if there'ld have been a delete (it wasn't in the surivior article, as it wasn't about the show specifically). A redirect doesn't destroy such information, and allows it to be used later in a spun-off article. It's worth noting, that we often do the merge/redirect for failed political candidates. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 01:26, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
