<li><b>Delete</b> if nominator provides evidence of a well-established consensus against such an article on the talk page.

<li><s>Ok...here's one, (I am only including the opinions of serious editors to the page, it attracks a lot of POV spam and such from random anons. Also, its not like eveyone lines up after each comment and says, "I agree" or I disagree".) Actually, we would delete such an article since it is a POV fork. The point is that the Armenian genocide is hardly contested outside Turkey and widely accepted as a historical fact. Immediately after the genocide and more recently it is partially accepted in Turkey too. Both the history of the genocide and the fact that many Turks and few others have reservations is well covered in the article. Therefor it is NPOV. We also cover the recent recognition of the genocide in Turkey, but are still weak on its early recognition. gidonb 22:51, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</s></li>

<li><b>Very Weak Keep</b> Upon further reflection, this person is as notable as many others that are allowed to remain on WP, the bar seems pretty low. He does have some articles as a principal investigator (which come up in a medline search) in top scientific journals. While I still think he is not nearly as notable as many other Neuroscientists who are not in WP, I guess this is not a good reason to delete him, although the arguments for keeping him are pretty weak as well. So I have changed my vote. That being said there is very little in the article to reflect his notability, and perhaps the article could be improved to show why he is more notable than the avrage assistant professor. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 02:15, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Because the already listed credentials and bibliography are sufficient, and should be seen as sufficient. As for civility, too many AfD discussions, especially about academics and writers, are just cesspools of derogatory comments about subjects and authors of articles that are labelled, often incorrectly, as "vanity" (even though the relevant policy is quite specific that "vanity" is not a grounds for deletion). The obsession with deleting non-celebrity biographies is extremely damaging to Wikipedia and to its reputation. The same editors turn up, over and over, in these discussions, sometimes even admitting they don't read the articles they vote on. If you look through the discussions and see how the misbehavior is unchanging, you'd come to the conclusion that "aggressive ignorance" and "irresponsible" are relatively mild, and entirely accurate, comments. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 20:14, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

If you look at his publication record you will see that he is never the <i>last</i> author. In scientific publications the last author is the principal investigator in a study, the first is the one that does the actual lab work, and this could be a graduate student or postdoc. The subject of this article does not have any more publications that the average Assistant Professor and is not notable within his field. I'm not saying he's not talented or smart, just not notable enough to merit an article.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I have no particular opinion about this article since I don't know much about voting systems. When I closed the first AFD as a "move" it was not due to aristocratic arrogance, but because Meegs presenting some reasonable arguments and evidence of the system being mentioned separately in a scientific paper. These arguments were, I felt, unrebutted, and moving this to the term used in that paper would satisfy some of the objections regarding the neologistic nature of the title. Such comments and discussion outweigh the pure vote count. The guideline is "when in doubt, don't delete". If it should have been deleted after all it can be renominated like here. Now, I see that Meegs no longer has voted keep because of the article's quality, so perhaps a consensus can develop this time around. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 09:28, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>With a low Google yield for "black eyed kids", this appears very strongly to be a neologism. Is it in <i>some</i> use? Yes. However, the term is not widespread by any means. Are there notable cultural uses of kids with blackened eyes (i.e., the eye itself is all black)? Sure, there are plenty of scary movies that might use that effect, but they're not referred to collectively as such in any of those films, and cataloguing them and trying to make blanket statements about them is rather original-researchy, IMHO. <b>Delete</b>. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a> (<a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JDoorjam_8460.html" title="Special:Contributions/JDoorjam">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Delete,</b> as not sufficiently encyclopedic. According to a page on about.com, this is a reference to one of Art Bell's stories of the paranormal.

<li><b>Comment</b> One of the biggest problems I have with this article is that it is not written as being about a piece of longstanding folklore (which is not clear that it is), but as undeniable fact. This is perhaps worse than writing about other fictions as fact, since the reader cannot easily understand it as being about a tv show or a book. It's in entirely the wrong tone for an encyclopedia article, and I don't believe with this particular article that can be easily fixed, from where it is now. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a><a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">emi</font></a> 16:35, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I noticed many people speculating that this is indeed not fact but folklore - however from the various different sources and experiences it is as "factual" as any other paranormal phenomenon i.e. Chupacabras and Ghosts. Therefore it is not only part of folklore and legend but a rather recent form of paranormal phenomena which should be taken into account. Regardless whether you believe in it or not that is not what is up for debate. It is definitely verifiable as someone earlier stated Art Bell and the other sites mentioned. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 03:47, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Why bother to expand this stub when there is already a great start to the topic mentioned here even though the page does not use the title of the topic but of the title of the area where the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Bogside_9d52.html" title="Battle of the Bogside">Battle of the Bogside</a> took place?

<dd><b>Keep</b> For now, I suggest keep; it's got some summaries of stuff I have seen elsewhere in depth in physics literature, and is a good overview for aspects of the problems with the standard model. I think it appears to be straddling the line out towards original research, but isn't clearly over it. It clearly needs references, some cleanup, and to be made more encyclopedic in sections. But those are cleanups, not AfD justification. AfD is not a substitute for cleanup tags. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 08:28, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is certainly not original research! It is a summary of well known ideas about physics beyond the standard model. There is also nothing faulty about the article name at all. It is good to see professional physicists taking the time to write articles here at wikipedia. We don't need to boot them out by removing their articles here. This article fits well into the category of articles on fundamental physics here in wikipedia. An article of this sort was actually needed. It's a bit technical, but this article will be linked from articles about the standard model, supersymmetry etc. to give the motivatons for physics beyond the standard model. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Iblis_817f.html" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> 00:09, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't mean to be difficult, but I'm not sure you do. "unique" Google hits are a nebulous concept, and of little to no value in judging the notability of a given topic much of the time. While <i>very</i> low or <i>very</i> high numbers might be meaningful, midrange numbers just don't tell you much. They absolutely <i>don't</i> mean that all results other than that number are duplicates or repeats. Anyway, I'm sorry if my original reply was terse, but nominations based on "unique" Google hits are one of my pet peeves&#160;:) I hope this clarifies my position. — <b><a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_9077.html" title="User:Adrian"><font color="#000000">A</font></a></b><font color="#646060">drian</font> <b><a href="../../../a/d/r/User_talk%7EAdrian_59cc.html" title="User talk:Adrian"><font color="#000000">L</font></a></b><font color="#646060">amo</font> <b><font color="#F660AB">··</font></b> 08:42, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

Are we going to copy and rebuild the WOTC online Magic Card database on Wikipedia, diversified out with a little fan speculation and some material coped from copyright articles on the WOTC website? With thousands (close to ten thousand) of cards printed since the game start in 1992, you better start composing those article now. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 09:17, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There was a <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Julian_Barendse_ee40.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Julian Barendse">VfD vote</a> last June, which resulted in a keep vote. Now the VSU bill has passed, it might be time to review this, but Barendse seems to be far more notable than Crawford. It's not just about what position you hold, it's about what you do in office. Crawford didn't do anything worth noting on Wikipedia; Barendse shaped a major debate. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harr</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">o</font></a><b><a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarro5_1808.html" title="User talk:Harro5">5</a></b> 09:54, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. There is a huge interest in roads, motorways and service stations in Great Britain and several organisations, publications and internet sites related to them. It is not my particular area of interest, but I am very aware of it. This article should be allowed to grow. A quick Google throws up several internet motorway services sites which mention Tibshelf.

<p>This article has no precedent for earlier elections, but more importantly there are more convienient ways for this information to be collated. The existing election "main page" and Constituencies in the next UK general election article bring together the information attempted to be listed here. This list is nowhere near complete, and seems unlikey to be adequately completed without massive duplication of information on individual constituency pages. <b>Delete</b> on the grounds of listing information which can be adequately covered on existing articles. <a href="../../../d/o/k/User%7EDoktorbuk_af25.html" title="User:Doktorbuk">doktorb</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/k/User_talk%7EDoktorbuk_4b6f.html" title="User talk:Doktorbuk">words</a> 08:25, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I agree but the UK system means, in over 600 constituencies, over 3,300 candidates from an array of parties. This table has never been attempted before and I wonder if it the potential for duplication and inaccurate information means it would be acutally easier to keep the information in the current articles rather than this.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm admitedly ignorant to UK electoral process, and would welcome suggestion from anyone more familiar. Perhaps there's a way to divide this regionally.

<li><b>Comment</b>. You could possibly have it organised on the grounds of Government Office Regions for England and for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as well as constituencies.

Maybe it's notable by now (after three months "out there") but maybe it's not. Either way this seems to me to need an AfD decision to avoid being speedied as a re-creation of previously deleted content. My personal view is that individual Flash movies are not notable except in extraordinary circumstances, but there you go. I'm also just the <i>teensiest</i> bit fed up with content being endlessly re-created until eventually it gets kept; for some reason this content is almost always related to some internet fad or aparent neologism. Yet more proof, in my mind, that we should not even try to document anything until at least a year after it happens, to allow a proper perspective to develop. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 09:42, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Does it matter what its made in? Is an artist who uses a single brush any worse than one who uses 20 different types? 26 comics have been released, one a week, and there are plenty more to come. Sure I could release another 15 now, but the whole "1 comic a week" system would break down don't you think? Everything starts somewhere. LoudHoward 11:10, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is quoted from <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_FAQ_fe96.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright FAQ">Wikipedia:Copyright FAQ</a>: "Generally, a summary (or analysis) of something is not a derivative work, unless it reproduces the original in great detail, at which point it becomes an abridgement and not a summary".

<li>You can use Wikipedia as something other than a mirror for a webpage. Use multiple sources, and don't copy anything. Summarize.

<li><b>Reluctant Delete (Or Perhaps a FIX)</b> I hate to say it, but it seems that this is original research.

Ideally Anthropogeology can also be edited, but I can do that at another time, so delete it if you wish.

<li><b>Not Delete</b> the updated and edited version of universal questions, or perrenial questions because it is another common idea for many famous philosophers, and it would be wrong for the Wikipedians to completely dismiss this ancient concept that was debated for thousands of years.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosephprymak_1011.html" title="User:Josephprymak">Josephprymak</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosephprymak_3565.html" title="User talk:Josephprymak">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josephprymak_d455.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josephprymak">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: It is very important to note that the above votes for deletion are not specific about what should be deleted and there are no good reasons for why exactly. Three distinct topics were lumped together. This is an improper procedure for deleting the hard work of other wikipedians and academics. My wife is also an editor, along with friends at many universities, and they would defend me, and a few have helped to edit some of this work. There really are no clear explanations for why each distinct topic should be deleted. Please do not take this personally. I am only trying to defend the writings of many famous philosophers whose books have been passed along by many humans who saw something very worthy in their ideas. This is a fact that cannot be denied. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosephprymak_1011.html" title="User:Josephprymak">joseph</a> 05:13, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I can also list many others who defend these ideas if you need more humans to explain why. I hope that we gave some satisfactory reasons, and that these alone are sufficient instead of a majority rules situation, which is against the Wikipedian rules. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosephprymak_1011.html" title="User:Josephprymak">Josephprymak</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosephprymak_3565.html" title="User talk:Josephprymak">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josephprymak_d455.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josephprymak">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Thanks for your considerate reply. However, the first articles in particular still read like a slightly confusing <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">personal essay</a> to me, and not like an encyclopedia article. And Anthropogeology still lacks any sources to indicate that anyone except you uses this term, so it also looks like <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. While we're on procedure, please also note that it is considered bad form to change one's previous comments; if any amendments are necessary, it is usual to strikethrough the old text <strike>like this</strike> and append any necessary corrections as a new comment.

<dd>No offense, but you killed your argument yourself when you said that it is important to [sic] "me and my wife." (in other words, it has to be important to a far FAR greater amount of people) The below user said it all with its low Alexa rating - if it is related to this site it needs to be Wikipedia:HowTo (in other words, in the Wikipedia, not the article space).

<dd>If McElwain is notable, I think it's probably more for his work with languages.

The top-ranked site is the most popular <i>among Yahoo! users</i> and only <i>among the sites listed in that category of the directory,</i> and it doesn't indicate how popular the most popular site actually is.

<li>Since his book either is academic or has academic pretensions, its low Amazon rating is of no interest to me whatever. (For that matter, even if it had no academic pretensions, a low Amazon rating might not worry me.) Whoever it was that wrote the nominal article about it clearly put no effort into the article; a small and perhaps inadequate amount of my own effort failed to turn up anything about it. Have it redirect to McElwain, at least until somebody can be bothered to write an intelligent short article about it. Even though McElwain is merely a real-life human who has written published books (hardly a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Trek_Planets_7fa1.html" title="List of Star Trek Planets">matter of indisputable cognointellectual significance to millions of right-thinking Wikipedia users</a>), his existence seems verifiable and of some note.

<p>The term is a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> and the content found in the article is original research, and other content information which is blatently fabricated (and unssubstanciated in the case of Chile, by its census figures).

<p>In regards to <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chile.html" title="Chile">Chile</a> being a part of the so-called "Euro America", that nation is overwhealmingly mestizo (93%) and conforms a part of the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Cone_7ad8.html" title="Southern Cone">Southern Cone</a> in geography and politics, not by demographic or cultural affinity with either Argentina, Uruguay or southern Brazil.

<p>Then we have the contention of the "America" of "Euro <u>America</u>".

<li><b>Comment</b> - Thanks sandstein, this though raises a problem, even though the authorship of the text is in question, the fact that these two muslim centers and who knows where else, may have more than 5000 parishiners sp? would that qualify. I don't know, when I talked to the guy, he was suprised like "online encyclopedia, what?" as if he would characterize himself as non-notable. I called back there and he is not there, apparantly he travels during these muslim calendar months to different mosques. Its seems to me like he's just not there as far as notability, we've had to search too hard to find evidence. Based on all this I think its better to delete it. 12:10, 9 March 2006 (UTC) ~~~~ This comment was made by User:206.210.225.131</li>

<p>An entirely false premise from the outset. It holds that any neologism is invalid (or a more commonly cited line of reasoning, that any additions to the collective phraseology are somehow self aggrandizing in nature and without applicable merit.)</p>
<p>Exburb is an entirely valid phrase labeling a structure of pattern migration <b>that didn’t exist until recently</b>. Furthermore, it’s status as a neologism is entirely reliant on ones own involvement in the relevant academic pantheons. Those involved in urban planning or the various human sciences are well aware of the term in spite of it’s relative obscurity amongst the public at large.</p>
<p>If exburb is to be deleted, than so shall be exurb, one of the most commonly cited components of the centricity of dwelling patterns. Wikipedia has the ability to remain on the cutting edge of the collective lexicon by virtue of it's open addition procedures.</p>
<p>Your position is akin to a linguistic xenophobia that maintains that anything new must be invalid by virtue of being new. While it may be new to you (and shockingly, Wikipedia too) it isn't new amongst those who are involved with the study of such things.</p>
<p>I agree that in many cases, neologisms are invalid. To wit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shizzle" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shizzle" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shizzle</a></p>

<p>I'll refrain from casting my own vote since i'm the one who penned the article and it must be obvious as to where I stand.</p>
<p>I wish I made it up. If I did, I would probably own the domain for it (which I just checked, and is taken by someone). To say that exburb overlaps with exurb is akin to saying that tread and retread are the same thing, or anything else where the basic logical construct is altered by virtue of a letter or a prefix is the same as it's parent phrase.</p>
<p>The specificity of exburb in no way negates it's applicability or validity. I'm sure there are a panoply of medical terms on wikipedia that you or I wouldn't know from a hole in the ground yet to that particular community, the're as valid as a page on the Boston Tea Party might be to a historian. You cannot on one hand cite the reference to a neologism (exurb) in support of your claim for deletion yet come to defense of said neologism when the premise of your entire point is that any neologisms that you have yet to hear of must be invalid. As I maintained earlier. If exburb goes, than so shall exurb.</p>
<p>Exburbian living is particularly common in the beltway. Many formerly exburban communities (like closet communities in New York City) have since evolved into bona fide exurbs or even suburbs. Human migration is one of the most fluid and constantly changing things, and as such, the phraseology might take a little time before it leaves the confines of academia into the common lexicon.</p>
<p>I understand that most people don't study planning just as I know nothing about video games or those Asian Cartoon things. If someone were to post a phrase native to those areas of interest, if I were the sort who were inclined to vote for deletion for anything that I didn't understand, I might take such a position too.</p>
<p>Let it be known that taking such a position is incorrect and if that thinking (I'll refrain from calling it "logic" as "logic" it ain't) were applied universally across this site, about 3/4 of it would be gone.</p>

<li><b>Reply</b>: Tell ya what. Since you feel bold enough and consider yourself sufficiently qualified to not only "comment" but vote for actual deletion, then i'll post a simple challenge. Everyone has a college of some kind local to them. Most of these have a Human Studies department, of which there will often times be a planning or urban studies professor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Call him up and ask him or her what's a commonly used phrase to the communities that are outer lying to the exurbs yet still service the central metro area.</p>
<p>This isn't a matter of "research" as there isn't anything here that's quantifiable no more than you could justify the shizzle other than by abstract reference. The word exburb is indeed a recent addition to the lexicon in spite of you personally being out of the loop. The point of contention here is the validity of said word. You are saying it's invalid. I would ask what field you work that affords you a perspective into the common phraseology used daily by the people who study this stuff day in and day out?</p>
<p>There is nothing more offensive than getting advice on field-specific linguistics or phrases by an IT guy or a video game programmer who maybe took a relevant one credit class in college 6 or 7 years ago.</p>
<p>My desire to "convince" someone like you is about nil. You have already displayed your ignorance by virtue of your position, thus I have no desire to educate ignorant people. I spend too many hours during the work day doing that to waste my time with it here.</p>
<p>The internet allows you the oppurtunity to naysay by virtue of casting a vote for deletion. It allows small and underqualified people "the power" to have a voice even though their qualifications to speak are none. Your qualifications to comment here (I would wager) are non-existant. You used a flimsy, blanket logical premise and applied it incorerctly to this word.</p>
<p>In short, we have is a petty and ignorant language xenophobe. THAT is not the wiki concept.</p>
<p>With that said, I would like to vote for <b>deletion</b> as well and it's my article.</p>
<p>This whole Wiki concept, while very clever, fails in it's most essential precepts. You cannot have valid information without vetting, but vetting isn't a matter of "public vote". It's peer review. You cannot allow unqualified individuals to impact those who are qualified just because they can adfford a computer and an internet connection and "have an opinion". Valid information comes from field-specific men and women who study and research the topic as a matter of their lifes work and is in turn reviewed by their peers in the same field. It is not a matter of "consensus" nor is it a matter of "public opinion".</p>
<p>What we have here is akin to the "internet public" voting on the techniques a doctor might use for a heart surgery. Anyone can vote, majority opinions might go one way or another, but few are qualified to comment in spite of their seemingly endless desire to do so.</p>

I do regularly steal a colleagues quarterly copy of JAPA, and I can't source exurb or ex<b>b</b>urb in that either. The ability or lack thereof to cite a peripheral source when the scope is limited to a single magazine is fairly absurd.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am quite confident that the "exburb" concept is very regional in nature, existing only in areas where the demography affords it an opportunity to exist, thus a planner from an area without any exburbs to speak of might not be up on the cutting edge of the colloquy. For example, you won't find any "exburbs" in areas that are suburbanized 100 miles out from the main urban center. They exist in some Metro area corridors where the transit times are within reason. Jacksonville, Florida is a community well known for "exoburbs"- suburbs of the exburbs- as is Atlanta Georgia. There are quite a few in Texas as well. Of course, now everyone who lives in Florida, Texas or Georgia will confidently chime in and say that at their job as a dump truck operator, they've never heard the word "exoburb" before.</p>
<p>As an aside, you work in the field of land use planning? I have colleagues all around the country in that field. Might I ask what area you are in? I knew it was only a matter of time before someone chimed in claiming to be in the field yet disagreed with the term. Enter the basic invalidity of the "internet expert".</p>

<li>I figured it was a regional thing.

If this concept can be cited to a reliable source then it will probably get kept. If not, it will probably get deleted. The deletion is not forever, just until it can cited and meet Wikipedia's guidelines.

<li><b>Reply To Maclean</b>: I'm actually very much OK with the article being deleted as I know that in due time, it will be back. I am correct about "exburb" today just as I will be when it returns, whenever it may be. Unfortunately, when someone else makes an entry for it, there is no doubt in my mind it will face a similar degree of unfounded opposition (as there are always nay-sayers for anything, no matter how valid, and they're far more common than the truly qualified) I now understand that the concept of this site is <b>not</b> to remain on the cutting edge of anything, but rather to catalogue things that can be quantified with a certain threshold of google hits, or, as "common knowledge" with a great emphasis on "common". We aren't talking about original research here with the word exburb. It's a simple addition to the lexicon that is unknown by more people than there are those who know it. I guess this entry and it's inclusion or deletion really comes down to the most fundamental philosophy of this website. But hey, look on the bright side. At least we all have a shizzle entry to reference! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.26.19.116 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.26.19.116.html" title="User talk:24.26.19.116">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.26.19.116_1e86.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.26.19.116">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Reply To JDoorjam</b>: Your own position keeps shifting.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, your case for deletion had to do with anything you classify as a neologism is invalid by sole virtue of being a neologism. Now, well, golly, neologisms are valid so long as they can be sourced through a certain degree of google hits. The basic logic (laugh) of your position is that validity is predicated on google hits which is just plain dumb. Google is no friend to regional specificity, nor highly specific topical matters. For example, a regional phrase for a touchdown scored at the Meadowlands arena is "Stomping on Hoffa" derived from the urban myth that the missing body of Jimmy Hoffa is supposedly encased in the end zone at that arena. Would you believe that not a SINGLE google hit came up for "Stomping On Hoffa", "Stompin On Hoffa" Stepping On Hoffa" or any variants thereof. In spite of googles inability to catalogue this regional colloquialism, it's heard about every ten seconds in that area when a game is being played. An entirely valid regional "saying", not one single google hit. I am sorry but your case for deletion is very, very weak. It basically holds that anything new is invalid so long as you personally haven’t heard of it or it doesn’t meet a certain threshold of google hits. This site is not an extension of google. It’s a consortium of knowledge from many different spectrums, including those that you don’t know or understand.</p>
<ul>
<li>So what you're asking is that we have to swallow anything you give us just because you say it's notable? In elementary school I learned to cite sources when I wrote papers, in order to prove that what I was writing was not made up and it was not being copied directly from another source. The same concepts apply here. I can make anything notable if all I have to do is to say it's notable. Nobody is buying your latest "logical" arguments, which you keep making after you've already said you wanted this deleted.</li>

<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidsolomon_2a67.html" title="User:Davidsolomon">Davidsolomon</a> 6 March 2006:</p>
<p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>I have exhaustively read the <a href="../../../k/n/i/Talk%7EKnights_Templar_%28military_order%29_72d0.html" title="Talk:Knights Templar (military order)">Talk:Knights Templar (military order)</a> page, the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Knights_Templar_0eb2.html" title="History of the Knights Templar">History of the Knights Templar</a> section, the <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knights_Templar_in_England_abaf.html" title="Knights Templar in England">Knights Templar in England</a> page and other articles around the subject area as well and frankly there is a lot missing. Why is nobody interested in the Templars in England, or the post-disbandment history of the men in the Order there?</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knights_Templar_in_England_abaf.html" title="Knights Templar in England">Knights Templar in England</a> page makes no reference of Baldock or its County, Hertfordshire whatsoever! That is where the Templars had their HQ between 1199 and 1254!! They founded the town and gave it its name!! Other Templar locations still exist in Hertfordshire, such as Hitchin and Hertford Castle (where Templars from Temple Dinsley - ALSO IN HERTFORDSHIRE - were locked up during the persecution. How can any serious page on the Templars, let alone the Templars in England, exclude this factual historical information? Some Templar historians seem to be terrified of Hertfordshire because they know that some people believe the Templars are still there.</p>
<p>Sorry for the typos, I only just created the article and I have not yet finished editing it (in face the drastic response to it may be a little premature!)</p>
<p>I created this article because there is not a single word elsewhere about the Knights Templar after the official disbandment in 1312. There is information about the Freemasonic Knights Templar, but they have no connection with the original Order whatsoever. In fact the only basis for a connection between the two is that somebody once claimed that crusaders formed Freemasonry to make sure they could tell the difference between themselves and the local Muslim population!</p>
<p>Where else in this entire encyclopedia is there information about what happened to the Templars who were not killed (only a tiny minority were killed.)</p>
<p>Is there no reasonable reference to legend anywhere else in this encyclopedia? I see mention of the Holy Grail in other articles but nobody wants to delete them. The Templars are positively steeped in myth and legend as I have pointed out and no piece on the Templars is complete without mention of some of the main legends that surround them.</p>
<p>I've only used solid information and I've also included my sources so I don't see the problem.</p>
<p>I urge you not to delete or make drastic changes to this article because it contains important information - with sources - that is not included anywhere else. That is why I spent so many hours creating the article!</p>
<p>Where else is there material on the Templars in England (the last place they went unpersecuted and the country that bears their flag as its own)? Where else is there information about what happened to the men of the Temple after the persecution began?</p>
<p>Please do not ignore the research of experts with specialist local knowledge like Helen Nicholson, Sylvia P. Beamon and F. M Page simply because it does not fit the usual brand of Templar material, which deliberately avoids the subject of the activities of Templar men after the Order ceased to exist. The men themselves did not spontaneously cease to exist after 1312 and indeed the activities of Templar fugitives after 1312, including the construction of Royston Cave, are fascinating. So why do many historians fearfully ignore them?! These are not modern Freemasonic Templars studying the Order from the United States.</p>
<p>The experts I invoke are people who live and work in towns like Baldock, towns founded by the Templars. These experts have studied the structures the Templars built after the dissolution and some of them indeed have had contact with people today who are involved with the genuine underground Templar order that continued directly from the original. Why does this create so much fear? Perhaps it is because in a cosy, neat and tidy world, if somebody important says, "your organisation no longer exists" that is the final word on the matter. But what if the people concerned don't share that view? What if they still consider themselves a part of something?</p>
<p>Removing or seriously altering this article will denude and rob this encyclopedia of information on a subject that appeals to a great many people. And the legends surrounding it only add to its appeal.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading my response.</p>
<p>God bless. (Posted by DavidSolomon)</p>

If anyone saw what was formerly posted here, it was an error.</p>
<p>If I am not mistaken, several local Federation Lotball groups may be found in recreational societies and intermural programs found in the the Hudson Valley Region of New York, and these groups are rapidly expanding.</p>

<p>Lotball is an entirely valid sport. I would know, being a member of the Lotball Regulatory Commission (LRC). I can personally vouch for lotball's existence as a completely real and organized sport, and board meetings continue daily in order to better define and regulate the game. *<b>Do not delete</b></p>

<p>Doesn't the fact that we're discussing this prove that it is notable or, at the very least, that it exists? This page has now had several different contributors and I'm sure that if the hit count was known for this site, you would find that it has had an abnormally large impact for a brand new article. I understand the neccesity for putting articles up for deletion, like spam, advertising, multiple articles on the same subject, or "non notable" topics, but does this article really fit under any of those? It is obviously not spam or advertising, and this is the only lotball article on Wikipedia. Though some may claim that it is supposedly "nn," what truly defines an article as notable? I have often surfed Wikipedia and found articles on mindless garbage I don't care about. The truth of the matter is that those articles might not matter to me, but they do matter to someone, they do matter to those who know what the article is about and those who wish to learn. Isn't that what Wikipedia is for, those who wish to learn? I love Wikipedia and I love the ideals for which it stands. I would never want to make something that would be harmfull to its goals. I ask you to please uphold the ideals of Wikipedia and keep this article. -INVENTM</p>

However, since Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy, there is not a strictly limited set of criteria for deletion. Articles are deleted daily on grounds of notability, and this has been common practice for over a year now.<i>"</i> Sure.</p>

<p>"<i>Wikipedia is not paper and (practically) has no size limits, and so should include "everything" that fits within its other criteria. There is room for articles on any and every verifiable subject. There is no harm in including an obscure topic, because if it is truly non-notable, people simply won't search for it or link to it. It will not create a significant server load as such.</i>" This is Lotball, right here. What's the harm? Really, what's the harm? Go ahead, tell me that the lotball article is not encyclopedic. It is not a vanity page, it is not a spam page; it is a thoughtfull, formal article on a topic that deserves to be included in the vast servers of Wikipedia.

<li>Selling 6 million copies of an album is a claim of notability. Even if it's entirely bogus, it protects the article from speedy deletion.

This person has characterized various Wikipedians' attempts to bring the page in accordance with Wikipedia policies as "censorship" and insists, among other things, that a highly POV discussion of Abu Ghraib prison is relevant to witch trials. The article creator removed the merge flag I had posted and replaced it with an informal poll on the talk page about whether to delete the article, so I'm nominating it here according to standard procedure. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 20:47, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I am Aaadietya Pandey. I have been recognized as the youngest Astrologer-Numerologist world over by Hindustan Times (a famous international daily).And am awaiting a <b>Certificate from Guiness World Records</b> for my Infinity Calendar theory. They will certify me as the <i>fastest human calendar</i>.</p>
<p>As far as the page on Wikipedia is concerned, it is not a self publicity because it has not been done by me but my followers and disciples.</p>
<p>I am a columnist for Hindustan Times and the Times of India, so there is NO PORN or VULGAR matter on my page.</p>
<p>I am a spiritual person and have no inclination towards SKEPTICS as pointed out by <b>JoshuaZ</b>.</p>
<p>For those of you who might be having problem understanding Hindi, i would like to inform that neither the page on wikipedia nor my website contains terms in Hindi which cannot be understood. Only the honorary title awarded to me mght not be decipherable. It is 'Ved Vaachaspati' which meand the person who is a laureate in vedic sciences, a person who has an indepth knowledge of vedas.</p>
<p>Yes, there are not many pages linked to my name <b>Aaadietya</b> because I have recently corrected my spelling as per numerology. Originally it was <i>Aditya" so my contributions to the world wide web were earlier published under the head Aditya.</i></p>
<p>Lastly, I am really glad to see so active members here on Wikipedia and I think my name must not be made an issue to discuss upon. So I request that this entry might surely be removed if still my dear friends do not think it appropriate.</p>
<p>God bless!</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I may need to withdraw this nomination pending investigation. Does anyone here know anyone who knows enough Hindi to check this out? I'm slightly skeptical that the person is that significant because most of the major Indian astrologers/yogi/whatevers show up on a fair number of the skeptic pages (like randi.org ) and this person shows up on none of them.

<p>Book is not a significant contribution to the literary well. Hummer190 23:40, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I can't speak for Jamesw9, Hummer190 or whoever the other people are, but I have made edits to more than just David Wong. I resent the ad hominem attack. Speaking of sockpuppets, notice that the same people who are defending Barbarians are Coming as a pulitzer prize winner are the same people who defended David Wong Louie's entry. I don't think drawing sockpuppet reference to the supporters of David Wong Louie is useful. I believe each of them has an opinion, that while different than me, deserves respect, not personal attack. Genb2004 06:23, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>Note to closing admin: Hummer190, Genb2004, and Jamesw9 all have the peculiar habit of editing virtually no pages other than those pages related to David Wong and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Wong_Louie_e7b3.html" title="David Wong Louie">David Wong Louie</a>. Make of this what you will, but I would at least draw a sockpuppet inference.</i> <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 00:14, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
