<p>I can't begin to contemplate the number of ways this is unencyclopedic... juxtapositions of two different things to form a subject are rarely if even good ideas, to start with, and this one iks a textbook case of an indiscriminate collection of information. Being a tawdry list with ostensibly two items (yes, there are six names, but all from two episodes of TV programmes) doesn't help matters.

<li><b>Keep</b>- Wow. came back to add a few more examples to something clearly labeled 'stub' and look what I find. This list was created because someone specifically said to me aloud they wished wikipedia had this info - so clearly it's information needed by the world. It neither picks your pocket nor breaks your leg to have verifiable information here, and if as Grutness, an alleged incrementalist, said, the complaint is partially that it is not very fleshed out, well it IS a two day old stub that is being worked on. sheesh. I am so damn sick of the Wikipedia anti-time travel list lobby/cabal - it's this cabal more than any other that is ruining the Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenneth_Fisher_1907.html" title="User:John Kenneth Fisher">John Kenneth Fisher</a> 06:08, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While information on what periods people have travelled to might be appropriate, perhaps you might want to start in a different direction, say by making a list of time travelers by era (or type. Sam Beckett is a different kind of time traveler than say the Protagonist of the book by Wells) instead of just concentrating on this singular example? At some point in time, I suppose the people who visited the Reing of Terror might be a large enough section of such a list to deserve a spin-off, but that is not yet demonstrated. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:04, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I will likely do that... and I won't make the mistake I made here of putting it up early thinking other people will flesh it out while I'm still adding to it. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenneth_Fisher_1907.html" title="User:John Kenneth Fisher">John Kenneth Fisher</a> 19:46, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>Comment</i> - sure I'm an incrementalist - I even coined the term and wrote the metawiki article on it. Incrementalism doesn't support the idea that any tiny subject is appropriate at a given point in Wikipedia's development. Maybe, just maybe, when Wikipedia is ten times the size it is today, such an article will fit alongside articles of equal worth. But WP is yet to reach that stage, and this article doesn't fit with <i>current</i> expectations of what a Wikipedia article should be. As an incrementalist I agree with Mister.Manticore's comments on starting with a larger, more appropriate list, and only breaking out smaller subtypes as and when they become approriate. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 01:20, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. Given that the first revision description is <i>Clearly the most important article Wikipedia has ever produced - but needs fleshing out.</i> and the author stated "someone specifically said to me aloud they wished wikipedia had this info - so clearly it's information needed by the world.", I'm guessing this is some kind of hoax or bad joke.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Was having fun with it, yes, but it was my brother working on an essay for school that mentioned that he looked in the Wikipedia for this info and couldn't find it. I suspected it wouldn't stand, and I admittedly was amused by it as I wrote the revision description, but it was not a joke, and was not a hoax, and was, as I said, added because I knew it was being looked for.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The Wikipedia is ment to have information that a normal encylopedia might have. I often call it "The source of all knowledge". This certainly counts as knowledge ( as most stuff does).

<li>I agree with you. However, this is <i>not</i> exactly a good example of an article that should be brought up as a martyr toward this end. "We want more diverse knowledge, like this!" "Oh yeah? Looks like trivial crap to me." (This is kind of like the "Save Betamax" campaign - People went "but I've already had VHS VCRs for the past decade or so, get on with the times" when the campaign was actually about the <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betamax_decision.html" title="Betamax decision">Betamax decision</a> rather than Betamax itself...) I like diverse and even <a href="../../../u/a/_/WP%7EUA_5bfb.html" title="WP:UA">unusual</a> information.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The point of lists and categories is to make it easier to find articles on Wikipedia.
