<ul>
<li><b>Has had a charted hit on any national music chart, in at least one large or medium-sized country</b> There is no evidence of this on the article page.</li>
<li><b>Has had a record certified gold or higher in at least one large or medium-sized country.</b> Doesn't look as if they have an album that meets either of the two.</li>
<li><b>Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country, reported in notable and verifiable sources.</b> Once again no evidence that they have. If so it must be a notable and verifiable source.</li>
<li><b>Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable).</b> Well they have never been on a major label. They have been on a few indie labels, most of them not being notable.</li>
<li><b>Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (excludes things like school newspapers (although university newspapers are usually fine), personal blogs, etc.)</b> Doesn't seem to be any evidence of this after doing a google search.</li>
<li><b>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such.</b> The band is two brothers who have been in this band only.</li>
<li><b>Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both, as in British hip hop); note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability.</b> Could be possible, I haven't found any sources saying that they have.</li>
<li><b>Has won a major music award, such as a Grammy, Juno or Mercury Music Award.</b> They haven't wond any major award.</li>
<li><b>Has won or placed in a major music competition.</b> According to their article they haven't been in any major music competitition.</li>
<li><b>Has performed music for a work of media that is notable, e.g. a theme for a network television show. (But if this is the only claim, it is probably more appropriate to have a mention in the main article and redirect to that page.)</b> If they did have one of these then it would be best to have them redirect to that work of media.</li>
<li><b>Has been placed in rotation nationally by any major radio network.</b> This needs to be verified if possible.</li>
<li><b>Has been the subject of a half hour or longer broadcast on a national radio network.</b> Once again a google search doesn't show that they have been part of a broadcast on a national radio network. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinosaur_puppy_8f46.html" title="User:Dinosaur puppy"><font style="background:yellow" face="Verdana" color="darkgreen">T REX</font></a><sub><a href="../../../d/i/n/User_talk%7EDinosaur_puppy_fe12.html" title="User talk:Dinosaur puppy"><font style="background:darkgreen" face="Tahoma" color="yellow"><b>speak</b></font></a></sub> 20:43, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Um, this band was just nominated on October 31. See previous <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Funckarma_b487.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Funckarma">AFD</a> Why is this being nominated again? I'm dubious of the nomination without even mentioning the prior discussion. It was rather short, and I can see an RFV, but not this. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 21:40, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Scratch that, it wasn't a short period, I misread the dates. Merely a small number of votes. Sorry, but you really should have pointed out that it was a second nomination. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 21:43, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The person who closed it told me to nominate it again because I felt the points made by the people voting keep weren't valid. Also I thought the title would give it away. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinosaur_puppy_8f46.html" title="User:Dinosaur puppy"><font style="background:yellow" face="Verdana" color="darkgreen">T REX</font></a><sub><a href="../../../d/i/n/User_talk%7EDinosaur_puppy_fe12.html" title="User talk:Dinosaur puppy"><font style="background:darkgreen" face="Tahoma" color="yellow"><b>speak</b></font></a></sub> 21:51, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And when making a second nomination, you should bring up prior nominations. Especially when you do it so very quickly afterwards . Given that you made such a lenghty proposal, a single line to say "This article was previously nominated here" would not have been a problem, would it? Consider it a courtesy to your fellow Wikipedians. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:58, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>weak keep</b> due to them having released on <a href="../../../s/k/a/Skam_Records_7f17.html" title="Skam Records">Skam Records</a>, of which I've never heard, but wiki has an article so I'm assuming some notability. <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 22:47, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I felt the arguements in the first nomination were not very strong ones and there were only 3 people who discussed it. The person who closed it told me to nominate it again because they didn't want to reopen a closed afd. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinosaur_puppy_8f46.html" title="User:Dinosaur puppy"><font style="background:yellow" face="Verdana" color="darkgreen">T REX</font></a><sub><a href="../../../d/i/n/User_talk%7EDinosaur_puppy_fe12.html" title="User talk:Dinosaur puppy"><font style="background:darkgreen" face="Tahoma" color="yellow"><b>speak</b></font></a></sub> 19:42, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>I'm saying <b>Keep</b> again. I appreciate that this is a greatly superior nomination to the first and a highly detailed one but Afd is not clean-up and renominating the next day does not give any opportunity for this to take place. I stand by my notation of the GHits for the duo - a lack is often cited as a reason for deletion so it seems inconsistant to disregard a significant quantity (NB - I am not suggesting that the nominator is guilty of this inconsistancy, this is more a remark on double standards often present in Afd). More to the point, Discogs - accepted in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> as a "good" source - lists them as members of Shadow Huntaz, who have released 2 albums on a notable label (<a href="../../../s/k/a/Skam_Records_7f17.html" title="Skam Records">Skam Records</a>) - 4 if you count the instrumental versions, which I don't. A Google search confirms that the information on Discogs is correct and that the brothers were members for both of the relevant releases, although some sources simply list them as producers. I shall add it to the article (I had hoped for a longer window in which to do this, but there you go....) as this role does not appear to be covered. If I had time, I might be more inclined to do an article for Shadow Huntaz (although, perhaps ironically, they have fewer GHits than Funckarma) and copy the relevant information. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 20:38, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hmm they seem to be notable as Shadow Huntaz but not as Funckarma. Should they be kept as Shadow Huntaz and a redirect from Funckarma to SH? <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinosaur_puppy_8f46.html" title="User:Dinosaur puppy"><font style="background:yellow" face="Verdana" color="darkgreen">T REX</font></a><sub><a href="../../../d/i/n/User_talk%7EDinosaur_puppy_fe12.html" title="User talk:Dinosaur puppy"><font style="background:darkgreen" face="Tahoma" color="yellow"><b>speak</b></font></a></sub> 01:20, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you'll give me time to do a SH article, I will include the information from this one and a redirect could be put into place. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 10:44, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK, basic <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadow_Huntaz_27a6.html" title="Shadow Huntaz">Shadow Huntaz</a> article now up, I'll add the discographical information later on.
