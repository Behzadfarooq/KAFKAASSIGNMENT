<p>A Friday night public-radio show in Sitka, Alaska. Zany? Maybe. Notable? Not so much. (The bad photos don't help the "Amateur-Night-in-Dixie" look of the article.) Was Prod'ed, by tag removed by creator with the comment, <i>Removal of deletion proposal because the personal opinion that this radio show isn't "notable" is not a viable reason for deletion. This article meets all four policies in the deletion policy</i>. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 06:31, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This show airs on Raven Radio, a legitimate public station in Alaska. This isn't some guy broadcasting his pirate radio show from his bedroom, this is a legit (maybe small fanbase but still legit) show on a legitimate FCC certified radio station. Therefore, it isn't a vanity piece. On Wikipedia we have dozens of entries for small TV stations, radio stations, and radio shows. Is it notable? To the listeners of the radio station it MUST be since it is still on the air. Just because it is a small fanbase does NOT mean it is NOT notable. We have entries on artists and jazz muscians who NO ONE has heard of outside their respective genres and does THAT mean they are not notable? of course not. The same rule applies here. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthCrusader_aae4.html" title="User:TruthCrusader">TruthCrusader</a> 06:36, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sigh. So much verbiage, so little sense. I mean, "legitimate"? Since I didn't use that term nor any synonym thereof, I'm trying to imagine what it's supposed to mean. I certainly wasn't arguing that the public-radio station hosting the show was <i>illegimate</i> -- which would entail, I dunno, maybe a band of totebag-carrying latte-drinkers skulking through the woods, secretly broadcasting bootleg <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Edwards_c809.html" title="Bob Edwards">Bob Edwards</a> tapes or something. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 20:18, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This page may not be the most informational on Wikipedia, but it does meet the polices. It is a real show on a real radio station and if someone wants information on it, where are they going to go? Just because it doesn't show up on Google means nothing. If you google search "Ricahrd Larry Rusk," you don't get anything. Although that man ran the biggest underground drug operation in the state of Texas known to this day. He was eventually gunned down by the FBI. Just because you can't find his name on google means that his operation wasn't notable? No, it doesn't mean anything. Same thing here. The "Other Appearances" was meant to be intertaining and not taken seriously. Anyone who knows this show is obviously from Sitka or surrounding small communities and will un-doubtedly know that those people never were on the show. We also can be fairly certain that the only people who are reading this or the article are people who know the show because...who else would care? The pictures are there to represent the light-heartedness of the program and its atmosphere, not to make it look sophistocated. But what it all boils down to is: There are three policies plus the copyright policy. This page meets all of them. It has a neutral POV, the information about the show is viable information, its obviously not original research, and what copyright could it possibly be breaking? There is unlimited space on the internet. Its not stealing anything away from you. So why not let it stay?--Dnomyar 7:13, 8 June 2006.
<ul>
<li>Because it doensn't meet the slightest standard of importance or encyclopedic merit? Because it's, in fact, trying to steal -- host space, bandwidth, and most importantly, reputation by association.</li>
<li><i>It is a real show on a real radio station ...</i> My mobile phone, my desk calendar, and my box of Kirkland brand Household Surface Wipes on my office desk are equally real, and they're not getting articles, either.</li>
<li><i>...if someone wants information on it, where are they going to go?</i> Wikipedia not being a webhost, not here. If you have no money (and if you're in public radio, that's a given), try MySpace.</li>
<li>Your "Ricahrd Larry Rusk" argument is particularly amusing -- yeah, such an article would be deleted <b>since there's no proof he exists other than your say-so</b>. Besides, I'm not following the logical chain here: because an unprovable subject doesn't have an article, yours should?</li>
<li><i>its obviously not original research</i> Two untruths in one clause: no, it's not "obviously" or even debatably -- "not original research" -- it doesn't have a <b>single</b> reference, not even the bog-standard MySpace page every garage band has.</li>
<li><i>The pictures are there to represent the light-heartedness of the program and its atmosphere, not to make it look sophistocated.</i> Pictures should added visual information to an article -- I hardly think a <i>radio</i> show requires pictures -- especially those that drive home the point that the whole enterprise is Amateur Night in Dixie. I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest the actual reason for the photos has more to do with ego than illustration, and to which I say, see the above reference to MySpace. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 23:32, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
