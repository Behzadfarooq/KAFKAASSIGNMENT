<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>MERGE, unanimously apart from nom</b>. I have merged the list to the list article, and added a mention to the series' article. <s>I have redirected this article to the list since that was the real 'merge' part of things.</s> Changed my mind. There was about as much content to go to both places. It seems more sensible to redirect a thing from a series to the article on the series, so that's what I've done. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 02:14, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>THERE IS NO COPYRIGHT VIOLATION. I am Thomas Powell, the author of the psicanica materials, owner of the website psicanica.com, and holder of all copyrights on the books and materials. I have placed that information on Wikipedia. If you wish to verify this, you may contact me by phone at 011 52 951 515 2149 or email me at tompowell@psicanica.com. I furthermore give anybody permission to use the articles I place on Wikipedia freely with condition that they cite the source as www.psicanica.com. I believe that all human knowledge belongs to the race and is the source of our progress -- a point of view, alas, not supported by our current copyright laws. But that is another issue.</p>
<p>I am new to Wikipedia and how it operates. However, looking over some of the comments here, it is interesting to see invalidations of what is very technical, philosophic and psychological material by people who, as far as I can see from their pages, have no background in the area at all, much less have even read the source books they are invalidating. (I have made it as non-technical and reader friendly as I can on Wikipedia, but the source materials are very technical.) I get the impression that for some, it is their hobby to just invalidate/delete whenever they can. The fact that some item of information should be beyond or outside of one's current level of knowledge or even contradict it, does not make it wrong or eligible for deletion. I thought that Wikipedia was a brilliant project, an attempt to gather up and catalog human knowledge. To see such trite remarks/reasons for deletion (other than copy vios, which I have answered above) and without any supporting arguments or discussion of the validity of the information--even if by people not in the field of philosophy--is disappointing.</p>

<p>I don't get this website?? Every time we try and do anything we are getting it deleted. What does Alexa ranking have to do with anything?? We are a quality music resource and can provide people looking up bands on your website with songs, photos, bios and lots more information about these bands that they can't get on your site. Why would you delete a page dedicated to our site????? That makes absolutely no sense, it gives people information about altsounds and what we are and what we do. How is that any different to a band having a page on your site?? Isn't that self promotion too?? I am utterly confused. When I stumbled across your site I spent a good time looking at it and wanted to get involved but everytime I do it gets deleted. Thats no use to me and I am almost at the point where I can't be bothered anymore. Why would you turn away people that are willing to add quality content? *sigh*</p>
<p>Just browsing some more and noticed that Purevolume.com has a page on wikipedia which isn't being considered for deletion. Why is that?? Whats the difference?? And if you say it's because we're not big enough, then doesn't that also violate one of your "commercial interest" policies?? It doesn't say anywhere you have to have an Alexa ranking of greater than x to be allowed on this site. There are so many flaws in your rules. Why do i not understand? I am reading all your policies and posting suggestions and i dont see us in violation of anything...if anything we are totally keeping in spirit with what wikipedia is about.</p>

<li><i>People</i> have a scale of notability, and wikipedia cannot hope to cover everyone of average notability. Schools are not people, they are more equivalent to villages, and the consensus is that every village that has ever existed has a place in wikipedia. Since wikipedia aims for comprehensive geographic coverage, there is no reason not to aim for comprehensive coverage of education in each location, in fact they enhance each other. Wikipedia should worry about its credibility with real users, not random page browsers. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 17:04, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Handle persecution according to the religion of the victims, because it's more salient than the religion of the perpetrating regime. Grouping by persecutors is problematic because their motivations are not necessarily religious (the regime may not have an organized religion) and those responsible may actually be a more diverse body of powerful individuals, both in terms of religious and other interests. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 03:14, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. These are valid themes, and the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution_by_Muslims_5cc6.html" title="Religious persecution by Muslims">Religious persecution by Muslims</a> article may survive VfD. Note that incidents by a group may permit events against minor groups to be listed that otherwise would not be covered. OTOH, this is just a stub, and the whole series needs a lot of work. Also, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution_by_Jews_5375.html" title="Religious persecution by Jews">Religious persecution by Jews</a> is not viable at this time since there is not a community of people willing and able to have it be anything other than an anti-semitic rant.

<li><b>Comment</b> The persecution of any identifiable group by any other group is valid historical reportage. This article needs <b>Help</b> and a solid effort to <b>edit</b> and expand it. In fact, I may take a crack at this personally, and invite any suggestions and help that you as wikipedians can offer. Certainly attrocities have been commited by almost any identifiable religious group, excused by their own belief in a superior ethic or mandate from a preternatural force. In fact, the lack of this kind of behaviour is so exceptional in human society and civilization, it warrants nay it BEGS a separate article " <b>Major Religious Groups Who Never Persecuted Other People</b>". That would be a tough one to research. Good luck! <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 03:52, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> persecution by Christians is a known fact of history. I was surprised this article is so short, as Christians since Constantine I's reign to the present day have persecuted non-Christians in many different forms.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is perhaps a noble idea, but these articles are <i>already</i> POV OR disasters. WP editors have enough problems dealing with prickly subjects as it is, without <i>making up</i> new ones. Any religious persecution by or of religious groups should be discussed in the articles that concern each religious group.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> all three, the template, and everything else related to this project. It's just a bad idea, destined to piss off everyone at the same time. In wiki articles describing specific, documented historical events, I would support having a "religion X persecuted group Y" kind of analysis. But trying to create a general "people persecuted by religion X" topic is the wrong way of doing it, and extending it to all religions and atheism, while it may seem neutral in theory, will only serve to attract the ire of everyone at once. This topic will turn into an endless edit-war and flame-war, with each side claiming to be absolutely right and the only one backed by historical evidence; a little like what happened with the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> page. Furthermore, like Michael Snow pointed out, making a "persecution by religion X" topic implies that religion X is a harmonious monolithic group with a single clear agenda; there is no religion on Earth for which that is true. Trying to group all actions of all sects and sub-groups of religion X over millenia under a single "things done by religion X" topic is a gross oversimplification of a very complex situation. <a href="../../../r/i/t/User%7ERitchy_3c4d.html" title="User:Ritchy">Ritchy</a> 22 July 2005</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> As noted, it's clearer when handled under the oppressed party, and is highly prone to POV insertion. Also, it's a bit ad hominem.

<li><b>Delete</b> and delete the others in the series. These will be magnets for POV (as Mustafaa said), but that is not the only reason to delete. The real issue here is the precision of the term - "Religious persecution by ____" does that mean persecution by members of that religion against anyone? By the religion itself (and under what interpretations)? By any member of the religion against another religion as a whole? Is all of history covered? Is nationalistic persecution the same thing? Would the <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedwabne_massacre.html" title="Jedwabne massacre">Jedwabne massacre</a> be religious persecution by Christians against Jews, or a case of anti-semitism? Would <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baruch_Goldstein_ddb1.html" title="Baruch Goldstein">Baruch Goldstein</a>'s murderous rampage be religious persecution by Jews against Muslims?

<dd>The page has changed significantly, and the quality is much better now (at the time of initial vfd, it stated urban legend as fact), but the fact remains that it is a non-notable UL. A well written debunking of the non-notable is still non-notable. An additional concern is that the article text is now very very similar to the Snopes article.

<li><b>Comment</b> If you can provide some verifiable evidence that this band is notable, and not just a local phenominon, you could probably get your inclusion. So far you have 2 votes to delete, One on the fence (me) and a kind offer of assistance from Capitalroadstar.

As long as this "awesome band" should be of general interest to a more or less worldwide audience, write about them. If they have members from previously notable bands, probably a good sign. If they have toured internationally, even better. Have they released music on a format other than <b>CDR</b>? More and more interesting.

<li><b>Abstain</b> - I edited the article after it was created using inflammatory and factually incorrect material for the ACW-Utah entry that was deleted several weeks back. The "(an)other editor" who suggested the deletion is a known disrupter/troll of Wikipedia under the guise of being a "white hat", and had a hand in creating the material used at the deleted entry and the original entry for this page, but that's a subject for a different rant. I'm not incredibly opposed to the article being deleted, but I have chosen to provide the relevant facts regarding the page's creation and suggestion for deletion, and I would hope that those would be taken into consideration. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChadbryant_f5a9.html" title="User:Chadbryant">Chadbryant</a> 18:11, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Major hit in its time, stuck in the mind of everyone who ever heard it, well remembered today, significant cultural reference. Is it properly spelled "lovely" or "loverly?" Danny Kaye pronounced it something like love-a-ly, definitely three syllables. (trot to CD cabinet) My copy of a net-very-authoritative CD says "lovely." Singing roll-er-bowl-a-ball-a-penny-a-pitch! Well, that's done it—it's going to be going through my head for the rest of the evening.

<li><b>Delete</b> LCR is a common phrase in electronics design indicating inductance (L), capacitance (C) and resistance (R). These are commonly used in combinations to form filter networks. It is a common topic to those who understand filters and a common question for those who do not. This page could serve a possibly more widespread and diverse audience by addressing this topic instead of the university club it currently references.[[User:AB|AB] 03:01, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The purpose of this project is to organize articles related to the <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a>. However, from what I know there is only such article, the <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a> itself, which is protected. Seems that this project has only one contributor, who started it and then did nothing else. The wording is also very vague. I'd say this page is not helpful. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> 15:28, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>advertisement/self-promotion</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Since yesterday, we, the creators of the article, were confronted with a number of very surprising incidents involving the user <a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoethean_633f.html" title="User:Goethean">goethean</a>. First, the article was tagged as disputed by <a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoethean_633f.html" title="User:Goethean">goethean</a> because it supposedly violated Wikipedia’s rules of neutrality. Quoting from the user <a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoethean_633f.html" title="User:Goethean">goethean</a>; “It is not written from a neutral point of view. It will have to be re-written to conform with Wikipedia standards of neutrality. Specifically, the unattributed claims that a god led men to write a particular book represent a particular point of view and must be attributed to those who hold these claims…” We made the changes requested by this user and asked him to have the disputed tag removed. Instead of acknowledging the changes, he put a request that this article be entirely deleted. We find this absolutely incomprehensible. He claims that this article is meant for self-promotion. This article can in no way be considered self-promotion, as the author, Dr. Hajari, passed away in 1978. <a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoethean_633f.html" title="User:Goethean">goethean</a> also said that he did a search on google for Hajari+Devayan, and the search engine only provided two relevant hits. We would like to suggest to <a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoethean_633f.html" title="User:Goethean">goethean</a> that he makes another search in google for <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=devayan&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=devayan&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">Devayan</a>, and he will find many websites associated with the epic Devayan. Dr. Hajari was a life long devoted disciple of Sri Aurobindo, and Sri Aurobindo was his guru. If he received any assistance from his guru, then there should be no reason for surprise. In the article, we have attributed all supposed claims to the author, Dr. Hajari, and the article in no way suggests that these claims are absolute facts. <a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoethean_633f.html" title="User:Goethean">goethean</a> also mentioned that Devayan is not listed amongst the books issued by the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. It’s a fact that many ashramites have written books which have been published outside the ashram. Since this was our first Wikipedian article, we did not know that we did not have the right to delete comments posted by other users. We deleted <a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoethean_633f.html" title="User:Goethean">goethean</a>’s comments. After he told us that this was not allowed, we apologized to him and he put his comments back on the page. And as far as we know, we are allowed to post links on other articles which could be related to the subject matter. If still there are any points which need to be ironed out in the article, we would be more than pleased to make the changes. Considering all of the above, we strongly feel that this article <b>SHOULD NOT BE DELETED!!</b></li>

Sri Aurobindo is sort of the Indian equivalent of Benjamin Franklin or Alexander Hamilton.

<li><b>Delete</b> I've searched high and low, and though the book does appear to be refered to more often <i>without</i> his name, it's not by much, and most of those references are copies of a single boilerplate.

<li><b>Delete</b> I cannot find much in the way of a basis for the notability of this book. Many of the links searching for just the title turn up either unrelated pages, or links back to the home page, often on user-submission sites. The article is also still not encyclopedic in the least, as it affirms that the book is a true prediction of the future.

<li><b>Comment</b> so the "copyvio" seems at odds with what I was thinking, which was close to "original research". But is there some lawyer who can comment on whether "incontrovertible evidence" is a genuine legal term of art, as opposed to (as I had assumed) a mere rhetorical flourish? If it doesn't have a meaning not obviously apparent from its constituent English words, then I want to change my vote back to "delete". --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 01:54, 23 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's exactly what I was wondering which was why I took it to Google instead of one of those silly online encyclopedias. My conclusion was that it probably is <i>not</i> a proper legal term, since that was the only earlyish Google that treated that way.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This appears to be a hyperbolic dicdef. It is indeed <i>not</i> a proper legal term - I'm not aware of any case ever ascribing a particular meaning to the term, and it does not appear in the pocket <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Black%27s_Law_Dictionary_b51d.html" title="Black's Law Dictionary">Black's Law Dictionary</a></i>; the proper legal term is <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conclusive_evidence.html" title="Conclusive evidence">conclusive evidence</a> (defined primarily as "evidence so strong as to overbear any other evidence to the contrary"). However, I <b>abstain</b> from voting as I am not so sure that the article should not exist as a <i>philosophical</i> distinction. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 02:42, July 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The wives of U.S. Senators don't attain independent notability per se in the way that First Ladies do, and she doesn't seem to have done anything else that rises to the level of deserving an article. She should of course be mentioned in <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Glenn_1471.html" title="John Glenn">John Glenn</a>'s biography, but merging would be pointless because of most of this article is extremely trivial. "She has a long-standing interest in American folk arts and crafts and collects quilts and other needlework as well as historical household items from the small towns of Ohio." Maybe if we were writing a three-volume biography of Glenn, we'd go to such detail regarding his wife.

<p>I am a father of two young boys and playing Lightning at the local park is their favorite pastime. Switch Lightning sounds like a thoroughly enjoyable game, not to mention all the extra exercise they'll get! I'm going to recommend it to my kids. I know I won't have trouble getting them to go to bed at night after a few rounds of Switch Lightning.</p>
<p>The game has seen quite a following in our little community. We started playing this game a few summers ago, and from time to time ,driving by the park, we see kids weve never even met before playing this game.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm glad you enjoy the game, but for a game to be included in Wikipedia it needs to be verifiable from independant sources and played by a somewhat larger group of people. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 20:46, July 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is aptly titled. The Faux is not about anything real. Research reveals no such vessel and reading through the article itself points to other clues that it's all in jest (i.e. "Jest'liana" is the owner of the ship.) I did find ONE relevant google hit that seemd to associate some of the terms in the article with a website about "behind the stories" in games. It is possible that this is about the backstory of some video game somewhere. At this point, it appears to be very non-notable and the article in its current state doesn't make sense.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I have looked at the Australian Dictionary of Biography entry for Charlton the ALP politician which lists him as being Matthew Charlton. Ross McMullin's book on the history of the Labor Party refers to him as Matt Charlton. If the aspiring poet gets deleted, I would propose moving the Mathew Charlton article to Matthew Charlton.

<li><b>Keep</b> Although whoever wrote this article didn't have complete information and did a half-ass job, I'll vouch for Matt. He's an important part of the queer community in his writing, poetry and art here in the city of Toronto. I'm a social worker who loves poetry and I have worked with Matthew before. He has won a few awards even here in Toronto for his poetry and speeches. He was reviewed in Word too many years back to note on the web and has been quite involved in the small press community in Toronto. His collection "The Cosmology of Love" has been read and even discussed at science fiction conventions. I believe Robert Charles Wilson has openly acclaimed Matthew's work. I wouldn't presume that just because a person doesn't have an instantaneously strong online presence that he/she is not notable. <small>(Unsigned vote by Apoetical (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Apoetical_bb85.html" title="Special:Contributions/Apoetical">contribs</a>), user's first edit)</small>

<li><b>Weak keep.</b> Surprisingly, this <i>doesn't</i> appear to be copyvio. I've done some googling and can't find anything like it, though it is notable, perhaps, that the [<a href="http://hideout.wtks.com/main.html" class="external text" title="http://hideout.wtks.com/main.html" rel="nofollow">page for this show</a>] links into this page as information on its history. If the history is verifiable, though, this seems to be a show with a long history and might be considered notable especially given the set of programs not on vfd at category:radio programs (2 Sense especially comes to mind) and category:radio programme stubs. If <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opie_and_Anthony_2c23.html" title="Opie and Anthony">Opie and Anthony</a> on XM manage to land a spot there, a program on a major radio station in a city like Orlando would seem equally notable. While XM may have national coverage, its subscriber base isn't exactly massive. I personally don't feel that the criteria for non-notable has been met, but I'm not exactly convinced on the matter. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 06:19, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> This show has a solid history and strong affiliations with legendary broadcast institutions such as WJFK FM, a heritage radio station in a top 10 radio market.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. The only reason I could even consider this a keep is for his books, but I am not of the opinion that all types of books are equal. Some books are author driven, some are subject driven. People who buy novels certainly pay attention to the author. People who buy textbooks and techincal manuals generally do not. His books seem to be the latter sort. While people often have the mindset "I'm going to buy a book by Heinlein or Ambose" (or whoever), I think people who buy this guy's book are thinking "I'm going to buy a book on programming in C". The fact that this article also seems like vanity doesn't encourage me either. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 15:38, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b>. One album should be enough, given that WP is not paper. Yes, I know that some who don't like inclusiveness have written guidelines that say two albums but that seems pretty arbitrary to me. Getting an album released by a major label is an achievement beyond the overwhelming majority of bands and should be sufficient for an encyclopaedia with almost limitless resources. What we should be asking -- and some sadly never do -- is not "how do we look if we have an article on X?" (because obviously most visitors to WP don't even know we have the offending article) but "how do we look if we don't cover X?". Yes, I know. Not many people will look up the band Radish, but still, where's the harm in a short, well-written article for those who do? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 04:38, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</s></li>

<dd>Please do not declare that an argument is moot. That is rude. There has been a written and defined precedent, reached after much work towards consensus, that is the foundation of my argument. The fact that the radio station was given excemption from the FCC does not change that stations status in regard to to notability precedent that I am citing.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The oldest high school radio station in the United States is notable. More important, the so-called "guideline" is illogical: the notability of a media outlet isn't determined by the wide geography it covers but on the number of people it reaches, and a lot of people live in a 20 mile diameter circle of Philadelphia.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 00:37, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Perhaps you might propose altering the language of the notability guideline? I'm just going off of my interpretation of the guideline as written. I don't believe it's really fair to call the guideline "so-called", my understanding is that a fair amount of discussion and work towards consensus went into developing those guidelines. Whether you choose to follow those guidelines is up to you, as is how you choose to interpret said guidelines. I am simply submitting an article that does not, in my opinion, meet the guidelines. Some have agreed, others have not. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">EvilPhoenix</a> <a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvilphoenix_c095.html" title="User talk:Evilphoenix">talk</a> 13:08, August 2, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>With seven unqualified keep votes out of twelve total, it's pretty clear that this discussion will end with either a <i>no consensus</i> or <i>keep</i> result. I would close it myself, but I am uncomfortable with closing a discussion I voted in with a result I agree with.
