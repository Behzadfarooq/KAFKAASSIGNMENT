<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. As for the rewrite, there doesn't seem to be sufficient consensus to delete it (although it's close and some votes are ambiguous), so <b>kept</b> for now.

<li><b>Comment</b>; I maintain that Bush Sydney J. UK Optometrist/Researcher/Inventor: Introduced Cardioretinometry December 2002. should be deleted for more reasons than I can count - it's horribly biased, postulating and very vain. Uncle G's rewrite of Sydney J. Bush has come out alright though and should be kept.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> the article with the long title. The rewrite has merit, and I need more time to evaluate it. I applaud Uncle G's efforts; however, I wish that Uncle G had not placed the new article under this VfD, since the articles are so different. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManoaChild_4445.html" title="User:ManoaChild">ManoaChild</a> 20:02, 24 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Extend delete to cover rewritten article</b>. Unable to independantly confirm notability. Rewritten article, while much improved, consists primarily of a list of letters written, which is not notable (fails average professor test). <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManoaChild_4445.html" title="User:ManoaChild">ManoaChild</a> 20:42, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Comment and additional vote: Uncle G's separate article is only tangentially related to the issues here, so I have to vote on it separately. The fact that the fellow isn't spoken of or his technique much used/discussed is what makes me argue for <b>delete</b> on that. Mind you, cardioretinometry is back. Folks need to watch out for deleted things mysteriously reappearing. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:35, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>The article is gone now. There is an article there, but it is only a place-holder that says that the actual article is deleted. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManoaChild_4445.html" title="User:ManoaChild">ManoaChild</a> 20:02, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>As much as I am in favor of deleting vanity cranks, this one is a bit harder as we still seem to have the article on cardioretinometry. As long as that article persists there ought to be an article on its inventor. Obviously this existing article needs to be torn to shreds and rewritten but it's anomalous to have the "medical" procedure without the "medico" who invented it. <s><b>Hold-the-nose keep</b></s> See below -<a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEDM_5af9.html" title="User:EDM">EDM</a> 02:46, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Since cardioretinometry is gone, changing vote on this to <b>delete</b>. As for Sydney J. Bush, thank you very much Uncle G, that was above and beyond and the deck chairs are really nicely arranged now, but <b>delete</b> that as well as crank. Writers of letters to journals and organizations do not achieve notability by virtue of that activity, and the Freemasonry clinches it. -<a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEDM_5af9.html" title="User:EDM">EDM</a> 13:56, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Duplicate with very crappy title. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 07:43, August 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've done a <b>complete rewrite from scratch</b> at Sydney J. Bush. It wasn't based on this article, which is entirely <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">autobiographical</a>, having been created by <a href="../../../s/y/d/User%7ESydney_J_Bush_c6d5.html" title="User:Sydney J Bush">User:Sydney J Bush</a>. There is no need to retain Bush Sydney J. UK Optometrist/Researcher/Inventor: Introduced Cardioretinometry December 2002., and it should be <b>Delete</b>d as the self-promoting, biased, egregiously mis-titled, autobiographical abomination that it is.
<p>However, I have brought Sydney J. Bush under the umbrella of this discussion. Other people don't write much about this person. Research mainly brought up self-publicity. For the latter article, <b>Weak Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:22:50, 2005-08-24 (UTC)</p>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I applaud <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a>'s efforts, but this doctor appears to be pretty much textbook non-notable. He's got a theory, and he's given his examination style a name. That's good, and perhaps one day, we'll have a big article about how he was published and everyone follows his theory of scurvy. Until that happens, it's non-encyclopedic. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 12:42, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'd say <i>"First optometrist to make available inexpensive, cosmetically acceptable, invisible prism segment bifocal spectacle lenses (not available in the USA at present) for the relief of convergence insufficiency."</i> is a <b>fair claim at notability</b>, but maybe that's because I worked with an opticien's shop. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:57, August 24, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"It is said that his birth was marked by earthquakes, tidal waves, tornadoes, firestorms, the explosion of three neighbouring stars, and, shortly afterwards, by the issuing of over six and three quarter million writs for damages from all of the major landowners in his Galactic sector. However, the only person by whom this is said is <a href="../../../z/a/p/Zaphod_Beeblebrox_11a1.html" title="Zaphod Beeblebrox">Beeblebrox</a> himself, and there are several possible theories to explain this." — <i><a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitch-Hiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_55f3.html" title="Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy">Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></i>, Fit The Ninth.
<p>I didn't find anything at all that mentioned the claim that you mention, or the claims to holding patents. The only source for these claims is <a href="../../../s/y/d/User%7ESydney_J_Bush_c6d5.html" title="User:Sydney J Bush">User:Sydney J Bush</a>, writing his autobiography in Wikipedia. See the rewrite for the stuff that I <i>did</i> find. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:17:16, 2005-08-24 (UTC)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Obviously, <b>delete</b> the horrible-title one and its twin firmly and quickly. For Uncle G's version, while it's very nice to see verbs in the sentences and a good structure, its virtues only make it clearer <b>why</b> "other people don't write much about this person", so <b>delete</b> (a little less firmly) that one, too. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 13:13, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment/query</b>: if the invention of cardioretinometry is notable, why has the article been deleted? Similarly, are his invisible prism segment bifocal spectacle lenses notable enough to discuss in <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corrective_lenses.html" title="Corrective lenses">corrective lenses</a>? If not, I don't believe we can call him notable. <b>Delete,</b> though admittedly not as speedy as before. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a> 13:21, 24 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because it was <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, and admitted original research, too. See <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Cardioretinometry_0046.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Cardioretinometry">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Cardioretinometry</a> where Bush says so outright, in as many words. It's not published in peer-reviewed journals, and the only source for it is the inventor himself. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:32:20, 2005-08-24 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Did I mention that, in addition to vanity, it is also <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>? Still <i>delete</i>. This applies to all articles in this series related to cardioretinometry or its inventor. --<a href="../../../i/b/y/User%7EIByte_f0c6.html" title="User:IByte">IByte</a> 16:13, 24 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>cardioretinometry certainly was original research. And the parts of the two autobiographies by <a href="../../../s/y/d/User%7ESydney_J_Bush_c6d5.html" title="User:Sydney J Bush">User:Sydney J Bush</a> that also presented that theory directly, were too. But to be original research <i>as a biography</i>, Sydney J. Bush would have to have presented a novel interpretation of the biography, or have been primary source material. With no arguments that this is a novel interpretation, and cited sources for practically every individual sentence in the article, I suggest that this is not so. As it is a biography article: rather than addressing it as if it were about the theory propounded by the person, which it is not, it's best addressed on the grounds of whether the person, that it <i>is</i> about, satisfies the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>, as <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">MacGyverMagic</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEDM_5af9.html" title="User:EDM">EDM</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a>, <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a>, and <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> have done above, discussing such things as whether people have written about this person and what this person's recognized achievements have been. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:10:45, 2005-08-24 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Vanity, then. This is why I'm usually not fond of merging VfDs for related articles, because the reasonings may differ. Building a bridge from one reasoning to the next, though, I don't think coming up with a theory that fails <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> gets you sufficient notability to pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. --<a href="../../../i/b/y/User%7EIByte_f0c6.html" title="User:IByte">IByte</a> 18:58, 24 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Groups of articles nominated together are sometimes troublesome in that regard, yes. But this wasn't a group of articles, just a rewrite done as the discussion progressed, a rewrite to replace an autobiography with a biography, about the same subject. That your opinion about a rewrite may differ from your opinion of the original is the idea. ☺ Moreover: It's better to bring rewrites created as new articles under the same umbrella than not to. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:47:53, 2005-08-24 (UTC)

<li>I appreciate your efforts, but I don't think the subject matter has sufficient merit for WP. --<a href="../../../i/b/y/User%7EIByte_f0c6.html" title="User:IByte">IByte</a> 20:13, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
