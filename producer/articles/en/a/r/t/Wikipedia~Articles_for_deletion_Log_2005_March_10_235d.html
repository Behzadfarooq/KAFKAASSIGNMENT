I'll have a look around the categories for these. And before someone goes mad saying what is major and what is minor - the ones with longer articles are major and the ones with relatively short stubs are minor. Planets can move between lists if they get expanded and articles on minor planets will be redirected.

<p>"Surrealist Movement in the United States" is a website that operates as a bookseller, <a href="http://www.surrealistmovement-usa.org/pages/black.html" class="external free" title="http://www.surrealistmovement-usa.org/pages/black.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.surrealistmovement-usa.org/pages/black.html</a> Read and scroll down page to see all books for sale, they take checks too.</p>

<li>The Surrealist Movement in the United States is not a website, as you well know; it <i>runs</i> a website. It can hardly <i>be</i> a website as it goes back to 1966, long before the World Wide Web. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C. Boyer">Daniel C.

<ul>
<li>kindly disagree, Daniel. Its the Chicago Surrealist Group that goes back to 1966. After 1978, their activities were very sporadic, too many gaps to substantiate credibility. Also, see Shattuck editorial from NY Times 1972 and his response to them.<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 16:25, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Article subject is also known as, "Black Swann".
<ul>
<li>This is a blatant lie, and is fooling no-one. Black Swan Press is associated with the Surrealist Movement in the United States, but is very clearly <i>not</i> the Surrealist Movement in the United States. You are posting these in bad faith. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C. Boyer">Daniel C. Boyer</a> 14:35, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not from what I see. The fact is that its a commercial website that sells books. Also, sells one of your books, "The Octopus Frets" by Daniel C.Boyer. Again, Advertising and Spam.<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 16:25, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's quite interesting what you're doing. First you assert "Article subject is also known as, 'Black Swann' [sic]". Then when I point out that <i>obviously</i> The Surrealist Movement in the United States and Black Swan Press are not the same thing, your support for your original assertion is the completely off-topic statement that "its" [sic] (what the "it" is is unspecified) "a commercial website that sells books".</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Dan, they are the same thing. Even look at the URL, <a href="http://www.surrealistmovement-usa.org/pages/black.html" class="external free" title="http://www.surrealistmovement-usa.org/pages/black.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.surrealistmovement-usa.org/pages/black.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It clearly shows that Black Swan and Surrealist Movement are on the same website that sells books, even your book.<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">User:Classicjupiter2</a> 18:37, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>It clearly shows that there is a webpage on the Surrealist Movement in the United States website for Black Swan Press, and fairly clearly shows that the two are associated. It is just as clear that there are many other pages on the website, and for someone to say that Black Swan Press doesn't <i>have</i> a webpage but <i>is</i> a website, that the Surrealist Movement in the United States <i>is</i> a website is totally bonkers. By the same argument, Coca-Cola is a website, the Vatican is a website, the White House is a website. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C.

</ul>
<p>Black Swan Press "is" "a commercial website"? Then where do the books come from? The Surrealist Movement in the United States "is" "a commercial website"? This is practically mind-boggling. If what you mean to say is that The Surrealist Movement in the United States runs a website that is largely or entirely commercial in that it sells books, say it. Your "[n]ot from what I see" is either disingenuous or it reflects very dimly on your powers of observation and analysis. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C.

<li>Advertising and spam is the reason here EL_C. This commercial website sells books, many commercial websites that sell books are notable.

<li>I just don't see how that bears on notability in this case, even if that is its predominant quality, still, the article can qualify it as such while excluding any actual advertising within the article space. It strikes me as notable, is all I'm saying, though, I remain open to the possibility that I overlooked important things and it ins't, in fact, notable.

<li><b>Keep, but drastically rework</b>.

<dl>
<dd>This page contains enough data about the school to merit its incusion in Wikipedia as a stub. The stub label is there as an invite to any Wikipedian from the local community or the school who knows more about the school than is on the website to update the page using their personal expertise (there is at least one Wikipedian from this school, <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwizxp_596a.html" title="User:Mathwizxp">User:Mathwizxp</a>, I have asked him to inprove this article).

<p>Completely unnecessary and has no potential to become encyclopedic. Rather than an actual character on the show <i>Family Guy</i>, Stan Thompson is nothing more than a placeholder name used in a single gag - not only is the name completely arbitrary, but the topic of Meg's real father is never brought up again in the entire series. In addition, the article causes further confusion because it is linked to by a couple of articles about a same-named unsuccessful U.S. House Of Representatives candidate in 2004. As an ambiguous article with no potential to become encyclopedic, I see no reason for it to remain here. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 06:41, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>, the cambridge podcast is the first podcast in the uk built around a community, for a community - it is not really intended for general use, nor is it promoted heavily outside of the cambridge community. it is now one of the highest rated radio shows in the community, has set up live shows and played over 40 cambridge acts. this is an original expression of a community, by a community, and is therefore worthy of saving. likewise the uk podcast network, which will link other university independent music podcasts together and change how college radio works in the uk.- (talk) 18:00, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> ‚Äî <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>, it's nice of you to bring up categories. I noticed that you have removed a lot of languages from top level categories, like <a href="../../../l/a/n/Category%7ELanguages_9c79.html" title="Category:Languages">category:languages</a>, so that a reader has to know the genetic classification of a language to get to it by category. I just thought it'd be nice if all language articles were in that category as well as in more specific ones. It just looks as if you are really keen on doing a lot of unnecessary housework. I could see your last comment being worthwhile if you hadn't performed the decategorisation. All I can see is a drive to make it more difficult to find language articles, and an over reliance on the often flawed system of genetic classification. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 11:39, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Not quite; I've moved languages out of top-level categories so that a reader has to know <i>either</i> the genetic classification <i>or</i> the country where the language is spoken. I think it's unlikely a reader will want information on a language without knowing at least one of those two facts. I also think having all the language articles listed directly at <a href="../../../l/a/n/Category%7ELanguages_9c79.html" title="Category:Languages">Category:Languages</a> will leave the door open to one day having a category with two thousand entries in it, which will be a nightmare to navigate.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia isn't a general information base. An information base is a repository in which information is available for querying in a variety of ways. It would be useful to to have a database containing one record for each human language with a wide variety of different attributes given and a query capability by which one could obtain lists of languages with various properties, sorted in various ways. Perhaps this exists elsewhere. I'd be surprised if linguists have not created it somewhere. However, Wikipedia is not this, and it should not try to make itself into a Human Language database by having an "article" for each language, and a plethora of "list articles" giving the results of every imaginable interesting query on the basic data. If it were to have one or a few articles representing queries on the basic data about languages, it is doubtful that a straight list alphabetized by the conventional name of the language in English would be the most interesting, or even interesting at all. All that said, some thought should be given on how to organize all the information in the Wikipedia about human languages. However, this is not it. In fact, it comes across as kind of stupid. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 11:09, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> ‚Äî As long as categories by country are done, I can now understand what the reorganisation was all about. I think that there is a question here about the validity of lists on Wikipedia when the content of those lists also appears ina category. This isn't limited to languages, but is present throughout the project. For me, the major use of lists is that they can be used for project building, where categories cannot (they can't have red links unless they are added by hand). Ethnologue is the most comprehensive online survey of the world's languages, but is often flawed and offers poor information. We have been using Ethnologue, perfectly legally, as a starting block for our articles on languages (compare, for instance, the Ethnologue article on <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=AIJ" class="external text" title="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=AIJ" rel="nofollow">Lishanid Noshan</a> and Wikipedia's <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lishanid_Noshan_0256.html" title="Lishanid Noshan">Lishanid Noshan</a>). It would be utterly daft to ignore such a comprehensive resource as Ethnologue, but it would be equally daft to rely on it alone (I haven't spoken to any linguist who is a total fan). This list is not just about navigation for readers: it is a recognitions that we have a long way to go before we are providing a good, comprehensive resource for the world's languages. Isn't that an aspiration of encylopaedia building? I see that Category:Languages that Gareth Hughes thinks are major by name is still a red link: I look forward to seeing that one on VfD! <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 16:32, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The first one is just a disputed scholar original research verging on rant to try to instill the concept of ACM as organized. It one of the reasons (there is an even more charicatural piece by some picturesque "scholar", massimo) why this ACM virtual article (it even lacks a definition) is ambiguous beyond repairs, and a more inclusive one is needed.</li>
<li>It is right that the second one has to do with opposition to cult and that it is reductionist to leave it in the ACM article.

<ol>
<li>history: grew out of concerned parents youth in the 1970s in the USA</li>

<li>methods: not talking with the cult, deprogramming, exit counseling</li>

<dd>There are former members who have NOTHING in common with this but still oppose as certain cult because they have observed abuses or deception. E.g.

<li><b>Merge</b>. Filled with POV. Should be covered in <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a>. If it's to be broken out I prefer a more neutral title.

<li><b>Merge</b> to Pokemon. Look at the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html#Controversy" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> article for a good presentation of charges of satanism within an article.

<li><b>Keep</b>, possible merge. I have some previous experience with this article; a while back I changed a little language, put in a anti-Pok√©mon primary source instead of the rambling personal homepage chat conversation there previously, and changed the title from "Satanism and Pok√©mon" (because the subject is really Pok√©mon rather than Satanism). The title could well be changed. This should only be merged if you want all of the detailed information in the Pok√©mon article. I also suspect there is still some room for expansion, as the points there are only treated very briefly as bullet points. For example, how does this compare to beliefs of other supposed signs of Satanism in popular culture? Actually, <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Satanism_in_popular_culture_91fe.html" title="Allegations of Satanism in popular culture">Allegations of Satanism in popular culture</a> could be an interesting article in itself.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 21:40, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It would be an interesting article and this would of course be worthy of inclusion therein, but is anyone going to actually take on that sort of task? I suspect not, and therefore I think the debate should center on whether this should be left as a standalone article, or if what's already in Pokemon is good enough (personally, I think the main article handles it much better). <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">Katefan0</a> 21:42, Mar 10, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The section in the general Pok√©mon article certainly is introduced better, but the details in the other article should not be cut out entirely if there is a merger.

They are both historically non-<a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhotic.html" title="Rhotic">rhotic</a> and lack most <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonemic_differentiation.html#Tense-lax_neutralization" title="Phonemic differentiation">tense-lax neutralization</a>, but that's no more justification for grouping them together as a single dialect family than it is justified to group Boston and Pittsburgh together because they both have cot-caught merger. The New York accent has more in common with that of Philadelphia than with Boston's. Boston and New York accents aren't even geographically contiguous, and they don't share a common historical origin; Western New England intercedes between them and always has, and has completely different features (rhotic, tense-lax neutralizing, etc.).</p>
<p>In short, I recommend to <b>delete</b> this article because there <i>is</i> no such dialect or dialect family as "Northeastern American English". The differences between NY and Boston English are more fundamental than the similarities; and the posited "Northeastern" dialect ignores the existence of Western New England, which is also in the Northeast. The content of this article should be moved back to <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_accent.html" title="Boston accent">Boston accent</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York-New_Jersey_English_ff21.html" title="New York-New Jersey English">New York-New Jersey English</a>; the similarities between the two accents should be remarked on, but not treated as if they make the two dialects into a single one. <a href="../../../a/j/d/User%7EAjd_013d.html" title="User:Ajd">AJD</a> 18:49, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Older works on American dialectology (up through the 1940s) used to group NYC and Eastern New England into a single dialect group, usually called "Eastern" (as oppposed to Northeastern as in this article). The Eastern dialects were opposed to Southern (from Washington DC southwards) and General American (called "Northern" by John Kenyon), which was everything else. But it is true that ENE and NYC didn't share any innovations, the usual criterion by which it is decided whether two dialects descend from a common ancestor. The only innovation they both have, r-dropping, was certainly imported from England, rather than developing independently, and the South got it too, so even r-dropping isn't unique to NYC/ENE. Failing to undergo mergers before intervocalic [r] isn't an innovation either. And even if it were, some Southern accents fail to undergo those mergers too. So it's true, there's nothing (in phonology at least, I don't know enough about dialectal differences in vocabulary to say) that ENE and NYC have in common to the exclusion of all other dialects.</dd>

<li>As the person responsible for most of the content in the "Pronunciation" section (I take no responsibility for what's in the "Lexicon" section other than giving it that name and the IPA transcription of "ayuh"), I vehemently deny that it is original research or POV.

<li>10<sup>174</sup> = 2<sup>578.015</sup> so if the number of articles in Wikipedia doubled every day, it would take about one year and seven months to reach a septenquinquagintillion articles. If a disk drive can store 200 gigabytes and an average article consumes 2000 bytes then a disk drive can store 100 million articles, so this would require 10<sup>166</sup> = ten quattuorquinquagintillion disk drives, at a cost of approximately 10<sup>168</sup> = 1.0 quinquinquagintillion dollars. The world GNP is approximately 30000 billion U.S. dollars so that is about 3 * 10<sup>154</sup> world GNP's. If the entire world was willing to contribute its entire output to the project it could do so in 3 quinquagintillion years. If we rely on Wikimedia fundraisers it will take longer, so I suggest that Jimbo tell them to get started right away. (Counting on figures) Mumble... universe lifetimes... atomic radii... Archimedes and sand grains... Unless we can broaden the categories for speedy deletion, the VfD for a septenquinquagintillion-article Wikipedia will probably require something better than dialup. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:45, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<p>This article describes a Russian <a href="../../../b/e/m/Bemani.html" title="Bemani">Bemani</a> news site. It appears to be a vanity page, and the information on it isn't very encyclopedic. Being an avid Bemani fan myself, I personally have never heard of this site until recently, and I don't think it deserves an article anymore than more popular Bemani-related sites like <a href="../../../d/d/r/DDR_Freak_a06f.html" title="DDR Freak">DDR Freak</a> (recently deleted). The page is also an orphan, and I can't think of an appropriate article to link it from. --<a href="../../../p/o/i/User%7EPoiuytman_f6fc.html" title="User:Poiuytman">Poiuytman</a> 23:10, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
