<li>I hope you will consider keeping this entry. OC has more useful information for researchers than Fark.com, which also has a Wikipedia entry. Several other Wikipedia.com entries reference the election returns at OC. Unfortunately, psephologists do not have an organization to rate websites - the only competition to OC would be politics1.com. I realize you need to use objective criteria in making your decisions, and if you decide to remove the entry I will understand. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronicler3_c4ac.html" title="User:Chronicler3">Chronicler3</a> 17:06, 7 February 2006 (UTC) Chronicler3</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am a proud member of this website, and registered merely to get across to you the point that OurCampaigns is a legitimate website. A valuable political resource with no real peer in its category. Like I said, several other "legitimate" Wikipedia articles point towards the site, so having this entry merely makes Wikipedia more complete. I've often thought of personally making the OC entry, but it seems users like those above spend far too much time finding information to delete. If anything, your wisdom should be put to use in other entries where there is inaccurate information, or entires that are considered "stubs" should be expanded. This would be of far better use to the "Wikipedia community" than trying to delete all incoming information that doesn't meet some rediculous criteria. If the arguments you all were using to delete it were true, why should we have an article on artist Van Gogh? Surely, selling only one painting in his lifetime doesn't make him a notable artist, does it? I should say right now that I do not represent the bulk of the OC community, I've always been known as the "iconoclast" and "troll" of the website because I use humor in a way to get a point across. Of course, I am reminded of some "no personal attack policy" above. If you feel that you are being attacked with the phrase "GET A BRAIN MORANS" you obviously are uncultured in the political realm, nor do you have a sense of humor. User:James Crews

<li><b>Keep</b> As long as Wikipedia links OurCampaigns pages as data sources, it should dignify the site with a page. Anyone who takes the time to inspect the exhaustive database at OC will realize that it is the single most comprehensive and accurate election database on the web.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Hi, this is the creator of the site. Sorry about some of the comments from a couple of our less politic users. I also didn't put my users up to this, they decided it on their own. I undertand that my site does not quite meet your policies for inclusion, and completely understand if you determine not to include it. I thought it would be helpful to provide some information to come to your decision. I'm not looking for advertising or a huge burst in traffic right now, because our server could not support it. We rely on the slow growth method. We are an extremely data intensive site, in some ways similar to Wikipedia by being a collaborative user effort. Because of this, we have a million or so virtual pages driven by a database. Many of the sites like Alexia and Google have limited information on us because I instruct them in the robots.txt file to not crawl the site. When several search engines try to crawl a million dynamically driven pages every few days it can bring the server to its knees. I am working on something to address this issue, but it will probably not be available for six months to a year. You can see the site statistics directly at <a href="http://www.ourcampaigns.com/stats" class="external free" title="http://www.ourcampaigns.com/stats" rel="nofollow">http://www.ourcampaigns.com/stats</a> if you wish, that show us getting between 1,500 and 4,500 unique visitors a day, 17,000 pageviews and around 40,000 hits. Those numbers increase sharply around election dates. We have gotten some press, some minor exposure on television news, but those are a bit out of date. We are a different enough site that we don't quite fit into categories for site competitions like best of blog contests as we are not a blog. We may not be a media sensation, but we are a very good data resource for people. Again, thanks for your consideration and if we are not accepted we will try again once we meet your criteria.

<li><b>LISTEN</b> Why are you Wikipedia regulars so hard headed? Listen. This was not a move for advertising. As Parker said, the last thing the site needs is a tremendous influx of users. Several articles point towards OurCampaigns. Why is the only criteria for entry into Wikipedia popularity? Are you seriously telling me something must be "popular" to warrant inclusion into an encyclopedia? How popular is the field of quantum physics? Not very, but it seems to have an entry. OurCampaigns doesn't deserve an entry because it is "popular" and listed on nerdy statistical websites, but rather because it is an expansive collection of political data maintained by every day people, much like this place. The only thing is, we are far more open minded towards data entry. You won't see anyone on OC complaining that the Slovakian presidential election wasn't "popular" enough to warrant inclusion. Excuse the "personal attack" but take your heads out of wherever they may be and look at the site before you actually judge in favor of deletion. This is supposed to be a community of intellectuals, not bickering teenagers concerned with popularity. user:James Crews

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am ready for one of the Wikipedia regulars to remove the entry. This has been frustrating for a lot of people, and I don't see any reason to let it continue. The last comment by Turnstep was rather discouraging - on the list of topics not found interesting by a lot of people are anti-heroes and Goat Head Soup. There is a difference between popularity and significance. The chronicling of USA's election returns in one place is not popular but is significant. Goat's Head Soup is neither. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronicler3_c4ac.html" title="User:Chronicler3">Chronicler3</a> 23:24, 9 February 2006 (UTC) Chronicler3</li>
