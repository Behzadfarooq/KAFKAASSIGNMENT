<p>Is it Wikipedia's policy to discriminate against religious belief systems simply on the basis of numbers? Yes, much of the text has been taken from the organization's web site. As it has adequately been described there, I saw no need to reword the descriptions. - Luna Faye</p>
<dl>
<dd>With all due respect to your beliefs, this is just a matter of whether this is an encyclopedic entry. WP is not a place for advertisement, or advocacy, and there must be a bar set for notability, as it is also not an indiscriminate collection of information. Lastly, depending on who is writing this, it could even be considered original research. If the belief system becomes notable, I don't see an impediment to its inclusion, but it's just too soon. Thanks and all the best to you. --<a href="../../../d/n/i/User%7EDNicholls_483e.html" title="User:DNicholls">DNicholls</a> 03:20, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What exactly would you consider "notability or legitimate references"? The Pæthieon of Imovinn is Incorporated by the state of Ohio, and is in the process of being recognized as non-profit under the fedreal 501c3 statute. I happen to be ordained by the Church of Spiritual Humanism and the Universal Life Church, and am registered with the state of Ohio to perform services in all Ohio counties. I hold Doctorates in Divinity and Metaphysics, and am a Certified Reiki Master. How much more "legitimate" would you like? - Luna Faye</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Lots of things are incorporated by the state of Ohio, but they are not all notable. Perhaps it's not entirely fair to rely on numbers - but numbers are, at the end of the day, the best way for the Wikipedians to judge impact, and impact is what speaks to notability, in my view. And yes, the internet-ordination-giving <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Life_Church_e3fe.html" title="Universal Life Church">Universal Life Church</a> is notable, though I wouldn't know if I would say that about the Church of Spiritual Humanism - Google indicates that far fewer people have even heard of it, its impact is likely less. But this is beside the point, Luna Faye. The notability of your religious affiliations won't convince people that another religion, which you are also interested in, is notable. If <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Graham_526a.html" title="Billy Graham">Billy Graham</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>, and <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> got together and started a new relegion and, for whatever reason, relatively few joined or talked about it or cared, then it wouldn't be notable. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirmob_3a04.html" title="User:Sirmob">Sirmob</a> 04:05, 26 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>the internet-ordination-giving <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Life_Church_e3fe.html" title="Universal Life Church">Universal Life Church</a> is notable</i>: Ooh, thank you; this means that my ordination is notable. Wanna be ordinated too, <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirmob_3a04.html" title="User:Sirmob">Sirmob</a>? (This may serve to impress the pious.) Costs nothing, takes only three minutes!

<p>And yet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_Humanism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_Humanism" rel="nofollow">Spiritual Humanism</a> does have a Wikipedida article and external link, though being considered less than notable? So precisely how many members does the Pæthieon of Imovinn require befor being consered "Notable"? - Luna Faye</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, you'll notice that's the abstract term, which is notable, not the church. The church is just linked.--<a href="../../../d/n/i/User%7EDNicholls_483e.html" title="User:DNicholls">DNicholls</a> 04:13, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Again, precisely how many members does the Pæthieon of Imovinn require befor being consered "Notable"? - Luna Faye</p>
<ul>
<li>For me, it's less about numbers, and more about impact on the world at large. Your group might be important and interesting to its own members, but otherwise, no one is likely to care. Show us some <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable</a> sources that indicate interest in your group from the <i>outside</i> – newspaper or magazine articles, for example. It may be that your group is too new to have garnered any outside coverage, but that would then be part of the problem. Also, keep in mind that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>, and you should not attempt to use it to promote your beliefs. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 04:17, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Not Notable, but more importantly, the "List OF Truths" is a <b>POV</b> in itself. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 04:22, 26 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> To claim you and your belief system are being discriminated against in this proceedure is offensive. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 04:25, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Here are two OUTSIDE articles that I had nothing to do with: Chronicles of Avalon <a href="http://www.chroniclesofavalon.com/current.html" class="external free" title="http://www.chroniclesofavalon.com/current.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chroniclesofavalon.com/current.html</a></p>
<p>Traditions Magazine <a href="http://www.traditionsmagazine.com/features.html" class="external free" title="http://www.traditionsmagazine.com/features.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.traditionsmagazine.com/features.html</a></p>
<p>Be offended all you want. To claim that a belief system is not notable simply because it is new or does not have vast numbers of members simply is discrimination. This is not upholding the idea of "free, open content, community-built encyclopedia" that Wikipedia claims.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Luna Faye misunderstood my use of the word <i>offensive</i>. I meant it in the sense of one attacking another for disagreeing with their POV. I felt Luna Faye was being <i>offensive</i> by their implication that the discussion and reasoning for this topic to be considered for a vote for deletion was discriminatory. Luna Faye has however, indicated that they are comfortable with offending people.

<p>Someone please tell me in no uncertain terms, since people can't seem to agree on what makes something notable, how many outside articles, or members Imovinn will require, so that I might know when to resubmit the article? - Luna Faye</p>
<ul>
<li>As I said, WP is not an indiscriminate collection of info. There's no strict number, but as a general rule: when it's time for someone to submit an article for a religion, it won't be the founder submitting it. (And I am trying to say that in all charity, excuse me if it sounds harsh.)--<a href="../../../d/n/i/User%7EDNicholls_483e.html" title="User:DNicholls">DNicholls</a> 04:36, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Good first rule of thumb. As I said, from my perspective it's rarely really about numbers, numbers are just often a good indicator of underlying impact. And I don't think additional sources exactly quoting you or written by you are ever going to count strongly towards the total. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirmob_3a04.html" title="User:Sirmob">Sirmob</a> 04:48, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

</dd>

<ul>
<li>There is no concrete number. Inclusion is determined by community consensus. We have set standards for some things, but not for religious groups (or so far as I am aware). I will have a look at your references at a later time. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 04:38, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>

Quote "when it's time for someone to submit an article for a religion, it won't be the founder submitting it." Well that doesn't make much sence. Who better than the founder of something to understand and describe it's ideas and principals? - Luna Faye</p>
<dl>
<dd>Answer: An objective, disinterested, outside observer. We don't want Oprah writing the article about Oprah, for example. As harsh as that might sound, we dedicated Wikipedians apply the same standard here. If you are a scientist, a religious movement, a politician, a corporate executive, or a professor, your impact and accomplishments have to be well-enough known for other people to write about them. Read the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral Point of View</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What Wikipedia is Not</a> guidelines for more info.</dd>
<dd>Honestly, no one is discriminating, except in the sense of making choices. It is no reflection on the validity or worthiness of the religion as a belief system. When we say not notable, we mean it hasn't had a broad effect on the world yet, and one of the Wikipedia guidelines is that you don't get to use this encyclopedia to help it achieve that notability. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidH_d410.html" title="User:DavidH">DavidH</a> 05:22, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Quote "And I don't think additional sources exactly quoting you or written by you are ever going to count strongly towards the total." You're right, I did write the article for Traditions Magazine. I forgot I had written that one. My bad. I didn't however, even know about the other article untill recently doing a Yahoo search for Imovinn. I can't help it that the author chose not to alter the definition of Imovinn in any way. I'm not displeased by it, I just had nothing to do with it. - Luna Faye</p>

If anyone can write a page about their religion which we are not permitted to delete on the grounds of political correctness, regardless of notability, then we might as well have a new page for every person on the planet.
