<p>The result was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about what this list is; it uses a precise definition of "charismatic leader." Setting this aside, there still seems to be some disagreement whether it's possible to categorically describe a person as a "charismatic leader" even by the dictates of that precise definition. It may help to add some prose explaining how each entry on this list meets that definition. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 04:38, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: This proponent of deleting the article has read Max Weber and still thinks this article should be deleted. Did you read our article on charismatic authority? The first sentence contains the phrase "exceptional sanctity, heroism or exemplary character". The caption on the top picture states that "Jesus is <i>considered</i> by many historians ..." Just because they aren't based on <i>your</i> POV <i>does not</i> mean that they <i>aren't</i> POV. Someone else's POV is also not acceptable. - <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheNuevara_65d1.html" title="User:CheNuevara">CheNuevara</a> 21:31, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Once again, many of you seem to misunderstand the concept of a charismatic leader. While the article is in need of attention and should clarify the distinction between charismatic, legal, and traditional authority to avoid confusion, this is not reason enough to remove the article. The tripartite theory of authority is an important element of both political science and sociology, and articles classifying specific leaders in authority-groups are helpful and encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../n/e/m/User%7ENEMT_33ce.html" title="User:NEMT">NEMT</a> 21:11, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> You still seem to be missing the point. There is no POV. Charismatic authority describes the method of gaining and/or holding power through rallying public suppot as opposed to other methods such as being part of a hereditary ruling class or elected majority, it has nothing to do with anyone's personal opinion of a leader or his/her actual or perceived level of charisma of competence. --<a href="../../../n/e/m/User%7ENEMT_33ce.html" title="User:NEMT">NEMT</a> 21:51, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Another comment to this comment</b> perhaps this could benefit from a better description of what constitutes "listed sources"? Right now it seems to indicate that if someone categorizes a leader according to Weber's distinction <i>anywhere in print</i> it should go on the list, but that doesn't take into account disputes or disagreements about the classification and is rightly near-useless and confusing. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font style="color:#DC2163;">Z</font>iggurat</a> 21:37, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> regardless of any misunderstanding on the part of the nominator, this article does not appear to have encylopedic content, or the potential for encyclopedic content. It should be moved to a willing editor's User space, and removed from the article namespace. There is too much room for disagreement, and no means exists to establish facts which will support the application of this theory. --71.36.251.182 21:16, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Question</b>: Can somebody please explain why s/he considers the list POV?

<li><b>Question</b>: Can somebody please explain to me why <a href="../../../f/i/d/Fidel_Castro_ecc2.html" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> is not on that list?

<li><b>Comment</b> This seems to be a fruitless discussion as the advocates of deleting the article continually ignore the clarification of charismatic authority's definition and refuse to acknowledge any misunderstanding. We can only hope the wiki admins will have more sense. The article should be partially rewritten to include further explanations of tripartite authority, however, it should <b>not</b> be deleted, and it is <b>not</b> POV. --<a href="../../../n/e/m/User%7ENEMT_33ce.html" title="User:NEMT">NEMT</a> 22:59, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. The best that this article can accomplish is to be one of the biggest POV arguments on Wikipedia.70.106.115.245 01:03, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>—that it might develop into POV discussions (for example by those that are appalled that George Bush isn't there and Bill Clinton is) is not a reason to delete. It is a reason to participate in a reasoned discussion to determine whether the list is correct.

<li><b>Comment</b> While I don't doubt the legitimacy of a list detailing those described under Weber's definition, the title of this article implies anything but. He does not have a monopoly on the use of the term "charismatic leader", and I don't think it's enough to mention this condition in the intro. Almost any reader would interpret the title as it stands to be a general (and POV) description, and people could (quite rightly) dispute why Weber's definition was the only one selected for such a generic topic. The solution seems to be either renaming this article, or merging it to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charismatic_authority.html" title="Charismatic authority">Charismatic authority</a>. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font style="color:#DC2163;">Z</font>iggurat</a> 01:52, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The list is unavoidably POV, and would be subject to edit wars over which POV is the 'correct' one. The examples of Clinton and Dubya are such polarizing figures that a 'reasoned discussion' is sadly a pipe dream. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 02:27, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

I can only reiterate that this is a notable academic concept - read this <a href="http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/ssh6.htm#Charisma" class="external text" title="http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/ssh6.htm#Charisma" rel="nofollow">"Charisma"</a>, and <a href="http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/o12f99.htm" class="external text" title="http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/o12f99.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> or <a href="http://cbae.nmsu.edu/~dboje/teaching/338/charisma.htm" class="external text" title="http://cbae.nmsu.edu/~dboje/teaching/338/charisma.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> or this: <a href="http://www.tricksterbook.com/BookDescriptions/Sociology.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.tricksterbook.com/BookDescriptions/Sociology.htm" rel="nofollow">"Charisma is central to Max Weber’s theories of authority, power, and domination"</a> I could go on all day...</li>

Also, though the theory stems from Weber it plays a continuing role in the study of political science. See my links above.

Others have addressed most of the salient points supra, but it should be said that, pace <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheNuevara_65d1.html" title="User:CheNuevara">User:CheNuevara</a>, whilst a <i>third party POV is still not a neutral one</i>, where such POV is presented as the subjective (or even objective) contentions of another, we've no problem (toward which, see, e.g., <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, viz., that <i>the threshold for inclusion...is <b>verifiability, not truth</b></i> [emphasis in original]). To be sure, the pronouncements of a non-notable individual or the non-notable pronoucements of a notable individual aren't encyclopedic, but the dispositive issues there are, principally, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>; where a classification system or subjective treatment is notable (either in view of its currency or of the prominence of its proponents), such concerns do not entail. Consider, for example, the <a href="http://tigger.uic.edu/~mckenzie/barber.html" class="external text" title="http://tigger.uic.edu/~mckenzie/barber.html" rel="nofollow">attitudinal taxonomy</a> of James Barber, which surely, even as it seeks to interpret objective facts through objective criteria, is necessarily subjective; the conclusions of Barber, though, are surely notable. The argument here is not unlike one that could be essayed toward the deletion of, to name an article I created, <a href="../../../w/n/b/WNBA%27s_All-Decade_Team_2452.html" title="WNBA's All-Decade Team">WNBA's All-Decade Team</a>, inasmuch as such list is POV; the list, though, is promulgated by a notable organization, and the conclusions of that organization are notable. The only distinction here is as to titling, and the list might be moved in order that it should be clear that the assessments of charisma are not those of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 23:53, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It is a notable political science concept that is very encyclopedic. I do agree that the terminology needs to be better expressed. I suspect the POV claims are tied into a base assumption that calling someone charismatic is inherently a POV descriptor (either positive or negative). If the article could better outline "Charismatic authority" and demonstrate the neutrality of the term more it would go a long way towards quelling the POV fears. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 18:20, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> original research. By the way, as a professional historian influenced by Weberian political sociology, I must say that I strongly disagree with the classification of many leaders of Western liberal democracies as examples of "charismatic" authority. These kinds of classifications should be made by professional political scientists, not Wikipedia editors. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 17:54, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> No, no 172 - This list is not original research it is sourced - or at least it should be sourced - to political science analysis. Anyone who has spent any time reading or listening to political philosophers debate examples of various leaders and how they relate to concepts of the three forms of legitimacy would testify to the legitimacy of the need for <i>examples</i>. The title should be "List of leaders described as examples of charismatic authority" or something similar. And that should be the end of it.--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 18:42, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, no Zleitzen - Just because something happens to be "sourced" does not mean it is not original research. Political scientists disagree on these classifications considerably. At present, any Wikipedia editor can dig up something by any author describing any random leader as "charismatic," regardless of whether or not the "source" happens to be a serious scholar of Weberian political sociology. This article is beyond the realm of what Wikipedia editors are qualified to do. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 20:22, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Scholars do not necessarily interpret and apply the work of Max Weber in a consistent way. The very selection of whom we cite in this entry is an act of original research and imposing a POV in itslef. While I make a career of doing so off Wikipedia, my own original research and POV is no more appropriate than that of any other Wikipedia editor on Wikipedia.
