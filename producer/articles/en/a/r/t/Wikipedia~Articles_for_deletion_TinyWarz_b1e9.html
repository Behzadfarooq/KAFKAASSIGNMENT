<li><b>Keep</b> Blue's News (a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Reliable_source.html" title="Reliable source">reliable source</a>) source is not to a message board link, Blue's News archives have a message-board like format. Game was awarded Most Innovative of 2006 by an independent game news site that is also a blog. Lastly, TinyWarz is a notable independent game that is significantly different that other wikipedia-listed browser based games, over half of which have no sources (<a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution_%28MMOG%29_46e2.html" title="Evolution (MMOG)">Evolution</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Pardus_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Pardus (computer game)">Pardus</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planetarion.html" title="Planetarion">Planetarion</a>, Shartak ... etc.) see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_browser_games.html" title="List of browser games">wikipedia's list of browser-based games</a>. BlKat
<ul>
<li>Blue's News doesn't actually have any information about TinyWarz, and I see no reason to separate this weblog from any of the hundreds of thousands of other weblogs out there. Those other games that you've mentioned could also be facing deletion soon (though they're not relevant to this discussion). Notability is not determined subjectively- it has to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 05:23, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd disagree, Blue's News chose to recommend TinyWarz to their readership, that represents a notable achievement for an indie game - are you saying that if CNN were to provide a link to an unknown news site that simply read "Great News Here" that wouldn't be significant? Those other games are relevant to this discussion, TinyWarz was given 6 hours to demonstrate <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, the authors of those pages were given weeks, months, and even years to get them into shape (I don't want to pull out <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>, but something seems seriously wrong with this). BlKat</li>
<li>You have until this AFD is closed to bring the article up to standards. Furthermore, <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a> is not an argument. Finally, one will notice that in the past <b>day</b> this site has recommend in an identical fashion no fewer than <b>4</b> games, all of which appear to be "indie", as it is put. As this site seems to be nothing but a link aggregator of stuff they think is "cool", I can't in good faith think that being linked to in such a fashion is at all notable. So, I'll say <b>Delete</b>, as well. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 06:14, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In fact, upon further searching, there appears to be something like 40-odd games recommended in this fashion, with no substantive comment, since the start of 2007. You can't seriously contend that satisfies <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 06:20, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, you have a serious <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> commenting on this issue without disclosing that you're the primary contributor to the article in question, and then suggesting <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> may apply here. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 06:22, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>So your main gripe about this article is the citation? I'm sorry but for a game of TinyWarz' size official recognition is few and far between. The author used what he/she could find, but the rest of the information is about the game itself. How is it possible to cite information if there is little outside information on the game to BEGIN with? Dr. Mordecai 18:29, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I found this game originaly from that Blues News link. Blues news is a major link sight with comment. I even bought and wore out one of their T shirts. The Journalistic content of Blues News is their. I have seen Commenary and such that brought me back to that sight over and over, just to find out what Blues Dog had done now. I love Blues news and defenetly repect it as a great source of news and info. I really enjoyed the filter of links that he provides to both game and none game topics. There is so much on the internet that one can read, and the job of a good link sight is to tell or suggest to you what you might find interesting, and Blues News Does that for me in spades. 70.59.86.64 19:11, 28 February 2007 (UTC)Walterohdim
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - how is this any sort of argument for notability? A link, without any comment, from a site that links to many, many sites in a similar fashion does not notability make. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 01:43, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> As a newbee to Wikipedia, I have got a few question to the person who have proposed to delete this article.
<ul>
<li>Do you really believe, that games are not a part of our (human) culture and civilization? If you think that several web based games are irrelevant here, why don't you propose to delete the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a> article? It is not web-based, but still a game.</li>
<li>Do you really believe, that small things do not deserve placing here? Let's take an example of a small city of <a href="../../../z/a/b/Zabrze.html" title="Zabrze">Zabrze</a> in Poland. Do you really believe, that it should be deleted, only because the external links lead to something that was created by Poles, who are definitely not objective (like people from the Tiny Warz community), and so they are not reliable? Should we keep small, new things, especially if thay have something special (like TinyWarz 2D graphics interface)? I allways thought, Wikipedians want to be leaders, and not the followers. Or maybe I am too new here to understand the idea of Wikipedia?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Having read what you have typed, I think that the most serious problem here is that the TinyWarz is not important enough, to deserve being placed in the Wikipedia. Am I right? That is true, TinyWars is a mere entertainment, and does not pretend to be something as important as the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>. But we do have articles about other games and sports, that are also not so important, don't we?</li>
<li>One more thing: the same google query, as proposed by <a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a>, but with "-forum" modifier gives 80k hits. Moreover, it is more reasonable to expect some info about a game on website like pc.gamezone.com than at BBC, CNN or in the .edu and .gov domaines. In my opinion, in this case some .edu sites should be cosidered less reliable.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe, that information is not documented enough, maybe you could place the same warning as for the Vietnam War? Rafkory 20:17, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> this is absurd. If you want to argue that the guidelines under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> should not apply, then <i>argue this on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a></i>, not here. Guidelines are not subjective, and, yes, non-notable things do not belong on Wikipeida. As a "newbie", perhaps you should review <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, since your suggestion violates both of these. The article on the Vietnam War is exceedingly well document, and the topic is notable. This article is not.</li>
<li>In addition, subtracting forum means you're getting hits <i>from their forums</i>. It's absurd to claim that makes it notable in any way, shape or forum. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 01:43, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Updated sourcing and game type - massively multiplayer turn-based strategy, which makes TinyWarz unique.

<li>Yes, they probably will be deleted once I have the time to research/nominate them. However, the source provided is just a reprinted press release- it was submitted by some random. I could also submit news via the "Submit news" option just below it. It also hasn't "created" a new genre if nothing about that genre has been mentioned yet (though most mentions of this "genre" point to a game called <a href="../../../e/v/e/Evernight.html" title="Evernight">Evernight</a>, which is also of dubious standing). --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 03:45, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>... "<i>could also be facing deletion</i>", "<i>probably will be deleted</i>" - can you be any more transparent? You don't intend to delete those articles or nominate them for lack of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> (you've had <b>years</b> to it). This one is an easy target, it's still being built; so you can flex your wiki-muscle by going after it. I was really looking forward to joining the wikipedia community, but after this demonstration I think I'll be staying away. I'm not going to join a community that works so hard to destroy the work of others. BlKat
<ul>
<li>I'm not flexing "wikimuscle" at all- I've had articles deleted/nominated for deletion here too. I'm a student, so I have a weird, and often crowded schedule, which means I can't just make a dozen nominations at once. We're all new at some point, and we don't always know how things go around here. If you want some examples of "more established" articles I've nominated for deletion, then here you go: (they're all of the same variety as this one)

<li><b>Comment</b> - you have until this AFD closes to bring it up to standards. If this topic really is notable, then you should have no problems doing that. If you <i>can</i> bring it up to standards, I would gladly rescind my objections to inclusion. As it stands, you have not made any serious progress towards doing this, and my objections stand. I also seriously object to any accusation of <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> - enforcing Wikipedia's guidelines in a civil and forthright manner is not "biting" anyone, and I find it tests the boundaries of my good will to be repeatedly accused of it in this discussion. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 05:05, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, lack of credible citations is listed as a problem which "may not require deletion" in the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Deletion_policy.html" title="Deletion policy">Deletion_policy</a>. Furthermore, the policy states that for deletion, the article must clearly violate the notability requirement. Tinywarz was cited by a popular game news website, and has over 30,000 external references (from google), so it's not <b>clearly</b> non-notable. In fact, looking at the pages that were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=0&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=0&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">deleted</a> for being "not notable", it seems this reason is used exclusively for entries which have no external references at all. The two obscure web-games brought up earlier also had <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Shartak_8b38.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shartak">deletion</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Planetarion_b9d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Planetarion">discussions</a> over notability, and both were kept. --<a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYaroslavvb_922f.html" title="User:Yaroslavvb">yaroslavvb</a>
<ul>
<li>From the deletion policy: <i>Articles and text which are capable of meeting these should usually be remedied by editing, but content which <b>fails inclusion criteria for Wikipedia</b>, is <b>incapable of verification with reputable sources</b>, or is in breach of copyright policy, is usually deleted.</i> Those other articles, while not relevant to this discussion, should really be renominated (they defaulted to a "keep" because of lack of substantial discussion). --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 04:34, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Again, we have <i>specifically</i> addressed this argument. This article does not meet standards under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, and therefore does not qualify for inclusion. The fact that <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a> has absolutely no bearing whatsoever on this - especially when the keep was procedural! None of the sources assert, or support notability for this game, and, frankly, you aren't even arguing they do. Instead, you have decided that we should just ignore policy because, apparently, <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>. This is not a compelling argument, and I strongly urge you to read up on the guidelines under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> before making arguments that run directly contrary to Wikipedia policy. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a></li>

<li><b>REPLY</b> Is there a problem with having information in an encyclopedia? Why are you (you being the collective group of "editors") attacking internet games, vying for their deletion? Allowing SOME information in and deleting others based on arbitrary, albeit confusing rules seems to be more of a restriction of information. How are we supposed to fix the page when it's doomed from the get-go? Is there anything you could suggest that would be HELPFUL and not as negative as deleting it?Dr. Mordecai 04:37, 1 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The rules are not arbitrary- Wikipedia cannot be a primary source. Only <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">attributable</a> information is allowed to be used. While this page might be "doomed from the get go", there are tons of other articles that need work.

<li>Echoing this, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> an indiscriminate collection of information. No one is attacking anything, and the rules are neither confusing nor arbitrary. To repeat, notability is <b>not</b> an arbitrary, nor a subjective attribute of topic. Either bring the article up to standards, or it will be deleted. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 05:05, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK, For one thing, I'd like to know. Other than DrMordecai and Whistlese, have any of you people played the game? If you had, you'd know that there are MANY reliable sources in the game, for the game! Jesus, by your warped logic, all the articles on online games lack "reliable sources" - except for all the commercial games. Does anyone here in your so called "Editor's Circle" have anything useful to say to help us? How can we improve the TW page?

<ul>
<li>Find game reviews from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Most often, online games are kept because they have had a full-length review printed in a widely syndicated gaming magazine. If you can't find one of those, try and find full-length reviews from websites that don't contain user-submitted reviews/recommendations/etc. Articles in major newspapers too. The only catch with all this is that the articles must have more than a passing mention (ie, more than a short blurb). Reliable sources have some sort of editorial oversight and credibility to them; Wikipedia articles are only as credible as their sources- if the sources aren't credible, then the information isn't credible, meaning it should be removed. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 05:44, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wafulz, in regard to the use of "LOL" here is the introduction to the staff page:</li>

<p>"The distinguished staff of TIGSource are a varied lot, culled from all over cyberspace to bring you all your indie gaming news, all the time.</p>
<p>Want to join the elite ranks of volunteers? Just pop me an e-mail telling me why you're fit to be a TIGSource editor. Probably the easiest way to get accepted to TIGSource is to have good writing skills - just because we're casual and fun doesn't mean that we type like monkeys! The second is enthusiasm. You gotta love indie games. Both should be reflected in your e-mail, so don't slouch!"</p>
<p>They may not be proffessional but they are an independent source and quite numerous. The main fact we're trying to get across is that this game does not have major recognition but does have unbaised reviews from external sources. Provided this page continues to exist we will continue updating and trying to gain more "appropriate" reviews for more distinguished sources. But you must understand that if you kill this site from the start than we'll barely have the chance to do so. Also Haemo, "obvious reasons" isn't a phrase I particularly like, these guides are very wordy and difficult to translate into real english. If you would care to properly articulate why this latest reference is unworthy, it would be appreciated. --Jester</p>

<dd>Well, from your excerpt: "<i>Want to join the elite ranks of volunteers? Just pop me an e-mail telling me why you're fit to be a TIGSource editor. Probably the easiest way to get accepted to TIGSource is to have good writing skills.</i>" Basically, anyone can become a "game reviewer" for the site provided they write well (which is really subjective judging from the entries). These people don't even have to be well-versed in anything online, let alone in games, which speaks piles about their credibility. It's the same as picking up someone off the street and asking them their opinion of the game.</dd>
<dd>I've done a pretty exhaustive search for good sources, and it doesn't look like the article has a chance of surviving. If you'd like, an administrator can have a copy of the article moved to your user page (or someone else's), sort of "housing" it until better sources (assuming they exist) come up sometime in the future. This is probably the best solution available right now- it won't have an article, but all the work on won't be lost. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 06:30, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I could become a writer for that website. I could make a post going "Hey I heard about this game TinyWarz. It's really lousy and awful, avoid it at all costs." I don't even have to prove that I've played it, and yet by that site's standards I could write whatever I feel like. Anyone can write for it- it's not a good source, and that should be pretty clear. Earth 2025 has won two Webby Awards, which clearly meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and has had multiple reviews (though only one is cited, I'll admit). These reviews are not user-submitted, and they actually have names attached to them too. Its publisher has also been named as a featured publisher by <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_Media_8cf0.html" title="Right Media">Right Media</a>.

I believe you are trying to apply <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> too strictly. Looking at the first several dozen deletions due to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> in deletions log, they seem to be used for entries with no external references at all, not the case here. --<a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYaroslavvb_922f.html" title="User:Yaroslavvb">yaroslavvb</a>

Another entry I contributed to (<a href="../../../m/o/r/Morphological_image_processing.html" title="Morphological image processing">Morphological_image_processing</a>) took several months before even one external source was found.

If they exist, and if any are found, I'm sure they can be mentioned on this article's new home on the Tinywarz wiki- there's no need to keep unsourced material here just for the sake of keeping it <i>just in case</i> some sources exist. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 00:43, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reason to keep unsourced material is because it was just added, and the wikipedia community hasn't had enough time to add sources. The argument here seems to be that the if the Wikipedia community doesn't find sources within 5 days, the entry must be deleted. That is against the spirit of Wikipedia, and you can find many entries for which the sources were added weeks or months after the entry's creation. Similar discussion took place over deletion of <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Throne_5a35.html" title="Dark Throne">Dark Throne</a> entry and the decision was to keep the article with "Unreferenced" template -- <a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYaroslavvb_922f.html" title="User:Yaroslavvb">yaroslavvb</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Furthermore, why would any editor produce an article in good faith that they knew did not meet standards? That violates not only Wikipedia policies, but the principle of the Encyclopedia itself. A hypothetical future source, which no one can find or produce, does not notability make. --02:59, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Editors are not paid, and you can't expect all the editors to always reference their information, that's why they put it on wiki where other people can add references. As far as notability, I think you are trying to apply it too strictly. I gave two examples which are very similar to tinywarz (in a sense that google doesn't give reliable sources) and for which discussion over notability led to a negative ( <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Shartak_8b38.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shartak">Shartak</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Planetarion_b9d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Planetarion">Planetarion</a>). If you look at the list of recent deletions over notability, you'll see that it's used almost exclusively to delete one/two paragraph entries with people writing about themselves, or things that can't be found on google at all. -- <a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYaroslavvb_922f.html" title="User:Yaroslavvb">yaroslavvb</a>

<li><i>If you look at the list of recent deletions over notability, you'll see that it's used almost exclusively to delete one/two paragraph entries with people writing about themselves, or things that can't be found on google at all</i>. I don't know where you're getting this from- while it is sometime the case, it's certainly not exclusive. Material must be <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">attributable</a> from the get go. There's no way around this. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 16:41, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that it must be attributable, but just don't agree that five days is long enough for wikipedia community to find proper attribution. Five days is too short to delete it for lack of sources, number of internet references to tinywarz and people interested in this topic is too large to delete it for lack notability. --<a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYaroslavvb_922f.html" title="User:Yaroslavvb">Yaroslavvb</a>
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure of your logic here. You seem to be claiming that the 'number of internet references' and number of 'people interested' is 'too large', yet say you (or someone else) can't find a couple of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> when you're given five days. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 19:07, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's pretty typical of Wikipedia though. I'm willing to bet that most entries in wikipedia existed without any references for the first couple of weeks (just look at History for some random pages), and had references added later. You can't expect the original the first 1 or 2 editors to fill out all required information, that's the whole point of having the Wikipedia community to fall back on. All I'm saying is that we should tag the page with "Unreferenced" template as and give some time for the wikipedia community to fill in the sources (a month maybe?). --<a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYaroslavvb_922f.html" title="User:Yaroslavvb">Yaroslavvb</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It seams to me, that the problem editors are trying to point out, is the lack of the notoriety <b>that is confirmed by independent sources</b>, that are reliable from the editors point of view. In such cases, there are two solutions proposed: either to delete, or to <b>merge</b> with the article, that stisfies the criterion of notoriety. The same was propsed for the <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Monica%27s_Church%2C_Barre_f1d3.html" title="Saint Monica's Church, Barre">Saint Monica's Church, Barre</a>: "Merge into Barre, Vermont." Do the editors believe, that the article about the web games satisfy the standards? If so, we might just propse to move TW to that article, until the <i>right</i> sources are found.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Telling the true, due to the nature of the web games (all of them) they need a lot of time to become known to so called "general public", unless they have a big company supporting it, that is able to spend money on PR. If I may use the analogy, the same sittuation is with the SF books in Poland. Books published in big number of copies are not either mentioned by the "mainstream" magazines, that are sponsored by the Ministery of Culture, as there are not "serious" enough. Using this criterion, you would not be allowed to place any SF authors in Polish Wikipedia but Isaac Assimov, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_K._Dick_87c3.html" title="Philip K. Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem_c9b6.html" title="Stanisław Lem">Stanisław Lem</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Bulgakov_4d5c.html" title="Mikhail Bulgakov">Mikhail Bulgakov</a> and authors, whose books were used for making a movie picture. For all the other authors, the sources that exist are linked to SF community, and not the official 'literature' organisations, i.e. they do not satisfy the independence criterion .</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> this oddly feels like a continuation or expansion of the recent slate of afd's for various webcomics. if that is deliberate or accidental is a completely different debate. however, from what i have been able to glean from those debates, the afd should be the _second step_ after a request for sources hasn't been met. but, somebody will probably say if such is formal policy or just basic politeness. so base question, was that formal request for sources even made, or did somebody just light the primer cord on the article without even making the cursory attempt to start the process to fix it. 70.51.53.37 14:33, 1 March 2007 (UTC) steuben (fixing my spelling)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> WP:WEB is an invalid arguement in this case. tinywarz is a game not a website. it is a game that happens to played through &lt;insert browser here&gt;. if tinywarz was played through a downloaded and separate client then the WP:WEB arguement would not apply. so by extenstion neither does the WP:WEB here. unless Wafulz would like to expand on reasons for including the wp:web argument.70.51.53.37 16:35, 1 March 2007 (UTC)steuben</p>

<dd>You answered your own question. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> applies because you <i>don't</i> download anything to play. You said so yourself, you have to launch a <b>web</b> browser, go to the <b>web</b> site and play the game whilst surfing the <b>web</b>. There is no 'by extension', <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> applies to web sites, and this game is played through a web site. Or to put it another way, the website is the game and the game is the website. Very simple, no big leap of logic needed. Looking at your argument, what you have essentially said is: <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> doesn't apply because you play the game through a web site. If you had to download anything, then <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> would indeed not apply. It is then covered by <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> and this article would STILL be here in an AfD.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 16:38, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I disagree with such an argument for basically the same reasons. First of all, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> does apply, as per Kinslayer's argument. Moreover, <i>even if it did not</i> the reason for deletion is per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, which <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is a subset of - thus, a simple reductio argument shows that deletion is the proper standard in either respect. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 16:51, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would also just like to comment that, despite assertions to the contrary, this AFD has been linked to from the TinyWarz wiki <a href="http://wiki.mobrulestudios.com/index.php?title=Main_Page" class="external free" title="http://wiki.mobrulestudios.com/index.php?title=Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.mobrulestudios.com/index.php?title=Main_Page</a> by a developer. So, I would suggest tagging SPA's as they arise. On the plus side, the TinyWarz page has apparently also been TransWiki'd to their personal Wiki, so we can avoid having to do that. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 16:59, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
