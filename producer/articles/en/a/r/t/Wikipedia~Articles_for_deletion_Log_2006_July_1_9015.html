<li><b>Keep</b> - I would argue that it is notable, although it may not perfectly fit according to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_Songs_5d80.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines/Songs">Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines/Songs</a>, which is currently just a proposed policy after all. It is at least fairly well known as an internet phenomenon, and I would argue that the article, though short, does add an important piece of information about it by stating that it is not a System of a Down song as is commonly believed. A quick look at the talk page for <a href="../../../s/y/s/System_of_a_Down_7ea2.html" title="System of a Down">System of a Down</a> shows that this is a fairly widely held belief. I'll admit that it might be hard to find sources for something like this, but I still think that it is notable and the sources issue can most likely be worked out.--Derco 00:47, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The clan has been the second most influential online community to Ensemble Studios, after HeavenGames. I think that's quite notable. Anyone who has ever visited HeavenGames knows of both the Flying Purple Hippo and the clan. Just because you know nothing about a topic, don't assume it is of "insufficient notability". Furthermore, 462 members is hardly a small membership roll, compared to most online groups that have wikipedia entries.</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>no consensus</b>. Sorry, but there isn't a sufficiently overwhelming majority for deletion here to be called 'consensus', and lists like this <i>can</i> be sourced - the counterpart for films is significantly better-sourced than this. This list isn't <i>intrinisically</i> unverifiable.</p>
<p>Given the concern expressed over this list's sourcing (most if not all delete supporters cite this as their reasoning, and many supporters also admit that this is a problem), I encourage editors to be <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a> and remove every single song that doesn't cite a reliable, well-respected source. Don't worry, you probably won't have to spend the next few weeks defending your edits - in my experience, when people find lists in Wikipedia they add their own pet thoughts and then never look at the article again, so if you remove those thoughts you don't encounter any opposition. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 03:49, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> the article cites sources and is not POV, it is referable to polling, sales and the like. Same applies largely for the others. This will always invite debate, but the listings are not referable purely to the editors' opinions.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The contributors have done a good job sourcing their statements and providing relevant context, which is what an encyclopedia <i>should</i> do. If there's a problem with selection bias, the appropriate response is "fix it," not "delete it." If you don't have time, that's fine, but don't deny someone else the opportunity to fix the article. I'd also like to second the "bad form on nom" comments. Continually renominating things for AfD because the "right" consensus wasn't achieved is just wrong. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 17:33, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, the last times this article was nominated were in November and December 2005, so I don't see what the problem is in nominating it again over 6 months later especially when the majority of the problems mentioned in the last two AfDs were not fixed and it continues to fail NPOV and NOR miserably. There are thousands of polls constantly taken all across the world by many different organizations (television shows, magazines, websites, critic lists, etc). Even if a song is voted #1 on some random worst song poll, I don't see how it is automatically eligible to be considered the worst ever. This article picks and chooses certain songs to display. Many statements are opiniated and do not even mention sources and others that do, do not even provide a link to the actual poll data. No matter how much cleanup it goes through, it will always be an extremely POV list.

<li><b>Delete</b> - unencyclopedic. We've been through this before with other lists. Where does it end? "List of songs in English that someone doesn't like"? "List of songs in English that make someone want to puke"? The whole thing about "indiscriminate lists" is that a list should be helpful in some fashion. Lists like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_00_ZIP_codes_b43b.html" title="List of 00 ZIP codes">List of 00 ZIP codes</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Acts_of_Parliament_in_Singapore_b307.html" title="List of Acts of Parliament in Singapore">List of Acts of Parliament in Singapore</a> may not be particularly encyclopedic, but they serve a function - they show redlinked articles that need to be created. Something like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_NCAA_college_football_rivalry_games_1c50.html" title="List of NCAA college football rivalry games">List of NCAA college football rivalry games</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_NCAA_Division_I-A_Football_Programs_9349.html" title="List of NCAA Division I-A Football Programs">List of NCAA Division I-A Football Programs</a> is useful, because it shows you more information than you can get out of just a category.

<li>Thanks. Reading the article I have one editorial comment: There is no such thing as consensus in matters of musical taste. I might say Keep but only if this list can be renamed and restricted to songs that have been <i>voted</i> worst songs in meaningful polls (with a definition what <i>meaningful</i> entails).

<li><b>Please note</b>. I have just been through the article and deleted the editor's own descriptions of the songs (which I feel are probably accurate as it happens).

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem here is that the author has simply picked and chosen whatever entries he dislikes from these lists and included them in this article.

The only possible way this article can avoid violating both these policies is if the article was rewritten to show the top five or top ten of various "worst song lists" from reputable sources, ie VH1, BBC, Rolling Stone, etc. However, in that case, it is merely listcruft, and violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> as it would be an indiscriminate collection of information. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 16:20, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I've just spent some time trying to tidy up the article - deleting sections which have no sources or which are contradictory. Putting in references and links. I dislike the idea of long standing articles being deleted - especially articles which have survived two previous delete votes - but this article, and the two related articles: <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_considered_the_worst_ever.html" title="Films considered the worst ever">Films considered the worst ever</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_in_English_labeled_the_best_ever_ffa8.html" title="List of songs in English labeled the best ever">List of songs in English labeled the best ever</a> do seem trivial, non-encyclopedic and attract the wrong sort of attention. I like the humour. I can see how such articles can become popular. But if we want Wikipedia to be taken seriously then we have to say that articles like this are great fun, but they belong in a general interest magazine and not an encyclopedia. As much as any of us like them personally and want them to remain, they do nothing good for Wikipedia's credibility. Such articles are the one's the media focus on when it comes time to drag Wikipedia's name through the mud. For the greater sense of what serious editors are attempting to achieve on Wikipedia we have to let these tongue-in-cheek, trivial articles fall by the wayside. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 22:18, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Forgive me, but I'm not seeing the excellent citations a bunch of you are mentioning. The criteria for inclusion are vaporous and subjective (see <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>), and two of the six sources cited are nothing more than lyrics pages. I hate to say this, but I'm not convinced of the article's encyclopedic notability, or of its factual objectivity, or if it even has any capacity to <i>become</i> factually objective. There's evidence of cherry-picking by editors -- one source lists 100 songs, another 50, another 40, and the last one 20; how, then, do we find the article itself listing 21 songs, if not by an editor's own opinions?

One of the sources is even a forum, which runs afoul of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. As I see it, none of the pages cited make any serious effort to provide the means by which they've designated any of these songs as "the worst ever," and none of them strike me as particular authorities on the matter. Citing a few op-ed pieces from an incredibly minute sample of mostly-unheard-of websites doesn't quite cut it, for my tastes.

<li><b>Comment</b> To the people electing "Keep", please explain how the current "cleaned-up" version of this list passes <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> - it still contains such blatant POV as "Aqua's satirical dance number is not strictly noted as the worst..." (so it should <i>NOT</i> be in this list) and "'Disco Duck'... Near the top of The Book of Rock Lists' list of worst #1 hits" (so it should <i>NOT</i> be in this list), and that's just the first few lines. This list must use solid verifiable criteria for inclusion, or it is just obvious editorial picking-and-choosing per Luna Santin et al. These two examples prove the point categorically. Since no such selection criteria have been asserted or seem likely ever to be asserted, this is an obvious Delete as intrinsic NPOV and NOR failure with no hope of credible fix-up. <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html#Lists_and_criteria_for_inclusion_of_list_members" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST#Lists and criteria for inclusion of list members</a> is absolutely clear on this. It is not enough when it comes to lists to cite a random unnotable source per entry - criteria must be clear, self-evident and unbreakable from the start, and must apply to <i>every</i> entry in the list. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 11:15, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The simple solution is to establish criteria and apply them, e.g. the song must have been called the worst ever by an individual of note, or it must have been called the worst ever on a notable medium such as TV, radio, press etc., or it must have topped a worst ever poll. The top three or five songs of such a poll could be a cut-off point.

I'll go through and list the rankings in that order (C4, Maxim, FR,PCM). A number is the song's placement on a list; an x means the song does not appear on the list; a yes/no applies to FR, which did not order their list.</li>

<dd>As we can see, six of the songs mentioned appear nowhere on the cited pages, and five of the songs only appear in one of the cited pages; that's half the page that's barely or never mentioned in the references. I'm curious how we listed #1, #2... then #6... and suddenly jump from #9 to #43, with regards to one page -- subjective cherrypicking, anyone? Maxim, probably the most notable source, is only used once. One source is a blog or forum, and isn't really admissable as a source... but that's one of the most-used sources in this article (removing it as a source puts seven more songs into the only-one-mention group, upping the ante to at least 18 of 21 songs we might call inadequately sourced). There doesn't appear to be any strong consensus between the cited pages, and I <i>seriously question</i> the argument that the pages cited represent any serious majority opinion among notable critics and organizations. If somebody wants to keep this sort of content, I'd encourage very strict criteria and listification to the effect of "songs called worst by X," instead of a central list (though a central list might link to other lists). The centralized page seems too high of a POV risk, to me, even before we address questions of notability. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 11:16, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Even if Wikipedia were an indiscriminate collection of information, this list is far too subjective and cannot be considered anything approaching NPOV.

<li><b>Comment</b> Can you explain the "misunderstanding of POV"? From what I can gather, you are advocating this list as a valid article because numerous reliable third party polls and whatnot do exist to provide this article with material. I hope that is correct. However, the problem with POV in this article to <i>me</i> at least, is that editors can cherry-pick from these various sources, in order to include the songs they <i>feel</i> are "the worst", and in order to exclude those songs they do not feel are the worst. Because the inclusion criteria are <i>so very broad</i>, POV problems are inherent to this list article. To go the other, "inclusive" route, and include everything from every "worst song" list ever made, would inevitably give us an article of unwieldy length with probable copyvio issues. So either way, this article topic is simply unworkable in WP, and the problem is its inherent POV issues. I think the <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html#Lists_and_criteria_for_inclusion_of_list_members" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST#Lists and criteria for inclusion of list members</a> guideline makes the point very well for cases like this, and I believe Luna Santin's research bears this out. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 16:34, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is little possibility of reasonable criteria for this. Do we say "4 reliable sources" must list a song as worst? None of the entries qualify for that. So then we say "1 or 2 sources", but then we can easily find a bunch of "Worst" lists that do not list the song. The so-called "reliable sources" must have considered the matter carefully and decided that the song is not worst, but they are not going to publish "the 1 million songs that are not the worst". Maybe just list every song that has ever been in one of these lists, but then the article has 500 entries and becomes really long and rather unmaintainable, do we then split it off into "List of songs labeled worst ever by Rolling Stone", "...by Maxim", etc. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 18:27, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, if the current article is <i>immediately</i> hacked down to include only the songs voted <i>the</i> worst (i.e. number 1) on the various "Worst Of" lists, and if the criteria of the article are adjusted to make it absolutely unequivocally clear that inclusion involves being voted <i>the</i> worst (i.e. number 1) on any such reputable and reliable third party list, then I would happily change my stance to Keep. But! If an editor were to subsequently remove such stipulations from the criteria for inclusion, or to edit them in any meaningful way, or to reciprocally do such a thing, to the extent that an edit war or wars were to ensue over this article, then I would expect a <i>very</i> speedy delete process for the article, without any of this AfD discussion having to be trawled through yet again.

<p>I've restored <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burnt_Face_Man_c44c.html" title="Burnt Face Man">Burnt Face Man</a> and created this third nomination, with reasons. The first nomination was deleted about 6-3 in June 2005, which was a valid deletion. The article was recreated and has been rebuilt since November 2005. A second nomination was created a month ago - The nomination didn't last long, as several pointed to the previous nomination. It was speedied.</p>
<p>My argument and reason for the restoring is that the AfD was over a year ago - Things change with time, and this is a well-known animation. I hear mention of it a lot, and it's known quite well with school students and young people who I know. This popularity has came since most episodes were created, which was after the initial AfD. Much like Firth's other project Devvo, which has become known almost universally with UK teenagers, this is growing in popularity. I visited Wikipedia earlier today simply to look it up, and had to view it in the deletion log. Why have an encyclopedia if things I'm going to look up are deleted?</p>
<p>Sorry for the long nomination text, but I personally believe that this should be <b>kept</b>, and even if it is deleted, that it needs a full AfD - The first nomination isn't really much reasoning to delete it, as times change. By that logic, a year ago we could have deleted <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theo_Walcott_bc4b.html" title="Theo Walcott">Theo Walcott</a>, and prevented it from being created now because of an early AfD before he was notable - Is that good for Wikipedia? So yes, <b>keep</b>.&#160;:p <a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEsteffect_957d.html" title="User:Esteffect">Esteffect</a> 01:44, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Mercifully, after an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Carl_Hewitt_3765.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Carl Hewitt">RfA which found against Hewitt</a>, he deleted the content he had written. Thus, as an "orphaned introduction", this "article" makes no sense and is not likely to <i>ever</i> make sense. <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 03:11, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The importance of the company does not so much lie in the freeware title "Beats of Rage", but rather in its open source game engine which is the only engine around to make oldschool sidescrolling beatemups with. It is still being developed further by an ever growing community of programmers and modders. The next release of senile team "Age of the Beast" will do the same for sidescrollers of the "Golden Axe" type.</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep.</b> It seems that the show itself might be notable, and I doubt anything else would compete for the name. Individual episodes and seasons, though, delete with prejudice. Consolidate it all, expand the article to tell us more. If that's all we can say about the show, and there's really nothing more to expand on, then delete or consolidate elsewhere still. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 07:37, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

It's just a mash of music videos and old interviews - I don't think there's even a voiceover as Eivind suggested. It's existed under a variety of names since the channel launched, and I believe they re-edit them frequently to add new videos. — <font face="Times New Roman" style="background: #000066;" color="#FFFFFF">stickguy (:^›)—</font> <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStickguy_d898.html" title="User:Stickguy">home</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStickguy_30f3.html" title="User talk:Stickguy">talk</a> - 17:22, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Question</b>. A few here have claimed the show is notable, but have not suggested any specific reason for it. Did it establish a new technique (like the blippy pop-ups in VH1's <i>Popup Video</i> series), or win some awards, or influence the genre significantly, or take a different marketing approach, have notable hosts, or involve an interesting approach to its subjects? -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 19:18, 7 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Answer / Comment</b> - None of the above, IMHO. It does, however, air three times a day, making it one of their more popular (in terms of scheduling, not necessarily ratings) series. It doesn't even have hosts, or any personalities really - a lot of the time we'd see the artist answering a question, but not the question being asked. — <font face="Times New Roman" style="background: #000066;" color="#FFFFFF">stickguy (:^›)—</font> <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStickguy_d898.html" title="User:Stickguy">home</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStickguy_30f3.html" title="User talk:Stickguy">talk</a> - 19:36, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

This actually is not something just made up by a user. One of the early fathers of the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormon.html" title="Mormon">Mormon</a> church, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Edward_Talmage_b62d.html" title="James Edward Talmage">James Edward Talmage</a>, wrote a book called <i>The Articles of the Faith</i>. In that book, he listed works that are referenced in the Bible, but for which we actually have no extant copy. "Manner of the Kingdom", which he also called "Book of Statutes" (I guess the title is catchier) was among them. For more information, <a href="http://www.biblepage.org/message/mm0397.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.biblepage.org/message/mm0397.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> and <a href="http://www.biblepage.org/message/mm0597.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.biblepage.org/message/mm0597.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> are from a Christian article refuting Talmage's claims. At any rate, this is not just something made up on Wikipedia, however, that said, there could not possibly be enough information about this supposed lost book to make an article. Thus, redirecting it would seem to be reasonable. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 22:28, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>One other comment just as an "oh and by the way" - I looked up 1 Samuel 10:25 in a Bible commentary that I use in my own study and it says that (in the view of this commentator anyway) Samuel was likely talking about the first part of 1 Samuel itself, not about some other book out there. I mention this not as a statement of theological truth, but only in order to point out that it is not universally accepted (or even prominently accepted) that a book by this title ever even existed. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 17:11, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>No Position</b> The New Oxford Annotated Bible, New Revised Standard Version, in the note for 1 Samuel 10:25 leaves it open that it could be a separate 'lost' book. The comment is, "<i>The rights and duties of the kingship</i> probably set out the responsibilities of king and people to each other. The expression here is nearly identical to 'the ways of the king' in 8.9,11, although they may not refer to the same document". And, the The Bible Knowledge Commentary edited by Walvoord and Zuck leaves it open stating on page 442, "All that Samuel could do was invest Saul with his authority and responsibility as outlined in a scroll prepared for this occasion of coronation (1 Sam 10:25). Undoubtedly the scroll included the Mosaic regulations for kingship found in Deuteronomy 17:14-17."--<a href="../../../p/t/d/User%7EPtdecker_b311.html" title="User:Ptdecker">P Todd</a> 02:16, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. As with the rash of AfDs proposed by originator against other articles from this general topic, this is, at most, a stub. It's new, the author hasn't had time yet to finish working on it, and it is encyclopedic. Furthermore, "Mormon" commentary above is irrelevent. As noted in new source (of which there are many more to follow), this one by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wesley_f66e.html" title="John Wesley">John Wesley</a>, this specific topic has been discussed by religious scholars for centuries, long before there were any "Mormons". Since citations are being added, and the article is only a few days old, <b>AfD nomination is outrageously premature.</b> --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEditrix_2b10.html" title="User:TheEditrix">The Editrix</a> 20:20, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> no redirect as <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. There is nothing in these sources provided to suggest there is a textual work called the "Manner of the Kingdom" that was at one time included in the Old Testament and later lost or removed. I actually don't even see anything in the sources that seriously suggests such a work ever existed at all. Wesley's statment appears to be an attempt to clarify and explain the meaning of the passage, not a statement that "Manner of the Kingdom" existed as an separate text worthy of biblical status. I don't agree with BigDT's redirect because <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_books_of_the_Old_Testament_e56d.html" title="Lost books of the Old Testament">Lost books of the Old Testament</a> is itself suggested for merge to <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-canonical_books_referenced_in_the_Bible_7d9d.html" title="Non-canonical books referenced in the Bible">Non-canonical books referenced in the Bible</a> and really is not in anyway a discussion of Talmage's claims.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:41, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Non notable website.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Most of this article is a regurgitation of the contents of the website, along with other filler material on Scientology controversies. There is no assertion of the significance of the website what so ever. The only claim as to notability is that "it has been spread across the internet by users of many popular websites and search engines including Google.com, and Digg.com." Appearing on a search engine hardly makes a website notable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Basically the article says: <i>"Look, we've made a site about scientology. It appears on google. Scientologists have sued other sites, perhaps they'll sue ours"</i>. By that logic I could criticise scientology on my website and then be immediately entitled to write a wikipedia article about it. <b>Delete</b></dd>

<p>Some sort of British authors' association of questionable notability. The original article was a blatant advertisement, so I tagged it for proposed deletion.

Look, I'm really sorry, I'm not terribly well-up with the WIKI policy. I do see that the original article could be seen as an advert. Therefore I deleted it and replaced with the text you see, hoping it would be acceptable. Apparently it is not, so please feel free to delete as you see fit. I'm afraid I have no idea what a 'prodtag' or a 'substub' are.</p>
<p>I would like to point out, though, that UKA Press is a legitimate Small Press publisher, and not 'questionable' in the least. As for not being 'notable enough', you really should give the small guys a chance sometimes, y'know&#160;:-)</p>

As I said, please delete if you feel it necessary, or I can delete the entry myself. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by AndreaUKA (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndreaUKA_b74b.html" title="User talk:AndreaUKA">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AndreaUKA_e751.html" title="Special:Contributions/AndreaUKA">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>For clarity, "prod tag" is the indication that a page has been submitted for <b>PRO</b>posed <b>D</b>eletion (prod), and "substub" is a really short article with really minimal content.

<p>Thank you, <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> (hey, I think I'm getting the hang of this!). I'm afraid my (US) keyboard is set to UK, so I'm unable to use the tilde option, it seems. I will try to update my entry tomorrow. However, if I have no time to do so (and I *am* very busy), please feel free to delete, as I said. No hard feelings on my part - that's life, eh? Meanwhile, huge thanks to all for your help and guidance.</p>
<p>Hello again all. Well, I've managed to add some more to the article. I do hope it's now acceptable. If so, I will try to expand just as soon as I have some more time. I think the Small Presses link (list) is very useful to writers (although it wasn't me who put it there) and hope you agree. Thanks to all for your understanding.</p>
<p>In the absence of tildes on my keyboard, I will have to sign myself thus: AndreaUKA</p>
<ul>
<li><s><b>Neutral</b> for now.</s> I think that links to the newspaper reviews mentioned in the article would be enough to establish notability - you're nearly there. Incidentally, you can copy and paste the tildes from my earlier comment (don't put in the &lt;nowiki&gt; tags, though), or use ALT-126, or just configure your keyboard correctly.&#160;:) <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 11:54, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>So I can! Hadn't though of that - thanks <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a>. Yes, the keyboard thing is a bit of a pain. If I have it set 'correctly', I can't use the £ sign, which is vital for my work. Between the devil and the deep blue... --AndreaUKAAndreaUKA 12:39, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Incidentally, not sure if it's relevant or not, but I linked UKA Press through from your <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Brownlow_4803.html" title="Kevin Brownlow">Kevin Brownlow</a> page, as UKA Press have just re-issued his book How It Happened Here, which has been out of print for 35 years. --AndreaUKAAndreaUKA 13:11, 26 June 2006 (UTC)AndreaUKA</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> following recent expansion. Should now be comfortably within <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. The article still needs tidying up - <a href="../../../r/e/f/WP%7EREF_ecd4.html#Citation_styles" title="WP:REF">WP:REF#Citation_styles</a> would be a good start - but I personally think it's OK to stay now. However, please note that we still have to establish a consensus that it should be kept, and my opinion carries no more weight than anyone else's.

</ul>
<p>Yes, thanks, <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a>. I do agree it needs a good tidy-up - I'll study the pages you gave me and amend - thanks.</p>
<p>No, no, I understand perfectly (re the consensus) - I shall just keep tidying until you reach a decision. --AndreaUKA 13:58, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Would it be ok to tag the UKA Press page for tidying-up help? I have to say I'm struggling a bit. Or should I wait until a decision has been reached? Thanks. --AndreaUKA 14:35, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello all, I just wanted to say a HUGE 'thank you' to <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> for all his/her help in getting the UKA Press article up-to-scratch (hopefully). I've been editing, formatting, bulleting and doing all sorts of things I didn't know I could do and, I must say, I think it does look a lot better now. Hope you all agree&#160;:-) I will now desist (although it IS very addictive!) and await your decision. Many thanks to you all, whichever way it goes. --AndreaUKA 18:14, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello All, I think it would be a pity to exclude the UKA Press entry from Wikipedia because it is very unusual in its priorities and in having some degree of voluntary funding, which allows it to take on worthwhile projects that might not be commercially attractive. It isn't driven by the profit motive. That means that it can publish, say, poetry collections or short story collections which bigger publishers wouldn't touch because they know that no matter how good they are they aren't going to make much money. UKA Press is one of the (very few) good guys in the publishing game who offer hope to writers in non-commercial/non flavour-of-the-month fields. --<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirat_367e.html" title="User:Sirat">User:Sirat</a> 09:45 GMT 27 June 2006</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's a bit ragged round the edges and could do with tidying to bring in line with usual article style, but there's enough there of notability (prizes, reviews, authors) to merit inclusion. However, please try to include links to 3rd party sites not just the UKA site for statements such as "Sheldon Goldfarb's "Remember, Remember" [13] has been nominated for the 2006 Arthur Ellis Award for Best Juvenile Mystery in Canada".

<li><b>Delete</b> Small publishers can be notable, but they need to have published a good number of works for anyone to have heard of them. It's clear from <a href="http://ukapress.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=9" class="external text" title="http://ukapress.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=9" rel="nofollow">this</a> that they've not published many books.

<li><b>comment</b> I think size is not, in itself, an indication of notability, when assessing authors, or books and publishers. Some famous authors have written only one book, and some publishers have one 'important' book. A publisher may stay small because it's nonprofit, another may be a specialist - though they can do well financially whether by chance, or by publishing work which is significantly noted to be brilliant, or memorable. As an example: "In January (2006) the English translation of Elias Khoury's 11th novel, Gate of the Sun, was released by the three-year-old, nonprofit Brooklyn (N.Y.)-based, Archipelago Books. The buzz started immediately and The New York Times and Publisher's Weekly bestowed rave reviews on the tale, a contemporary homage to the Middle-Eastern epic 1001 Nights, reset in a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon." <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/may2006/sb20060502_704137.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/may2006/sb20060502_704137.htm" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> The oft mentioned wikipedia <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECompanies%2C_corporations_and_economic_information_Notability_and_inclusion_guidelines_bc24.html#Criteria_for_companies_and_corporations" title="Wikipedia:Companies, corporations and economic information/Notability and inclusion guidelines">notability</a> criteria for companies and corporations is in this case... "The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself.". This company satisfies the independent source (i.e. the authors own the moral rights to their works) and obviously there multiple works (the notability policy doesn't say how big multiple is so people who say e.g. 50 works is not enough, can't verify their statement). I guess the only issue is: are the works trivial&#160;?. Do any of the newspaper reviews call the published works trivial&#160;?. A quick read of a few reviews don't call these works trivial. Thus the article satisfies the Notability policy. <a href="../../../t/t/i/User%7ETtiotsw_54d6.html" title="User:Ttiotsw">Ttiotsw</a> 10:22, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> eon8 gets one hit on Google News and one hit on Lexis/Nexis; both are blog-related hits based solely on the claims of the website itself. As such, it is completely unverifiable according to the normal standards of reliable sources, and is also non-notable per the standard of being written about in multiple non-trivial publications. It hasn't even made much of a splash as an internet phenomenon, with only 150 hits on Technorati at this moment. I would not oppose recreation if it gets reported in multiple non-trivial independent reliable sources (<i>Wired</i>, CNN, etc) but I suspect this will vanish pretty quickly. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 06:38, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If, in the 6 months the site was up, it didn't generate a single Lexis/Nexis hit, that strongly suggests no one really cared (outside the ARG community maybe). If the technorati rating only spikes now, <i>after</i> the reveal, it shows there was not much interest during the last days of the countdown, either. (They got 38000 unique visitors in June, that's about 8 hours worth for instapundit or 2 hours of dailykos.)

<li>Have you not read any criticism of Wikipedia? One thing that comes up time and time again is that people say Wikipedia cannot be taken seriously because it is full of articles on trivia, minor aspects of pop culture, and internet memes that everyone forgot about a week after the article was written. So every article like this that is kept is just one more weapon for people to use to discredit any hope Wikipedia has of being taken seriously as an information resource. Not hurting anybody? Sorry, I don't see it that way. It's hurting <i>me</i>, because I wanted Wikipedia to be an <i>encyclopedia</i>, not a <i>gossip chatroom</i>. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 18:53, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strongest Possible Speedy Delete A7</b> and <b>Ban the IPs of the article creators</b> There is nothing new or special about what this website did. Internet and very marketing and publicity techniques of this kind have been around for a long time and are widely known - which is why so many people assumed that this was a marketing website. Not only did the website do nothing special in its promotion techniques, it admits that it has no other purpose than to get people excited over nothing. This deeply non-notable, unoriginal and uninspired waste of people's time and abuse of wikipedia during it, should be speedily deleted and the article creators punished for their relentless and obnoxious abuse of wikipedia and the afd process for their own selfish promotional purposes. - as I've said in the previous afd discussion about this (where did that go?) <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 19:02, 1 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>eon8 is a notable website because it did get people excited over nothing. It may have used the same techniques as a marketing website, but instead of attempting to get attention over an actual event, it instead left its true purpose up to the imaginations of the fans and viewers of the website. It was an experiment on how the public would react to such a "mysterious" website, and therefore had a purpose, and can be considered notable. Also, your statement about the article creators being obnoxious assumes bad faith. --<a href="../../../j/e/a/User%7EJeames_c009.html" title="User:Jeames">Jeames</a> 19:10, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b>. Okay, leaving commercial marketing aside, this kind of hoax website viral technique is also well-used by artists who are trying to provoke reactions from the public sometimes with surreal or apparently meaningless content. (some of these artists will, in time, become marketers of course). Still nothing new or special here. I'm not assuming bad faith about anything. The creators can be obnoxious without being conscious or deliberate about it.

<li>You can't jump to conclusions about their motivations. That's still assumption of bad faith. It's possible that you are correct, but it's still possible that these are people attempting to assist Wikipedia, and not be, ahem, happy-go-lucky innocent-hearted telemarketers.

<li><i>Comment</i>: Slashdot (I think) counts as a reliable third party known for fact checking. At the very least it counts as a news source on par with many print newspapers. The fact it has covered the event therefore makes Eon8 notable, as it has satisfied WP:WEB. Also, the sheer number of notable websites that have discussed it (4chan, YTMND, pOnju, etc.) also makes it notable. Again, Internet fame is no different from real world fame. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 23:01, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I think some people here are overguaging the notability of this website because they had personal experience with it. Obviously, a lot of people here interact with the Internet. I certainly spend my fair share of time online, although I had never heard of eon8 before its article got nominated for deletion, likely because I don't do online forums or games. And that is why I don't think this really even qualifies as much of an Internet meme. If a person who spends a lot of time online but doesn't go to specialized sites doesn't hear about it, it probably wasn't really that notable. Besides that, it fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, still. It's not likely to have much cultural impact, and the fact that it's speculative in nature whether it will or won't means that it doesn't merit an article now, as WP is not a crystal ball. It really has nothing going for it other than the fact that some Internet forumites wasted time speculating about it, and that's just not encyclopaedic stuff right there.

<li>Replying to every delete vote doesn't exactly make you look like a disinterested party, but on the assumption that you're really just trying but failing to understand what I've said: I made reference to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> because it's a sensible guideline (to me) and it is one with which people are familiar and to which I can link. I am of the mind that failing it is a reason for deletion, so I cited that as one of my reasons. You don't have to point out (repeatedly) that failing it isn't an automatic reason for deletion, or else we wouldn't be having this mess of a discussion, so, as you made your views regarding <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> clear, I'm not sure why you've told almost every user who's cited it that they shouldn't. As to whether it makes a difference whether or not if users were involved: while I certainly think people who were involved deserve the ability to voice their opinions too, I also think it skews their point of view. For example, in my life, there are some specific local annual events that I've often attended and that have impacted me. If there were articles on them on WP (there aren't) that were nominated for deletion, it would be hard to me to realize that, while they hold personal significance, they really aren't, in the grand scheme of things, notable. As to Dpbsmith's comment, a paraphrase would be: "Believing doesn't make it so." I hope this has helped to clarify the commentary for you. GassyGuy 20:49, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I see no valid reason to delete this article. It currently consists of a description of what the site is and was, not speculation. It's not our duty to determine what's relevant and what's not. Statistics provided by the site indicate that it received over 45k <s>thousand</s> visitors. That's more than the population of some settlements which I've seen on Wikipedia. Also, as far as I know, this is the first page of its type. It could evolve into a larger internet phenomenon, and could have unforeseen consequences. Since the information is valid, keep it. Velessar 11:55, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Some guy experimenting; I think that's cool, but I <i>don't</i> think it's particularly noteworthy. I also think that arguments based on how much discussion we get about it here are straw men. Just because eon8's inclusion in Wikipedia is something many of us feel strongly about has no bearing on whether eon8 is suitable for inclusion or not. Notability is not really determined by how many people argue about it on the internet. I'm sure this can be written up under <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">Internet phenomenon</a> or something, but that's pretty much it. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 15:45, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I also think that because of the very nature of the internet, websites that people talk about a lot for a couple of days aren't necessarily at all significant. The net tends to be pretty ephemeral. I'd say that something that people keep talking about two weeks -- or two months -- after the event (even if it is at a reduced intensity) is far more significant than something a lot of people blog about for a couple of days. Considering that eon8 never got much attention until its six-month countdown was almost at its very end, I think this has all the makings of a tempest in a teacup. Compared to <a href="../../../i/l/o/Ilovebees.html" title="Ilovebees">Ilovebees</a>, which really engaged people, had them running around solving riddles and receiving weird phone calls and whatnot, eon8 was essentially just a timer that only got real attention when it was almost at an end. Is this going to keep people engaged for months to come? It's possible. If it does, <i>then</i> I think it merits an article. <i>Now</i> it's just one internet thing among thousands and thousands other internet things... and not a significant one at that. YMMV. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 21:39, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I must say that it is a very bad argument to use. The Danish wikipedia contains as of now 44952 articles and many other important stories in the news never makes it to the Danish wikipedia. The fact is that is is not very updated. But I can just mention that the article in the Danish newspaper Politiken had a link to the English wikipedia-article, and therefore I think that it justifies the article. <font color="green"><b>Snailwalker |</b></font> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Snailwalker" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Snailwalker" rel="nofollow"><b>talk</b></a> 20:18, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>According to your user page, you speak Danish. You give eon8 a "very strong keep." You obviously think it is important. You say it has gotten exposure in mainstream Danish media.

<dd>A religion is not "made up," per se. It is a tradition employed by a large group of people for hundreds or thousands of years, and engrains itself into the culture of those people. This, on the other hand, is something some bored high school kids made up.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete</b>. Keep rationales: 1. large size, major city - not a criterion of inclusion per se, 2. precedent - not valid, 3. important shopping centers - valid.

<li>Both Vedic religion and Brahmanism have separate articles in Britannica. Vedic religion refers to the religion of IA people who moved into India around 1500 BC. Brahmanism refers to the religion of ancient India that evolved out of Vedism. Specifically, "Brahmanism is distinguished from the classical Hinduism that succeeded it by the enhanced significance given in classical Hinduism to individual deities, such as Śiva and Vishnu, and to devotional worship (bhakti)." <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh_2aea.html" title="User:Sukh">Sukh</a> | <span style="color: green;" lang="pa" xml:lang="pa">ਸੁਖ</span> | <a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh_f94b.html" title="User talk:Sukh">Talk</a> 10:38, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>First of all, this is not Britannica. The content here needs to pass <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. I don't think there are any books written by the modern authors of today (other than the 1911 Britannica) that refer to Brahmanism at all. Anyway, the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmanism.html" title="Brahmanism">article</a> itself says that Brahmanism is also known as <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>.

<li>Indeed IA theory may well be questioned, but that doesn't negate the need for an article about it. WP:Verifiability says: "One of the keys to writing good encyclopedia articles is to understand that they must refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have already been published by reputable publishers." I consider Encyclopedia Britannica a reputable piece of published work and hence an entry for Brahmanism automatically means that it is worthy of a place here. I'm not saying the content of the current article is perfect, but there still needs to be a separate article. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh_2aea.html" title="User:Sukh">Sukh</a> | <span style="color: green;" lang="pa" xml:lang="pa">ਸੁਖ</span> | <a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh_f94b.html" title="User talk:Sukh">Talk</a> 11:16, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Brahminism is the term for certain real and distinct religious practices. To put it in somewhat simplistic terms, Brahminism is Hinduism as practised by Brahmins. It draws heavily from vedic and puranic traditions. On the other hand Hinduism is the collective term for all religious currents prevalent in the collective Hindu populace. To give just one example, while the worship of Sai Baba - a Muslim holy man of early 20th centuary - can certainly be called Hinduism, it will be too far fetched to describe it as Brahminism. <a href="../../../s/i/s/User%7ESisodia_a2d7.html" title="User:Sisodia">Sisodia</a> 04:35, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nope, I meant that there are some people who categorise the revival of Hinduism under, say, the Guptas, as that of a particular strand of thought that did not include several modern strands that are, for example, more inspired by the <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bhakti_Movement_ec08.html" title="Bhakti Movement">Bhakti Movement</a> of the 11th c. So the point is that Hinduism as we know it is an agglomeration of not only forms of philosophy, but of practices and the consequent social structures; and there is place in WP for articles that examine all those various components. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 03:18, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Would be interesting if we have sufficient information about the term itself, like how it originated, how it went into disuse, etc. That would make a good article, as <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> suggested. An article on <i>Brahmanism as a term</i> is worth keeping, but on <i>Brahmanism as a religion/sect</i> is not, simply because there's no such religion/sect separate from mainstream Hinduism. For instance, religious followers are determined by self-description, and no one describes(/ever described) oneself as a Brahmanist. Also, there are hints of the authority of Brahmins being questioned even in the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Rigveda.html" title="Rigveda">Rigveda</a> (see article), and in any case, such authority has only slowly (first increased and then) decreased over centuries, so it would be hard to distinguish religious beliefs over centuries based on that parameter. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 14:36, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Nuttah. In addition, in response to deeptrivia, the fact that people self-identify themselves as Hindus does not mean that their beliefs cannot be systematised in some other way. <a href="../../../a/r/y/Arya_Samaj_19a5.html" title="Arya Samaj">Arya Samaj</a> hinduism is distinct in many ways from other forms of Hinduism.

It's what the bricks build, and in this case we have a candidate involved in a highly contentious campaign against a high-profile member of the Republican party, a candidate who had the full backing of his party and whose loss is sometimes attributed to his brother's name.<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 21:25, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This person, though a failed politician, is broady notable for his widely-reported opinions. His success in achieving the party nomination was national news. Hart is chiefly significant as a rare modern, and unabashed, proponent of the otherwise discredited practice of <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugenics.html" title="Eugenics">eugenics</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hs=rcd&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=James+L.+Hart+eugenics&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hs=rcd&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=James+L.+Hart+eugenics&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>.

<dd>Comment, is Hart even notable as a eugenics proponent? From all appearances he is just a lone crank who ran for Congress in 2004 and lost. Does he have articles on eugenics published somewhere other than his campaign website, or does he get quoted in eugenicist literature, for example? I don't see that he's notable in any way, not even among eugenics proponents, and we have a lot of current AFDs on other failed congressional candidates who are far more notable (as local civic leaders and so on) that look like they are getting an overwhelming consensus to delete. In general I don't agree with the philosophy that "X gets an article because he has really fringy views" while "Y doesn't rate an article because he's just a mainstream civic leader" philosophy. It should be the other way around. <a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleenupKrew_dfad.html" title="User:KleenupKrew">KleenupKrew</a> 12:06, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I tend to feel that failed candidates should not be in the encyclopedia, unless their campaign was of particular interest (i.e. marred with scandal, causing true division in the constituency, frequently nationally-covered, etc).

<dd><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word.html" title="Word">Word</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/o/Koorong.html" title="Koorong">Koorong</a> dominate their market in Australia, to the extent that other chains and stores have been forced to close or (in the case of at least one formerly independent chain) effectively become agents of Koorong or Word. In fact, because Koorong and Word get very significant discounts by buying in large quantities, smaller retailers can purchase stock more cheaply through retail at Koorong or Word than wholesale. Koorong and Word are much more than "the largest in a sector made up of small companies" - they dominate the sector. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacknstock_1d12.html" title="User:Jacknstock">Jacknstock</a> 05:39, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> per ScottDavis and since when has wikipedia discriminated against "minority interest". It is not like it is a small chain within its field. In Australian terms it is notable. Since the nomination only referenced the size of the store without referencing the overall market niche and they expect notability to be correlated with the total in numerical terms they seem to have missed what notability is about. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 13:42, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thank you for the useful ref that tells me it is a Pty Ltd company - ie not listed. Under WP:Corp one of the criteria to apply is whether the business has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself. I don't see that applies. I can see no other criterion this stub meets - other criteria for inclusion of articles on businesses refer to stock market listings. A family owned business that has been in existence for 60 years and is not mentioned in non-trivial published works, other than "new store opening" - just does not seem to warrant an encyclopaedia article. This stub has been around for a couple of months and a previous AfD debate prompted no augmentation. Is there anything to be said more about this business, is there anything that justifies not deleting this?

<li>This would be quite frankly classified as a small business.

There are though an awful lot of business with less than 100 employees (which this is likely to be, or at any rate not much bigger) - that is the market for Howard's workplace reforms. I really do not see that these businesses are going be notable. Of course they occupy a niche - that is what businesses do.

<p>I searched google for "Second Somali Civil War", and I got one hit - someone's blog. Our <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somali_Civil_War_851c.html" title="Somali Civil War">Somali Civil War</a> article makes it seem as though the first civil war is not considered to have ended yet.

<dd>I don't really know. You might want to check the history and ask. I do know, though, that the stubs are basically the outer reaches of intellect where the encyclopedia is hoping somebody would like to do the research on a new article. I'll change my vote if it's not a regular stub. Ste4k 17:34, 1 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It seems to me that what makes the difference between this and a regular stub is that not only is there a lack of evidence to establish its verifiability, but there's an abundance of evidence to refute it. Everyone seems to agree that the first war hasn't ended, and google turns up no results for the phrase. --<a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughcharlesparker_a9f4.html" title="User:Hughcharlesparker">Hugh<small>Charles</small>Parker</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/u/g/User_talk%7EHughcharlesparker_6d32.html" title="User talk:Hughcharlesparker">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hughcharlesparker_62d0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hughcharlesparker">contribs</a>)</small> 18:10, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The piece is titled "Leaving Endeavor Academy". That makes its subject fairly clear. An article doesn't have to be 100% about a subject for it to be a useful source.

<li>But since there is nothing from the CBS article content that's included in the Wikipedia article content, the CBS article is basically just moot material. And for the same reasons, basically none of these sources are useful for anything. This pseudo-biography hasn't a leg to stand on. It's completely bogus, original research, and an attack page in disguise. We shouldn't be including things in this biography that aren't already published somewhere else. That's <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> in a nutshell. This has nothing to do with notability at all. If this person were notable in the least bit, then we would be able to find reliable sources that give biographical data on him. But there aren't any of those available, especially not in the list that is cited.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> or <b>Strong Merge to Endeavor Academy</b>. The original nomination reads as if it might have been made in good faith. His argument that sources <b>do not exist</b> if the only place they are readily available online are "personal websites" is a specious argument that has been tried before in other cases, and has been quite rightly rejected -- but it still might have been the argument of someone just very confused about whether Wikipedia values the letter of the rules or the spirit. But after that, Ste4k's behavior shows clear bad faith. Anyone can check it and see. Ste4k: "Oh I just noticed, that the <b>words</b> in the <b>two versions</b> of that article <b>are different</b>; i.e. the actual article from the CBS archives differs from the article printed on the web site." (emphasis in original) Reality: the only differences are paragraph breaks and a typo ("talkd") in the CBS version that does not appear in the version on the Ross site. Ste4k: "If you read the article that 48 hours wrote, it hasn't anything to do with the content in this article. That makes the content in this article original research. The article that 48 hours wrote, was apparently about a person who left the academy. If you feel that person should have an article of their own, then please feel free to write one." Reality: In the <b>two</b> segments that <i><a href="../../../4/8/_/48_Hours_a6db.html" title="48 Hours">48 Hours</a></i> did on Chuck Anderson, individual <i>couples</i> (yes, couples, as opposed to "a person") are used as examples of what people say about Chuck Anderson, but Anderson is clearly the focus.

<li>There isn't anything in the current article that even remotely resembles the content of the CBS article as previously stated. Also, please keep good faith. Hadn't the admin been asking me the questions to investigate further, I wouldn't have ever found those articles on CBS. In a nutshell, those two CBS articles should have been used to create an article about people who have complaints about this person rather than siting a source that sourced a third party in a list of 22 different reprints, many of which aren't related. After reading your note, I went back to re-read again sentence per sentence the one article entitled "Leaving...". It appears that your analysis is correct at this time. Earlier this morning the quotation from Rick Ross, was changed to his own words. There isn't anything "wrong" with that, of course, since they were his own words and it is his own web site. However, clearly none of the information from his web site could reaonably be used in an unbiased fashion to create a biography for this other man. Therefore, we still have a biography which is bogus, and cited sources that are useless for anything related to such a biography. Ste4k 20:02, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>And who said this? If you read my comments carefully you will note that I suggest using 48 hours directly. You will also note that the articles provided by 48 hours are superfluous since they are only speaking about other peoples' opinions. Yes, they say it is a fact that other people have complaints and negative opinions about Anderson. So what? You have a complaint about my nomination as well, should we call 48 Hours and see if we can get our names in this article since your complaint is about Anderson? I consider your implication rude, unfounded, and twisting facts rather than discussing criteria is detrimental rather than helpful. Ste4k 18:58, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Wow. That last comment is completely devoid of any logic or reason. If a major news source prints an article which contains people talking about the subject of this Wikipedia article, then it certainly counts as a secondary source and deserves mention.

<li>Do you think so? What exact information should be added to Anderson's biography now in that regards?

Do you intend to add some <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> saying something like, "two couples made complaints about Anderson"? Is there anything neutral at all about adding this link to the page? Can you explain simply what relationship it has to a person whom we haven't even a resource to know his age? Again, so what? There are millions of people that don't like other people for one reason or another. Do you believe that adding one more factual instance will somehow give Anderson more notability? How exactly can you justify such a link and still remain within the guidlines which state that articles are <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not propaganda or advocacy</a> of any kind?

How come none of the literally hundreds of experts on small web-sites aren't adequately represented nor mentioned on our article about him?

<li>Perhaps you haven't bothered to read the link recently, since policies do change, this is probably the issue. Synthesis of published material serving to advance a position is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html#Synthesis_of_published_material_serving_to_advance_a_position" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Please note the intent of the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Buell_Anderson&amp;oldid=62117827" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Buell_Anderson&amp;oldid=62117827" rel="nofollow">in the first paragraph</a> which plainly shows the intent of the original authors: "<i>Anderson has a policy of seldom granting personal interviews. One of the results of this interview policy being that some facts and dates regarding his earlier life are less readily available. Still, many facts about his early life can be assembled from a few published documents.</i>" And this includes adding bits pieces of fifteen year old testamony from unreliable sources together to prove a point rather than simply report the facts. Beyond that, though, your misinterpretation of the laws involved regarding "A Course In Miracles" show only that you haven't bothered to read much about this man, or his involvement in this case. The District Court of New York has already established that the version of "The Course" which is associated with Charles Buell Anderson is <b>not</b> the same version of the course that you just linked again into his biography, and which is known at large by the trademark "ACIM". I appreciate that you at least brought the matter to discussion, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Buell_Anderson&amp;diff=62117282&amp;oldid=62115718" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Buell_Anderson&amp;diff=62117282&amp;oldid=62115718" rel="nofollow">but <b>ADDING</b> material which is patently false</a> to an article carries with it the burden of proof of the author. Since this is <b>your</b> addition, now, I suggest that you remove it unless you can prove the opinon of the New York District Court incorrect. I removed it because I have read the court's opinion on the matter and per <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">policy</a> and per Jimbo Wales: "I can NOT emphasize this enough. There seems to be a terrible bias among some editors that some sort of random speculative 'I heard it somewhere' pseudo information is to be tagged with a 'needs a cite' tag. Wrong. It should be removed, aggressively, unless it can be sourced. This is true of all information, but it is particularly true of negative information about living persons."

<li>Let me cut through the rambling nonsense. The 48 Hours article is about criticism of Anderson. People looking for info on Anderson would probably want to see this. It belongs in external links.

<li>Let me give you a direct answer. If the only sources are external, and the rest article hasn't any sources, then what sort of content do you intend to have on the page to provide any context for those links? Let me provide a quick example. The very first clause of the thesis is "<i>Charles Buell Anderson, born ca. 1926</i>". We don't even have a source reference for that. Should it be deleted? Or just marked up like it is? According to the guidelines it should be deleted. Do you have a source that we can use to verify that very first clause? Ste4k 10:52, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The references do not amount to much. The media sources are mainly local papers and radio. In my town we have a street beggar called Billy The Quid - he's appeared many times in the local media, but that doesn't make him suitable for entry in an international encyclopedia. That people are interested and have filled the Talk pages with comments suggests some interest, though almost all content has been written by one person for over a year. That the article is slanted with subtle but obvious comments against Charles Buell Anderson, with allegations of sexual and physical abuse, gives serious cause for concern. This is a living person in which the article makes serious allegations of sexual abuse based on internet forum gossip. I have removed those allegations. I am having a hard time seeing how the article can remain in its current form. And, as the man seems to be known mainly by his ex-students, his notabiliy even in a balanced article is questionable. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 21:51, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well for one, the 48 hours article is only talking about one guy's opinion. And for two, there isn't even any mention of anyone named Anderson in the court case. The court case <i>does</i> however go into pretty much detail about all the actual people involved, including things like where they worked, how much money they made, etc. etc. Like I said before, if you think that a couple shows about some guy complaining about some other guy regarding something that happened nearly ten years ago is worth an article, then maybe you should write one because there isn't any information from that CBS article that's in either of these two articles nominated for deletion. So what's merging a bunch of unsourced information going to do? Ste4k 04:38, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>According to the article written in 1999: "<i>Ross believes that Anderson's sway over those in the Academy could end tragically. Using the example of Marshall Applewhite, who led all 38 members of the Heaven's Gate cult to mass suicide two years ago, Ross says Anderson's leadership role could be a prescription for tragedy.</i>" Okay, so, it's been like seven years now. (*yawn*) Looks like Ross was wrong. So who cares? Don't you think the encyclopedia should sort of wait for something to occur before reporting it? No wonder none of this source was ever put into the article! Ste4k 20:52, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

In that article from 48 hours he even says that he used to be Anderson's right hand man. If Anderson is some kind of con-man, that doesn't give this other guy much credibility. The whole article reeks of disgruntled people that knew this man personally. In itself that doesn't make the subject notable, on the contrary, it's a pretty good reason to toss the article into the bit-bucket, since all of these sources are then <i>primary</i> sources which we aren't allowed to be using per <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a> Ste4k 11:10, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm left pondering, now. If the article is notable, and the person about whom the article is written is notable, both of which seem to be correct at first sight, and if the article is substantially correct and non defamatory, I can't yet understand why it should not remain. An additional dilemma is "how does the community know that Seth Finkelstein the man is Seth Finkelstein the editor?"

<li>Fiddle Faddle, I commend your willingness to be skeptical (how do you know I'm really that Seth Finkelstein?). In fact, I've had trouble with trolling-impostors before. I can authenticate myself by, for example, writing in advance about a blog posting. Or you can email me at sethf at-sign sethf.com (using a throwaway account if you don't want to reveal your own identity).
<p>My view is that even though the article is non defamatory now, who knows what it will be tomorrow, or the next day? Notwithstanding <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, for people below a certain threshold of notability, Wikipedia biographies can be an <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attractive_nuisance_doctrine.html" title="Attractive nuisance doctrine">"attractive nuisance"</a>.

<li>In many ways "both". Equally I have no idea on a wikipedia stance on a person who wishes not to appear. Hence the need to refer to an experienced admin. You see, I think you are wiki-notable. Hence an article probably should exist. But your arguments against are also convincing. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 23:40, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikipedia standards for Notability are that the person be more notable than the "average college professor".

<li>I'm familiar with the debate, but this is an area where policies are in flux. I'd argue that the criteria in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> should be a necessary, but not sufficient, condition. In my view, there needs to be a balancing, where the incremental utility of the page has to be weighed against its potential to be used as a tool of harassment. This is always going to be a judgment call. But there should be more than "You've achieved a few things over the years, and as a reward, here's your very own troll magnet to monitor and defend for the rest of your life.". -- Seth Finkelstein 02:06, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> As SM247 said, the wishes of the subject are no more germane than those of any other editor. Seth has been an editor for 1 year and 10 months, which is a lot longer than I have. He has a low number of edits, but enough that I feel his views should be listened to on non-notability the same way we would any other editor.

<ul>
<li>Subjects do <i>not</i> have the right to prevent Wikipedia from having articles about them. That is long established here. It is irrelevant both whether subjects want the encyclopaedia to have articles about themselves or whether subjects want the encyclopaedia to not have articles about themselves. Our criteria for inclusion of biographies are the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria. Articles either satisfy or fail to satisfy those criteria, upon which the wishes of their subjects have no bearing. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:11, 4 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Note <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> says about criteria: "Failure to meet these criteria does not mean that a subject must not be included, meeting one or more does not mean that a subject must be included. Many Wikipedians oppose the use of this guideline.". It is by no means the last word on the subject.
<p>I'm not trying to "prevent Wikipedia from having articles", in the sense of threatening legal action. I'm arguing that in the specific case of biographies of slightly notable living people, there is a significant problem of mismatched incentives, of "cost-shifting". For a very small potential benefit to itself, Wikipedia imposes a much larger potential negative cost on the person. This should be recognized as a Wikipedia structural issue. And until better procedures are in place to address the problem, that large potential negative cost should not be blithely imposed on unwilling people. -- Seth Finkelstein 23:00, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Were a person to be included in the national press against their will the newspaper would say "This person was notable for the item we reported about" and would refuse removal. Were the same person to be included in a printed encyclopaedia the same argument woudl apply. Just because wikipedia is not paper does not mean it will vary as an individual wills it. An exception would be in the UK under <a href="../../../d/a/t/Data_Protection_Act_1998_ea20.html" title="Data Protection Act 1998">Data Protection Act 1998</a> legislation where the individual has the power to instruct an organisation to cease processing their data if they can prove that it causes damage or distress. It seems to me that would be an individual's only recourse. Otherwise, if wikipedia feels one is notable, one is notable. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 06:38, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Neither a newspaper nor a printed encyclopedia allows random flamers to anonymously insert libel/defamation/smears into its articles, at any moment. That aspect puts Wikipedia in a class by itself. Appeals to the norms governing articles which have a process of accountability and responsibility are inappropriate for a context where that very lack of accountability and responsibility is the problem at issue.</li>
<li>My objections don't come out of being a hermit (I'm not), or having some sort of Hollywood-style star image to maintain (I don't). Rather, I've concluded that the extremely poor quality control of Wikipedia biographies constitutes too much potential for harm, which should not be inflicted on unwilling people of minor (even if nonzero) notability. Rebutting along any of the general class of argument that it's a legal right (unless perhaps countered by a lawsuit, which is almost impossible for an ordinary person), is a very poor response. Something can be legal without being good ethics or good policy. And I believe proper policy in this case is to err on the side of least personal harm. -- Seth Finkelstein 09:42, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rubbish. Subjects of articles are not required to edit the biographical articles about them. They <i>most definitely do not</i> own those articles, in any way. This idea that there is an "imposed cost" is entirely spurious, and your entire argument fallacious because of it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:34, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're missing my point. If some troll edits my biography to read e.g. "He was thought to have been involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy, but never indicted" (example deliberately chosen, but you can use your imagination), that AFFECTS ME. I bear the cost of any reputational damage done. Wikipedia has no cost, except in the extraordinarily rare situation where the person who gets hit has enough power to make a fuss, generating bad publicity for Wikipedia. Otherwise, nobody home. This is deeply problematic. -- Seth Finkelstein 12:13, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No-one is missing your point. Your point is simply fallacious. The same person can put up a web page in a vast number of places on the World Wide Web saying the same thing. That people can publish things about other people that damage their reputation has no bearing upon whether people warrant biographical articles in an encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:20, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Repeating what I said above: "and it won't be a marginal comment with the social status of an inconsequential rant, but rather will be made prominent about the person and reputation-laundered with the institutional status of an encyclopedia.". Wikipedia is different from putting a page up on the web, because Wikipedia strips out attribution, and worse, adds an unwarranted air of authority. Or are you saying that Wikipedia articles are (not *should be*, but *are*) in general trusted no more than a crazy ranter's website? Wikipedia's poor troll control has a lot of bearing as to whether it should contain biographical articles on people who can be hurt by them. -- Seth Finkelstein 12:29, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

I would be astounded if anyone would want to know who I was, 50 years from now. Anyway, my website is in the Internet Archive, so it'll last at least as long as that lasts. And I wouldn't put any bets on Wikipedia lasting 50 years, or even 10, or even past the next tech recession.

<li>Actually, I did, in a way - a few weeks ago, I crossed paths with Jimmy Wales at a conference, and took the occasion to bring up this very point to him (I didn't want to mention it since that sounds like name-dropping, but if you ask, I think it's reasonable to relate it). The conversation was amicable, and I was hopeful I'd planted a seed for future policy revisions. As to making a formal policy proposal myself, I'm not sure I have the requisite community status to do it *effectively*, and the amount of arguing I'd have to go through is daunting (even this discussion has been very draining). I expect the issue is going to come to a head sometime in the future, and I'm not eager to be a big activist on it. I figured here that if I could opt-out myself at the relatively low cost of several discussion comments, that would be a reasonable outcome. -- Seth Finkelstein 18:54, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

A valuative term as I hear it called. Google Censorware and Seth appears to have been effective in getting out his message. So he appears to have had an effect on people.

<li>Thanks for the compliment, but I only wish I were anywhere near as effective as some people think I am.

Where's my invitation to the Playboy Mansion? How come I don't have a press agent? ..."). I say I popularize the term "censorware", I don't claim to have coined it (it seemed a pretty obvious formation, given firmware, wetware, middleware, etc., and later, spyware). My point is that the specialized achievements I have shouldn't make me fair game for the character-assassination free-for-all which is an unfortunate potential result of Wikipedia's flaws. -- Seth Finkelstein 05:10, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Firmware is firm stuff. Middleware is stuff in the middle. Wetware, well I never heard of that. Spyware, well that spys on you. Censorware, well that censors you. No it doesn't! Pornblockware, That keeps you from seeing porn by blocking it without devaluing it such as would antipornware. Shouldn't it be called pornblockware? I think that is far more accurate than censorware. After all, that is the purpose of the software. Censorship is not the purpose, and indeed US v. ALA says the use of pornblockware is not censorship. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESafeLibraries.org_8d6f.html" title="User:SafeLibraries.org">SafeLibraries</a> 13:46, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Umm, "Firmware" is software that's encoded in hardware, not "firm stuff". And the makers of spyware would probably like their wares called helpfulconsumerware, or some such. As I've said: Regarding censorSHIP, I'd say "censorware" is a derived coinage, in the same way we talk about "a taxing task" (even though that doesn't involve paying money to the government), or "policing the language" (even though that doesn't involved men in blue uniforms from the government).

<li><b>Do Not Delete:</b> This is an incredibly useful tool for online video content, and it would be a loss to the online community were information about veotag not accessible on Wikipedia. I understand that the service is new, thus explaining why it does not have many Google hits and the like. The burden of evidence lies with those wishing to delete this article; that veotag is free to individuals alone ought be convincing enough that this factual article is not part of a "spamming campaign." In any event, I see no harm in allowing this article to continue to exist on Wikipedia, exposing users to a tool meant to help disseminate information, much as Wikipedia is meant to do. --Glen63D 23:22, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>On notability, from Wikipedia's entry: "Many editors also believe that it is fair test of whether a subject has achieved sufficient external notice to ensure that it can be covered from a neutral point of view based on verifiable information from reliable sources, without straying into original research (all of which are formal policies)." A Google search for "veotag" results in 30,000 hits; obviously not all of these hits are useful or reliable sources, but the 126 that Google considers unique each explain, separately, what the service is from what can only be considered a netural point of view. Considering that notability in and of itself is not a formal Wikipedia policy, and that veotag seems to meet the most succinct "test" available to meet said criterion <i>even though</i> it is not a formal policy, veotag ought not be deleted. --Glen63D 11:06, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> The veotag offering does meet the criteria to be included in Wikipedia because it addresses the the fastest growth area of the internet ( online streaming video, long format in particular ) with a set end user tools that are destined to be prolific. While it might not have widespread public relations machine of a YouTube or Google Video, it does have significant adoption of online education thought leaders like Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York , The New York Better Business Bureau, the Catholic Church, and a consortium of Nine Universities in Scotland. The offering is notable as it is an enabling technology that makes long format videos easier to view, easier to understand, and by submitting the annotations and comments to search engines, easier to find. By deleting the page prior to viewing veotagged videos by Jazz at Lincoln Center (<a href="http://www.veotag.com/jalc" class="external text" title="http://www.veotag.com/jalc" rel="nofollow">Jazz at Lincoln Center Distance Education</a> ) or the videos from Princeton or Stanford Universities ( <a href="http://www.veotag.com/browse/?q=princeton+stanford" class="external text" title="http://www.veotag.com/browse/?q=princeton+stanford" rel="nofollow">Princeton &amp; Stanford Lecture Series Videos</a>) would be a deriliction of duty for the wikipedia editors and a disservice to the wikipedia community. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Three_Sons_1b6f.html" title="User:My Three Sons">My Three Sons</a> (<a href="../../../m/y/_/User_talk%7EMy_Three_Sons_e49b.html" title="User talk:My Three Sons">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_My_Three_Sons_9433.html" title="Special:Contributions/My Three Sons">contribs</a>) 21:18, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Perhaps the forum entry is being misunderstood as advertising. There are 2 reasons why veotag should stay in the wikipedia:</li>
</ul>
<p>First, veotag does something new and unusual. It participates in the web in a new way by automatically exporting the tags created in a video to all the major search engines. Thus the use of the product adds to overall semantic information in the WWW. This feature allows people to open any video like a book for reference changing it from a long pipe to something that can be accessed randomly.</p>
<p>At last count, there were more than 29000 entries on Google for veotag - many of them differ in a way which is non-trivial. Quite a few blogs are using the product as a way of telling their story more effectively.</p>
<p>It would seem appropriate to add this to the list of entries be-- 19:52, 2 July 2006 (UTC)cause it is not something for the dictionary but is of public interest -</p>
<p>Veotag is a method and way of indexing video. It happens to be a company. Google, Is also a company on Wikipedia. What do both the Veotag entry and Google have in common? They define to the public what they are and there basic technology method. What happens when someone tells me to veotag my video. "What is veotagging?" I say. I go to Wikipedia and find out.<s>--Jkarol 19:52, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</s><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 216.216.76.11 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.216.76.11_f4f1.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.216.76.11">contribs</a>).</small> The above comment was copied here from the "discussion" section on "veotag" article proper.

<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom. 1,200 people doesn't seem to be worthy of encyclopedia coverage, no matter what they're saying. Al Jazeera is a major news channel with certain political biases, and like any major news channel with certain political biases (as well as most other kinds of major news media - which are all biased in some way of course), they will cover events which would be judged trivial by encyclopedia standards (or is wikipedia going to start articles for every single event with 1,000+ people with a few celebrities in the history of the world now?). Many stories covered by major news channels are not encyclopedic. Celebrities go to a lot of unencyclopedic events.

<li>Can This article be <b>merged</b> with the main Determinism article? This article was created primarily because main article has serious issues .It simultaneously deals with philosophical and scientific views of determinism, going into too much depth into either aspects,failing to provide a concise and understandable explanation of the theory,atleast to the average wikipedian .As you can see this article only deals with the scientific aspect of determinism (not just at the quantum level but the broader aspect of it). I am sorry for not adding any external links or references; that will be done shortly.Kindly choose which is more appropriate:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Let the article remain in wikipedia after the addition of external links and references.</li>
<li>Merge the article with the main determinism article in some way or editing the main article atleast to make it more understandable,etc.</li>
<li>Delete the article altogether.</li>

<dd>The primary problem with the article (in my opinion) is that it's written like an essay. I'm not sure the topic could realistically be written otherwise, but I could certainly be wrong. However with this AfD expiring so soon, I suggest copying it all to a subpage of your userpage ("userfying" it) and working on it there. If you want to do this you can indicate it here and I can help you out, or the closing admin can userfy it for you (I think).</dd>
<dd>If/when you can improve it to meet WP guidelines for an article, perhaps you could mention it on the talk page of the original article or some other place where experts on the topic can discuss it. If it's then deemed to be appropriate for the main namespace, it can always easily be moved (or a deletion review could be requested).</dd>
<dd>The point is, even if this article is deleted, it doesn't have to be the "end of the line" for the topic, if it can truly be turned into a good article. --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:42, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Response to Raghavb</b>: The article still poses no relevancy to begin with. Wikipedia's <a href="../../../d/e/t/Determinism.html" title="Determinism">Determinism</a> article is very detailed, and covers pretty much all aspects of this sphere of philosophy. Your article, at best, is an opinioned and highly dumbed down version for laymen. It reads like a poor essay lacking any sense of neutrality, though tries desperately to present itself as irrefragably factual -- more so with your recent edits, which contain phrases such as "many philosophers accept so and so to be true," although such statements lack any citation. Sorry, but Wikipedia is not a place for POV-pushing. The article needs to be removed. Also, <a href="../../../c/a/u/Causal_Determinism_b31d.html" title="Causal Determinism">Causal Determinism</a> is likely nothing more than an attempt to resurrect this article, and should be deleted just as well. If you have anything important to contribute regarding Determinism, then <i>please do so in the main article</i>.</dd>

<dd>We can't have entries about an individual's opinions and beliefs being littered about Wikipedia. It's simply a waste of bandwidth. Grendel 04:19, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>By the way, I also move that <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-determinism.html" title="Non-determinism">this</a> be deleted. As pointed out above, if you have anything to contribute to Determinism, (that is, provided that it is actually relevant and does not lack citation) then do so within the main article.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm sorry, but you appear to have no idea how the Australian political or electoral systems work, particularly with respect to the power balance and interplay between parties and preferences in the Senate. Note also that they polled around 7% of the primary vote in both houses, despite that they didn't pick up a seat in the lower house. As one who lives and votes here, please take my word for it, the Greens are notable. Any Australian will tell you likewise. This question is academic, as this person would not be notable even if he were an <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">ALP</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Australia_e08b.html" title="Liberal Party of Australia">Liberal</a> nominee. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 00:56, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm sorry, but you appear to have not to have read my comment. I accept that they are notable but, in my view, not a major party - 7% is not what a major party polls in my view - notable, influential, I'm happy to take your word for. To provide an example, in the UK the 'United Kingdom Independence Party' is both notable and influential but no-one would describe them as a major party. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 01:42, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> They are a notable party, but Senate candidates in Australia generally are not just by dint of running for office, becuase of the way the proportional voting system works. This guy isn't notable. Only recreate if elected to the NSW Legislative Council at next election (not until next year). <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 00:23, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> John Kaye. He gets 77 results in a search of an Australia New Zealand media database and there is enough verifiable info about him to write an article. <b>Keep</b> David Risstrom. There are 134 returns in an Australian New Zealand database so there is enough verifiable material available to allow a reasonable article to be written. Jenny Leong is more of a borderline case with 14 articles returned mainly on the topic of gay marriage. The John Kaye article is well written too and not the usual dump of his campaign brochure which is a bonus. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 03:32, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep Kaye, delete Leong</b> no opinion on Risstrom. My reasoning is purely practical: Kaye is second on the Greens' announced ticket <a href="http://www.nsw.greens.org.au/media.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1144628318&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=2&amp;" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nsw.greens.org.au/media.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1144628318&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=2&amp;" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> for the next NSW Legislative Council election, which is just around the corner. Seems a waste of time to delete only to have to recreate next year. Leong won't be on that ballot, which means she's not likely to win any seat anytime soon. Nick 03:38, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> all 3; agree Leong is more marginal but she pooled significant percentage of the primary vote and may appear elsewhere - thus adequately notable and definitely verifiable. Other two as per comemnts by Nick and Capitalistroadster--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 05:13, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Greens candidates who head the Senate ticket in a State. The way the Senate vote goes there is always a strong possibility that they will be elected. The Greens are now the strongest party outside the Coalition parties in government and the Labor Party, as the Democrats vote has crashed. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 09:22, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Both Kaye and Risstrom were very narrowly defeated in 2004 and in circumstances which were fairly controversial involving other parties preference deals. This should ensure their continuing relevance if not the fact that Kaye (at least) is a current candidate likely to win a state seat in 2007. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrismaltby_c1f2.html" title="User:Chrismaltby">Chris Maltby</a> 07:48, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Keep Kaye. The 2007 campaign is very much under way already and the election is less that a year away. Kaye is a prominent candidate with good prospects of entering the parliament. --<a href="../../../w/m/_/User%7EWm_3eec.html" title="User:Wm">Wm</a> 08:01, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Kaye and Risstrom. I think the lead candidate on a Greens senate ticket is notable, even if others are questionable, as they have a significant chance of winning a seat. Nick's reasoning is also a good reason to keep Kaye. Not sure one Leong, but 21% of the vote in <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_of_Sydney_2aa0.html" title="Division of Sydney">Sydney</a> in 2004, seems reasonably notable. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 11:23, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep.</b> Risstrom in particular is highly notable - his campaign was a high-profile one, and he only missed out on a Senate seat by a freak consequence of the preferential voting system. I'd also argue that Kaye is notable, and I see no reason to delete Leong. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 05:32, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I note that <a href="../../../i/r/f/Irfan_Yusuf_7a1c.html" title="Irfan Yusuf">Irfan Yusuf</a>'s page survived this process. As for the vote count, Yusuf got 14,364 votes in an electorate where he had no chance of winning whereas Kaye received 291,845 and missed out on election by 0.5% of the total vote in circumstances which remain significant. Yusuf has vanished without trace from the political process, whereas Kaye is now contesting a winnable seat. Whatever the deletion rules are they should be applied without bias. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrismaltby_c1f2.html" title="User:Chrismaltby">Chris Maltby</a> 06:29, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>DON'T DELETE!</b> Again I spent a lot of time writing that, if you feel it is not a notable product please first confirm that you are an enthusiast of Cigarette Papers. I am trying to get other enthusiasts / collectors to post more info and such, but if someone who doesn't even smoke is allowed to delete an article written by someone who does (and is an authority on such), that wouldn't seem quite fair. I don't think I wrote it as promotional text but please feel free to modify it to make it less promotional and more informative. The text I have added and others have added to the Zig Zag &amp; JOB pages is quite similar so I don't understand the difference really? Article has been redone, anything that seemed promotional is gone and thus hopefully it now passes muster. Please post your opinion below, new opinions should be placed towards the top since the changes of JULY 3, 2006;--<a href="../../../m/r/t/User%7EMrtobacco_3b80.html" title="User:Mrtobacco">Mrtobacco</a> 04:03, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Dear Mrtobacco, it is not a good idea to remove the first deletion reason in the heading of the article (or any other texts here unless they are clear vandalisms). Moreover all Wikipedians are allowed to speak here, both smokers and non-smokers.</li>
<li>Regarding your claims: Please, give us some reasons why to believe that the brand is notable and that the article is not pure advertising. For example: It is a very old brand (say 30+ years in existence)? Is there a book or film where it is prominently featured? Is it the market leader? - I think that most of us would like to keep the article in Wikipedia, but it should contain strong and sourced reasons why the brand is notable. Please read <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../i/m/p/WP%7EIMP_460f.html" title="WP:IMP">WP:IMP</a>. --<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 08:24, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I am sorry but I don't know enough about the brand to respond to your questions. For me it is very notable because it's the only gummed rice paper that is still produced. I like the marketing of it (the Elements girls and the holographic packages) and I really like the way it burns. It's my favorite white paper, and based on my collection of more then 1,000 packs, for me to say that it really does mean a lot. I don't know the sales data nor the full history (or if it's been in movies etc..) although I have emailed the manufacturer to ask.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Ug, you're one of those people that hate me eh&#160;:( OK sure I certainly do not have the Wiki experience that you do, and I will therefore bow-out and do my best to add that text to a different page. I'm reluctant to add it to the Rolling Papers page because any talk of brands there leads a user named "Lostsociety" to put in blurbage about his company's products (Bambu). Ie if I talk about JOB Rolling papers being the top seller in Chicago, he will delete that and replace it with Bambu related text every time. Maybe you would consider locking the Rolling papers and Bambu articles to stop this barrage of gunfire from him (he uses other aliases as well)? When I get back from Virginia (running around in the tobacco fields....), I will try to dig deeper and maybe write an article about Rolling Paper Brands alltogether. Thanks for all your advice and such&#160;:) I guess you won't be helping me with the rewrite of the GITANES article (they were John Lennon's favorite cigarette, folklore has it that he smoked them to make his voice deeper and this is missing from the article) --<a href="../../../m/r/t/User%7EMrtobacco_3b80.html" title="User:Mrtobacco">Mrtobacco</a> 06:11, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Closer's notes</b><br />
This debate was evenly divided between people in favour of deleting the list, those in favour of keeping the list, and those in favour of merging and redirecting the list somewhere else. The main argument in favour of keeping the list was that the centralised list was useful. The main argument both for deleting and for merging was that the list largely duplicated content found elsewhere.</p>
<p>While this discussion reached no consensus, it was trending away from keeping the article in its present form. The option now most compatible with this debate would be to <b>discuss a strategy for merging this article</b>. Consideration should be given to the significant minority who find a centralised list useful.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, consider <b>Merge</b> This is far more complex than a content fork. <i>Table of books of Judeo-Christian Scripture</i> is a far larger article than <i>Books of the Bible</i> in terms of the headings and the books. We have to keep religion out of the discussion though the topic is to do with religion, and view the article on its merits as an article. I see substantial merit in this article with information that is simply not present in the older one. I would like to see more description in addition to the table, however. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 20:51, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> non-overlapping content into <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_the_Bible_908a.html" title="Books of the Bible">Books of the Bible</a> then <b>Delete</b>.

<li><s><b>Keep</b> obviously - this is a very useful list for writing about Christian and pseudo-Christian documents. I would, however, suggest renaming it to "List of ..." and removing the Mormon books. This isn't for theological reasons - it's just that if we put a column for every new Christian and pseudo-Christian religion and their holy books, it would really be gigantic. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 22:33, 1 July 2006 (UTC)&lt;/a&gt;</s></li>

<dd>The distinction between <i>Books of the Bible</i> and <i>Table of books of Judeo-Christian Scripture</i> is that the latter includes apocryphal writings. We already have an article on <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocrypha.html" title="Apocrypha">Apocrypha</a>, and sub-articles on all stripes of apocryphal writings, such as <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_apocrypha.html" title="Jewish apocrypha">Jewish apocrypha</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_apocrypha.html" title="Biblical apocrypha">Biblical apocrypha</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_apocrypha_b74e.html" title="New Testament apocrypha">New Testament apocrypha</a>.

<dd>Ok ... I have re-examined the list and I accept your reasoning. The only difference between this table and the one in <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_the_Bible_908a.html" title="Books of the Bible">Books of the Bible</a> is the inclusion of the Mormon books and the inclusion of the apocrypha. Both of those efforts are duplicated elsewhere. As it is, this list is extremely large, apparantly for POV purposes, and the functionality is covered elsewhere.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> Although this might have some use the stuff is already tabulated and listed elsewhere under morespecific categories, per the above. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 00:11, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The distinction Dr. Zak makes is inaccurate. Not only does the table include apocryphal books; it also includes pseudpigrapha, lost books, oral Torah, and Restorationist books. Books of the Bible covers only a fragment of what this article covers. This much more comprehensive page is the obvious keep. As to removing "Mormon" books (??), use of the term "pseudo-Christian" demonstrates bigotry, not theology. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEditrix_2b10.html" title="User:TheEditrix">The Editrix</a> 00:32, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you are reading into what I said that Mormons fall into the "pseudo-Christian" category rather than the "Christian" category, then you're reading something I never said. Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons, Christian Science, Way International, Swedenborgianism, and plenty of other modern Christian or pseudo-Christian groups have their own scriptures. Listing every single one of them on a table of what different denominations believe would get very big very fast. The list is already big. It's a useful list as I said above, but if the only purpose in having it is so that you can equate modern scriptures with ancient ones, there's a problem somewhere. This isn't a question of theology - it's a question of usefulness. Among ancient scriptures, Mormons use the same books Protestants do as far as I know, so the only possible use in having a separate column would be for POV issues. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 01:09, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>While I try always to assume good faith, I find myself asking why this deletion nomination has now assumed such large proportions that you have looked for this? Is there something that we do not know about here that should be brought to our attention in order that we may be better informed about the page you feel should be deleted? I unerstand completely the wikipedia distaste for internal spamming. Equally I have the strong opinion that it is the article that will survive AfD or will fail to survive, and that great tranches of "delete" vs "keep" tend to alert the closing admin to the fact that there is an underlying issue far wider than an article itself. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 07:30, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would agree to this rationale - for one thing, it would ensure the current article does not constitute a mere POV fork. But, aside from that small concern, and assuming good faith, the tabular form of this article is simply a mess - the section heading "Apocrypha recognized, but not canonized" appears in the middle of the Restorationist column for absolutely no logical reason, also the table appears to show books demarcated as they are used by various churches in its first five columns but, due to the flawed layout, makes no such indication for the contents of the Apocrypha/Pseudepigrapha column. They are simply "there". If the reason for this is "it would be too difficult to squeeze in all the details", then this merely reinforces the need for a separate table for Apocrypha/Pseudepigrapha, ideally as part of the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_the_Bible_908a.html" title="Books of the Bible">Books of the Bible</a> article. The new table could then follow the same "as used by..." columnar format as the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_the_Bible_908a.html" title="Books of the Bible">Books of the Bible</a> main table, and IMO might then become actually useful. Trying to "do it all" in one table obviously isn't working. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 14:33, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There are many lawyers, professors, and teachers who have biographies on Wikipedia, but very few ministers. There are only about 15 Southern Baptist ministers with bios. Pastor Spencer was a substantial minister in the central Louisiana area for three decades. I will try to get more information this week. Here's hoping you won't delete him just yet. I looked over the list for deletion, and I must say that nearly everything there on first appearance looked as if it did not belong. -- Billy Hathorn 14:02, 4 July 2006
<ul>
<li>What you have to remember is that, to be included, verifiable notability must be established. I am certain that some of the lawyers, professors, and teachers you mention do not belong in Wikipedia. Likewise, I am sure there are ministers who <i>do</i> belong, but have yet to be added. The key to adding a successful article to this encyclopedia is the notability of the individual to a broad population. If the person is only notable to a specific, limited number of people, then the person's article is likely to come up for this kind of review. --<a href="../../../n/m/c/User%7ENMChico24_74ee.html" title="User:NMChico24">NMChico24</a> 02:10, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Here is a link under "Teachers" that I pulled from random:<br />
Paul Geisert was a biology teacher in Chicago in the 1960s, a professor in the 1970s, an entrepreneur and writer in the 1980s, and the co-developer of learning materials and a web sites for teaching religion in the public schools in the 1990s. He also attended the Godless March which subsequently led to his coining of the noun bright and co-directorship of The Brights Net.<br />

How is this person more worthy of inclusion that a pastor known throughout central Louisiana? -- Billy Hathorn
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Here is another person under "American academics" who would seem to have notability only within his academic area. In fact, he is an ADJUNCT professor at Rice. Pastor Spencer was in the field for some four decades. It seems to me that we are setting a higher bar for ministers than for other professions.<br />

<li>Here's another entry under "Christian pastors" that in my view is not stronger than the one for Pastor Spencer here:<br />
<br />
Apostle Arturo Skinner, known as the "Father of Deliverance" in black Pentecostal circles, founded the Deliverance Evangelistic Center of Brooklyn, New York, in the 1950s and founded other churches, or centers, in cities such as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Newark, New Jersey; and other large and small cities up and down the East Coast. Skinner's ministry, which Pentecostal in nature, focused on salvation and divine healing. There was also a strong element of the prophetic in Skinner's ministry and in the ministries of the evangelists and other clergy who received ecclesiastical training at his centers.<br />
<br />
Hundreds of pastors credit Skinner, also known as "Apostle Skinner," as their spiritual guide as well as for being the man under whom their ministries started. Skinner is believed to be the first Pentecostal to employ the title apostle as an indicator of the spiritual gifts at work in his churches. This use has been emulated by many of his spiritual sons and daughters as well as by people unaffiliated with his movement, and even by some who are unfamiliar with his name and history altogether.<br />

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> One of the problems with Indian names is that they can be transliterated in different ways and thus, a straight google search is never helpful. Another unfortunate and unavoidable problem is that several famous people share the same name (esp. in North India) making Google test very difficult to validate. Coming to this nom, Kedarnath Agarwal has won the <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahitya_Akademi_f600.html" title="Sahitya Akademi">Sahitya Akademi</a> award which is the most notable award (next only to <a href="../../../j/n/a/Jnanpith_Award_6c99.html" title="Jnanpith Award">Jnanpith Award</a>).

There also at least one businessman and one movie producer with a similar name. Noone is saying this poet doesn't exist, we're just wondering how strong his notability is. I'm not changing my vote from weak keep, as I still think this guy is notable for his awards but still concerned about his lack of press coverage. I tried a Factiva search for your alternative spelling and got 0 relevant hits. He does seem to be occasionally mentioned in the news media as in <a href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1717/17171020.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1717/17171020.htm" rel="nofollow">Frontline article where he gets a very quick mention in a long list of poets in an article about a more famous poet</a>, but not very much at all.

<dd>I am sorry if you feel that Government of India funded websites are unreliable. Aren't you being over the top when you say that you have no way of verifying <b>any</b> information? That he has won <i>Sahitya Akademi</i> award is verifiable. I'm definite that if someone is diligent enough to go through the 1000-odd Google hits for various spellings of his name, they'll find more info. I have shown that atleast some of the info is verifiable and that it is notable. If you feel that some info is not verifiable, either excise it from the article or better still, slap such info with {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}}.

<li>I don't understand what you mean by "over the top". I have just reviewed the page again, and suggest if there are government agencies that provide funding that these agencies be referenced on the page. Any published mention of the awards should also be placed in the references. The problem here may be one of language as you suggest, but dilligence is the burden of the author rather than the reader.

<li>May I point out, Ste4k, that on Wikipedia we are all simultaneously authors and readers. A quick look around the net about what the Sahitya Akademi is and who wins its awards might have been called for rather than an AfD. Then you, yourself, could have referenced the article. In future, why dont you try that? Also, when reading articles written about a cultural or political milieu with with you are unfamiliar, and where <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a> might come into play, be very very careful about random prod-ing and AfDing.

<p>The result of the debate was</p>
<p><b>Deleted.</b> While the article describes a notable conspiracy theory, its narrative was that of the conspiracy theorists, and no reliable sources were cited. If an article on this topic is to be written, it needs to be based on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">reliable sources</a>, such as books or papers by notable historians, and rewritten from scratch. To anyone who wants to work on an encyclopedic narrative about this topic, I'd be happy to provide a copy of the most recent revision; it might also be a good idea to do this in a consolidated article about Nazi conspiracy theories (or a similar title).

<p>The <i>Battle</i> is probably a hoax or at least a misnomer. No such place is mentioned in the sources. No archeological reference is known.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Still checking but just wanted to point out that if this is hoax, then vandals have also infected <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Lautulae_7043.html" title="Battle of Lautulae">Battle_of_Lautulae</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Roman_battles_6e95.html" title="List of Roman battles">List of Roman battles</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/m/Template%7ECampaignbox_Samnite_Wars_e19d.html" title="Template:Campaignbox Samnite Wars">Template:Campaignbox_Samnite_Wars</a> with Ciuna mentions. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 22:14, 1 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Followup</b> Note that this battle is supposed to have taken place in 315BC, one year after the battle of Lautulae in 316BC (According to the Lautulae article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Lautulae&amp;diff=61600752&amp;oldid=60430488" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Lautulae&amp;diff=61600752&amp;oldid=60430488" rel="nofollow">before I corrected it</a>).

<li>The battle of Laetula is real enough (Livius, aUc IX-25), but references probably got in by avid wikipedians, taking all articles in the wiki for granted. Incorrectly, but in good faith. The same happened on the dutch wiki and even our italian friends admit they got suckered in.

<p>Seems to be noted only for speaking about Wikipedia to media and at events. So have, for example, Kurt Jansson and Arne Klempert for the German Wikipedia and Wikimedia e.V. (both have appeared in national newspapers, magazines, and on national television), neither of whom has (or should have) an article. Wikipedia is such a media phenomenon that being interviewed about it alone does not make one notable. Might reconsider if he receives an official position with a Japanese chapter.</p>

<li>No. You know, the permission level was called "bureaucrat" exactly because we didn't want people to consider it a status symbol, but a purely functional role for some higher level administrative tasks (assigning sysop, bot status). We could probably have called it "silly wikiaddict" and people would still want to proudly proclaim it in their biographies.&#160;;-) --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 02:44, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
