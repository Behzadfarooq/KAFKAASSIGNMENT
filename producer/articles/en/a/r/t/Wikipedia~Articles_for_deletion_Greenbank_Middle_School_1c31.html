<li><b>Merge</b> per Carnildo, to keep the school inclusionists happy... though truthfully, a separate wiki for schools would be a whole lot more useful than turning Wikipedia into a <a href="../../../w/w/i/WP%7EWWIN_b86f.html" title="WP:WWIN">web directory of schools</a>. If a school isn't well-known out of state, or at the center of a national news story, it's not notable enough to receive its own article. Universities are notable because in the job market and academia, they receive much more recognition than schools below them do. Schools below university level should just be mentioned in passing with their city, just as shopping malls, libraries, etc., are. (And yes, I did actually read the article and see its recent changes before voting.) --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 1 July 2005 04:52 (UTC)

<li>"Inclusionist" is Wikipedia slang for those bent on including every possible scrap of trivia under the heading "knowledge" (as opposed to "deletionists", who are intent on slash-and-burn censorship throughout Wikipedia to leave ignorance and darkness in their wake). Or something like that.</li>
<li>Schools seem to touch a particular nerve, whereby people who might argue strenuously against inclusion of people who lack strong evidence of fame, accomplishment, and/or notoriety suddenly , when it comes to schools, confuse Wikipedia with the Special Olympics, where EVERY school is special regardless of its fame, accomplishment, and/or notoriety. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 1 July 2005 05:37 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Have just redone a part about the Kids Helping Kids Program, which might bring to light some notability for the school. No, I the author will not under any circumstances merge this with the entries for the City of <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa.html" title="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, the <a href="../../../o/c/d/OCDSB_e610.html" title="OCDSB">OCDSB</a> or any other entry <b>WHILE</b> (and I mean while truthfuly here) there are some stubs of high schools in the area (e.g. <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_High_School_%28Ottawa%29_43c5.html" title="Bell High School (Ottawa)">Bell High School</a>) of whom have less information than this entry and which are allowed to be sitting there freely. The ONLY reason you discriminate against the entry is that you do not believe this school is as worth speaking of as a high school, or even a university.

Saying it's not really notable for anything, although true, it's in more in how you said it than what you said. e.g. "<i>trust me</i>" That's kinda harsh, don't you think?)

<li>Hmm.. there's a thought... making an obviously stubby entry in Wikipedia for a basketball tournament around Ottawa started by one specific school that doesn't have an entry itself.

<li>The problem is that the district article does nothing to support development there.
