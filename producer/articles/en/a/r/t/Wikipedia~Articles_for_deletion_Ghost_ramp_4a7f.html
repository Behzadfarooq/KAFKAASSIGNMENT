<dd>Your google test is flawed.

<dd>it still faces the OR issue, though, because the only source for a lot of these is a photograph of the ramp in question, which says nothing about whether it is actually abandoned or why it is in the current state.

<li><b>Comment</b> since I am working at a computer that rejects cookies and therefore cannot sign in. The terms "ghost ramp" and "stub ramps" are synonymous and have been use long before there was an Internet (the definition can be found <a href="http://www.southeastroads.com/glossary.html" class="external text" title="http://www.southeastroads.com/glossary.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, for example, in addition to several travel books; the State of Washington uses the synonym <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/transit/ptr_newsletter/2006_october.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/transit/ptr_newsletter/2006_october.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>). As far as <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is concerned, those ghost ramps/stub ramps mentioned in the page that have external links most definitely do not constitute original research in the Wikipedia definition. This this the most liberal interpretation of WP:NOR I've seen in my time with Wikipedia - if this interpretation is upheld, then 90 percent of the road articles (and 100% of those with current exit lists) violate the policy as well. Furthermore, if we are now defining neologisms as terms being used by only a certain segment of the population, we'd better be very well consistent in that interpretation... and delete about 99% of the technology articles - or anything dealing with a very specialized topic - as well. From this person's viewpoint, this is right on the edge of a bad faith nomination, particularly in light of over 150 external links and references in the article.147.70.242.40 19:15, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Count of references means nothing if none of them are <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> or support what the article is actually claiming. List of YTMND Fads had hundreds of linked YTMNDs but it was still original research to identify things as fads. Unless you have sources documenting that these ramps are in fact abandoned, it's original research to link and satellite photo and claim it as proof that the ramp is abandoned. As for the glossary, all it says is that "some definitions of commonly used words and phrases on AARoads," it doesn't say it's an accepted term beyond that website or with any particular history, or even that it's the best term. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 19:45, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: (Before I even get to my reply, I should point out that its synonym "stub ramp" has been used/cited in legal opinions, including <a href="http://www.landcourt.qld.gov.au/Decisions/PDF/A98-13.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.landcourt.qld.gov.au/Decisions/PDF/A98-13.pdf" rel="nofollow">this one from Australia</a>). Now, are you saying that photographs showing their existence are OR without the documentation of their history? If that is the case, all this article would need would be a more emphatic presentation of the references to their histories. This can be done without having to resort to an extreme measure of an AfD... as quite a few of them are already there, just not presented in a fashion that seems to be preferred by some editors.147.70.242.40 19:58, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I agree that the article should be moved, but not deleted. The article needs to be pruned and renamed. There is some interesting stuff here, like the I-70/I-95 interchange that got cancelled and the ramps that were partially built. Much of this is not relevant. Now as for claiming there's a stub ramp, IMHO aerial photography to show out-of-use ramps and whatnot is fine, pictures are neat to, but to claim where a half-built ramp would go would need a source. For example "There are ghost ramps on I-65 in Huntsville for both north- and southbound" or something like that, Google map it. To continue "these ramps were to be I-365, but was cancelled" needs to be sourced. There are no ramps there, it's an example I made up. <b>--<a href="../../../m/p/d/User%7EMPD01605_77c2.html" title="User:MPD01605">MPD01605</a> (<a href="../../../m/p/d/User_talk%7EMPD01605_0e7e.html" title="User talk:MPD01605">T</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPD01605_89a1.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPD01605">C</a>)</b> 22:58, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The photos are a pretty clear indication of ramps that lead to nowhere. There's obviously a reason that all of these ghost ramps exist and the fact that they do exist (with associated proof in the form of satellite pictures) is not debatable. For someone to say the ramp was built and the project was cancelled is not original research, though it may be unsourced. Unsourced statements are not necessarily original research. Just request sources ({{fact}}) on anything that you think is not properly sourced. Sparingly use the {{OR}} tag for speculation only. <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 18:23, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They are not original research because an aerial image <i>clearly</i> indicates that the ramp is no longer used and is abandoned. It doesn't take a genius to see that if you see an abandoned ramp, or a graded path, that it was to be for a purpose. That itself is not original research.</dd>

<dd><i>Neologisms are words and terms that have recently been coined, generally do not appear in any dictionary, but may be used widely or within certain communities</i>... and if the term has been in use for over four decades, it might not have "recently been coined," unless we wish to argue and nitpick on the definition of "recently" (while we're at it, shall we also debate of legitimacy of the Wikipedia definitions of "obscenity" and "smut"?). The terms "ghost ramp" and "stub ramp" predate the Internet by decades - and, unless there has been a change of definition in the last few years, neither involved the abandonment issue.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Where's your evidence that they obtained their information by "scouring aerial photos"? Looks like a bit of a leap to a conclusion on the basis of not a lot of evidence. Gathering together information for an article is in no way original research. The detail of the information provided on the page certainly does not imply that these are merely assumptions of the existence of ghost ramps based on aerial photographs (which would be original research). -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 00:08, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>To be fair, the Houston items (only, AFAIK) do have some references, but reading them did not lead me to conclude they are actually <i>abandoned</i>, as there was discussion about future plans. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 00:31, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Again, this brings us back to the scope of what this article should be. Is it about ramps that for which the connecting road will be built + ones that may be built + ones that will almost certainly not be built? What Wikipedian is in the position to interpret what "may" or "almost certainly not" mean? If Wikipedians try to determine the difference themselves, without reliable sources, that would constitute original research. Determining the difference with reliable sources is good article writing. Regarding the ramps in Houston, I think a 20+ year period before construction continues on ramps is notable (like Spur 5). <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 00:54, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then why is the only reference the image, in nearly every entry? As Crum is pointing out, there seems to be a real scarcity of any reliable sources calling these things "ghost ramps", which is why this article has real verifiability issues. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 00:38, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sure sources exist for many of these ramps. State DOT offices would have information on proposed freeways and local newspaper articles would, in many cases, explain why the project was cancelled. Let's work on sourcing some of the major ones, possibly keeping the unsourced ones on the talk page until sources can be found. <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 01:00, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I added the sources earlier for the Houston area ramps and also a few non-satellite sources for the Saint Louis area ramps. I would think the Embarcadero, Mt. Hood Freeway, and I-70 extension into Baltimore would have reliable sources explaining the reason for the cancellations as these were contentious routes. <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 22:19, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Earlier I stated that the article should be kept, and I still feel that way, but that does not mean that I think the article is fine the way it is now. The article states that a ghost ramp "is an incomplete onramp or offramp which does not connect a freeway or expressway with another road" and on a cursory look it appears there are numerous entries do not meet the definition. Some examples from the region I live in are the 2 entries for Louisville. The first entry is a highway section that is partially complete in anticipation of being completed, has no ramps that do not connect to another road, and has no 'ghost ramps'. The second Louisville entry is on a completed intersection, so it should not included either. A Cincinnati entry has its reference as a page on 'Never-Built Cincinnati Expressways'... if it was never built, there is no 'ghost ramp' there either. In contrast, I've driven through Memphis several times and have seen these ramps to nowhere and, being the curious person that I am, looked it up online and found that the partially constructed highway was stopped mid-construction due to a lawsuit that was won by neighborhood groups. I would be the first to say that the article does have inaccuracies and is in need of cleanup, but that does not mean it needs to be deleted altogether. Ghost ramp is a valid term and this could be a good article if it only included true ghost ramps (which I would guess would be about ⅓ of what is actually listed) and had more references than just links to aerial photographs, but instead of throwing the good out with the bad I find it preferable to make the mediocre better. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris24_12cc.html" title="User:Chris24">Chris24</a> 01:40, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think it's mediocre - I think it's totally unacceptable as it stands.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I think that claims of original research are based upon the false assumption that the information was gathered only from aerial photos...when in fact, in many cases, the information is common knowledge in the area in question, but is hard to cite because it has not been reported on in many years, and would have only been reported by local news sources, if anything. Besides, I always thought that the purpose of the aerial photo links was not to cite sources, but to illustrate the ramp being described. And before I forget, I do think the term is common enough. — <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELastusernameever_4fe2.html" title="User:Lastusernameever">Lastusernameever</a> 13:19, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Aye, but there's the rub. Most of these are merely supported by a WP enthusiast's GoogleMap aerial photo of what <i>seems</i> to fit the criterion (with possible added comment "trust me, over here everyone knows it's abandoned"). A little short on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">reliable sourcing</a>, to the say the least, and a little long on <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. To meet the criterion you suggest, we would need definitive information showing the stub in question is truly <i>abandoned</i>, not just a work-in-progress with some possible delay. And I have yet to see a single such reference that clearly shows abandonment for any of the items in the article. And even if there are a couple that I missed, the vast majority are pure <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and speculation at this time. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 15:42, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The issue is the <i>future</i>, not the <i>present</i>. The picture only shows us the present - not the future.

<dd>No, we have not decided on the scope, so it is the <i>present</i> phenomenon that we (many editors) are trying to describe (with, in some cases, information about past construction plans). I brought this up before, asking what the scope should be. Some editors have suggested that it only be about ramps that were built with the intention of connecting to another freeway which were later cancelled. However, there was no consensus. The scope of the article could be to-be-constructed freeways or "abandoned" ramps. Many of the naysayers seem to be using this one case (that the article should only include "abandoned" ramps) so that they can make a half-credible argument of original research. All of the satellite photos show non-completed ramps and that is not debatable. If we eventually decide to limit the scope to only abandoned ramps, and editors add unsourced information claiming that a ramp is abandoned based only on a satellite photo, <i>then</i> you can make the claim of original research. <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 17:38, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>'Abandoned', as in a public project, has a negative connotation, that reflects poorly on the community and/or its local government. At WP we only make a negative comment about a community or a government if it's well supported.

<dd>You're stretching here. "Abandoned" is not necessarily perjorative: in the case of the ghost ramps (or whatever you want to call these things) along I-5 in Portland, they were built for projected highways that not only were never built, it took local grassroots mobilization to stop them. Making government officials listen to the people is sometimes a good thing. And saying that these projects could be restarted any time is much like saying that the USA is not definitively independent of the UK: after all, the UK could always raise &amp; send an army to end their "rebellion". -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 17:22, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Calling a project, that has a visually unsightly ramp leading to nowhere, 'abandoned' is making a judgment, not just a visual observation. That judgment requires proof, per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 17:44, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There's no need to use the black-and-white term "abandoned" in every paragraph if the article is kept. There are many options:
<ul>
<li>Where proof and reliable sources exist, use "abandoned".</li>
<li>Where the status of the ramp is unknown, but proof exists that it has never been used, we could say "unused"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Or "unused for X years".</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Where the satellite picture shows an obvious ramp that is unusable (e.g. because it dead-ends in mid-air) leading to nothing, we could say "currently unused stub ramp". (Again, this depends on the scope of the article that we decide on).</li>

<dd>However, if the article is deleted, there will be no chance to convey these differences or subtleties.

<dd>Give me a break. So let's just remake this article into one that is just all rosy and cheerful by calling them "unused highway ramps" is okay, but your whole argument about "WP makes negative comments if its well supported" is quite laughable. Labeling a ramp "abandoned" is not "negative" but <b>clearly states that the ramp <i>is</i> abandoned, no longer used.</b> Now tell me how that is "negative" against the "government"? A rerouting could have occured, or the ramp may have been realigned, or there was community opposition. You have no idea, so don't go out and label all "abandoned ramps" as negativity towards this "government." <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 18:02, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Anything that is ugly looking and seems like a waste of taxpayer's money (if truly abandoned) is negative. To say that it is for sure <i>abandoned</i>, hence negative reflection on the community/government, would require <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">proper proof</a>. An aerial photo doesn't prove abandonment, only lack of completion at a given point in time. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 18:13, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Who said ugly? Not me. Where in the article (except for the one road in Quebec talking about striping) does it say ugly? Or unsightly? Who said "waste of taxpayer's (sic) money"? Where in the article does it say this? Nowhere that I can see. For someone to make the leap to say it's "ugly" or a "waste of taxpayers' money" takes, well, ... a leap. If you have a problem with the wording, change that. But let's not scrap the article. <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 18:34, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, in some cases, building the intial ramps is probably cheaper if there is a high probability that the connecting road will be built. If you're doing a construction project on one freeway, it's likely a lot less expensive to built the connections (the ramps) from road #1 to road #2 while doing construction work on road #1 so that road #1 doesn't have to be partially shut down again when road #2 is eventually built. If the DOT of that state and leaders were under the impression that building road #2 was a virtual certainty, then building the ramps first makes more economic sense. <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 18:40, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I thought this was one of those things that are obvious, at least to me it was. Are you saying that to you the <i>abandoned</i> stubs are not ugly, nor a waste of money? <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 18:37, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So it's obvious, but POV? Maybe your POV? Has anyone else used the words ugly or waste of money other than you? I'm suggesting that we describe a ramp as ... (see my bulleted list above)... as it is. If you make the leap that it's ugly and a waste of money, that's your prerogative, but not the result of wording in the article, nor any editor's words on this talk page. <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 18:45, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So are you saying that to you the clearly abandoned ones are not ugly nor a waste of money? <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 18:51, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First, no I'm not saying that and did not say that.</li>
<li>Second, regarding ugliness: who cares if I think it's ugly?!? If a reliable source shows significant community opinion that it is ugly, then we can mention it. Otherwise, it's totally irrelevant and should be worded in a way that prevents making a judgment regarding the aesthetic qualities of these structures in a general or on a case-by-case basis.</li>
<li>Third, regarding "waste of money": It depends on the case. Construction projects in general have contingency plans based on the difficulty of construction or significance of (environmental, social, economic, etc.) impacts based on different alternatives and also on the future political atmosphere (e.g. Who will be in office X years from now when the project will require important permits? Are there any politically powerful people (or "squeaky wheels") in the path of the proposed project, regardless of the significance of impacts to those people)? They make the best decisions possible based on the information they have at they time regarding whether or not a project will proceed (in this case, road #2 (see above)). If there's an 80% chance that road #2 will be built and the costs of building the ramps (from road #1 to road #2) now are less than the costs of building the ramps later once the area has grown in population and traffic (keep in mind that you have to shut down road #1 once again), then I would say it probably makes sense to take the gamble and build the ramps now. Nowadays, schedule analysis in construction projects is much more sophisticated than it was 40 years ago, so there's not as much "gambling" inherent in this scenario. So, to sum up, it depends on each circumstance. If we have reliable sources that analyze the costs in depth or that show that significant community opinion (in the area of the ramps) believes the ramps were a waste of money, let's add it. Otherwise, my opinion and your opinion are irrelevant, as this is an encyclopedia and not a blog. <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 19:08, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>(outdent)My point is not that we need to say in the article that "ghost ramps are ugly" or waste of money, although I am sure we could get a reputable source to say that if we wanted to. My point is simply that calling a structure or a construction project 'abandoned' is negative, at least to most people, and hence can only be done on WP article space if there is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">proper sourcing</a> for saying so. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 19:22, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The negative aspect of the statements does have some implications in WP. Yes, everything needs good sources, but we tend to be more strict and require <i>better</i> sources when a negative statement, that can be perceived as offensive to someone or some group is made. Also, in the case of non-negative statements some have made the argument of "let's leave the statement in the article, and hope that some future editor will add a source". I personally don't buy that, but in the case of a negative statement it's even more unacceptable. So yes, they all require sources, but negatives require better sources, and they stay out unless well sourced. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 19:55, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is not a <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">Biography of a living person</a>. The ramp will not get offended and it is extremely unlikely that the builder or designer of these ramps or highway projects will get offended either. It's just an abandoned ramp, not an abandoned area, or an abandoned person or group of people, or an abandoned city. So I would be surprised if residents of the areas in question get offended either. In some cases (e.g. Portland or San Francisco), people see these "abandoned ramps" as a source of pride...a neighborhood "saved", sticking it to the man, etc., etc. "Abandoned" ≠ a negative statement. So far, you are the only one making this argument. I have already proposed removing some of the unsourced and least credible statments and putting unsourced statments on <a href="../../../g/h/o/Talk%7EGhost_ramp_4a38.html" title="Talk:Ghost ramp">Talk:Ghost ramp</a>. Those statements can remain there and gradually be readded as we get sources. I would hope that this should satisfy your desires to get "negative" statements out of the article space, not that I think such a thing is necessary because the statement are "negative". Rather, they should be stored on the talk page because they are simply unsourced. <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 20:09, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Good. We may have to put 90% of the items on the talk page (or perhaps a sub-talk page) to start out, but if that is necessary to save the article, I wouldn't have any major objections. There are a few sources as refs, a few other non-satellite embedded references, and a few articles that have wikilinks to other sourced articles, so the entire article would not likely disappear. Perhaps I will propose this as an alternative to deletion. <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 20:17, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
