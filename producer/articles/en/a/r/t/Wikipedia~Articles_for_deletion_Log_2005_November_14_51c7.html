<li><b>Delete</b>. I responded to a message yesterday on the help desk from Timp of Britlist wondering what had happened to an article he had posted. I checked the records and noticed that we had an article created by Tim Patterson of November 9 and I assume that Tim P of Britlist and Tim Patterson are one and the same. I did a search and discovered 109,000 hits so I put a notice on the UK Wikipedians notice board talk page see [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:UK_Wikipedians%27_notice_board#Britlist" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:UK_Wikipedians%27_notice_board#Britlist" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>].

<li>This isn't systemic bias. A similiar article about any country's blogs would have similiar problems.

<li><b>Delete</b> Do we need something describing what blogs are for every country? What makes Canada so special? All of this information is just repeatative of what blogging in general is. 131.128.142.226 06:44, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a no-brainer in the Canadian media; this is used as part of any good barometer of Canadian public opinion. Deleting this article would be a mistake, and I think significantly demonstrates an offhand US systemic bias on Wikipedia. It *is* tantamount to saying that Canadian political debate (which naturally contains a lot of debate about US policy, for reasons any Canadian would see as obvious (US policy has arguably as much effect on Canada as Canadian policy)) is irrelevant. As a Canadian, I'm inclined to object to that. References to PB or 'Canadian Blogosphere' as 'non-notable' here seem to be offhand and poorly informed. I don't hesitate to say that an American isn't going to be naturally inclined to make an informed choice about this. There are, after all, only 30 million Canadians. . . for US perspective, that's NYC and surrounding areas, and we're a pretty politically splintered group. That said, the Alexa rankings make perfect sense, and actually don't justify deletion based on overall popularity. Overall popularity among whom? Americans interested in Canadian political scandals? "What makes Canada so special?" What makes the US so special that most references in 'blogging' are pulled from the US (and refer to it)? Is there a US or pan-global content requirement for a Wikipedia article to be relevant? I wasn't aware that there was.
<ul>
<li>You're making an argument to fix the U.S. bias in the other articles, not to keep this particular one. There is nothing special about Canadian blogs, and there is also nothing special about U.S. blogs, so no article should be biased towards either. Incidentally, before you go assuming I'm demonstrating bias here myself, let me add that I'm British... and I would vote to delete British Blogosphere, if it existed. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 17:07, 15 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm actually making the argument that this is a form of political dialogue that is rather important in Canada, and that if, perhaps, the article ought to be about anything other than what it is (which is bewildering, IMO), it ought to be about or include a distinct section about the mechanism by which the Canadian media interacts with this specific set of blogs, and the reason why they have such an effect on the political debate in Canada. That is notable, IMO. These sites are simply not what these delete votes claim. Sigma-6</li>

<li>I really, really hope people will explain their reasoning for keeping or deleting as it relates to editorial policies and the objections to the content. Assuming sinister anti-left or anti-Canada motives is not helpful. Also, just because there are equally unverifiable articles on other topics does not make <i>this</i> a proper article. This isn't written as an article, it's written as a personal essay. I'm willing to accept that blogs are significant to Canadian politics. But, this is a recent movement, and if no proper sources are available on this topic, there's no way to have an article about it.

<li><b>Comment</b> I fail to see how the blogosphere is a "recent movement". The word was coined at the latest in 2002, and one assumes what it describes was going on for some time before that.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is getting silly. There is systemic bias on Wikipedia <i>in favor of all things internet-related</i>. This article's existance is <i>helped</i> by the bias, not hurt by it. This is not an "American article versus Canadian article" issue- Wikipedia is meant for the whole world, not just two particular countries. There should be no such thing as an American article or Canadian article, they're all just articles. But, the big issue here is the <b>lack of verifiability</b>. This is a broad, new topic. I don't see how it's going to be possible to write a proper article (rather than a personal essay) on this topic unless there are good secondary sources available. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> 00:39, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: As for the country specific blogosphere articles, to me this is a no-brainer. Blogs, by their very nature as websites, are global.

<p><b>Comment</b>. One of Wikipedia's recognised strengths is that it is up-to-date, especially on recent phenomena. We have articles on every single imaginable video game, most music albums you care to mention, practically every single piece of software out there, a number of <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">usenet</a> <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsgroups.html" title="Newsgroups">newsgroups</a>, Wikipedia did better than the regular news media on recent events such as the London bombings and Hurricane Katrina, and so on. Where else but Wikipedia can people find hopefully neutral information on the recent and increasingly important phenomenon of blogging, especially political blogs, which are not neutral by their very nature. NPOV articles on Blogging groups (not necessarily individual blogs, mind you), perform a vital service to the world at large. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigizanasi_db83.html" title="User:Luigizanasi">Luigizanasi</a> 04:08, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>It's not a <i>good</i> way per-se. The best way is for someone who is familiar enough with the material to not just be making a "I've never heard of this" assessment, yet is detached enough to make an honest judgement. In lieu of someone like that who can make an authoritate assessment, it's better than simply saying "I've never heard of it before". *shrug* --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 20:03, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable. There are at least two problems with google hits: link exchange and the presence of unrelated topic. In this case, a search for " cdghost -site:diaryland.com" (pages mentioning cdghost but not on the site diaryland.com) gives <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=cdghost+-site%3Adiaryland.com&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=cdghost+-site%3Adiaryland.com&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">700 hits</a>, but most seem to be related to <i>Net CD Ghost V5.0 - Multimedia network virtual CD cabinet</i>. A search for "link:cdghost.diaryland.com" (links to the site) gives <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=link%3Acdghost.diaryland.com&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=link%3Acdghost.diaryland.com&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">1 hit</a>.

<li>Actually, the best way is to not count hits at all, but instead to <i>read what the Google Web search turns up</i>, and look to see whether anyone else, apart from its own author, has written about this journal. Multiple published works about the subject from sources that are independent of the subject itself are a clear indicator of notability, as they demonstrate that <i>other people have found the subject notable enough that they have gone to the effort of writing and publishing stuff of their own about it</i>. No experts and their opinions are required for this method. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:58, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Uncle G is correct - in part. He is correct in saying that other people having written about the journal is more relevant than the number hits. However, if there are basically no links to the journal site (besides those from the same site), it is probably safe to assume that the journal is not notable (not vice versa; I think this is his point). I assume that Uncle G is only proposing "this method" for articles on web sites/blogs/journals and similar things. If he is proposing to use it in general, I strongly disagree with him: there are some notable topics that are not covered well on the Internet (I remember a past AfD about a town in India with a population of over 100.000 and with a little web coverage). I am saying this because the original question was about using Google in general, not in particular for this kind of articles.

<li><b>Speedy delete</b>, CSD-A1 popped in mind when reading the article.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>MOOT</b>. The previous article, a one-liner that failed to even explain where the school is, was a clear-cut CSD A1 candidate, and I'm sorry I didn't speedy it when I first saw it. That non-stub has been replaced with a redirect to an actual stub, mooting the grand majority of the delete arguments, so I am closing this particular discussion as resolved, as neither the title nor the contents of that less-than-a-stub now exist anywhere on Wikipedia save buried in page history somewhere.</p>
<p>That said, this is not intended to be an endorsement of the stub at <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin%27s_Performing_Arts_School_d165.html" title="Colin's Performing Arts School">Colin's Performing Arts School</a>, as that stub did not exist during the bulk of this discussion. If someone wishes to list that stub on AFD (Eris help them), this is not a relevant precedent to protect that stub and should not be cited as such. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 21:38, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

To the anon who created this: if you create a Wikipedia account, which is free, takes about fifteen seconds, and doesn't require disclosure of <b>any</b> personal information, you can choose any username you like. You get a personal user page, and this material would be perfectly suitable for it. Also, user pages get indexed by Google so people searching for this would still find it, just not in the main encyclopedia. It would be nice to know if this school is spelled "Collins" with two L's or "Colins" with one L. Google shows sporadic hits on both.

<li><b>Keep</b> It exists, doesn't it? Furthermore, the nominator (and many of the deletionist vandals wishing to delete) fundamentally misunderstand the purpose of deletion. Deletion is not a judgment on the content of the article; if there are problems with the content then the article should be revised, not deleted. Deletion policy even says as much, although the deletionist vandals conveniently ignore that part of their holy book. Deletion is a judgment on the worthiness of the topic of the article itself for inclusion--and anything that exists is worthy for inclusion. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 14:36, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delay</b> please. Can I ask this AFD not be closed until at least five days after DBsmith found the web site. I think there was good basis of deletion early on, but now I think there probably is a basis for keeping it; yet I haven't had time to know that for sure (I only noticed the fix just now). Rather than just vote "keep" I'ld rather we just pause and review what's now known (as I haven't had time evaluate what info I've read, its verifiability, and its signficance). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 20:52, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, I would say it probably falls under Articles 7 (An article about a real person that does not assert that person's importance or significance), but I wasn't thinking about that when I left the comment. I was probably more just being snarky, but as per <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> below, it seems logical that there ought to be a criteria for stuff of this nature.

(By the way, I didn't manage to actually <i>see</i> any of the images, because the derned image server is so flippin' <b>slow</b> these days... yet another reason against turning the site into an image gallery) <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 16:51, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I assume you have read my proposal at <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_79ff.html#Proposal_to_modify_WP:NOT_an_image_gallery" title="Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not#Proposal to modify WP:NOT an image gallery</a>. If so, please comment there as to why you oppose the proposed change. BTW, in my opinion, the current slowness of the image servers is an argument for allowing image galleries. Since one must see many examples of an art movement in order to understand it, if image galleries are not allowed, then the images would need to be included in the main article, making that article slow to load. However, one would not know from a link wether or not an article is image intensive. (To demonstrate this point, which of these articles includes a large gallery: <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codex_Aureus_of_Lorsch_261e.html" title="Codex Aureus of Lorsch">Codex Aureus of Lorsch</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codex_Aureus_of_St._Emmeram_d015.html" title="Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram">Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram</a>?) However when you click on an article with the word "Gallery" in the title, you know what you are getting into. <a href="../../../d/s/m/User%7EDsmdgold_7663.html" title="User:Dsmdgold">Dsmdgold</a> 18:19, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's an interesting point, AMIB; I remember you've raised it before. I suppose I see those reasons as additional benefits to keeping a redirect that is clearly meritorious; but I do not think we should keep even poor redirects essentially only because there was once a page there.

<li>It also reduces "deletion shock" for newbies, when their work is deleted with no clear sign of what happened to it, and also preserves the history in the off chance we want to transwiki or merge it later. (Yeah, I know about undeletion, but anyone can look at the history of a redirect.) Redirects pose vanishingly little database impact and take up so little disk space as to be a rounding error. There are lots of good reasons to use redirects any time there's a reasonable redirect target. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 14:05, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is completely unethical and shameless self promotion and spamming of Wikipedia on behalf of a useless, amateurish, and nondistinctive site called Ipselon that has just recently been launched.

<li><b>Delete or not Delete and make changes</b>* I'm Antonio Cantallops the person that wrote the wikipedia article about Ipselon, first of all I feel much but I confused the username with nickname when I registered myself in wikipedia I'm sorry my poor english and also i like to say you i'm sorry if you think i'm spammer but i'm not spammer, i hate spammers.</li>
</ul>
<p>I write you here my job and you judge me: when i was 14 years old my birthday present was my first computer "Spectrum Sinclair 32k", I am a self-taught person and now i have 30 years old. I like to much the computers and i like to much internet.</p>
<p>I had a idea to create a metasearch engine without publicity inside the results and include results of my own engine (a version based on nutch) and last 2 years i designed and created ipselon, a very hard job and many hours of job.</p>
<p>I do not have million dollars as other company's that have personal for create the enterprise, nobody has helped me to create ipselon only my parents and my wife. I have made meta-search engine with my own design and logo and i'm running 4 servers with my search engine version based on nutch that crawl internet web (the first version was an average year ago Ipselonbot 0.17 and now i'm running my version 0.53). Ipselon results are the combination of meta-search (Only this engines: Google, Yahoo, Msn and Teoma/Ask) + search engine based on Nutch. Ipselon Ranking results are combination of: Google results position, Yahoo results position, Msn results position, Teoma/Ask results position and my search engine version (based on Nutch)ranking position results.</p>
<p>When i wrote about ipselon in wikipedia I was not thinking to promote ipselon, i just was think to write a objective information about my company ipselon similar to other internet company's as clusty or dogpile.</p>
<p>I tried to wrote a similar article as clusty in wikipedia (internet open enciclopedia) with information about ipselon not for my own publicity. I haven't publicity at any place because i can't pay it and i don't send millions of e-mails to the people who do not wish to receive e-mails advertising also because i hate spammers (i have 2 ipselon e-mail accounts daily full of spam), the only publicity of ipselon it was the launching of press release with prweb.com and i haven't doing any more publicity.</p>
<p>I'm sorry again for my ipselon article (my first article on Wikipedia) and my bad english. If you want delete my article i understand you, but try to understand to me and my job, personally i prefer you don't delete my article but it's it is truth that is necessary to make a few changes to ipselon article for it be more objective and without language mistakes.</p>
<p>Thanks very much for your attention, my personal e-mail is toni.cantallops@ipselon.es if you want to tell me something about it. Antonio Cantallops 22:44, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Gastrich, or one of his supporters clearly wrote the original entry... Cut down, emasculated, and with a healthy dose of scepticism added I think it's worth leaving a page here on him if only to provide a voice that counters the enormous spin-machine that he runs through his ministry... He's clearly an important figure in North American fundamentalism which sadly twists real Christian teaching and attitudes through power abuse, ignorance, manipulation and personal ambition... I'm sorry... from the tone of the original article, Gastrich is clearly no different... so if he wants a presence in wikipedia, so be it, and let the article 'testify' to that...</p>

<p>This is simply a vanity page, as far as I can see. The level of debate he has managed to stir up is actually quite limited, and his "debating" with Usenet and other users is not particularly erudite. He has been as guilty of mis-representation as some of the tele-evangelists referenced below, often quoting at length arguments made by other creationists that have been thoroughly discredited, often years ago.</p>
<p>If Mr Gastrich deserves a Wikepedia article about himself, then I am afraid that the whole resource may as well degenerate into a free-for-all of vanity articles and ego-massaging entries.</p>
<p>Please delete this article.</p>

</ul>
<p>While it is true that Jason is still at a fairly early stage in his life and career for God, he already has managed to stir up so much discussion and debate about the Christian faith in the net, running one of the most visited Christian resources, and facilitating online work for many other Christians, as well as actively debating the most zealous and high profile atheists of America in Usenet and Bulletin Board discussions, so that he has actually become very high profile among them.</p>
<p>There exists a sizeable campaign among them to shut his mouth and make him look bad, and they usually use their overwhelming number on their forums to flood out his posts with bad posts about him, which actually in my view have no serious substance other than to serve as an excuse not to listen to the Message.</p>
<p>The existence of a few regrettable frauds in the tele-evangelists have enabled people to paint even sincere people in the worst possible colours, and they have been leveraging this to the hilt in defaming Gastrich, who is innocent of the matters they alledge and insinuate against him.</p>
<p>The existence of an officially sanctioned by Jason article about him on a resource of authority like Wikipedia would be a useful way to offer a balanced view about him, and would not detract from the quality and authority of this online encyclopedia. On the contrary, it would enhance it.</p>

<li>No, Davey, there is no "so much discussion" nor "most visited site" nor "sizeable campagin" nor any such thing involved. It's a relatively minor sideshow in the online world. Nothing to get excited about. Face it, if Gastrich were of any real significance, he and his merry band of sycophants wouldn't have to try to wedge a vanity page into the Wikipedia. Fact is, this system is not meant for self-promotion. You can whine about "persecution" all you want but there exist page after page after page here explaining what the Wikipedia is for and how it works. Deliberately breaking the rules then whining "Help! Help! I'm being oppressed!" only makes you look foolish. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkkbilbo_8d0f.html" title="User:Markkbilbo">Mark K.

<li><b>Delete</b> Though at an early stage in his "career for God," the only reason this "evangelist" has "managed to stir up so much discussion," which is mostly *not* about the Christian faith, is because of his underhanded and dishonest tactics as well as his methods of self-promotion. This "officially sanctioned" article does nothing more than repeat a number of his own self-aggrandizing claims. Like most such articles, it leaves more questions unanswered than answered.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>This Entry Should Stay</b>. Duncharris is biased and has been against Gastrich for some time. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Skeptic%27s_Annotated_Bible&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Skeptic%27s_Annotated_Bible&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Skeptic%27s_Annotated_Bible&amp;action=history</a> where he edited the entry so that someone wouldn't create a page for Gastrich (and he also made a negative comment about Gastrich in the attributions, indicating a personal bias against him).
<p>The Jason Gastrich entry is informative and he is notable as an author of several books, former gubernatorial candidate, college professor, etc. He is also mentioned and linked on several other Wikipedia pages. See:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gastrich complains about bias in others, but would pretend that he has no bias. People are biased against him because of his actions and tactics, and the issues about an encyclopedia entry are just more examples of Gastrich's arrogance. Gastrich is not notable and did not author "several" books. There are two of record, one of them in three editions. Of those, both are amateurish, self-published, and self-promoted (just as all of this is about selling those books). He is not a "college professor." Having taught at a tech/trade college in undergraduate courses, assuming that's even true, does not make one a "college professor." His run for Governor of California was a joke. He got 11 votes, despite a fairly vigorous campaign. He couldn't even get the support of his local churches and fellow Christians, and that was so infuriating to him that he issued a press release, whining about it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the Internet Infidels Discussion Board, Gastrich has had several debates. IIDB's top <a href="http://www.iidb.org/vbb/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;f=17&amp;page=1&amp;pp=25&amp;sort=views&amp;order=desc&amp;daysprune=-1" class="external text" title="http://www.iidb.org/vbb/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;f=17&amp;page=1&amp;pp=25&amp;sort=views&amp;order=desc&amp;daysprune=-1" rel="nofollow">two most popular debates</a> of all time belong to Gastrich. They've been read tens of thousands of times and so has the <a href="http://www.iidb.org/vbb/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;f=59&amp;page=1&amp;pp=25&amp;sort=views&amp;order=desc&amp;daysprune=-1" class="external text" title="http://www.iidb.org/vbb/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;f=59&amp;page=1&amp;pp=25&amp;sort=views&amp;order=desc&amp;daysprune=-1" rel="nofollow">commentary thread</a>(also most popular of all time). Among the commentary threads and debate threads, there are well over 60,000 reads; more than any other member or debater or thread.
<ul>
<li>It should be kept in mind that part of the reason for this is Gastrich arrogance, and the general desire among the readers to see Gastrich properly roasted in these debates, which is, of course, exactly what happened.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the Infidel Guy forum, <a href="http://www.infidelguy.com/forum-31.html" class="external text" title="http://www.infidelguy.com/forum-31.html" rel="nofollow">Gastrich's debate</a> is also the most popular of all time. And so is its <a href="http://www.infidelguy.com/forum-37.html" class="external text" title="http://www.infidelguy.com/forum-37.html" rel="nofollow">commentary thread</a> with tens of thousands of reads.
<ul>
<li>I don't know how the "debate" was determined to "the most popular of all time." It was fairly universally panned, with neither participant gaining much in the way of praise, and it's said that Gastrich charged (and, amazingly, was paid) $1,000 for his "performance." Gastrich's arguments, as usual, were eviscerated in the "Peanut Gallery" and Gastrich, himself, was unable to answer many pertinent questions about his position and about things related to him. If this was a "popular" debate, it was because there is some satisfaction in seeing one such as Gastrich humbled.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This certainly isn't a vanity page and even if Gastrich is a nutjob, that isn't reason to remove this entry. I'm not an admin, but I vote to keep it. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Daddy_576d.html" title="User:Big Daddy">Big Daddy</a> 11:20, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Big Daddy is Jason Gastrich, so it's disingenuous, but common, for Gastrich to refer to himself as we see above, just as it's quite normal for Gastrich to take on a name like "Big Daddy" and refer to himself in the third person.

<li>Coleman College is a small trade/tech college near San Diego, and teaching classes there does not make one a "professor." Usually the granting of the title, "Professor," has a specific criteria and meaning. Gastrich has always been impressed with the use of titles--"Doctor," "Professor," "counselor," and so on, even when he hasn't really earned the right to use those titles.</li>

<li>Yes, there are more positive reviews, many clearly written by Gastrich. However, anyone who bothers to give the issue any thought can see that the negative reviews are clearly the more objective and substantial, and so have the most value. Even many Christians have steered clear of Gastrich and his controversies, and of those who comment, most find is methods offensive.</li>

<li>I don't think we will have any trouble turning the article into something more objective and honest, should it be retained. There's a lot of information on the web and in Usenet about Jason Gastrich and even from stuff written BY him. We can draw on that. Encyclopedia articles are not about promotion, and if they are written about personalities, they include the warts and controversies that Gastrich clearly wants to avoid. If the article is kept, it should include those. Otherwise, it is just a vanity piece.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. While he might possibly be infamous, the sockpuppets have muddied the waters so much it's difficult to tell, and clearly it's going to be difficult sustaining an objective article when the only Wikipedia editor interested in the man is himself. Naturally AfD is not cleanup, but I don't think Wikipedia is really going to miss this article, so I err on the side of deletion. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 09:30, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>These certainly don't look like sockpuppets. Anyhow, there are two points to consider. First, the ruling admins will be able to see everyone's IP address and he or she will know whether or not these are sockpuppets or people from all over the country and the world who are weighing in on this issue. Next, voting to delete simply on the assumption that these are sockpuppets is absolutely absurd. Votes such as these should be significantly devalued.--<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Daddy_576d.html" title="User:Big Daddy">Big Daddy</a> 18:24, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, "all over the country and the world" as in "open proxies." 213.42.0.0/16 contains a number of open proxies and at least one unsigned comment in support of this page has come through 213.42.2.22 which is very interesting don't you think? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkkbilbo_8d0f.html" title="User:Markkbilbo">Mark K.

<li>Hi! Thank You so much for letting us be apart of the in-put! Jason as usual has gone to great lengths to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ! Yes you will have opposition. What would faith be without it in our world?. But at the same time Our great Nation depends on differences of opinion and allows each party to talk,show,discuss, But NEVER DELETES or ILLIMINATES the other opinion!Its what makes our country so great! If you know anything about any of his sites -You know the time effort and personal touch that goes into his information and discussions and sharing of Faith! Jason's site should be allowed to stay and let more people see for themselves.

<p><b>Delete</b> Very self serving and I find the fasting claim both erroneous and mildly offensive. Erroneous because the first time he only fasted for 36 days according to the text, not 40, further, how on earth does anyone know that only a <b>few</b> have doen this. Offensve because there are people starving to death every day who undoubtedly beat his 40 day record hands down.</p>

<li>Well, we agree on at least one thing, Squibix. With the addition of Dave Horn's (138.162.140.45) soap opera/editorial/opinions/conjecture, the article isn't very encyclopedic. However, before he tampered with it, it did resemble other Wiki entries on authors, evangelists, professors, etc.--<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Daddy_576d.html" title="User:Big Daddy">Big Daddy</a> 22:45, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Actually, Jason, what it looked like was an advertising and promotion piece for your ministry and yourself. Can you imagine an article about Peter Popoff that didn't include his exposure as a fraud, or one about Jimmy Swaggart that did not include his famous "I have sinned" speech after being caught with prostitutes? An encyclopedia entry is not one that must needs be limited to whatever the subject wants others to see. Sometimes, it has to include things that the subject may wish to have hidden.</li>
<li>Jason, I notice you want us to believe that you have a degree in psychology, but <a href="http://www.jasongastrich.com/personal.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.jasongastrich.com/personal.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>, on your campaign site, you tell us that your degree is in "Liberal Arts and Sciences (Psychology)," which tells me that the degree is not in psych, but in a more general area, and you probably took quite a few courses in psych, just not enough to get a degree in it. You do understand the difference, don't you?</li>

<li>Delete: For a <i>biography</i> article, the subject needs to meet WP:BIO, in my opinion, which is why band articles should not link all member names <i>unless</i> the member is known for something outside of the band or is famous outside of the band.

<p>This list would simply be absurd. You would be talking about tons and tons of albums. Live versions of songs, except in certain cases, are not extraordinary. It is rather the norm to have a song be released live. The scope of this list would just be so immense that it would simply be useless. THollan 16:12, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Due to the amount of literature created it isn't very logical to make a list of villains with no restrictions. Maybe a list of evil mythologycal cratures, a list of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disney.html" title="Disney">Disney</a>, <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Comics_9a75.html" title="DC Comics">DC Comics</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartoon_Network_8384.html" title="Cartoon Network">Cartoon Network</a> or whatever company villains, a list Famous Villains of Classic European Literature or even a list of historical characters considered as villains by most people; would be logic, but mixing all of them in one same list is not very smart.

<li>This is inelegant and has no hope of becoming elegant. This is incomplete and has no hope of being complete. This list has far too broad a scope to ever have a significant amount of commentary. It is a failed navigational tool. I respect that you disagree, but I don't see how it's inappropriate to "force" editors to not work on navigation tools I don't feel help Wikipedia as a project, and I don't think any list so hopelessly broad to encompass both Pontius Pilate and Scarface from All Dogs Go To Heaven is useful to Wikipedia as a project. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Black</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 06:02, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm deleting this now. There's an overwhelming consensus for deletion, and I don't think a single legit keep vote was cast. With all the socks and vandalism, there's no point in continuing. Several legit delete votes were removed (as if there weren't enough anyway), and rather than try to go back and cut and paste them back in, I'm going to close this to save everyone grief before the process becomes any more tainted. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 14:40, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I did the speedy. The grounds were that there were no claims of notability. The article said that "a Pomparius" is the most wonderful person in the world, and everyone admires him, with then a "see also" to "Nicholas Ortiz" (which seems like it needs to be here, too).

<li><b>Delete</b> If this page stays, we might as well have a page for every website on the internet filled with private in-jokes, insults directed at others and pretentious 'hilarious' fake webpages.

<li><b>Delete</b> Aside from the way the entry is advertising the site, the write-up itself stinks. It pretty much outlines the pointlessness of the submission with its total lack of content. Unlike the X-E/Seanbaby entries, it just SOUNDS like someone blowing their own horn.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. PB gets over 16k google hits for "progressive boink," has recievied tens of thousands of page hits for many of their articles (like the "rating the lesbians" series), and features like The Dugout have recieved a decent cult following. Plus, it's a spinoff/replacement for Whatever-dude.com, an <a href="../../../x/-/e/X-Entertainment_e3af.html" title="X-Entertainment">X-Entertainment</a>-style e/n site that I believe was fairly popular back in the day. Article still needs significant cleanup ('ve already tried to do a little, but I've been away for a few days and will continue), and I'm fairly certain that authors of the website created this article, but it is a notable website that should be kept. Also, original nominee, on article's talk page, nominated for the following: "I am recommending this for deletion, it's a pretty sad excuse for an article." Worth noting. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> 17:23, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Interesting, I suppose. I admit to being possibly the worst googler in existence, I've never heard of that. For the sake of discussion, "link:x-entertainment.com" gets 275, dropping to a whopping 9 when "-wikipedia" is added. It's apparent I'm the vocal minority here, but I'm honestly surprised at the amount of opposition on this one. Perhaps I just know a lot of people who read it, or simply remember it better when it was whatever-dude. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> 14:47, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I've seen worse articles and things far less notable on Wikipedia. Sure, the article may have been started by staffers of the site the article examines, but it is not as if they are vainly watching over it hawk-like in Pro-Boi propoganda manner. It is a rather popular website, notable enough for Wikipedia, and has no reason to be deleted.

<p>I checked this out and found that there are a good few hits for scienticity, but the majority of them make no mention of Donald Black, and those which do are mainly publicising him and his lectures and publications. I can't make out whether this is vanity masquerading as science, a genuine article which exaggerates the importance of one person, or genuine.

His web page at the university where he teaches does not make such claims. This article reads to me like original research, but I really can't make up my mind whether I am just being over-sceptical because of the gratingly effusive style of the various Black articles. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 12:47, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>With what is passing for personal attacks around here these days, this is a borderline personal attack. Claiming that people vote "keep" to "run with the crowd" with no evidence, impugns the integrity of individual editor in a condescending, disgusting and offensive manner which implies both that "I know better" and that "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles" would never lower themselves to such activity.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 16:12, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hm. It seems TED stands for "Türk Eğitim Derneği," which is the name of Turkish Educational Association<a href="http://f7385.tripod.com/Thesis/2_1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://f7385.tripod.com/Thesis/2_1.htm" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>, whatever that is. I don't think there's a single TED College in the same way there's a George Washington University; I think that TED colleges may be schools accredited by this program or board. For example, look at <a href="http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~tugrul/biography.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~tugrul/biography.html" rel="nofollow">this bio</a>; it refers to the person going to "TED Ankara Koleji". I think we should delete this article, since the information contained therein is misleading, and see if we can't find a Turkish speaker to help the school Wikiproject make a proper article about the Türk Eğitim Derneği. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Black</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 13:45, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is vague. The close connection between The Nate Rowlan Project and the community life of <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangel_University_c102.html" title="Evangel University">Evangel University</a> should constitute notariaty. Yes there are many small bands and groups who will never sign a major label record deal, or win an award or have an top 100 song, but this does not mean that they did not exist and that they do not hold importance to any one person and/or group of people. Furthermore it is up to us (the collective society) to establish what is History. If we do not mention it, then it dies as if it never were. Because of these reasons and because of the belief that this band in particular and the album in question had an impact on a minor community, I feel that it should be allowed to stay as a source of reference for those members of the pre-stated minor community (that being the community of Evangel University). <a href="../../../r/o/w/User%7ERowlan_b02d.html" title="User:Rowlan">Rowlan</a> 21:44, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

(No, he is not Stalin&#160;:-) <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 21:40, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> see my reasons here Talk:Vzryv, it is a term used in English literature, just not yet on google. Whether or not Stalin put special meaning in his native language to the word is meaningless, as it came over to the English in several major books on the subject as describing his form of idea about Capitalist upheaval in particular, contrasting socialist progression. It doesn't even mean "revolution" it means any change toward or away from socialism which alters a society, which is unique to the mode of great change in Capitalism, so it is not a repetition or twin concept with 'revolution.' I am not interpretating it this way, this is what the book 'Dialectical Materialism' told me, which in itself sources many English works. Google is not an end all, there is a lot of well circulated literature which has zero representation through google.<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagelfar_fb83.html" title="User:Nagelfar">Nagelfar</a> 05:53, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The best I can do it cite English works &amp; books, there is nothing online, which to me, is the most valuable use for wikipedia; adding citations of uses unfindable elsewhere on the internet, among the sources I listed in English were; "<i>K.

<li>This has nothing to do with Stalins works, it has to do with English academic use of Stalins theories putting a key Russian word therein as an English loan word.

<li>Also I agree it is of historical interest and quite educating to present a picture how Stalin's disciples tried to squeeze water from rock and show great theoretical contributions of Stalin into the communist theory.

<li>This has nothing to do with "Stalins disciples", it has to do with Anglo-western academic use, most certainly NPOV if not anti-Communist, in a great many works from the '40s &amp; '50s, based on the Russian terminology. <a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagelfar_fb83.html" title="User:Nagelfar">Nagelfar</a> 19:00, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, Nagelfar. I went and looked again at your citations, and I can't see them other than as the very common trick in writing about translated works where you use the original word parenthetically to make it clear what you're referring to. Also, it would be swell if you could <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> regarding editors' familiarity with the merits of books. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 21:39, 17 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am very familiar with this use of parenthetically quoting foreign terms, and wouldn't have added it if I had believed it to be that this was the case. Besides however that in the instances provided being unnecessary for those ends (i. e. there is no need to clarify there), it wasn't just used "parenthetically" in that work or others, in the overall contexts of the works presented they used 'vzryv' especially, as that moment of change, qualified as meaning a philosophically based social instability in capitalist systems, but not elsewhere as a social revolution. I only took the initative to add it for it seemed rather entrenched in Anglo-American works on the subject in the late 40's &amp; early 50's, but maybe not thereafter. So that was my reasoning. I suppose that would make it a half-century old <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protologism.html" title="Protologism">paleologism</a>. <a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagelfar_fb83.html" title="User:Nagelfar">Nagelfar</a> 23:28, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>In other words, a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> that did not survive. If you are so sure about this, please write an article into a reputable journal, get it <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer reviewed</a>, then come back here. At the moment we have a problem of "<a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">wikipedia:Verifiability</a>" of your theory. Especially since your article speaks about "Russian", not "English" usage of the word. As I wrote, Stalin "discovered" exactly the opposite: "non-vzryv". And I can explain you why, although this is not the place, but for the sake of archiving; may be in future I will write the article. The "non-vzryv" was invented to resolve an apparent paradox of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communism</a>. By marxist's religion of <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialectical_materialism.html" title="Dialectical materialism">dialectical materialism</a>, the driving force of progress, motion and development is internal contradictions in things. In application to society, this would mean contradiction betwen classes and contradiciton between "means of production" and "relations of production". Now, communism's greatest fit would be to eliminate both and to becume an ultimate, ideal form of society. But this would leave communism without drive to progress (and you know, Marx turned out to be right after all!:-). For this reason it was necessary to invent another, <b>non-catastrophic</b> philosophical driving force of change. That's what Stalin's invention was about. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 00:11, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There's some possibility that this is actually a legitimate conventional radio station — at the very least, there's an FM frequency noted in the logo on its webpage. Wikipedia policy <i>does</i> permit articles on real AM or FM stations, but unfortunately I personally understand maybe fifteen words on the entire page: four of them are names of streaming audio software, and the other 11 are stray bits of English. If somebody who reads Dutch can confirm that this is a real FM radio station, and can clean the article up, I'll vote to <b>move to Zap! FM and keep</b> — but if that doesn't happen, then I vote to <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 07:07, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, article is about Formatted and non-formatted radio, there's nothing to move to a page on Zap! FM.
