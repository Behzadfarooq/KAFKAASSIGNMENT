<dd>I got a post on my talk page drawing my attention to this debate. I only did one cleanup edit on the article, and had never heard of the tuba before that. Having snooped around the net, I can't find any non-wikipedia-dependent citations for the tuba. The three named cryptozoologists (Coleman, Beckjord, and Zhamtsarano) appear to be legit, but I'm not sure about Chalmers. His article and other mentions of him appear to be by <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawkerTyphoon_6353.html" title="User:HawkerTyphoon">User:HawkerTyphoon</a>, a major contributor to the tuba article. None of this is strictly evidence of a hoax. More suggestive evidence, however, is the fact that the "16th century painting" of a tuba with rider, displayed prominently on the tuba article, is also found <a href="http://www.buryatmongol.com/mythology.html" class="external text" title="http://www.buryatmongol.com/mythology.html" rel="nofollow">on this page</a>, only there the mount has <b>feet</b>.

The cited work "Chalmers, R: <i>Dyddiadur / Journals 1805 - 1810</i>" does not appear in the holdings of any of the World Cat libraries, which libraries include all of the major research libraries in anthropology in the US and UK.

<li>Hulk was included in my paper because I considered him a powerful influence among children, and most children admired him for his shorts that had the ability to stay on him no matter how big he got.

<p>Inherently POV listcruft. The inclusion criteria for this article are vague, and include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"an agreement between two or more natural persons to break the law (or have the law unconstitutionally changed) at some time in the future (civil conspiracy and criminal conspiracy); conspiracy in the sense of conspiracy theory; or actions undertaken in secret (and outside public legislative processes) to obtain some goal, usually understood with negative connotations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any list aiming to include any instance where two individuals conspire to break the law is going to be enormous and unmaintainable. It is hard to imagine such a list having any kind of encyclopedic value. Also, I feel that the list was created to provide some support for conspiracy theorists. Finally, the examples given in the list are very POV as an aggregate, because they come almost entirely from the US and reflect very badly on that country. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 02:20, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> for several reasons: (1) Inherently POV. The first sentence: "This is a list OR INDEX of conspiracies considered proven to have existed or officially covered-up (and or later discovered) with or without newer evidence." Considered? By whom? The editors? Uncited sources? Putting an article on this list inherently pushes a POV on a question which is contested in virtually every imaginable example. (2) A conspiracy cannot be proven. That verb does not go with that noun. One can prove specific conspiracy theories, or specific allegations of conspiracy, or that a certain group conspired to do something. A "conspiracy" cannot be proven, however. Perhaps "List of Events Related to Proven Allegations of Conspiracy" would be correctly framed, but that title makes clear exactly how much value a list of this sort has. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColindownes_6ecd.html" title="User:Colindownes">Colindownes</a> 00:50, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> I believe that the list has been poorly maintained. I had to go into and make links to the articles, or sections of articles, that the elements in the list referred to. I believe that the argument "...include any instance..." fails as only <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">notable</a> instances would be included. As it stands now, there are approximately 46 entries on the list. I don't believe that this is a large or unmaintainable number. I have personally edited and looked at ~30% of the entries, and had to link most of those to their respective articles. Generally, within the parent articles, the event on the list is undisputed (a.k.a. proven or generally accepted). There are a few exceptions. The Lincoln Assassination is currently unsourced. The <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Reserve_Act_a851.html" title="Federal Reserve Act">Federal Reserve Act</a> is highly disputed in its article (see also <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Reserve_System_b397.html" title="Federal Reserve System">Federal Reserve System</a>, esp. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve_System&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94851367" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve_System&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94851367" rel="nofollow">this diff</a> where it is clearly disputed). The Video Poker section doesn't reference an article at all, and should be excluded from the list. Actually, any element of the list that doesn't refer to an existing article should be removed.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>As to the question of "Who must consider a conspiracy proven for it to be included?", this answer is partially discussed above. If the topic is not generally disputed in the main article it refers to, that should qualify for inclusion in the list. General dispute should automatically categorize the topic back into conspiracy theory, not conspiracy (proven, accepted, or undisputed), thereby disqualifying it from inclusion to this list.</li>
<li>As to this argument here, "Besides, once a conspiracy theory is proved wouldn't it no longer be a theory?", I absolutely agree, and that is the purpose of this list. It puzzles me that such insight sits behind a vote for deletion.</li>
<li>Another argument in this discussion is, "A conspiracy cannot be proven. That verb does not go with that noun. One can prove specific conspiracy theories, or specific allegations of conspiracy, or that a certain group conspired to do something." These sentences seem to contradict themselves. They seem to imply that one a "conspiracy theory" is proven, we "dare not call it a conspiracy". Perhaps the common vernacular sublimely precludes such grammatical correctness. Also, we need not worry whether or not a conspiracy can be proven. Doing so would technically be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.</li>
<li>The argument "Soapboxing, original research by selective synthesis" may be closer to valid. Since there is not a category setup for this, it is inherently difficult to peruse the mass of articles in wikipedia for qualifying entries to the list. I would propose that the selectiveness of the list, currently, is the result of the difficulty and time involved in scouring the whole of wikipedia to find items to include. This effort is further impeded by my above argument to the "dare not call it a conspiracy" response, that seems to remove the "conspiracy" classification from those entities, preferring to call them plots, scandals, cabals, operations, etc. We must remember that bias, and POV are not always very clear cut, and are not always to be confused with soapboxing. Indeed, a television newscast has a fundamental bias that cannot be avoided. This fundamental bias is to consider what news is newsworthy enough to be reported in the limited timespan that they have to report the news in. This natural bias can be more clearly seen on a local TV station's broadcast, rather than a 24hr cable news channel's production. I would go so far as to say that wikipedia's natural bias is a reflection of the accumulation of fundamental bias in the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">media</a>. I would like to emphasize that this is not always a conscious bias, just a product of "the way things work."</li>
<li>As to the name of the list, I personally don't prefer "proven" conspiracies. I would be more inclined to agree with either the term "undisputed", "accepted", "actual", or some reasonable combination like "generally accepted" or "actual undisputed" would be OK.</li>
<li>As for the argument that the list is based of confusing two homonyms, I would first point out that the two homonyms referred to were "legal conspiracy" and "conspiracy theory". As I have noted above, that which is theory should not be included on the list. That which is on the list and is still disputed as theory in the article that entry refers to should be removed. The homonym argument would probably hold more weight if it tried to make a distinction between general conspiracy and legal conspiracy. So, I'll take up that argument too. It should be noted that legal definitions are more watertight and restictive than the common vernacular definition. As far as I know the only definitions that are meant to be more watertight that a legal definition is a mathematical definition. I believe that the unnecessary constriction of the list to fix the more narrow definition of legal conspiracy to be inappropriate for this list, although it would be appropriate for a sublist.</li>
<li>The next argument, is one I'm slightly closer to agreeing with. And that is the argument of, vague inclusion parameters. I would like to direct your attention to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candy_bar.html" title="Candy bar">Candy bar</a>. Please note that <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reese_Peanut_Butter_Cups_901f.html" title="Reese Peanut Butter Cups">Reese Peanut Butter Cups</a> is on that list. Is it really a candy bar? For POV inclusion in a list, take a look at this list .</li>

<dd>I do think that this article could use a lot of work. There obviously a couple items that don't belong. I feel that the only things that should be on the list should be articles in wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have noticed that shortly after I made my vote above, a couple of users who voted for deletion have been doing many edits to the article. These have been generally constructive edits. Much of the removals are ones that I would've done anyway, so they have been saving me the trouble of doing so. There are only a couple (maybe three) removals that I would disagree with, but for the most part their work seems right in tune with what I think should be done. There has been a decent bit of removal of text that didn't belong in the items, but the proper parts of those items remained. I can agree completely with those particular edits. To me, this seems to suggest that there has been a place for this list on wikipedia and that the real problems with it could be fixed by editing. I would like to spend the rest of this comment proposing better guidlines for determining what should be on the list.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>An item on the list implies that there is an article about this item, or a section in an article about this item. i =&gt; (article(i) or article#section(i))</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>This requirement helps keep both notability in the list and original research off of it.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Summaries on the list should follow, as closely as possible, the summary of the corresponding article. If the element on the list refers to a section in the article, the summary of that element should be an encyclopaedic summary of that section, or the conspiracy part of that section.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>This guidline will help keep soapboxing and original research out of the summaries in the list.</li>
<li>It is obvious that this will be a bigger problem for the elements of the list that refer to a section of an article. In this case, it may be a good idea if the primary editors of the article in question approve or actually create those particular summaries.</li>
<li>I think that many of the summaries could follow this pattern:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>main article: <b>bold title</b> ... rest of summary</li>
<li>list item: [[link to article|bold title]] ... rest of summary</li>
<li>It would be nice if a template could be made to help automate this.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Having such a template would be an very valuable tool that could be used to protect from soapboxing or original research attacks.</li>

Even so, that argument should not be sufficient for the deletion of this list. I do think that the page should be renamed, as proven is a pretty strong term.

<dl>
<dd>I appreciate the effort you're putting into this Umeboshi, but I really think its a lost cause. Take for example, your qualification regarding military operations, this would include every military campaign conducted by two or more allies in the history of the world. (Or any campaign conducted on the soil of a consenting third country, or any peacetime war plan), etc. And how is it that you come to define a conspiracy as an act coordinated between allies? Wouldn't it be equally "conspiratorial" for a team of individuals to plan an invasion? Does it really make sense to call the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Peninsular_Campaign_7cb9.html" title="Peninsular Campaign">Peninsular Campaign</a> a conspiracy? The only way I can see to salvage this list is to do something like List of major conspiracy cases and only include cases where people were accused of conspiracy in court, but even then the list is enormous and completely unfocused as you are combining say, Enron, with a case where a guy shoots someone and then another guy helps him cover it up (conspiracy after the fact). I would accept something like List of convictions under the RICO act, but clearly <i>legal</i> convictions are not the point of this list. Clearly, this list is about showing that historically, massive governmental or corporate conspiracies have happened in order to lend weight to the nutty conspiracy theories that Striver loves for one reason or another. That's POV pushing and its unacceptable. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 17:22, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My purpose in advocating the inclusion of military campaigns was specifically to keep away from pushing POV. I will agree that it would make the list cumbersome. Personally, I would prefer to keep most them out of the list, but I would not want to be accused of pushing POV. It may be a better idea to resurrect the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy.html" title="Conspiracy">Conspiracy</a> article and make it a real article that explains how military campaigns, plans and operations could be considered conspiracy and preclude their mention from the list. The article could then direct the reader to the appropriate categories and lists. One can hardly doubt that the <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor_c6a2.html" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">Attack on Pearl Harbor</a> or <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Overlord_76ce.html" title="Operation Overlord">Operation Overlord</a> were conspiracies, at minimum from the viewpoint of people who plan the suprise attack. The conspiracy article at the moment is nothing more than a disambiguation page. It used to a little better, it wasn't great but it was a decent stub. It seems what happened is that early on, it detailed criminal conspiracy, got a legal template, then split from the main article. I'm not disagreeing with the split, but after that it went downhill to nothing more than a definition and some links to other articles. When you take a look at the other articles like <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_%28crime%29.html" title="Conspiracy (crime)">Conspiracy (crime)</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_%28civil%29.html" title="Conspiracy (civil)">Conspiracy (civil)</a> there are only a couple of examples of specific cases mentioned in each article, and there is no direction to a list of events which would fall into those categories. The Conspiracy (political) article is even more pathetic, and could probably be merged into a good <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy.html" title="Conspiracy">Conspiracy</a> article. I do understand that the concept of conspiracy is a vague concept covering a lot of territory. I also understand that it is a human construct. I invite you to take a look at other vague, but simple, concepts that cover a lot of territory and have better articles:

</dd>
<dd>These are all vague (to various degrees) human constructs that seem to require a larger explanation than just a quick definition and pointers to disambiguation links. Rather they try to discuss the topic with a small amount of detail without delving into a whole systematic exposition. While I agree that the conspiracy list seems to focus on massive government and coporate conspiracies, I don't believe that deleting the list is the appropriate answer to that focus. I have tried to create some guidlines to remove that particular focus and stay true to the general meaning of conspiracy. While the list might give a slight amount of weight some of the conspiracy theories out there, I would like to point out that deletion of the list might actually give more weight to them. This might seem counter-intuitive at first. If it can be shown that there is a history of shoving actual conspiracy in the corner, or displaying its vigorous dismissal, and if it can be shown that conspiracy theory is actively advanced in means and methods that help ridicule it, then it becomes much easier to add weight to the conspiracist view of events. A good list may help support the idea that conspiracy, while pervasive in the course of history, is full of mundane unconnected events, rather than a "topdown plan guided by the elite for generations to enslave humanity." The deletion of the list could be seen in the eyes of the conspiracy theorists as evidence that there are those that are too fearful of the list because it would clearly reveal such a plan. Personally, I doubt that any list of events in the wikipedia, conspiracy or otherwise, would ever reveal such a "master plan", as there is too much disconnect between notable events. It's part of the reason I use other methods in my own personal research on the topic. Now as far as being a lost cause, I would like to direct you to look at Tom Harrison's remarks on last years <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_proven_conspiracies_e53c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of proven conspiracies">afd</a>. He discusses the motivation that inspired it in the first place and warns that removing it would just have the effect of it popping up again in another form. I'll try to draw an analogy for you. Close by, in a small town, young teenagers used to meet up on Friday and Saturday nights in a parking lot on the edge of town. This had been the tradition for many years. One day, the chief of police got the "bright idea" to stop this, possibly because it made the town look bad or something. The result of this is that the teens just found other places to meet up, some of them outside the city limits. This made it more difficult for the police to keep their eye on the kids and keep them out of trouble. I think that policy has since changed and the old tradition is in full swing again, but I haven't been back to verify that in a while. Please don't take this as some sort of vague threat from me to force the list to pop up again if it's deleted. I'm not interested in causing trouble or disrupting the process of making a better encyclopedia. I'm just trying to impart some words of wisdom, "build a field and set the boundaries" and things will be easier to maintain in the long run. I am, however, interested in building a better <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy.html" title="Conspiracy">Conspiracy</a> article, as I described above. I may seek to do that later once I come up with a good plan to make it viable. <a href="../../../u/m/e/User%7EUmeboshi_5534.html" title="User:Umeboshi">Umeboshi</a> 08:16, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Comment</i> Perhaps it would be best to limit the list to conspiracies to overthrow states. (Directly overthrow, anyway, so we don't have people arguing, e.g., that there was a conspiracy by FDR to let the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor, go to war with Japan, and thus overthrow the Japanese state.) Focusing on that category strikes me as reasonably encyclopedic; but I don't think there's sufficient commonality between the Catilinian conspiracy, the Black Sox scandal, the Gulf of Tonkin incident (how is this a "conspiracy", BTW?) and DRAM price fixing to create any sort of meaningful article or list, per GabrielF's original remarks. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoess_95be.html" title="User:Choess">Choess</a> 21:13, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> The only way this article could be made useful and interesting is if WP:NPOV and WP:V were both rescinded. There are two real questions here. The first is "conspiracies." We are fooling ourselves if we defend this article under the pretense that "conspiracy," as used here, can be defined neutrally. If a conspiracy, for the purpose of this article, was defined neutrally, it could theoretically contain all coordinated human activity in all of history, with the only criteria for entry being the old saws "notability" and "significance." Meanwhile, the convenience of the list format is that it allows for an absolute definition of an event in precisely the same way an article's title does: the article title "Boston Massacre" states, conclusively, that the event in question was a massacre, no matter how much of the article itself is devoted to criticism of this view or if the article's description itself is more nuanced. The reality is that the structual flaw (intentional or not) of this list is that it inevitably uses the common understanding of conspiracy as a nefarious plot to do harm or evil to undermine WP:NPOV by allowing an editor to state CONCLUSIVELY and without in-article criticism that an act or event is an act of violence or other deliberate harm. The second question is over the issue of 'proof.' The same analysis applies: the list enables an editor to make a conclusive claim as to whether or not an act was undertaken by a conspiracy or that a group was conspiratorial. By the nature of the list, debate over the substance of this claim must be made on the talk page of the list rather than on the article page, where the complexity of opinions on the question would be made apperant to the end-user. The assumption that the end-user will appreciate the complexity of the issue upon viewing the main article on the subject is inappropriate. In summary, there is no reason why we should create more circumstances where WP:NPOV must be bent for the sake of brevity or convenience. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexeiSeptimus_d337.html" title="User:AlexeiSeptimus">AlexeiSeptimus</a> 03:01, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree with very much of what you say. I have put a great deal of thought into this, and tried to find a way to keep POV out of the list. This is problematic due, like you say, to the nature of being able to define conspiracy neutrally. My solution was to keep the list from being able to make that definition in the first place, primarily by only allowing all entries to be articles. For the other issue you raise of proof, I tried to make a way to determine this, not proof but lack of dispute, by forcing compliance that it not be disputed in the main article. This helps keep the editors of the list from determining "proof". The more I keep thinking about this, the more ready I am to get rid of the list. This does not mean I'm ready to dispose of the issue that I feel is important, which is basically categorical navigation. The problem is that there is currently no way to navigate through the many commonly accepted conspiracies that have taken place in history. I would agree that including military campaigns, intelligence operations, assassination plots, and terrorist attacks to the list would make the list very large and unmanageable, keeping them off of the list is equivalent to pushing POV. Even selecting a smaller list of well known and generally accepted conspiracies also serves to help push POV. <a href="../../../u/m/e/User%7EUmeboshi_5534.html" title="User:Umeboshi">Umeboshi</a> 06:09, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>The more I think about it the more I feel that the list should be removed. Categories may be a better approach. The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy.html" title="Conspiracy">Conspiracy</a> article really needs to be worked on to help explain the concept in greater detail, then direct the reader to the various forms that it occurs in. I can agree that lumping anything that falls under the definition of conspiracy into a "hodgepoged" list is unwieldy. I can't agree with the idea that there is no better way to go about this, and that the problem will just go away with the deletion of the list. The activity I've witnessed in the 911 conspiracy articles seems to confirm this. There are quite a few people who have voted to keep because they felt the information had encyclopaedic value. It may not be the majority, but I don't believe that the are the "wacky fringe" types, and there should exist some solution that would help satisfy this value. Many who have voted for deletion have provided examples of known conspiracy, so there is little doubt that they exist. This means we're not talking about conspiracy theories here, yet conspiracy theories are well categorized. Why is it that conspiracies are not categorized? All it takes is not being disputed as ocurring and not being disputed as a conspiracy. This doesn't seem to be that difficult. Having them all on one list may be a mess, categorizing them by type doesn't seem all that difficult. Why are <a href="../../../c/i/a/Category%7ECIA_operations_88a6.html" title="Category:CIA operations">Category:CIA operations</a>, <a href="../../../f/b/i/Category%7EFBI_operations_f930.html" title="Category:FBI operations">Category:FBI operations</a>, and <a href="../../../n/s/a/Category%7ENSA_operations_fe86.html" title="Category:NSA operations">Category:NSA operations</a> not split between known and alleged? Does a reader have to browse through every article to determine whether they are known or whether they are alleged? A student doing a paper on a synopsis of intelligence operations would have to sift through the entire category to determine whether the op was real or not. The inertia that exists to keep vague the distinction between real and fairy-tale ultimately does a disservice to the end users of the project and help keep wikipedia from being taken seriously when people want to look stuff up along these lines. I mean it might be great for lining the presidents up by height, or listing every <a href="../../../g/u/n/Category%7EGundam_Mobile_Suits_8c88.html" title="Category:Gundam Mobile Suits">Gundam suit</a> known, but it seems to be really hurting in this area. I don't believe that this is an <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impossible_Mission_1f2f.html" title="Impossible Mission">Impossible Mission</a>, it just seems that no real effort has been put forth to make a solution for it. The ability of some to call spades, spades and ducks, ducks when they recognize a conspiracy theory seems to be inexplicably handicapped when it's time to cross the theory barrier into actuality. <a href="../../../u/m/e/User%7EUmeboshi_5534.html" title="User:Umeboshi">Umeboshi</a> 06:15, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have no strong feelings about this nom one way or the other, but it has been suggested that it is somehow unfair not to have this article up for deletion when the article List of Playboy Playmates with D-cup or larger breasts is. So, this nomination. This article has been nominated twice before, see discussions <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_big-bust_models_and_performers" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_big-bust_models_and_performers" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_big-bust_models_and_performers_2nd" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_big-bust_models_and_performers_2nd" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Previous discussions seemed to get tainted fairly quickly with accusations of bad faith and other shenanigans, so let's try to keep to a minimum here, OK? My only concern with the article is that it's performer by genre. We've had some consensus emerge recently that "model by magazine" is unacceptable (see discussion of Category: Playgirl and Category: playgirl models <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_November_5#Category:Playgirl_models" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_November_5#Category:Playgirl_models" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and the categories for Playboy models, Playboy Cyber Girls, Playboy Coeds of the Week and Playboy NSS models <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_November_14#Category:Playboy_models" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_November_14#Category:Playboy_models" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This may not be the same sort of issue but since previous discussions devolved so quickly an actual discussion of the article and the performer by genre situation is appropriate. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 02:30, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's probably easier to classify who has modeled large breasts for publication than it is to, for example, determine what city or U.S. state someone is "from" when they lived in multiple cities, yet we have still "People from" categories. Also, the reasoning here doesn't make logical sense: List of Playboy Playmates with D-cup or larger breasts is <i>more</i> specific a subject than this article, so it would be a delete consensus on this article that would imply AfD on the other article, not the other way around.

<li><b>Comment</b> This debate more than the existance of this article has proven the complete confusion over what Wikipedia actually is. This would <i>never</i> make it into an encyclopedia. It doesn't really matter if it stays or not, no one is going to be harmed by this article being here. But why bother defining Wikipedia as an encyclopedia when in reality it is just a collection of random information. Let's just give up trying to market ourselves as an encyclopedia and be honest about what this project really is... a searchable database of random information. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 12:32, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Exactly, Martin. And Wikipedia, as it is currently set up, will <i>never</i> be a rival to traditional encyclopedias on the traditional subjects-- science, mathematics, history... At best, it will be only an easy starting point for information on these subjects. Articles on these subjects by anonymous, uncredentialed editors is <i>never</i> going to rival writing by experts in their fields. It is <i>exactly</i> subjects like this, which will not be found in traditional encyclopedias, and on which is is nearly impossible to fine unbiased, non-commercial, sourced information which is Wikipedia's strongest point. Articles like this are <i>exactly</i> the kind in which Wikipedia has the advantage over traditional encyclopedias and other reference sources. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 16:49, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> That I agree with. So what I was thinking was this: rather than spend time debating if something is original research, sourced etc. why not just face the facts as you described them above? Debates like the one we are having here are surreal. We are trying to apply academic principles to determine the value of a list of big-bust models. Am I the only one to whom that sounds totally surreal? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 16:57, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, I've also noticed the surrealism that can creep up in these arguments on more than one occasion, but I suppose that's to be expected. I do agree with Wiki's original research/NPOV/sourcing rules. Just because an article is on a non-traditional subject doesn't mean it can't be well-written, sourced, etc. These are valuable policies. I do think that these rules are sometimes applied more strictly-- sometimes absurdly so-- to some subjects than others, depending on the biases of particular editors. But that's another issue. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 17:09, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree that those are important policies. They just aren't very suited for debating a list of big-bust models. And if we agree that this is the kind of articles that Wikipedia does better than anyone else then maybe we should consider the criterias we use when discussing this kind of article or at least to what degree we should apply these policies. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 17:28, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I think what we're getting at here is the difference between form and content. My understanding is that Wikipedia strives to be an encylopedia in <i>form.</i> Its goal is to produce well-written, reasonably unbiased, appropriately sourced articles on a wide variety of subjects, like a traditional encyclopedia. However, when editors seek to delete articles like this on the grounds that they are "unencyclopedic," what they mean is that they are unencyclopedic in <i>content,</i> not necessarily in form. "Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia," means Wikipedia does not seek to imitate the <i>content</i> of a traditional encyclopedia, only its <i>form.</i> So a well-written article on every pop-culture reference in one episode of <i>The Simpsons,</i> or a list of Playboy Playmates whose bra cup is D or above, as long as they are encyclopedic in <i>form,</i> are perfectly appropriate. That's my take on it anyway. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 18:45, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Thank you. Putting it that way it becomes much more clear to me what is meant by the word <i>encyclopedia</i> around here. I was getting to the point where I was getting frustrated but putting it like you just did it becomes perfectly clear to me. I hope a lot more people than me read your responses to me because it really clarifies things a lot and would make many of these AfD's a lot more to the point. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 18:58, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Not delete</b> - I'm the original submitter of the article, which describes an activity that is valuable for preservation and access of genealogical information. "Graving" is a term used by thousands of "gravers" - people who gather information from cemeteries and make it publicly available online.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - quite the opposite. We don't do original research here. Therefore, we let the authorities (dictionary editors, in this case) decide what is accepted <i>before</i> we write an article. For example, thousands of skydivers know exactly what a "whuffo" is. You'll find it on Google searches, and it even found its way into a movie (<i>Cutaway</i>), but until Websters or the OED, or some other authority decides it is part of the English language, I don't get to write an article about it. That's how it works here, and I don't mind playing by the rules. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 00:23, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Rebuttal</b>: Your comment conflicts with your other comment about the acceptability of the word "truthiness", which is in no English dictionary at this point. Other articles like "Cryptex" or "Skitching" or "River Trekking" should then be deleted by your standards, but are given a pass. The purpose of Wikipedia is to provide information about topics (including unusual hobbies, new ones of which are appearing all the time) to the general public, and this necessitates the acceptance of new terms <i>to a reasonable extent</i>. Zero-tolerance always causes more problems than it purports to solve. {Bubbha 02:40, 18 December 2006 (UTC)}</dd>

<dd><b>Reply</b> - I see no contradiction regarding expert confirmation. The word "truthiness" has been select as the 2005 word of the year by the American Dialect Society. Here at Wikipedia, the fact that other unworthy articles exist is <i>never</i> a valid reason for keeping yet one more. I would prefer to see the Cryptex article merged with the article about the book. However, I suspect the book article is overly long, and the editors chose to split sections out into separate own articles. If this is the case, then Cryptex would be worthy because it is central to the plot of a notable movie. The <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skitching.html" title="Skitching">skitching</a> article has no sources and should be either fixed or deleted for the reasons you specified. Unlike "graving", <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_trekking.html" title="River trekking">River trekking</a> isn't a word, it's a phrase, and it describes an outdoor activity that is well documented.

<dd><b>Reply</b> First, Rklawton, I do value your input and I have learned a lot. But I had always thought that the proscription on neologism was to prevent someone from, say, inventing something out of whole cloth and posting an article about it; say, inventing the practice of walking backwards naked with a Sgt. Pepper LP album cover on one's head and coining the word "Whoojness" to describe it. On the contrary, "graving" is something that thousands of people do as a hobby, and is termed such by them. I have no objections to changing the title to something acceptable. You objected to my previous suggestion to do just that by citing another proscription -- original research -- but the simple act of describing a hobby that is actually practiced by a definite community is not "original research"; it's just statement of fact. Yes, I know I don't make the rules, but I would hope that the parameters of the proscription on neologism could be adjusted to be slightly more accommodating to the sharing of useful knowledge. Again, I would be happy to see this article being retained under a more acceptable name. {Bubbha 05:44, 19 December 2006 (UTC)}</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> As a new member of the Wikipedia community who was been lurking here since the site's inception I have to confess that I'm scratching my head as to why this is such a big deal. I have noted COUNTLESS articles on obscure practices on these pages. In fact, I have had learned of the existance of several simply by reading these pages. One such practice, Geocaching, was only brought to my attention this year, but it appears to have been around for awhile and like graving thousands of people are doing it. If you hold true to what you say on your admin page of wanting to help others then I suggest that you give the author and his associates a chance to flesh out the article to meet the site's approval.<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberlucy1965_fbf6.html" title="User:Cyberlucy1965">Cyberlucy1965</a> 16:18, 18 December 2006 (UTC)cyberlucy1965

<dd><b>Reply</b> - good points. The AfD process takes 5 days. That should be plenty of time to fix up the article. But it doesn't change the fact that "graving" is a nelogism (see <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>). If there's something about this word that satisfies Wikipedia's neologism guidelines, then this is the place to discuss it. As for Geocaching, unlike "graving" (which has multiple meanings), geocaching has over 4 million Google hits. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 16:47, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Reply</b> So how many of those four million google hits are mulitiple repeats of the same article. Sorry using that doesn't hold water. It's true graving has multiple meanings but it doesn't dismiss that like geocaching that it is hobby that is practiced by thousands of people and, as Mr. Norton kindly pointed out, it is a practice that has been going on for hundreds of years. As others have pointed out here if the issue is the word being neologism then why not let the author and his associates title it something else perhaps a phrase not unlike "river trekking" which was inferred to be appropriate. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberlucy1965_fbf6.html" title="User:Cyberlucy1965">Cyberlucy1965</a> 14:51, 19 December 2006 (UTC)cyberlucy1965</dd>

<dd><b>Reply</b> - I did leave the editors welcome messages complete with "how to" links. If I thought the article might be saved, I would have tagged, prod'd, or fixed it myself. The point here is that I this article <i>can't</i> be saved. A group of internet users have created their own slang to describe their activities, and now they want an article about it. It just won't fly here. Asking new editors to fix their article "or else" and then having to delete it anyway is far more cruel. It's less misleading to simply point out the article's failing points, provide links to help its editors better understand how things work, and proceed to AfD.

<dd><b>Reply</b> - This experience has left a very bad taste in the mouths of those of us who are users of and contributors to both Find A Grave and Wikipedia. This is beginning to appear to us as the petty crusade of one person who has ALSO solicited others to support his point of view (a definition of the neologism "meat-puppetry," I believe). I recognize the signatures of everyone who has posted in support of the article, and they are all different people. No "sock-puppetry" going on -- and no "meat-puppetry" either. The original solicitation on Find A Grave was for ways to improve the article, not hammer at the Wikipedia administrators. And then to presume to register on Find A Grave for the sole purpose of instructing us poor benighted amateurs . . . well, the mind boggles. We are NOT just a small group of internet users who have created out own slang. We are people with a common interest in a common pursuit which has its roots in changing attitudes towards death and burial in the 19th-century -- most of whom were doing it long before we had any access to the internet -- who are simply describing what we do in the most simple, elegant terms possible.<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocWilson_c875.html" title="User:DocWilson">DocWilson</a> 18:39, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

No, I'm not leaving Wikipedia - I will still contribute as always. All the best to everyone here, and no hard feelings. Bubbha 07:05, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Calvery Lutheran (Willmar, MN) would be worth keeping if it was the first congregation of the Norwegian - Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church, it is certainly one of the first. I would keep this up and give someone a chance to check on that.</li>
<li>Evangelical Catholic Church is a denomination (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Lutheran_denominations_16e2.html" title="List of Lutheran denominations">List of Lutheran denominations</a>, not a local congregation, if that matters.</li>
<li>Faith! Christian appears notable as it is pastored by the national Vice-President of the Assemblies of God in Australia and is the parent organization of a college.</li>
<li>St Mary's Basilica seems notable, because of its history and current function.</li>
<li>St John's Cathedral (Edmunton) seems notable to me, because of the previous bishop, its role as a major cathedra church.</li>

<li><b>Ouch</b>, we went through this with a bunch of historic synagogues a while ago, and those weren't even this many. Mass-nominating is a really bad idea in most cases. Some of these articles aren't really worth the trouble, but the subjects may well be notable and should emphatically not be knee-jerkishly re-deleted if they are deleted now and a better version recreated later. I am inclined to keep all cathedrals and any churches with a couple of centuries of history or more, as well as anything that stands out architecturally.

<li><b>Keep all</b>. This is nothing more than a communist insurrection on Wikipedia. On his user page you can see that he is a Russian atheist.

<li><b>Keep all</b>, purely on the basis that there are <i>far far</i> too many nominated here to have an accountable AfD process - 64 articles all getting tarred in the same brush stroke is not good - about the only way that would be acceptable is if they were all from the same originating author as part of a spamming - but these are all by different authors, some cathedrals not churches, some are total junk but some are historically important buildings deserving of articles and some of them have existed for a couple of weeks but some have an article history going back a year and a half or more. We can't just scatter gun and take out 64 articles because a few are spammy. In the case of the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Shepherd_Cathedral%2C_Ayr_397b.html" title="Good Shepherd Cathedral, Ayr">article</a> that brought me here it is far more deserving to be merged into its town article than deleted.

<dd><b>Reply</b> - OK, let's see what we've learned. The first link indicates that not only has this person released only one album, but it's also the label's first release. That doesn't exactly make it a major label. The second and third articles only confirm this. The fourth link mentions a "#1" spot for one of his singles, but it isn't at all clear about what list this comes from. The fifth link is from a promotional site that lists one of his singles as #1 briefly. Face it, the kid just put out his first album on an indy label and suddenly we're supposed to believe he's a notable musician? I think our doubt is more than justified. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 23:51, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If your justification for NN is not based on the music notability guideline, then don't bother citing it as a failed test. The subject passes WP:MUSIC, despite your and others' insistence to the contrary, and is therefore notable. Granted, I'd never heard of this artist before about two days ago, but I'm not Canadian. In any case, baseless deletionism bugs the hell out of me. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<dd>I shouldn't have to read WP:MUSIC to you. #1 says <i>been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent from the musician/ensemble itself and reliable</i>. The first four links are independently written stories about the artist, in reliable sources such as the Edmonton Journal and Calgary Sun. <a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/1156759021.html?dids=1156759021:1156759021&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Nov+5%2C+2006&amp;author=Ashante+Infantry&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=C.8&amp;desc=George+takes+the+Backstreet+to+the+top" class="external text" title="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/1156759021.html?dids=1156759021:1156759021&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Nov+5%2C+2006&amp;author=Ashante+Infantry&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=C.8&amp;desc=George+takes+the+Backstreet+to+the+top" rel="nofollow">here's another one</a> from the Toronto Star. WP:MUSIC #2 says <i>Has had a charted hit on any national music chart</i>. The fifth link above shows the artist's single at #1 on the Canadian MuchMusic chart, and continued chart placements on subsequent weeks.</dd>
<dd>While I'm at it, WP:MUSIC #4 says <i>Has gone on... a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country.</i> He has already been on a cross-Canada promotional tour, and has more stops next year. Again, read the fine cites. In any case, WP:MUSIC indicates that only one of the criteria must be met to establish notability. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<dd>So you admit it was just a promo tour? By your way of looking at it, a solo act heading cross-country in a minivan to hawk his only album would qualify a musician for inclusion. That's certainly not what the policy editors had in mind. I think you might be taking too many liberties with the concept of "national concert tour". <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 19:34, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It would appear that this article is what would be considered a <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glossary.html" title="Glossary">glossary</a>, and a look through the corresponding Wikipedia category (where the article in question is listed) would turn up a lot of similar articles such as <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_terminology.html" title="Chess terminology">Chess terminology</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Final_Fantasy_VII_terms_1cf4.html" title="List of Final Fantasy VII terms">List of Final Fantasy VII terms</a>. While I encourage you to take a look at the second and see what this article should probably look like (because it's thoroughly well cited and decently pruned, and because personally I think it's a similar level of notability), with regards to glossaries and AFD there doesn't seem to be a solid consensus. Several glossaries similar to this (with varying degrees of citations) have survived AFDs (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Slang_and_offensive_terms_for_police_officers_d64e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Slang and offensive terms for police officers">slang for Police here</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Internet_slang_c89d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Internet slang">Internet slang here</a>).

<li><b>Delete</b> for basically every reason.

<li><b>Keep</b> Original research? I'm not saying every term on the page can be verified, but many can. Those that can't? Feel free to remove them. Still wouldn't be original research, as that's about advancing a cause, but whatever. However, the existence of the article itself doesn't violate any principles of Wikipedia that I know about. Magic the Gathering is a real game, it is notable, and it does have a common vernacular shared among its players. This can be verified from many magazines and articles. (Scrye for example has done it several times). How a list of words common to a subject violates Wikipedia policy, I don't know, but if it does, how about deleting <a href="../../../g/l/o/Category%7EGlossaries_5e13.html" title="Category:Glossaries">Category:Glossaries</a>?

<li><b>Keep</b>. Being OR is <b>not</b> a deletion criterion, it is at most a reason for trying to improve the article.

<li>Well, speaking for myself, I added two sources rather easily. It's about as easy for the rest of the terms that should be kept, and dump the rest. So, OR as an argument for deletion is not that applicable here. It's a clean-up issue for this article, not an inherent problem with the very concept of it. The real question is, does a list of words common to a specific subject belong on Wikipedia. And I think the plethora of glossaries indicates that there is some acceptance to their inclusion in Wikipedia. If not, then we should be discussing that, then dealing with the articles like this. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:58, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Keep it, because magicplayers will automatically fill in more details. Mtg is a game that is expanding in so many conceptual directions that no single individual or group can contain it all. I for instance can easily envision a mtg only wp. Besides, slang will be incorporated into wp no matter what is done to avoid it. Wp will be subject to I-wars (information-wars), and biased oppinions will collide while "fanatics" of certain ideologies try to textually wipe out other articles with "intolerant" contents. As a defence mechanism people will turn to slang so that articles with their oppinion are not found and "errataed" by the opposition.</p>

<li><b>Don't delete</b> - I have posted on the article discussion about the genre. More info will be added soon. If you have other sugestions i'm open to them.

<li><b>Delete</b> - There's plenty of genre mixing out there, but not all genre hybrids deserve their own genre name. The key is whether the genre is actually famous or not. Whether or not one band makes music in a way described by the genre, the genre may be totally unheard of. And that's the key. Now, if a <a href="../../../s/e/a/Wikipedia%7ESearch_engine_test_390d.html#Google_bias" title="Wikipedia:Search engine test">google test</a> returned much more than <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22deep+melodic+jazz%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22deep+melodic+jazz%22" rel="nofollow">18 hits</a>, I think you'd have more to back you up. But think of it this way: Tryad released their album Public Domain saying it was under the genre "Industrial Classic Pop"; that doesn't mean Industrial Classic Pop deserves it's own page on wikipedia, you dig? -<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonk_of_the_highest_order_d058.html" title="User:Monk of the highest order"><font color="green">Monk of the highest order</font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/o/n/User_talk%7EMonk_of_the_highest_order_6566.html" title="User talk:Monk of the highest order">(t)</a></sup> 20:30, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep for now:</b> Maybe raise another AfD later depending on how it progresses and delete it then if need be. They just got going about three weeks ago. They have 1500 articles, which is small, but not insignificant. I think Wikipedia should extend the benefit of doubt to competitors, in the spirit of fairness. Wikipedia will not suffer from a little competition, especially since they are avowedly Christian and have two flaws: one, they are biased and non-neutral point of view; two, they do not have an adequate means of filtering since they are very accepting of just about any kind of edit (may change later). It is so new that no third parties can be expected to have written about it, but they have potential. Technically it may fail on the Web criterion for the moment, but it is verified: it does exist and it is growing. The Conflict of Interest / Vanity charge is bogus, but even though I advocate keeping for now, we must still edit the article stringently, as I have been. So I say, relax the keep/delete criteria in their favor, but scrutinize a little more carefully in compensation. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 05:32, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>; the seven Google hits don't persuade me of its being "very well known" -- quite the contrary. If it becomes famous and covered in reliable third-party sources at a later date, <b>then</b> is the time to have an article on it. Only three of those Google hits are neither on Wikipedia nor Conservapedia itself. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 05:36, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Antandrus, I have a question for you. Is there a Wikipedia policy that states that <i>Google</i> is the designated gauge of how well known a site is? The site is only two or three months old... how many Google hits do you expect? Last time I checked, Conservapedia had 81 users, which is not bad on the scale of things. <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVeniVidiVici007_8a0a.html" title="User:VeniVidiVici007">VeniVidiVici007</a> 05:44, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not a "policy" -- it's basically common sense. Conservapedia is <i>not</i> well known by any measure, except maybe to you and a few home-schooled kids. Hey, I wish you well building it, but we don't exist to help you attain notability. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 05:57, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well... I say it is well known, now what? It all depends on what you consider "well-known." I suggest we go with Hu's idea and give the site more time to become "well-known." <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVeniVidiVici007_8a0a.html" title="User:VeniVidiVici007">VeniVidiVici007</a> 06:07, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"I say it is well known" is not a valid keep reason. Please read <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proof_by_assertion.html" title="Proof by assertion">proof by assertion</a>.

<li><b>Comment:</b> It is an abuse to demand "speedy delete" for political reasons. Conservapedia has obvious importance as an alternative source of information from a conservative perspective. With 1500 entries in a short period of time, conservapedia is clearly successful and growing quickly. There are many entries on Wikipedia that are less significant yet do not hear calls for speedy deletion. Let's be fair about this. Andysch 06:18, 17 December 2006 (UTC)andysch

<li>You are free to nominate any article for deletion that you feel do not meet Wikipedia criteria for retention, Andysch. You can do it carefully following the three step AfD tagging process, or you can get someone else who agrees with you to do it for you, though it is not difficult. Use it with care, but feel free to use it where you have read the relevant Wikipedia policy pages and feel that an article meets the criteria for deletion.

<li><b>Comment:</b> the demands to censor this entry illustrates how Wikipedia has changed from its original purpose. This entry is factual, useful and obviously noteworthy, as demonstrated by the many comments here. Yet some don't like this entry for political reasons, and demand it be removed. If it is removed, the only question will be this: how many other sites have similarly been removed or censored on Wikipedia for political reasons??? Alternative sites may be the only way to combat this type of censorship. Andysch 15:28, 17 December 2006 (UTC)andysch
<ul>
<li>The article, as you and your allies wrote it, was full of promotional adjectives and at least one factual error. I spent a little time editing it down to a more factual presentation. I also took time to advise you on some policy pages to read, but you have given no indication that you have digested or absorbed them, or even read them. The article is not being censored. You are new users here, and you don't understand yet as well as the other conservatives who are more experienced on Wikipedia, that Neutral Point of View is the controlling philosophy here and it works. Wikipedia policies and processes like this AfD have been hammered out over years and with thousands of discussions and participants. They are robust and effective and neutral. You need to get up to the level of understanding of the other conservatives here because your claims of censorship and political bias don't hold water. It used to be that conservatives would see a "red under every bed" (communist). Now they sometimes see a censor behind every web page. Both views are nonsensical. Wikipedia has articles on conservative sites <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Green_Footballs_498d.html" title="Little Green Footballs">Little Green Footballs</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Republic_0fa6.html" title="Free Republic">Free Republic</a>. The Conservapedia article does technically fail the notability requirements, but I have argued on your behalf that it deserves a relaxed interpretation of the rules. I suggest that you try to adopt christian humility and Wikipedia's <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Assume Good Faith policy</a> (which is christian and conservative, when you think about it, though not limited to those orientations) and have the good grace to not question people's motives here. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 16:10, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The reasons cited here for immediately deleting "conservapedia" are pretextual. Those same reasons would require deleting tens of thousands of other Wikipedia entries. But those demanding deletion of this entry do not complain in the same way about the other entries. Instead, they demand that this particular entry be deleted. Simply put, nothing except political bias justifies defacing this entry with the "speedy delete" notice. This entry is not defamatory or offensive and it is obviously noteworthy and useful to many people. The lengthy debate here is strong evidence that the entry should remain. It will receive far more visits than tens of thousands of other entries that remain. Andysch 18:41, 17 December 2006 (UTC)andysch

<li><b>Reply</b> to Andysch: Possibly you should read through that article I linked right before your comment, Andysch. 1) re: "Those same reasons would require deleting tens of thousands of other Wikipedia entries" is only an argument that there are many other Wikipedia entries that may need to be deleted, not an argument to keep this one if it fails to meet wikipedia's criteria. 2) The reason this "particular entry" is being debated is because someone looked at it, believed it was inappropriate, and brought it here. Dozens of other articles every day have this happen to them, and those do not involve politics so there is no need to do anything but assume good faith. 3) "it is obviously noteworthy": if it were obvious, there would be no debate. Don't assert it, prove it. The comments of a small handful of individuals does not make a website notable. Verifiable proof, in the form of reliable secondary sources, is what makes it notable. It is NOT obvious as the article currently exists. If you wish it to be obvious to those of us voting for deletion, find the evidence to support that, don't state it as rhetorical argument. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 20:41, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I did not post the original entry "Conservapedia" here. But the defect to the citations above to numerous policies (like many regulations) is that enforcement becomes selective and biased. I've helped many criminal defendants against arbitrary enforcement of laws and know well the potential for abuse. Regardless, the above comments indicate that Wikipedia has become a tool for bullying, which is the opposite of its original purpose. I contributed to Wikipedia entries years ago when it was a voice for those outside of the mainstream. Sadly, Wikipedia has been taken over by bullies. Andysch 17:18, 18 December 2006 (UTC)andysch
<ul>
<li>Fact is, Wikipedia has a deliberative process that is <b>not</b> bullying. By contrast, if someone edits the Conservapedia Evolution page to indicate that the "theory" is well-established science, just like gravity, though well-established, is a "theory", the bullies at Conservapedia will delete it post-haste, without discussion or justification, because not only does it not fit their faith-based agenda, but there is no place on that site for anything else. By contrast, Wikipedia has an extensive series on so-called Intelligent Design, even though it is way outside of science and the mainstream. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 17:50, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> just as a reply to the hipocracy (sic) argument: I believe this point has been made a few times in this discussion, which confuses me. Hundreds of articles are nominated for deletion every week, and a large percentage of them are deleted upon discussion. Quite often the reasons for deletion are the same ones being argued here, which means there is no hypocrisy, only an ongoing consistent policy which is currently being applied to this article. The only other point you seem to be making is "the article is more worthwhile than..." which is, by definition, a subjective view completely at odds with wikipedia's policies on maintaining a neutral point of view.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>::: OK, here's the thing. You say that Wikipedia is unbiased because it contains material that would satisfy a "faith-based" person. But having the article doesn't invalidate a biased report. The content may be very biased. And, Conservapedia does, in fact, welcome established science in its articles. Then you might be asking why we deleted the phrase describing evolution as a scientific theory. Well the reason is very simple. That phrase did not meet the requirements of a well-supported statement. Based on solid scientific fact, the "theory" of evolution is just an accepted hypothesis.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. This has nothing to do with any sort of black-helicoptered, blue-helmeted "liberal bias" of WP and everything to do with the fact that this article does nothing whatsoever to establish notability -- it doesn't even make an attempt. There is one external link (to the site itself) and three reference links (again, all to the site itself). Ordinarily I would hope to see an AfD nom like this result in an article being improved by adding in references that satisfy <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, but in this case there do not appear to be any (if a 7-hit Google search is any indicator). <a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESeventypercent_9424.html" title="User:Seventypercent">Seventypercent</a> 03:29, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> 1.) This discussion seems to imply fantasy art and illustration in general has no claim of encyclopedic notability; deleting this article sets a precedent and will show personal bias unless ALL fantasy artists of similar rank are deleted from Wikipedia, including <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brom.html" title="Brom">Brom</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/d/Todd_Lockwood_20f3.html" title="Todd Lockwood">Todd Lockwood</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julie_Bell_ac70.html" title="Julie Bell">Julie Bell</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Brown_f46e.html" title="Amy Brown">Amy Brown</a> and countless others.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.) Pui-Mun Law's work DOES have wide notability amongst fans, professionals and her peers in the field, where she is regarded as one of its premiere watercolorists, hence her resume reading like a who's who of companies who use fantasy art. She is as well known as any of the aforementioned artists, so again, deletion should include all or none of them. 3.) Does NOT fail <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The 2nd and 9th bullet points apply. Verifiable references can be found and deletion is hasty and unnecessary. 4.) User Wavy G's (who has been banned) accusation is bizarre, nonsensical and irrelevant, having nothing to do with why an article on her (or any fantasy artist) was created and therefore should not be taken into account. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkgod_048b.html" title="User:Inkgod">Inkgod</a> 07:42, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Response</b> Okay, I just said her notablility was "questionable" (as others have pointed out, there is no assertion of notablility in the article) and the article <b>was</b> created by <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrickSW_3c82.html" title="User:PatrickSW">User:PatrickSW</a>, a main contributor of a recently-deleted hoax article (see: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Tuba_%28mythology%29_63dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tuba (mythology)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tuba (mythology)</a>) about a made-up mythological creature, citing Ms. Pui-Mun Law's painting (called "Snail Siesta") as a painting of said creature--THEN creating this article. I simply said it was created out of an attempt to bring some sort of credibility to that article (and it worked, by the way). She may be notable in her own right, but, as others seem to believe, she is not. Take of that what you will. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 08:07, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Response</b> The Tuba myth article, its author and that controversy are irrelevant to the article on Stephanie Pui-Mun Law (regardless if the original author is the same). If articles were simply deleted whenever tainted by trolls there wouldn't be much left on Wikipedia to look at. Also, most people familiar with the fantasy genre would not question her notability; so if it's the notability of the fantasy art world itself that's in question, then there are many more articles than this that must be debated for deletion as well. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkgod_048b.html" title="User:Inkgod">Inkgod</a> 07:42, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The article also cites a profile at the CrescentBlues website. That website's "about us" page shwos that they pay for work, but doesn't say that reviews will be rejected for errors, and some other things on the site indicate that the editors have other day jobs.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Looks like some of the earlier voters (discussers? commenters?) didn't understand the article. It says she broke <i>school</i> records, not <i>national</i> records. Every school in the world has a school record, and the newer the school's athletics program is, the easier it is to break that record. I'm not saying Findlay isn't a good athlete; it seems pretty clear she must be. But her record is definitely not noteworthy on a Wikipedia-article scale. --<a href="../../../q/u/u/User%7EQuuxplusone_9b50.html" title="User:Quuxplusone">Quuxplusone</a> 05:26, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>delete without prejudice</b>; there is clear consensus to delete this article as partly covered in other articles, partly dangerous original research. Howrealisreal doesn't appear to dispute that the current article is a liability, only that crack cocaine and hip hop is a notable topic - which itself is more or less undisputed in this AfD.

<dd>No one is saying that the connection between crack cocaine and hip-hop music doesn't exist. While saying that the drug's emergence is mainly responsible for the musical genre may be going too far, there is definitely a long history of early hip-hop musicians having been influenced by the crack epidemic or by being involved in the drug trade. However this article, right now, is full of speculation, sweeping generalizations, and unreferenced libel. Many artists are accused of committing illegal acts without so much as a reference to publicly disclosed police records. Others are simply assumed to have specific views of society and the drug trade because of subjective third-party analysis. Each wikipedia article must bear the burdens of neutrality and verifiability, crack cocaine and hip hop does not. ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 21:40, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - minor mentions even in a major newspaper does not necessarily warrant a WP article/bio. More to the point, there are several assertions within the article which are disputable at best, not referenced, and the details regarding his arrest and trial have been around since the initial creation of this article - leading me to believe it is not at all relevant to Wikipedia or his notability. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchaios_bf70.html" title="User:Archaios">Archaios</a> 05:53, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Not being referenced is grounds for cleanup. Only the references not <i>existing</i> is grounds for deletion, and they obviously exist. And I don't call a front page article a "minor mention", even if it is in a fringe magazine. For me, three non-trivial mentions establishes notability, and he definitely has those. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 05:58, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - in that case, every criminal in the media history of the world should be covered be Wikipedia. I believe the pertinence of the newspaper articles relates to his ideology, rather than his cause or account per se -- indeed, their disputations of the so-called hacktivist philosophy seems to indicate this, in which case I believe that such a subject may deserve a mention in <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hacktivism.html" title="Hacktivism">Hacktivism</a>, or <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a>, but not merit their own biographical article. I must mention that I am personally linked to this case, and I have great misgivings regarding its content _and_ notability. The front-page article existed in the previous incarnation, which was deleted; it appears that such fringe magazines do not constitute notability in this instance. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchaios_bf70.html" title="User:Archaios">Archaios</a> 06:06, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - As noted, the "front page" article is in a local "fringe" paper. The Reader is a self-described "features" rag. Not a newspaper like the Chicago Tribune or the Chicago Sun Times. Also, if someone media-whores enough, does that automatically make them notable? If the other "hacker" of recent vintage from Chicago, William Konopka (a guy who was busted for blowing up power stations and amassing stores cyanide, and actually made front page in the Chicago news rags) doesn't meet the requirements for Wikipedia notability, neither does this guy.

<li><b>Keep</b>I created this article in it's current incarnation and am happy to see significant support to keep. I have been a WP editor for a year. I have never engaged in edit wars. I have had nothing to do with any unpleasantness in this matter. I created this article last week after going to hackthissite.org to inquire about testing port scanning software. It was there I first learned about Mr. Hammond. I thought his story was interesting and sought more information on WP. I was surprised to find no article as it seemed a inherently notable topic. So I wrote a stubbish one. I made no reference to any earlier versions, as I did not know they existed. It is highly unlikely that this article bears much in common with any deleted article. I have sourced the article appropriately for a stub and feel the article should not be deleted. I don't mean to make it difficult, and I understand that an article about hackers and parody protesters could be draw people who might be difficult. But the fact remains it is notable. The recent plea/sentencing also adds material. I understand that JH is young, and an article about criminal activity that has not been proven/admitted is problematic. With the plea entered this is no longer the case. I do not have a negative opinion of JH. If anything I mildly admire him. I have no animosity toward his victims. I believe in debate and free speech and believe this topic raises interesting points<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdivorce_959f.html" title="User:Edivorce">Edivorce</a> 17:14, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I realize this has already been deleted in the past-and that my suggestion to keep it will in all likelihood be disregarded-but I feel it necessary to reiterate my point-of-view, which is that Hammond-especially with his recent conviction-is a notable subject. He has been arrested repeatedly-in a very public manner covered by local news sources-and his criminal behavior has been covered nationally by a number of well-known journalists, bloggers and political activists, e.g. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelle_Malkin_6e09.html" title="Michelle Malkin">Michelle Malkin</a>. <a href="../../../r/u/t/User%7ERuthfulbarbarity_f647.html" title="User:Ruthfulbarbarity">Ruthfulbarbarity</a> 18:00, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As the initial author of this article, I clearly may be biased. But there are more references that discuss the co-op, and would like an opportunity to present them and demonstrate its noteworthiness.</dd>
<dd>Regarding the Alex Jordan Sr. connection: It's true that the architectural history of the house predates the co-op, and the organization and the building are not legally identical, but where else would one write that information? Could there be a separate article about the house? Since Summit is a housing co-op, as a practical matter the organization can't be separated from the building. <a href="../../../c/e/p/User%7ECephal-odd_805a.html" title="User:Cephal-odd">Cephal-odd</a> 15:49, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - I was unsure what to do with this article, as it is a school that fails to provide why it's notable. However, due to how well the article is formatted and worded on <i>the first try</i> I am inclined to keep for the time being, allowing for a bit more time to let the author assert notability. <b>I recommend that this AfD last the entire five days and not be closed before then to allow time for the author to fix any problems with the article</b> However, a major problem, beyond its lack of notability is the fact that it sounds like an <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">advertisement</a>. <a href="../../../p/u/m/User%7EPumeleon_d227.html" title="User:Pumeleon">Pumeleon</a><sup><a href="../../../p/u/m/User_talk%7EPumeleon_a3a5.html" title="User talk:Pumeleon">T</a></sup> 05:57, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'm going to have to agree with Pumeleon; it was a great first article, and the author should be allowed the time to correct it. <sub>The previous unsigned comment was added by <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomitho_e029.html" title="User:Somitho">Somitho</a> on 06:22, December 17, 2006 UTC</sub></li>
<li>I edited in a few rounds to make it more clear exactly how I've changed the original article. I actually was a student there, and I apparently disguised my distaste for the place a little too well. Look on the bright side - I didn't try to include a section on the general emotional state of the upper school students. <a href="../../../i/g/n/User%7EIgnis_cec1.html" title="User:Ignis">Ignis</a> 07:19, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't see how this school stands out from other special schools. Also looking at the article you would have to stretch the truth a little too much to claim that this is a well formatted article. It consists mainly of small 4-5 line sections. The entire first section is just a copy from the school's website. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 16:38, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep or Merge</b> Disclaimer and disclosure: I was at the event. In the main it's curious to me that the criteria I see most often for deletion on this item is size, with second place seeming to go to a lack of mainstream media coverage. I can't control consensus, but notability shouldn't be restricted to the size of an event. That a planned event of 500 people gets cancelled at the last possible moment and is replaced by a fan-organized substitute, also at the last moment, seems notable from an everyday standpoint. <i>Serenity^3</i> wasn't notable in that sense because it was a planned event which happened as planned. The B3 was different, and therefore notable. As for verifiability, my complaint there is probably more as to flaws in that policy overall than with the concept -- e.g., if the mainstream doesn't notice something, there should be a way to still consider it verifiable, such as the existence of dozens of first-hand reports from attendees, who aren't at fault if no acceptbly-mainstream source has bothered to verify an event.

<li><b>Keep</b>, the unique nature of this event coupled with continuing media coverage in two major publications in addition to the major blogs already listed compell me to vote keep.

<li><b>Comment</b>: "Unique" is not a criterion for inclusion. Also, where is the media coverage?

<li><b>Keep or Merge</b> into Firefly fandom. While it sounds like it was a great party replacing what would have been yet another fan convention, what's notable about it is how it came to be, as a self-organizing event, and as that it should be remembered. People doing good things is usually not considered to be newsworthy, btw; the cancellation would have gotten press (probably did, in fact) but that was lost in the success of the Backup Bash. While it's surely not policy to "reward" good behavior, deleting the article, rather than merging it, is surely punishing it. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtterSmith_4321.html" title="User:OtterSmith">htom</a> 20:50, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Imagine you prepared for a group trip to Europe. You paid for your air, hotel and entertainment. Depending on what your itinerary, you pre-paid anywhere from $1000 to $5,000 up front. The trip is sold out, which means the organizer (who has a good reputation and has put together this type of event many times before) has been paid for everything. You get on the plane and when you land, you find out that other than the air and hotel that you are paying for directly, nothing on the itinerary has been paid for. You and a group of 500 people are milling around the hotel lobby not knowing what to do. There is no one there to help you and from what you understand, the company that booked the itinerary does not have the money to refund you.</p>
<p>There was a fan convention where 500 people from around the world paid for a weekend of socializing with actors, directors, writers, musicians and other Industry folk connected with the series Firefly/Serenity at the Burbank Hilton. People spent anywhere from $1000 to $5,000 including air, hotel and the convention itself. At the last minute, actually in the afternoon prior to Day One, while most people who were coming from outside of Southern California were in the air or in their cars driving down, the convention was canceled, with no refunds in sight. Seems even the studio people and the Hilton were left in the lurch, w/o being paid thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>The California Browncoats put together a Booster Backup Bash (the company's name was Booster Events) and entertained the attendees from Friday through Sunday on a shoestring. Most of the Industry folk came to hang out with the fans for free, Clare Kramer (Glory in season 5 of Buffy) and her husband opened their new Hollywood Blvd restaurant (La Cantina) 2 weeks early so we could have a party (again where the Industry people joined us), people and companies helped us with getting locations to have the daytime events (the Hilton would not/could not release their convention rooms to us) and paid for tour buses so we could move over 350 people (some people didn't come at all, others arrived and left -boy were they pissed they left). Cash donations totaling $6500 came in from Browncoats around the world to help pay for the non-convention. In other words, we made lemons out of lemonade.</p>
<p>So now imagine that same group trip I wrote about at the beginning. While the tourists are in the lobby crying about their ruined trip and how they saved for this special event, strangers start to show up in the lobby. They help you with contacting friends and family. They tell you they will, out of the goodness of their heart, make a substitute itinerary for you for the weekend, keep your group busy seeing the sites, meeting people, playing games, transporting you around, even hosting a major party in a fancy restaurant at no cost to you since you're already out thousands of dollars. And other strangers donate money to a site to help towards paying for the new itinerary and transportation. Strangers. And after you have a weekend that although wasn't what you paid for ended up being more fun during, those strangers wait around until the last person is on their way back home.</p>
<p>Do you think strangers would do that for strangers? As a cohesive group? Of course not. The Browncoats did.</p>

<p>The result was <b>Keep (no conc)</b> Whilst the arithmetic is borderline, the keep case much is stronger. The deletioners seem focused on the google notability of the term, but the article isn't about the term but the phenomenon, which verifiably exists. (if renaming is wanted, it does not need deletion). There seem plenty of citations available on the article - so that objection has been addressed. Clean-up required though. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 12:22, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Should I post these on his talk page, with appropriate warnings; or will you perhaps have a talk with him about his obvious issues with civility? I don't think it's quite time for an RfC; but Mr. Norton is on a slippery slope, in my humble opinion. I understand that he is a strong inclusionist, and I respect his views, even as he does not seem to respect any but the inclusionist viewpoint. I am certainly no deletionist, and I don't deny that (as you've pointed out) this article is a worthy topic, if it gets a bit more fleshed out. But I don't like being preached to by an individual who isn't even <i><b>trying</b></i> to be polite in their accusations that those who have voted to delete the article are acting in bad faith, having done no research whatsoever. It makes me not want to listen to even polite, intelligent arguments such as yours. -- <a href="../../../w/e/i/User%7EWeirdoactor_7234.html" title="User:Weirdoactor">weirdoactor</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/e/i/User_talk%7EWeirdoactor_eae5.html" title="User talk:Weirdoactor">t</a></sup><sup>|</sup><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Weirdoactor_bb16.html" title="Special:Contributions/Weirdoactor">c</a></sup> 15:09, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Contested PROD. I'm not quite sure what this is. On the surface, it looks like a text dump from something. A closer reading seems to indicate that the title refers to <i>self-proclaimed "voice builder" Gary Catona</i> and that the article is a PR piece of some sort.

<li><b>Keep</b> The Degenatron was sufficiently fleshed out, both in the GTA games and in the real world thanks to Rockstar's official Degenatron website, to sustain an article. It is relevant in real life as Rockstar's subtle counter-attack against critics who accuse videogames in general, and GTA games in particular, of pushing kids into committing crimes. And unlike what Y2kcrazyjoker4 said, it is actually playable, as there are Degenatron emulators out there. The article itself is well written, with an out-of-universe perspective, and well referenced. It is well worth keeping in Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../r/i/t/User%7ERitchy_3c4d.html" title="User:Ritchy">Ritchy</a> 15:35, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Lots of people play GTA and hear that "degenatron" praisings. Whether it's a real or fictional game, it's a clear fact that such an entity exists, and I think it's a good thing that a guesser may open up Wikipedia and get to know all the details. Really, the GTA universe is very tightly intermixed with real-life (GTA:VC - with sunny 80s in USA). Lots of people just won't know if "degenatron" is real reference to some weird 80s early game or just a parody - and then the Wikipedia should provide that sort of information. --<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreyCat_699e.html" title="User:GreyCat">GreyCat</a> 08:57, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>non-notable / vanity TruthGal 07:47, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a></p>
<p>Seems like a non-notable / vanity page. The three references cited include a link that's dead (<a href="http://www.diald.com/Models/2004Interviews/01JanInterview.htm/" class="external free" title="http://www.diald.com/Models/2004Interviews/01JanInterview.htm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.diald.com/Models/2004Interviews/01JanInterview.htm/</a>) and the subject's own web page.</p>
<p>The subject's own web page is a membership-based soft-core porn site ("Here's the second part to the webcam video I made last week. In this one, I just finished cooking and do a sexy dance for you.").</p>
<p>The "interview" cited on www.modfxmodels.com has a link to the subject's "gallery," which then prompts for payment. I thought maybe she was a famous internet porn girl I was unaware of, but then I did a Wikipedia search of the first 10 "models" on the modfxmodels page with Flo Jalin and none of them have Wikipedia pages (no Wikipedia page for Flor Bermudez, Sophi Berglund, Lisa Angeline, Kymberle, Luana Lani, Jessica Burciaga, Ann Poll or Vanessa Valdez).</p>
<p>Article also claims that subject was Miss Hawaiian Tropics (sic). The reference for this is the subject's own website. I tried to independently corroborate her Hawaiian Tropic titles, but a search for "Flo Jalin" on <a href="http://www.pageant.com" class="external free" title="http://www.pageant.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pageant.com</a> turns up nothing.</p>
<p>The link to her interview at the IGN website works, though a search of that site seems to indicate that she's a car show / video game show model. Is car show model + soft-core porn site = famous enough to warrant an entry in an encyclopedia? I'm just asking...</p>

<p>I'm going to have to detract slightly from the apparent consensus. Please note that I have no affiliation with the above person, and had never heard of him prior to this morning. However, upon reviewing his recent publication list, I feel that Savisha's comment, though well-intended, is misleading: "A man with two or three PubMed publications...". More important is the fact that he has published in <b>two of the five most prominant medical journals</b> that exist, mainly the <a href="../../../c/m/a/CMAJ_c6e5.html" title="CMAJ">CMAJ</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lancet_6c53.html" title="The Lancet">The Lancet</a>, and thus, in my opinion, is entitled to a <i>brief</i> article that is <i>neutral</i> in nature and adequately presents both sides of whichever controversal hypothesis he argues. --<font color="olive">JE.at.UWO</font><sup><a href="../../../j/e/_/User%7EJe_at_uwo_2966.html" title="User:Je at uwo"><b>U</b></a></sup>|<sub><a href="../../../j/e/_/User_talk%7EJe_at_uwo_e5f5.html" title="User talk:Je at uwo"><b>T</b></a></sub> 17:06, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I need to say that I have no personal issue with that man. However I do have a problem with him advertising his methods on Wikipedia - He and his colleauge have tried to include the treatment (for which he has no accepted publication not to speak of a randomised controlled trial) in the article for <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarcoidosis.html" title="Sarcoidosis">Sarcoidosis</a>.

<p>I wasn't sure that I really wanted to get involved in this, but in my dealings with this individual I did do a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&amp;DB=pubmed" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&amp;DB=pubmed" rel="nofollow">PubMed search</a> (which I have pasted below). You can clearly see that the "papers" published in CMAJ and the Lancet are not papers but are, in fact, <i>author replies</i> (i.e. usually disagreement with what the authors of the papers did publish).</p>

<p>I stand corrected (and slightly embarrased:) in my (premature) statement that he had published the papers in CMAJ and The Lancet. I suppose this is what I get for trying to edit on wikipedia during exam time! Anyway, if it can be established that he has insignificant notoriety then I say delete it. I would be in favour of adding a section on either sarcodiosis or vitamin D to something to the effect of: Researchers have also proposed blah blah blah treatment, etc (Marshall T <i>et al.</i>) and then site his journal or something. --<font color="olive">JE.at.UWO</font><sup><a href="../../../j/e/_/User%7EJe_at_uwo_2966.html" title="User:Je at uwo"><b>U</b></a></sup>|<sub><a href="../../../j/e/_/User_talk%7EJe_at_uwo_e5f5.html" title="User talk:Je at uwo"><b>T</b></a></sub> 19:16, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Seems I will need to add a few things in the view of the above comments.
<ul>
<li>Dr Marshall (PhD in electric engineering/diabetes) and a user called <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalbert_3ec2.html" title="User:Palbert">Palbert</a> have already tried to include their views on the articles on Sarcoidosis and Vitamin D, and their views have been rightly not allowed to be included in the content. For the disscussions please see <a href="../../../s/a/r/Talk%7ESarcoidosis_cf0d.html" title="Talk:Sarcoidosis">Talk:Sarcoidosis</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/t/Talk%7EVitamin_D_e333.html" title="Talk:Vitamin D">Talk:Vitamin D</a></li>
<li>I will take Sarcoidosis as an example. I am myself no big fan of corticosteroids, and I embrace the fact that Dr Marshall is hypothesising a different aetiology and treatment. This is worth looking for, and the Oxford Textbook of Medicine, 4th ed. does suggest a protoplast form of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as one of several possibilities. Now the problem: T Marshall is selling his treatment as being for Sarcoidosis, he has not published ANYTHING for that in peer-review journals. However, there has been Published literature on alternatives to corticosteroids one of the more notable authors being [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed&amp;cmd=search&amp;term=baughman+rp" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed&amp;cmd=search&amp;term=baughman+rp" rel="nofollow">R.P. Baughman</a>], who recently even published [<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12888-7" class="external text" title="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12888-7" rel="nofollow">an article</a>] in the Lancet. If you want too beef up the Sarcoidosis article I would suggest you add people like Baughman rather that Marshall.</li>
<li>Lastly, why I got involved in this. I belive that the greatest danger for Wikipedia are not vandals or editors who post hoaxes. In a specialist field like medicine, people like Trevor Marshall or whoever wrote the article are far more dangerous - his article on himself looks very professional, and he uses what looks like scientific papers to back up his arguments (some of these he published in a journal he set up himself). To a lay user, who has sarcoidosis, for example, this may look very serious, and he may be fooled. He will then go onto Marshall's website and maybe even join his therapy, for which there is not a hint of scientific evidence (Please remember that a <i>significant</i> result in a <i>Randomised controlled trial</i> is needed to verify a treatment).</li>
<li>Marshall seems to be very keen on putting his point forward, and his contributions have been doubtful at times: [<a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/326/7379/12/b#88124" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/326/7379/12/b#88124" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>],[<a href="http://impnvestigator.chat.ru/" class="external autonumber" title="http://impnvestigator.chat.ru/" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>. He has however been very active on the internet, and his wikipedia activity as well as his webpages are a testimony to this: [<a href="http://www.trevormarshall.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.trevormarshall.com/" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>] [<a href="http://www.marshallprotocol.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.marshallprotocol.com/" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>] [<a href="http://www.sarcinfo.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sarcinfo.com" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>]. He also not an academic at any University, but rather set up his own institute, with a few nurses.</li>
<li>Marshall's Protocol seems to be a wonder treatment for [<a href="http://www.marshallprotocol.com/forum32/1263.html" class="external text" title="http://www.marshallprotocol.com/forum32/1263.html" rel="nofollow">many diseases</a>] including Crohn's, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Sarcoidosis etc. see link.</li>
<li>Marshall's Protocol is not alone in the world of unproven and unpublished hypotheses. There are many other so called Protocols as exemplified by this [<a href="http://lassesen.com/cfids/protocols.htm" class="external text" title="http://lassesen.com/cfids/protocols.htm" rel="nofollow">this website</a>] on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronic_Fatigue_Syndrome_baf5.html" title="Chronic Fatigue Syndrome">Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</a>. Are you going to include Marshall and all other Protocols? None of them are proven scientifically. Or are you going to include Marshall because his internet presence is more bold? There are so many more important things than his small-print research.</li>
<li>Finally @DGG: You say that <i>We do not omit theories that are rejected by the medical or scientific community but which have gotten public attention.</i> 1. What do you base his public attention on? His own publicity on himself? 2. In science I think that it IS important whether someone has been embraced by peer-based-review or has not been able to publish because his articles were seen as not up to the standard. I do not believe we are here to publish random hypotheses. Especially if you look at the Articles for <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarcoidosis.html" title="Sarcoidosis">Sarcoidosis</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vitamin_D_cf3b.html" title="Vitamin D">Vitamin D</a>, they include the barest minimum of information including a random hypothesis might lead a lay user to the idea that Marshall's small print stuff is mainstream!</li>
<li>What is also funny, someone has added him as a notable producer of Home-made synthesizers on Wikipedia <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synthesizer.html#Homemade_synthesizers" title="Synthesizer">Synthesizer#Homemade_synthesizers</a>. He is an electrical engineer, and as a medic I cannot assess whether his home-made synthesizer was more important than other ones in the history of these things.</li>

<p><b>Conditional keep</b> - the subject of the article appears to be notable and the article is well-sourced, but I agree with the tag at the top that it reads far too much like the subject's resume. This article should be kept, but it needs a complete rewrite by someone who is prepared to make it less like a vanity page or something advertising the article's subject. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 03:27, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> Marshall's entry is not an attempt to disparage other researchers or ideas about treating chronic illness. It is simply a professionally written article intended to make people aware of the fact that Marshall is a significant figure in the world of chronic disease. Thousands of people are currently applying Marshall's treatment plan towards diseases which are painful, and in many cases deadly (particularly Sarcoidosis, a rare lung disease). Take a long look at <a href="http://www.marshallprotocol.com" class="external text" title="http://www.marshallprotocol.com" rel="nofollow">www.marshallprotocol.com</a> to understand how many people's lives revolve around Marshall's scientific breakthroughs. The MP website has 80,000 posts. That's a lot of feedback by patients undergoing treatment. It would be very strange indeed to tell the thousands of patients doing the Marshall Protocol (who firmly believe that the treatment is drastically altering their quality of life) that the founder of the MP is not a person of note.</p>
<p>The Marshall Protocol is being used by physicians and patients in many countries around the world. A quick Google search for "Marshall Protocol" brings up 12,300 entries, demonstrating that the MP is not only a treatment option in the United States, but recognized internationally.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that Marshall charges no fee to the patients benefiting from his scientific breakthroughs. Patients are only required to understand that they are subjects in a Phase II study about the MP that is being done in conjunction with the FDA. Thus, the FDA not only is aware of this treatment, but is working closely with Marshall to monitor its outcome. In fact Marshall was invited by the FDA to make a presentation in their "Visiting Professor" lecture series.</p>
<p>I suppose an argument could be made that Marshall's views on chronic disease are not correct. However it then makes little sense that his presence in high demand at science colloquia and conferences. Marshall has been publishing scientific papers for the last 25 years. Last month Marshall was offered the position of adjunct professor at an Australian University.</p>
<p>It seems that a fair share of the scientific community is very interested in Marshall's work and his connections with prominent doctors and scientists continue to grow by the day. He's a man with novel ideas who seems to be on the rise in the scientific world. Perhaps we should hesistate before removing the bio of a person who is touching the life of so many people who are so very ill. Sazevedo 23:04, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

If you or your research is notable then it will be writen about by someone else. I think this also includes parties within an arm's reach, such as a coleague. Anyway, i tried to clean up the intro a bit to get rid of some weasel words, etc, but I have finals to study for ... though that hasn't stopped me much anyway&#160;;) I have to agree with Wooty though, it isn't about what good he has done. I'm sure that a lot of people that feel they have been saved by his treatment no doubt want to let others know about it, and I don't blame them, but Wikipedia isn't the place to promote opinions or beliefs, no matter how well-intentioned. Providing lots of information, with the caveat that all medical decisions should be made through discussion with a family doctor, would be most appropriate in situations such as these. -- <font color="olive">JE.at.UWO</font><sup><a href="../../../j/e/_/User%7EJe_at_uwo_2966.html" title="User:Je at uwo"><b>U</b></a></sup>|<sub><a href="../../../j/e/_/User_talk%7EJe_at_uwo_e5f5.html" title="User talk:Je at uwo"><b>T</b></a></sub> 03:43, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was surprised when I noticed this article was marked for deletion. Dr. Marshall is a notable person, and a brief Wikipedia entry is appropriate. Marshall meets the criteria for notability in his field, which is suggested at Wikipedia:Notability (doctors) - a Google search for “Trevor Marshall” results in a distinguished number of hits, showing that Marshall is an 'important figure' and is regarded as a 'significant expert in their area' by physicians worldwide (criteria 1 and 2). - Marshall originated the important new concept that dysregulated vitamin D production in humans results in negative changes to the effectiveness of innate immunity and ability to kill bacterial invaders. - Marshall has contributed to refining the use of molecular modeling to evaluate the effects of drugs. As a result of his work, the FDA invited him to make a presentation on the use of molecular genomics and computer modeling, in their “Visiting Professor” lecture series (criteria 7) - His 1983 paper on insulin infusion at <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=6662523" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=6662523">PMID 6662523</a> (available on the National Library of Medicine's PubMed index website) is a significant academic work (criteria 4) as it has been significantly cited by other researchers (source: Science Citations Index). - There is a medical procedure named after Marshall. The "Marshall Protocol" refers to the use of specific dosing of selected antibiotics in combination with an angiotensin receptor blocker. It was actually the physicians and patients using this treatment who began calling it the Marshall Protocol, not Dr. Marshall himself. That name itself is not self promotion. A search for "MarshallProtocol" on Google yields 12,300 hits, and also demonstrates international notoriety (criteria 10).</p>
<p>The existing article doesn’t do a good job of nailing down the fact that Trevor Marshall has developed and used advanced technology for a broad range of innovative applications over more than 25 years. His work has influenced - music (see Wikipedia: Synthesizer). - computing (1993 Eddy Award for Mac User) (<a href="http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/</a> ).

<p>Sarabrate 17:14, 16 December 2006 (UTC)Sorry! I wasn't signed in when I posted.</p>
<p>I'm confused about some of the statements posted after my reply. After reading the bio I did not get the impression that it was written by Marshall himself or even his colleagues. I see no statements that reflect any sort of vanity or a desire to "promote" the scientific concepts in the piece. The author of the bio seemed rather objective in my eyes. For example the author does not even claim that Marshall himself believes his protocol has cured patients. It simply states that some patients "claim" to have recovered. I see no statements which say the MP is the ONLY treatment for chronic disease, the best treatment...or anything along those lines. What I do see is a very carefully cited description of the basic concepts of Marshall's scientific discoveries that are essential to state if the reader is to understand WHY he has spent the last decade developing a novel treatment protocol for chronic illness. The science comes straight from medical journals which do not publish "opinions or beliefs." They publish..science. Again I remind you that Marshall is working with the FDA. I'm not sure the FDA conducts Phase II trials based on opinions.</p>
<p>JE-Kudos on balancing finals and wiki work! I think it is reasonable to include a statement that all medical decisions should be made with a family doctor. But I want to clarify that patients on the MP are already required to make decisions with a doctor. Marshall himself is not a medical doctor (he has a PhD in biomedical research). Thus, he cannot prescribe medication. Patients on the MP need to take several medicines aviliable only with a prescription (antibiotics etc). Thus, every person on the MP is already currently working with a doctor who understands and consents to the treatment. That's quite a few doctors around the world who are using the protocol. In regards to your corrections of the first paragraph, I feel it goes a bit overboard. Give the reader a little credit! I think they can certainly infer from the original piece that the MP is one of many treatments for chronic disease. I also think readers can infer on their own that the treatment is controversial, seeing as there are no statements in the piece that even come close to saying that the MP is the only treatment option for sarcoidosis etc.</p>

<li>Despite much discussion, there is still no consensus about the <i>notability</i> of the subject, which seems to be the key issue here. I believe some more detailed opinions on why his scholarly contributions and the third-party coverage about him (or the lack thereof) make him notable (or not) would help here.</li>
<li>However, alleged misconduct on the part of the subject (such as two <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single purpose accounts</a>, which should be discounted, participating in the above discussion) is not grounds for deletion of the article about him, but for warnings and/or blocks if need be. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 07:58, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Back to the discussion</b>: 'Ombudsman' gave a concise characterization of what this discussion is really about - suppression. Marshall has attracted attention from the medical community and regulatory agencies, making his work scientifically notable. Although I am a newbie, (contributing small bits on various topics for a while, but only formally registered in August), the insinuation that my contributions are sub-par spurred me to do what no one else has apparently been willing to do: take a look at Google!</p>

<p>The issue is one of <b>notablility</b> here. I will try to explain why T Marshall is not notable enough to be included in an encyclopaedia, in my opinion. <b>Please read this especially if you are a non-scientist</b>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first thing we need to realise is that T Marshall in Wikipedia is not a media personality but is portrayed/portrays himself as a scientist. I believe this makes a big difference to notability criteria.</li>
<li>I think what is most important to understand in this context is the concept of <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidence-based_medicine.html" title="Evidence-based medicine">Evidence-based medicine</a> and scientific <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer-review.html" title="Peer-review">peer-review</a>. This means that in scientific journals, a board of editors looks at the submitted work and analyses it from a viewpoint of scientific validity. For medicine, the main source of authoritative journals is PubMed, if a journal is not on Pubmed, it is unlikely to be important.</li>
<li>T Marshall has published five articles to be found on PubMed. Two of these are just author responses, thus only short letters referring to other people's publications. The remaining three are in specialist journals - which means they are not the most groundbreaking discoveries. If a scientist discovers something really important he publishes in Nature, the BMJ, The Lancet etc. And the volume of Marshall's work isn't really breathtaking either - not few of my medical student friends have one or two scientific publications on PubMed.</li>
<li>T Marshall has tried to publish in the BMJ 3 times and admits to this in a <a href="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/326/7382/182/b" class="external text" title="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/326/7382/182/b" rel="nofollow">BMJ internet-reply</a> - his works were rejected by BMJ-reviewers because they were of "limited interest" and "added little to existing knowledge".</li>
<li>T Marshall publishes regularly in a 'journal' edited and reviewed by himself, a pracice which does not put his professionalism into the best light - [<a href="http://www.joimr.org/index.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.joimr.org/index.php" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>]. Some of the links in the Wikipedia article about him link to this 'journal'.</li>
<li>What about the other links that Sarabrate posted above? Well, from a scientific point of view these aren't really notable - they are far less likely to have factual and scientific content. They should not be taken into account when assessing Marshall's scientific notability. If you want a comparision to journalism - this is like writing for a community newsletter. One of them is the Wikipedia synthesizer page copied onto a html page, two are connected to a local Lyme disease movement etc.</li>
<li>If you care you can take a look at the contributions of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sazevedo_3708.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sazevedo">Special:Contributions/Sazevedo</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sarabrate_b8d9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sarabrate">Special:Contributions/Sarabrate</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Trevmar_c443.html" title="Special:Contributions/Trevmar">Special:Contributions/Trevmar</a> (T Marshall himself) and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Palbert_3293.html" title="Special:Contributions/Palbert">Special:Contributions/Palbert</a>(seems to be P Albert, a man closely working with T Marshall). You will notice they are very similar indeed in response style, and all accounts try to promote T Marshall on Wikipedia. They all clearly have very good knowledge and very high affection for him. My question is: Who is Who? Make your own mind.</li>
<li>One final note: Sarabrate has inquired into my contributions. I do not have anything to hide and I openly admit that I asked <a href="../../../d/o/1/User%7EDO11.10_882e.html" title="User:DO11.10">DO11.10</a> and <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> to join this debate. If you think this is questionable practice please contact them or disregard their votes. Also you might notice, that most I have done in WP is linked to this discussion. This is because I was struck by the fact that someone could be pushing pseudoscience via Wikipedia so effectively. I am a medical student and have no other interest in this debate other than making WP more evidence-based and a little less random.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, I would like to appeal to users who vote keep (other than Sarabrate, Trevmar et al), to give an argumentation which also touches on the issue of notability of scientists and Evidence-based medicine in relation to T Marshall. <b>Delete</b>--<a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavisha_e2e9.html" title="User:Savisha">Savisha</a> 02:00, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> as I have already voted to delete.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Savisha is correct, this debate is about Trevor Marshall's purported notability as a scientist, and since the public is not generally capable of truly judging the scientific merit of a given paper, (the crux of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> policy I assume) the job of judging science must fall to other scientists, in the form of peer review. Admittedly, this process is not perfect, but in this forum we must accept the peer's judgements of scientific merit.</dd>
<dd>I would also like to note that another important factor in determining the notability of a scientist is the number of times that <i>other</i> scientists have cited their articles. This is usually a good indication of how important and useful the published paper is to the understanding and work of other authors <b>in the same field</b>. According to <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Trevor+G+Marshall%22" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Trevor+G+Marshall%22" rel="nofollow">Google <b>Scholar</b></a> (which I refer to as it gives a more accurate "cited by" record) Trevor Marshall's most recent papers have each been cited by fewer than 10 other scientists. This indicates that a paper is of <i>extremely</i> low impact, especially as these papers have been available for over two years. As a comparison, for non-scientists, I offer <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22p+marrack%22+author:p-marrack&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;scoring=r&amp;as_ylo=2001" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22p+marrack%22+author:p-marrack&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;scoring=r&amp;as_ylo=2001" rel="nofollow">the record</a> of a <b>truly</b> notable researcher (I pick this scientist because I am familiar with her record, but many <i>notable</i> scientists have similar citation records).

<li><b>Strong Merge</b> with the Norman Finkelstein page. This is about a substantial part of one of his <b>published</b> notable books, and is a notable controversy surrounding Mr Finkelstein himself. Hence I feel WP:NOR is not a valid argument. I suggest possibly trimming a little, and merging back into the main article. This article was originally broken out of the main article which has a section redirecting to it. See also the talk page.

<p>I recently prodded this and it was uncontested for a week. However, the admin closing old prods noted that it had been through VfD before so isn't prod-able (I was unaware of this stipulation). I think this should be deleted because it is an unsourced, unencyclopedic article topic that any other encyclopedia wouldn't have (even keeping in mind Wikipedia is not paper). What makes fictional people being cremated noteworthy enough for an article? If this were kept it sets a precedent to keep any arbitrary list of things that happened to fictional characters, which is a potentially endless amount of lists. If kept, this at very minimum needs souces for every entry.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - I'm fairly inclusionist and would have been willing to fight for the page as it was presented as having an association with quite a few people so I looked at the web site BUT though the web page lists many peoples names it says "To Name a Few of the Individuals and Organizations <b>from whom we are seeking</b> Candidates and Platform recommendations:" and also "The following is just a <b>sample</b> of the organizations that <b>we wish to receive support from</b> in the form of information and participation:". (my emphasis) To me listing all those names is simply trying to rig the search engines. Bad karma feeling - something is just not right. Maybe in the future when it actually gets some people on board then fine but let others create that page on Wikipedia not people involved with the organisation. <a href="../../../t/t/i/User%7ETtiotsw_54d6.html" title="User:Ttiotsw">Ttiotsw</a> 02:13, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Muslim porn is a redirect to veil fetish, so redirecting there won't help.

I don't know, this isn't my demense) and then <i>that</i> content cited or tossed.

<li>A better solution would be <b>Redirect to <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mask_fetishism.html" title="Mask fetishism">Mask fetishism</a></b>. Patchouli is right in that the Muslim thing is only part of it, though it may well be an important one - a more important detail is that the veil anonymises the women to some extent - a feature shared with the similar Mask fetishism. A redirect and smerge to that would seem to me to be a more sensible option, with links to Muslim porn, Harem fetishism and the like there if such articles exist. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 11:35, 18 December 2006 (UTC) (after not one or two, but three edit conflicts!)</li>
<li>The mask one is suggestive of a leather covering of the face and/or body. <b>Veil</b> and everything described in the article concern fabric as far as I can think.

<li>I take it from that you haven't read <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mask_fetishism.html" title="Mask fetishism">Mask fetishism</a>.

<li>Comment: Note that despite surviving an AFD in Dec 2005, <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mask_fetishism.html" title="Mask fetishism">mask fetishism</a> has only one reference from what appears to be a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, and that is a BBC news report about a mask fetishist who devlolved into criminal behavior! And even that barely mentions the topic itself.

Not that that page couldn't use a lot of expansion - mask fetishism is quite common in Japan, for instance, and is related to the full body-costume fetish of kigurumi (itself related to turning real people into anime-like cartoons) - but that's not mentioned anywhere on that page. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 22:42, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is one of the many Survivor contestant articles where the person really isn't notable. It seems like she's only had a few minor, one episode appearances on shows besides Survivor. Through the many AFD's, it has become clear that, unless the player has won the show, did something really, really notable on the show, or did something notable outside of the show, they really don't deserve an article. <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETeckWiz_cd20.html" title="User:TeckWiz"><b>T</b></a><span style="color:green;">e</span><a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETeckWiz_cd20.html" title="User:TeckWiz"><b>ckWiz</b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/e/c/User_talk%7ETeckWiz_cb9b.html" title="User talk:TeckWiz">Talk</a></sup><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TeckWiz_ea80.html" title="Special:Contributions/TeckWiz">Contribs</a><sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_TeckWiz_0fa0.html" title="Special:Emailuser/TeckWiz">@</a></sub></small> 18:42, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

We don't (generally) create articles about topics that are short-term in-the-news; we wait until it's clear that the topic has lasting notability. Little-white-girl-missing may be covered by all the news channels for a day or two, but that doesn't mean the little white girl deserves a Wikipedia article, even though many people may, briefly, be able to remember her name. Because, chances are, in a couple of weeks or months, nobody will remember the name any more. As for Ms. Oakley, bit TV parts may make this person more notable than your average game show loser, but fall <i>far</i> short of what <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> asks for.

<li><i>Au contraire</i> - Wikipedia is loaded with such ephemera and should reflect the notability and notariety of the subjects of the articles. Regarding your <i>Little-white-girl-missing may be covered by all the news channels for a day or two, but that doesn't mean the little white girl deserves a Wikipedia article, even though many people may, briefly, be able to remember her name</i> argument: of course the logical reply is that once the person is forgotten, the article covering her can be quickly and easily deleted. Regarding Ms. Oakley, she <i>is</i> a regular on a program seen by over a dozen million people each week (and has been for the last three months), and until that status changes, that's enough to establish notability under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Once she slips from public mind (along with <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/Survivor%7E_Cook_Islands_f5fe.html" title="Survivor: Cook Islands">Survivor: Cook Islands</a></i>), the article can be erased. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 06:34, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

If either of them wins, that will make a major change in their notability status. It does not make much sense to me to close either or both of these AFDs and delete the articles when in only two days there may be a dramatic shift in the notability situation for one of them. If these AFDs are closed and one of them wins, then the article will need to be recreated within days of it's deletion. If the AFDs can be held from closing for just a couple more days, we can avoid that situation and know for sure if one of them is the winner. I'm not arguing that these articles are premature, and if these AFDs were being held a few weeks back I would have said to torch the articles. But at this point, this close to the end, if the AFDs can just stay open for a couple more days.... - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 18:20, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</s></li>

<li><b>Dont Delete</b> . This is a helpful page that compares and contrast the diffrent legendary pokemons powers according to their basestats, and is helpful to readers who want to know information on how strong each is. It is a combination of pages put into one that tell the reader each pokemons power in contrast to one another and in no way helps one complete the pokemon game in any way, so I do not understand how this is a guide, and if it is, then so is every other pokemon page that tells the reader how to catch pokemon, which is way more of a guide then this one.
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> there's two things to note about your objection. The first is that you call it a guide in the first sentence then deny it in the second. The other problem is that there are no pages telling people HOW to catch Pokemon, or there SHOULDN'T be... if you see info like, "You can catch Zigzagoon on Rts. 1, 2, 3, 4, etc." delete it. This is a general encyclopedia and detailed info about base stats is considered to be too in-depth for the average reader. Ask yourself - would someone who is never going to play the game care if Ho-Oh's attack is 110 or 120? Saying one has a higher attack than another is enough.

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b>. It seems like it could cause problems, e.g. with redundancy, having two separate articles for philanthropist and philanthropy.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I agree with PrimeHunter's points, but I think it doesn't outweigh the effort of continuously maintaining the article, which is more work than for most other articles since this article has proven to be prone to vanity edits. (Creating "List of notable philanthropists" wouldn't help - it's just a different name for the same thing.) I could be swayed to "keep" if I were convinced that Jerzy and The Transhumanist, who so lovingly improved this article after I informed everybody that I had tagged it with {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}, kept watching over it. This seems to be not the case, seeing that they have not raised their voice here. I don't make a big difference between "merge with philanthropy" and "delete", since there isn't much more text here, and everybody is free to add a sentence or two to the philanthropy article, anyway. — <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastianHelm_63db.html" title="User:SebastianHelm">Sebastian</a> 01:56, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Keep</s></b> - all listed. They are U2 songs, not some by some unknown. People are interested in them even if the nominator may not be. Admittedly more work could be done to work up the articles, including interpretations - there is enough sources around - but that can't be done if they are deleted.

(it will improve the Pop album article). However, I do not want to see this information deleted and lost.

<li><b>Merge</b> all into <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_%28album%29.html" title="Pop (album)">Pop (album)</a>. That U2 are notable does not mean that every song they have recorded is notable. The vast majority of album tracks are non-notable, and these articles fail to establish the significance of these songs (apart from the sentence-long mention of the <i>Q</i> magazine list in the "Miami" article that could easily be merged into the album article). Readers of a general encyclopedia will not need to know that "If You Wear That Velvet Dress" was played at nearly every show on the Popmart Tour, or that The Edge used a Rickenbacker 360-12 to perform "Gone" on the Elevation Tour. A bigger problem here is the presence of original research and editorial opinion in these articles. Apparently "Miami" is "perhaps the most experimental track the band has released under its own name" - according to whom? "["Wake Up Dead Man"] is written as a plea from Bono for Jesus to return and fix the world" - who said this? "The opening notes [of "The Playboy Mansion"] strongly resemble that of a pornographic movie soundtrack" - again, where is this information coming from? None of these articles are referenced either. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 13:53, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep Gone (U2 song) and Miami (U2 song) under any criteria</b> - "Gone" is one of the most visible <i>Pop</i> numbers in later concerts, and is included on the group's <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Best_of_1990-2000_cbf8.html" title="The Best of 1990-2000">The Best of 1990-2000</a></i> compilation.

<li><b>Keep the rest under pragmatic criteria</b> - U2 is one of those artists at the pinnacle of critical and commercial success and fervent fandom where eventually, every song is going to have an article. Examples already exist in WP: every song of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> has an article, even those like "<a href="../../../h/o/l/Hold_Me_Tight_c1cc.html" title="Hold Me Tight">Hold Me Tight</a>" that McCartney no longer remembers. Every <a href="../../../l/e/d/Led_Zeppelin_cf85.html" title="Led Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> song seems to have an article, even ones like "<a href="../../../h/o/t/Hots_on_for_Nowhere_4fd8.html" title="Hots on for Nowhere">Hots on for Nowhere</a>" or "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wanton_Song_b07f.html" title="The Wanton Song">The Wanton Song</a>" that don't have much to say (the article <i>or</i> the song!). Every <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pink_Floyd_f331.html" title="Pink Floyd">Pink Floyd</a> song has an article, even for albums before <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>, even for songs like "<a href="../../../s/t/o/Stop_%28Pink_Floyd_song%29_a930.html" title="Stop (Pink Floyd song)">Stop</a>" that are only 30 seconds of connecting music, or songs like "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hero%27s_Return_6fc6.html" title="The Hero's Return">The Hero's Return</a>" that are unremembered tracks from failed albums during the group's breakup period. And so on. U2 isn't quite there yet, but it will be, and that's ok. It comes with the WP territory, like every Simpsons episode and every minor Star Wars character and every stupid video game all having articles. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 13:57, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have nothing against U2, I happen to have the CD that these songs are off of.</li>
<li>If the articles are deleted, they can be readded later with citations for interpretations. They can be worked on in a User subpage. Although the fact remains that they are just songs that were never released as singles.</li>
<li>I realize now that there are articles for every song by notable bands but I don't have the time to go around and tag everyone of them. I'd also rather avoid making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>.</li>
<li>The articles consist of mainly technical details, such as the time of the song and its track number, which could and do already go on the article for the album, as well as tour details like how often it was played, if at all, which really should go on the article for the specific tour. If this info is taken out since it's already in those articles, all you're left with is a sub-stub.</li>
<li>I'd like it if this whole song thing didn't devolve into <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">WP:POKEMON</a>.</li>
<li>And finally, "The Hero's Return" is not unremembered. It happens to be a favorite song of mine. &#160;:-)</li>

<p>I'm a bit mixed on this one. According to the guideline at <a href="../../../s/i/n/WP%7ESINGLE_146b.html" title="WP:SINGLE">WP:SINGLE</a>, if a song meets one of the criteria, "it may border on notability". This may meet the seventh, "has been the subject of a music video that played on a major music network". There was a music video (I've seen screenshots <a href="http://www.shakiragallery.com/thumbnails.php?album=103" class="external text" title="http://www.shakiragallery.com/thumbnails.php?album=103" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but there's not much information about it, and I don't know if it was played on a major music network or not. Plus, the guideline is still only proposed. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 09:16, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Delete</b> I think that defense is kind of ridiculous, Jpaulm. People don't get put on wikipedia because someone they know is famous. I'm sure there are thousands of people out there who are spouses of, friends of, or acquaintaces of, famous people. That doesn't make them notable in their own right. Google search of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Barbara+mckenzie-smith%22&amp;start=0" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Barbara+mckenzie-smith%22&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow">"Barbara Mckenzie-smith"</a> returns 18 hits, and I think all of them are just copies of this wikipedia article.</dd>
<dd>Even supposing that her fame "by association" was justification for it's own article (I don't believe it is), We'd need evidence for all of these relationships from an actual external source. But it's irrelevant, because just because I might happen to be the husband of a barely notable radio personality, the friend of Leonard Nimoy, and a very active member of greenpeace, doesn't mean I'm notable. I could work all day in an artist's association, marry or befriend all the famous people I want, but it wouldn't necessarily make me of any interest. -<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonk_of_the_highest_order_d058.html" title="User:Monk of the highest order"><font color="navy">Monk of the highest order</font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/o/n/User_talk%7EMonk_of_the_highest_order_6566.html" title="User talk:Monk of the highest order">(t)</a></sup> 19:15, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>You mean it asserts notability by claiming stating that the "1938 FIFA World Cup in France is still remembered by Polish fans of this sport as the one in which Poland national football team debuted"? You have to be kidding me. Well, for all I can say, Sweden-England on Ullevi in 2004 is still remembered by Swedish fans as the 100 year jubilee match of the Swedish FA. And Germany-Sweden in this year's World Cup is still remembered by Swedish fans at the match where Sweden were eliminated. But I wouldn't even consider creating articles on those matches as there are hundreds of matches "remembered by x fans as the match which y". That doesn't mean the match itself is notable. –&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a><small>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a>&#160;•</small> 12:02, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The notability derives from the fact this is the match "in which Poland national football team debuted". It isn't really relevant who remembers which games as what, but the fact remains that this was the national team's first game. This raises the notability of the match above most other first round matches and should qualify this subject for an article. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcscott_e3f9.html" title="User:Ccscott">Ccscott</a> 14:02, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ccsott, we have, as said, 78 teams that have played a "first game" in the World Cup final tournaments. We have something like &gt;200 national teams that have played a "first game" of any kind. A "first game" is not notable unless something unusual happened. –&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a><small>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a>&#160;•</small> 14:13, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am a little out of my element in this subject, but if the rule is that a single match should have an article if it is more notable than most matches I think this should qualify. The debut of a nation at a World Cup event is a relative rare event (78 of the almost 700 games played is not very much). Further, a quick google search reveals this match has been noted by many. It was named the top match in World Cup history by William Hill Sportsbook[<a href="http://www.world-cup-bets.com/world-cup-matches.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.world-cup-bets.com/world-cup-matches.php" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>] and is described as "one of the greatest games of all time" on the official FIFA website[<a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/pwc/1938.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/pwc/1938.html" rel="nofollow">[62]</a>]. Is this the most notable match in FIFA history? No, but If the standard is that the game has to be more notable than most, I think this match qualifies to have its own article. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcscott_e3f9.html" title="User:Ccscott">Ccscott</a> 16:25, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is just something I do not understand. You people are more than happy to delete my article while you stick to your stuff, thinking that what matters to an Englishman or a Swede also matters to everybody else. Mister <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a> writes in his wiki-works e.g. about the year 1904 in Swedish football league, but here he states that Wikipedia is not ESPN or "Wikipedia is not a news service, be it old news". Hypocrisy, isn't it?
<ul>
<li>Disregarding the borderline personal attacks, I wonder how you fail to understand the difference between a seasonal summary (such as <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904_in_Swedish_football_ee11.html" title="1904 in Swedish football">1904 in Swedish football</a>), and a summary one match of one day of the year? And I don't understand in which way the comment is relevant to this AfD. –&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a><small>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a>&#160;•</small> 12:02, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The span of time does not matter. Your works on seasons in Swedish soccer are just about same as my works on the 1938 game. How about ESPN stuff you mentioned before? (<a href="../../../t/y/m/User%7ETymek_221e.html" title="User:Tymek">Tymek</a> 16:28, 18 December 2006 (UTC))</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Someone stated that Poland vs. Brazil 1938 was not "more notable than any other match in the World Cup", adding that <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Bramall_Lane_0a74.html" title="Battle of Bramall Lane">Battle of Bramall Lane</a> or <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_v_United_States_%281950%29_88db.html" title="England v United States (1950)">England v United States (1950)</a> made a bigger impact on football history. Let me just ask - what impact did these games have? They are only remembered in England,just like the 1938 game is remembered in Poland. Or in other words - how can you judge from global point of view, which of these games was more important? It is impossible obviously. The 1938 game was unusual because of its emotions and 4 goals scored by Wilimowski, which had never happened before.
<ul>
<li>They're only remembered in England? No? Anyone with an interrest in football history remembers or has heard about when the US beat England 1–0. I also heard about the Battle of Bramall Lane back in 2002. Still you're using a straw man. You can't say "we have an article on x, so why shouldn't we have an article on y". This discussion is about the notability of the 1938 match, not any other match. –&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a><small>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a>&#160;•</small> 12:02, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I would not argue. Surely England - USA game is remembered, but was it a crucial game from global point of view? About Battle of Bramall - ask someone in Brazil which game they know and the answer is obvious, I also never heard of this game (using your reasoning). I wonder how you fail to understand that English-language Wikipedia is for all English speakers all over the world, not only those in England or Sweden (<a href="../../../t/y/m/User%7ETymek_221e.html" title="User:Tymek">Tymek</a> 16:28, 18 December 2006 (UTC)).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Also - say, there is an article about some 1967 game New Zealand vs Fiji. This game may seem unimportant to Swedes or the English, but what if it is very important to the New Zealanders? Think fora while before you try to destroy somebody elses' work. Soccer is not only about games in England and 1911 season in Sweden
<ul>
<li>I won't even comment this. You are obviusly way too emotionally involved in "your article" to discuss this matter in a reasonable way. –&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a><small>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a>&#160;•</small> 12:02, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why you don't comment on this? Surely I am involved in it, because it is part of my works on soccer in interwar Poland. Anyway, you miss one point - there will always be someone who wants to know the champion of Sweden in 1904 and there will always be someone who wants to know more about the 1938 Poland - Brazil game. You gave me no reasonable answers, claiming "straw man" or stating that I am too emotional. In other words - there are no reasons for deleting this article (<a href="../../../t/y/m/User%7ETymek_221e.html" title="User:Tymek">Tymek</a> 16:28, 18 December 2006 (UTC)).</li>

<li><b>delete</b> - Sephiroth isn't hard! all you have to do is.... ok yeah, it's indiscriminate and OR, and there's no way that people will ever be satisfied with the inclusion criteria. Also, many games have multiple bosses, and challanging games will have multiple challanging bosses, without restrictions to genre or platform I think I can say without hyperbole that this list could have a hundred thousand items on it easily if it were sufficiently inclusive. Also, a quick reading reveals a significant content bias towards modern (IE playstation and later) games probably unintended by the author. I think my reaction as a (well, fairly) rational editor thinking "wait, you forgot Kefka!" shows how rapidly this could balloon and get unmaintainable. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 18:52, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>That you think it was created for Pan Turkism is your opinion, i dont think the article implies that all. It is a noteworthy list of states with a Turkic heritage and it does have academic footing, for example see Hugh Pope, 2005. Sons of the Conquerors: The Rise of the Turkic World or Carter Vaughn Findley, 2004.

<li><b>Keep</b> bad faith nomination following many edit-wars in Turkic-Persian articles. There is nothing in there for "pan-Turkist" propaganda, the comparison with "Aryan states and empires" is childish, in bad-faith and not academic. <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_peoples.html" title="Turkic peoples">Turkic peoples</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_languages.html" title="Turkic languages">Turkic languages</a> articles exist. This is not a template either. There is nothing wrong with such a list, there are many states that have been considered "Turkic" for many major academic works. I woud like to remind that, even though many editors tried to argue until the sky turned green how the usage of the word "Aryan" in the English language has definitely shifted from the anthropological definition, this has not gotten through to some people. "Turkic" has never suffered such a degeneration. The comparision is baseless: there is no such article Aryan peoples, nor are there serious academic sources that advocate such categorization. However, there are articles such as <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_peoples.html" title="Iranian peoples">Iranian peoples</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_peoples.html" title="Turkic peoples">Turkic peoples</a> The case here is similar to "Hellenic empires" or "Hellenic states". There is a similar article at <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellenistic_civilization.html" title="Hellenistic civilization">Hellenistic civilization</a>. Many of those states listed have been categorized as "Turkic" by major academic sources over the centuries. Extremely bad-faith nomination and unencyclopedic behavior. The actual countries listed have also been listed as "Turkic" by major academic and news organizations. If editors would take a close look at the article, they will see that arguments center on 5-6 states of 14th century Central Asia that have been listed, with arguments such as "Turkic-speaking, but not of origin" or "Turkic origin, but not of culture". That is not the basis for the article's deletion.<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 16:24, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Tajik, you have been blocked countless times for edit warring and incivility on a wide range of Turkic-Persian articles, so please spare others the accusations of disruption. <i>Many</i> of those states have been called Turkic for centuries by major academic sources. There is nothing wrong with creating an article for states that have been founded by slavic peoples either. If it hasn't been done, that's not our concern. Please stop accusing others of racism. Criteria for AfDs is not the same as TfDs, and I would like to remind you that template Turkic speaking easily survived a TfD, and a template Semitic speaking also exists. This article is a simple grouping of states that have been founded by Turkic peoples over the ages. Your concerns center on 5-6 states in the list, and that with arguments such as "turkic origin, but not turkic speaking" or "turkic-speaking, but not of turkic-origin". Please take these disputes to the article's talk page. Maybe you should have gone to that Royal Academy of Arts exhibition I mentioned earlier&#160;:) I easily addressed another non-academic allegation that Pejman made about the three dynasties, so this shows what a bad faith nomination this is.<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 01:38, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

This article, however, is another attempt of Turkish nationalists to infiltrate Wikipedia with their POV. The article would be totally correct if it were only limitted to the present Turkic states, with a small notification that these nations also include large numbers of NOn-Turkic minorities (Russians, Kurds, etc). But this article is POV because it tries to establish the biased claim that these nations are "Turkic by nature". It also contains a totally POV section about history - of course the way Pan-Turkists want history to look like. All kinds of historical kingdoms and states - some of them still a big myth (<a href="../../../h/u/n/Huns.html" title="Huns">Huns</a>), some of them not really Turkic (<a href="../../../k/h/w/Khwarezm_Shahs_378e.html" title="Khwarezm Shahs">Khwarezm Shahs</a>, <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghaznavids.html" title="Ghaznavids">Ghaznavids</a>) - are claimed as <i>Turkic states</i>, and the confusing intro does not justify ANYTHING. <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">Tājik</a> 20:54, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again, FALSE... First of all, it is normal that there only the slavic states in Europe, since there have never been slavic states in Africa. If there were, I am sure the title of the article would have been modified to take that into account. This article also lists only the Turkic states in Eurasia, since there haven't been any Turkic states in South America. Secundo, this article lists current Turkic states, and those that have been defunct in 20th century to begin with, and then gives another list of states since the Gokturks. <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavic_Europe_030b.html" title="Slavic Europe">Slavic Europe</a> does a similar thing, there are also the mentions of "Mongol invasion", "Ottoman invasion", "Holy Roman Empire", "Austria-Hungarian Empire", "Imperial Russia" in the article. Stop using the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chewbacca_defense.html" title="Chewbacca defense">chewbacca defense</a> and please stop trying to confuse other editors in to believing non-truths. The article's format is very similar to other similar articles. If you think that the article's history section could be better formatted, please raise those objections in its talk page. Personally, I would also prefer it to be extended so that it is not a simple list, but there are no editors that work on this article 24h a day, so give them a break. Of the whole list, your only objections center on 5-6 entities, and that only on grounds of "Turkic-speaking, but not of origin", or "Turkic-origin, but not of culture". They can all be addressed using the talk page. Some editors, including you, have been working to extend the history section so that it is more informative. So what is the problem? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 21:27, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again wrong.. The chewbacca defense at work again. <b>Russia is already listed</b>. Did you take a look at the article? The fact that Russia is transcontinental is not our business. As for Kazakhstan, its inclusion concerns the editors of that page, that's a content dispute more appropriate to its talk page. I would like to remind you that there are only "seven" nation-states that are listed there? There is no sick pan-turkic propaganda, otherwise Russia, Germany, Bulgaria, Greece, Iraq, Iran etc would have been included as well. There is no such list in this article, please stop spreading non-truths around. You first claimed that there was no such list, it was proven to be wrong. Than you said it was only for modern states, that was also proven to be wrong, since there are mentions of states of 13th century.

<li><b>Comment</b> - This isn't really about the content of the site, in fact the site looks very well done. The problem is the lack of assertion of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> for inclusion in Wikipedia. You can imagine why this would become a problem. If any website could just have an article on Wikipedia it would be impossible to make sure things were accurate (as it is things are very hard). Ironically, it seems the best way for torrent sites to gain notability is to get sued&#160;:/... That said, it seems that many other torrent sites have articles on wikipedia...

<li><b>Keep Running</b> I think it is interesting that this site is the only site on the internet that is ipod format exclusive. There isn't any non-video d/ls available, and all of the movies are mp4. Another interesting point about the site is that many of the ipod videos are optimized only for the ipod, (it will look grainy on a computer screen or tv screen, but great on the ipod) whereas the iTunes ipod offerings are made to be put on a bigger screen as well as on the ipod. -----<a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokyogirl79_9288.html" title="User:Tokyogirl79">Tokyogirl79</a> 5:07 am 12/19/2006</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep Running</b> To answer the claim that iPodNova is not notable, I have to absolutely disagree. I came to it after seeing torrents from it on both Torrentspy AND Mininova, and I have since moved all my upload/download traffic exclusively to iPodNova, AND I have donated money to a site that has constantly and consistently been improving since I joined in April of 2006. To answer the negative comments about Google search results...I have to say that I don't know what search term was used, but when I entered "iPodNova", the very first result was iPodNova.net". The site is now at <a href="http://www.iPodNova.tv" class="external free" title="http://www.iPodNova.tv" rel="nofollow">http://www.iPodNova.tv</a> and I actually changed the links to reflect that (the site crashed and was down for a few days recently). The previous link that was available (www.ipodnova.net) wasn't correct, since it was actually <a href="http://ipodnova.net" class="external free" title="http://ipodnova.net" rel="nofollow">http://ipodnova.net</a> (no www. before it). And, some person changed the membership information here on wikipedia from factually accurate information to factually inaccurate information. This has been corrected today, and hopefully will remain as is. I think a site that has well over 100,000 users, and is steadily growing, gets such positive feedback in the forums from its users, provides so much help to its users, and provides a variety of content that is not found anywhere else, specifically created for iPods...but that can be viewed with or without an iPod, deserves credit for being notable, and not criticism. It is still less than a year old, I believe, and the growth has been amazing. It is a MUCH better site than isohunt (which, in my opinion, absolutely sucks) and Torrentspy. It is well done all around, and this article should be allowed to remain, as it provides information on a valuable and useful resource, and a torrent index site that is better than others out there. Finally, I would never have signed up here at wikipedia if I hadn't seen this article linked on the forums over on iPodNova.tv JDRR22</li>

<dd>As I said in the article's talk page, it is clear that a lot of work has been done to this article. It's too late to consider deletion. Thousands of other articles may meet the AfD criteria in this way, and they should be deleted before this, since this has more work in.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Notability is in the eye of the beholder - there are thousands of articles about places many have never heard of. Furthermore, as for sources, give it a week and it should pick up.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't mean to sound over-the-top here, but someone has taken the time to write this article, fairly well I must say, and the deletionist attitude being presented here is not justified by naming guidelines all over the alphabet. I don't see the harm in leaving the article on Wikipedia. There are stubs that don't even approach the detail of this article, and yet they are left alone, with no calls to delete them. Yes, there are lines that must be <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">upheld</a>, however, this article is well within bounds. Furthermore, this article is not on a controversial issue, and to put it under the same scrutiny as a more controversial article is ludicrous. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Jay_e6f4.html" title="User:Master Jay"><font style="background:black"><b><font color="white">Jay</font></b></font></a><b><font style="background:gold">(<a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Jay_a66f.html" title="User talk:Master Jay">Reply</a>)</font></b> 23:18, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Now, Jay, you're an <i>admin</i>, you know this just isn't true. Lots of long articles about school, churches, etc. that aren't controversial, get deleted all the time, on exactly the basis I brought up.

(BTW, <a href="http://www.pgm.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.pgm.org/" rel="nofollow">Pacific Garden Mission</a> probably ought to have an article, coming up with at least a dozen media cites for that should be a snap).

As for the Pacific Garden Mission, make an article for it—no one is stopping you; the "this topic doesn't have an article" argument is probably just as ignored. Has it ever occurred to you that WP has grown to 1.5+M articles because small topics (such as this) have articles written about them?

<li>Here's one for you, sound familiar? <i>For clarification, I won't generally break any rules. If a job needs to get done, there is a way it can be done without breaking the rules, if it is a legit job.</i> I don't see any extraordinary circumstances here demanding IAR, if there are any, what are they? AAMOF, I think PGM does deserve an article, although I'm not much on writing articles on religous stuff, if no one beats me to it, I will do it at some point (after all, it's in Chicago) I just happened to mention PGM tangentially as something that needs an article, not as an argument for or against deletion of this one. <i>You</i> might like an article on every rescue mission in the country, but at this point, the notability guidelines don't support that, and (Jesus, tautology) as I pointed out before, similar non-notable religious organizations are getting zapped - sometimes <i>en masse</i> - now you want to suggest that a whole <i>series</i> of articles on <i>rescue missions</i> would be apropo for WP? Yeah, I could use a break from AfD's.. OTOH, God made many different kinds of Wikipedians, some like discussing AfD's, others want to create in-depth Pokemon articles. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 07:30, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>"I will do it..." is the same good intention that the new user had when writing this article; unfortunately, they had to get a taste of the good ol' wikiprocess. All I will say is that no one is stopping you from creating any article; <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">go ahead</a> (hopefully you won't find yourself here&#160;;). As for my mentioning of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">IAR</a>, it was to illustrate a point that any essay, guideline, etc. that can be brought up as "case law" in this matter can easily be contradicted by another policy or guideline (and I really don't see what you're trying to get at by quoting my RfA - <i>administrator rules</i> are very different from <i>article guidelines</i>—the subject of this debate.)

<li><a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Articles" title="WP:CSD">CSD A7</a>; not even close. You are mistaking <i>notability</i> for <i>popularity</i> - two different things. If this article were to say simply, "LMR gives food to the homeless", I would have speedied it when I originally came across it. However, the article clearly mentions how LMR is involved with <a href="../../../l/i/m/Lima%2C_Ohio_59f5.html" title="Lima, Ohio">Lima, Ohio</a>, and furthermore, how it is apart of the global city mission movement—that is what makes it notable. The fact that it has never been on CNN or that it doesn't have 500,000 search engine results (indicative of <i>popularity</i>) does not mean that the subject is not notable. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Jay_e6f4.html" title="User:Master Jay"><font style="background:black"><b><font color="white">Jay</font></b></font></a><b><font style="background:gold">(<a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Jay_a66f.html" title="User talk:Master Jay">Reply</a>)</font></b> 04:15, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>
<ul>
<li>The notability guidelines are pretty clear. The subject of <i>this</i> article doesn't even assert a claim to meeting even one of them. If it <i>did</i>, I'm sure you'd have brought it up by now. So tagged. 07:30, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The sub-argument here is on whether or not the article should have been removed per CSD—it shouldn't have, and this was addressed in my previous comment (further upheld by LS). You have solid points on everything else in this debate (which ironically is much longer than the article in question), however, your CSD claim should be put to rest. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Jay_e6f4.html" title="User:Master Jay"><font style="background:black"><b><font color="white">Jay</font></b></font></a><b><font style="background:gold">(<a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Jay_a66f.html" title="User talk:Master Jay">Reply</a>)</font></b> 15:59, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>
<ul>
<li>Why do you have such an issue with <i>this</i> article? After you tagged you noted "No notability asserted, just another rescue mission". Why don't you go tag other rescue mission articles then? Some of them don't even list any references at all, and they all contain similar information to this article. So why aren't those being disputed? 208.10.0.114 08:36, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> Any organization that's existed for 100 years gets a sort of "special attention," from me. We can obviously verify that this group exists, and that it has had an impact on its community. I see here that the AfD regulars seem to be leaning to delete -- I can sort've see both sides of the picture, personally, but I do worry that sometimes we get too "jaded" (after deleting 100 articles under prod, I know I get a bit deletionist). A7 certainly wouldn't be appropriate, for this one, and even AfD, I'm not so sure. I notice this one hasn't been closed, yet -- it's a <i>very</i> close call to make, and I'd encourage the closing admin to think it over carefully. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 01:10, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The subject seems to be a very location within the pokemon video game series. I can understand including pokemon and pokemon-trivia on wikipedia, but this is a little ridiculous.

<p>Ok, as per what I posted in <a href="../../../i/t/v/Talk%7EITV_f83e.html#ITV:_Time_for_a_reorganisation" title="Talk:ITV">Talk:ITV</a>, a week ago I think it is time for a reorganisation of articles about ITV. This one stands out in particular as something I beleive action is needed about.</p>
<p>In the first instance I think we need to consider whether this article is encyclopedic at all, IMHO it isnt really do we have an article like this for every broadcaster in the world?</p>
<p>If it is encyclopedic, we then need to consider the correctness of the article. It seems to get lost in a large amount of confusion on here of the distinction between the ITV network*, ITV plc**, and ITV 1***. The article is entitled <b>ITV Network</b> continuity announcers. However, AFAICT stv and UTV have their own branding and continuity? In which case the article would be better entitled "ITV 1 continuity announcers" or given that it discusses the other ITV plc channels "ITV plc continuity announcers".</p>
<p>* A network of broadcasting franchises.</p>
<p>** A company owning 11 of the 17 franchises (15 regional, 1 breakfast, and 1 Teletext)</p>
<p>*** A brand name used by 12 of the 15 regions</p>

<p>Well, I don't have that much to do with ITV Network Continuity Announcers, I only moved the content from ITV1 Network Continuity Announcers to that page. I personally think it should be deleted, as it doesn't have much point to it. I also think ITV pages need a clean up, but I think the ITV1 article should stay.<a href="../../../g/m/c/User%7EGMc_d393.html" title="User:GMc"><font color="#0099FF"><b>G</b>Mc</font></a><sup><a href="../../../g/m/c/User_talk%7EGMc_5713.html" title="User talk:GMc"><b><font color="#0099FF"><b>talk</b></font></b></a></sup> 00:30, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Speedy deleted in September as A7, re-created almost immediately by the same editor with what looks like the same content, tagged today as G11 (blatant spam). Not sure about thet, but I don't see any credible evidence of notability or of non-trivial independent sources. Plenty of spammy-looking weblinks, not much in the way of wikilinks (in or out). <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 19:36, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> One of the few things I've actually heard of, besides the World Cup match, on AfD. On the other hand, I am a connoisseur of hoaxes and conspiracy theories, in addition to being an artist, and I can't quite figure out why it is so familiar. My local news stations seems not to have heard of the country <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saudi_Arabia_53d2.html" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> so I'm not sure that that rates very high. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 19:57, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There is no connection to any business. For people in the Pheonix area, anything north of the Mogollon Rim often is not covered by the metropolitan's media sources, so any arts community must seem surprise. Most of the people on the list don't watch television, let alone have one. However, in the Verde Valley, specifically Sedona, the local, non-gallery art scene is expanding rapidly as stories covered by two other newspapers: <i><a href="http://verdeindependent.1upsoftware.com/main.asp?SectionID=19&amp;TM=52608/" class="external text" title="http://verdeindependent.1upsoftware.com/main.asp?SectionID=19&amp;TM=52608/" rel="nofollow">Verde Independent</a></i> and <i><a href="http://redrockreview.com/index.html/" class="external text" title="http://redrockreview.com/index.html/" rel="nofollow">The Red Rock Review</a></i> and a <a href="http://www.sedona.tv/?socccc/" class="external text" title="http://www.sedona.tv/?socccc/" rel="nofollow">Sedona TV 16</a>, a public access channel for local residents.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This seems a bit <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> to me, and the newsletter coverage seems to back this up. The real reason for my&#160;!vote is the fact that the article cites no "multiple third-party reliable sources" verifying any of the info in it, nor as a measure of notability. In addition the article is crufty in the extreme (cruft == high level of detail inappropriate for an encyclopedic "arm's length" treatment of the subject in question). <b><a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid"><font color="red">Zun</font></a><a href="../../../z/u/n/User_talk%7EZunaid_e4f9.html" title="User talk:Zunaid"><font color="green">aid</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zunaid_cf3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zunaid"><font color="blue">©</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Zunaid_7c6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Zunaid"><font color="orange"><sup>Please rate me at Editor Review!</sup></font></a></b> 14:58, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>An article on an individual bus route is trivial – <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscrimate collection of information</a>. Also, it is not individually <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>; its online references are essentially limited to the bus company which operates it and the system to which it belongs. Besides that, as far as I'm aware, there is no precedent for such articles on Wikipedia, although there are lists of collective bus route series. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 19:45, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is a rather new list. Give us a chance to work on it, and suggest constructive changes instead. It is only a list article, not an encyclipedic article. It is not subjective, since it has well-defined criteria. If you wan't to delete a list article, plese refer to a formal Wikipedia criteria for that. Longhairadmirer 20:54, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, it doesn't have well defined criteria. It doesn't really have criteria, the mere title of the article is almost enough for deletion. This is not useful, not encyclipedia, which you just admitted. If you look at the upper left hand corner you see "Wikipedia The Free <b>Encyclopedia</b>."

<li><b>Keep</b>. The criteria is simply "Famous women with waist length hair or longer". Famous mean that they must fulfill <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I don't see the subjectivity. This is a list article, meaning that is lists encyclopedic articles. A list article may refer to a main article, which in this case seemes to be the article about <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair_fetishism.html" title="Hair fetishism">hair fetishism</a>. There is a large interest for this list, since many men adore women who decide to have long hair.

<li>So, are you stating that Wikipedia exists for any or all fetishes? This isn't a use of promotion for some guy to click links. It's acceptable to have an article about the fetish, but this is subjective to define "long" and just keep any maintance. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font><font color="red">sox</font></a> 21:25, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, in addition to the arguments raised above, this is not a defining characteristic, which makes this merely a random list of random people who happen (for whatever unknown reasons) to have one trivial point of commonality.

<li><b>Arguments for keeping the article</b>:
<ul>
<li>No strong argument for deleting it has been presented above.</li>
<li>This information is not compiled anywhere on the internet, but is spread over various long hair fetshism publications, discussion groups, etc. In some cases modelling agencies and similar state hair length in terms like "very long" or "long", but without a clearly defined criterion. Thus, it is not simply list cruft described in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>.</li>
<li>The criterion is well-defined, and can be verified from photos, and in many cases form long hair fetishist publiciations. We have removed couple of articles that do not fulfill the requirements. No discussion has been raised about this, proofing that this is not an issue. Thus it fulfills <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.</li>
<li>Two similar list articles were created a year ago, but with less well-defined criteria. One of them was deleted. If this article is deleted, it will probably be created over and over again by other people than me.</li>
<li>The talk page of the article has the character of a WikiProject page, with a to-do list of articles about famous people that should be created. So the page will contribute to Wikipedia biographic articles!</li>

<p>Student organizations at one particular university are rarely notable, and this one is not. An attempt to have the article redirected to the university page and a paragraph added to that page has been repeatedly rejected by the original author, therefore this AfD nomination. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 20:19, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear "Zoe", I don't appreciate your very biased opinion at all and would prefer for you to keep it to youself rather than deleting other peoples hardwork and valid contributions. LJMU-ISOC may be very hard to notice from your part of the world but in Liverpool UK it is one of the most active and dynamic student societies. I would advice you to redirect yourself and your efforts for a more humane purpose rather than deleting and redirecting Islamic Society articles. We will get official Wikipedia clarification concerning the repeated abuse from seemingly Islamophobic quasi-editors.

<li><b>Keep/Merge</b> 1) It's an animation/comic book, its source is in its title (W.I.T.C.H.) 2)WP:OR usually requires conclusions, findings or opinions, pointing out the difference between two formats isn't WP:OR 3) Precedent (for example <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadow_Realm_%28Yu-Gi-Oh%21%29_4b5a.html" title="Shadow Realm (Yu-Gi-Oh!)">Shadow Realm (Yu-Gi-Oh!)</a>).

<li><b>Delete/Merge</b> A section in the animated series's article should be enough to touch on the major differences. The minor differences are not worth mentioning.

<dd>Personally, I don't think that a list differences require a third party source. You don't need a third party source to say that x "has black hair" in the comic, or that X "has brown hair" in the cartoon, the franchise name is enough, so why do you need a third party source to say that X has "black hair in the comic but brown hair in the cartoon"? <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerfectblue97_ef11.html" title="User:Perfectblue97">perfectblue</a> 07:30, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Addendum: from your nom: <b>Delete this for the good of Wikipedia</b>; this presumes that you know better than many, many, many, many other users, admins, and bureaucrats what is "good for Wikipedia". This is strikingly similar to the argument used <s>in the 80's</s> re: pornography; "I know it when I see it". While you are perfectly within your rights to have a subjective opinion about what is "good for Wikipedia", I'll thank you not to use that as part of a nomination to delete an article. An article should not be deleted for such a subjective reason.

<li><b>Keep</b> The word is used even in non-computer/gamer related culture (TV shows and the like) and, while I'm pressed for time and can't look right now, there are probably some sources. What are we going to delete next, pwned? Yes, the article needs some fixing, but that doesn't mean that it needs deleting.

<p>This is one of the many Survivor contestant articles where the person really isn't notable.

<p><s>*<b>Hold-On</b>. We are now only two days from the finalle, and the declaration of the winner.

If either of them wins, that will make a major change in their notability status. It does not make much sense to me to close either or both of these AFDs and delete the articles when in only two days there may be a dramatic shift in the notability situation for one of them. If these AFDs are closed and one of them wins, then the article will need to be recreated within days of it's deletion. If the AFDs can be held from closing for just a couple more days, we can avoid that situation and know for sure if one of them is the winner. I'm not arguing that these articles are premature, and if these AFDs were being held a few weeks back I would have said to torch the articles. But at this point, this close to the end, if the AFDs can just stay open for a couple more days.... - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 18:19, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<p>This article, created by <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">User:Striver</a> is a quote farm and a content fork of a section in the existing article <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Qurayza_16f3.html" title="Banu Qurayza">Banu Qurayza</a>. Splitting a daughter article from <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Qurayza_16f3.html" title="Banu Qurayza">Banu Qurayza</a> is unnecessary, as the article is only about 26KB long, but it contains pretty much all the necessary material about its subject. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 21:30, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. This is a POV fork designed to get around ongoing content disputes at the main article. Its main purpose appears to be to excuse the killing of the Banu Qurayza men by erroneously asserting that the massacre was conducted according to Jewish law; at best, this is a fringe theory unsupported by the extant sources. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 21:36, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Qurayza_16f3.html" title="Banu Qurayza">Banu Qurayza</a> is the article of a tribe, this is the article about a notable event that the tribe underwent. The tribe is notable for many things other than this event, including its pre Islamic history and the events that occurred before the siege. When the article was created, i had worked to expand the siege part of the article, and my addition, including the previously large amount of text that was there ended up in the siege part of the article taking over 2/3 of the entire article. At the time of the split, no material was removed, it was not an attempt to dodge any consensus of any kind. On the contrary, this very siege has been a hot topic for long and has several times ended in the lock down of the entire tribe article. Considering the highly controversial and notable nature of this siege, it is nothing more than normal procedure to give it it's own article. Remember that this is not "the X perspecite of the Seige" or anything, it is just <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_the_Banu_Qurayza_bdb0.html" title="Siege of the Banu Qurayza">Siege of the Banu Qurayza</a>, a NPOV and accurate name of a event deserving a article that devotes full attention to it. Other precedence can be seen in the article <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khaybar.html" title="Khaybar">Khaybar</a> and the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Khaybar_e1e4.html" title="Battle of Khaybar">Battle of Khaybar</a>. It is true that the content of both this and the original article are in dispute, but the split was not done to dodge or evade any consensus, on the contrary, this article has been prominently linked to from the main article and a section describing it has been introduced. But without giving any good reason, a part of the editors have refused the split of this highly notable event and want it confined to one single article. I have invited them to expand the article on this event, but they have refused to do so, and now is one of them trying to get ridd of the article, claiming it is a "POV Fork". My question is: How can an article about a battle be a POV fork of an article about a tribe? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 21:49, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Oh, btw, regarding content dispute, i again urge you to edit the article. Some editor undertook himself to rewrite the siege section, but did it on the main page and choose to ignore the article devoted to the siege. On the talk page, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABanu_Qurayza&amp;diff=94915087&amp;oldid=94891007" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABanu_Qurayza&amp;diff=94915087&amp;oldid=94891007" rel="nofollow">i commended him for bringing more material</a>, but also asked him why he deleted other views that existed on that article while doing so. Now that the main article has dramatically changed its POV, this article is accused of having the other POV, something that was never intended. right now, i am working to incorporate that new material to this article. The effort is on having a ALL POV article, and doing so in detail would end up giving one aspect of the tribes history undue weight and overshadow the rest of it's history. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 21:55, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your use of "Undue weight" is totally inapposite here.

<dd>Yes, and that includes much more than this notable but single event.

<li><b>Delete</b> Since all we know about the Banu Qurayza consists of their fatal interaction with the Muslim community at Medina, as reported by Islamic sources (which makes what we "know" rather nebulous), taking this out of the article and leaving a shell with nothing in it is contra-indicated. The title of the new article is also misleading, since the meat of the dispute is 1) the events leading to the siege, and the credibility of the reasons given for it and 2) the aftermath of the siege, the killing of the adult male Banu Qurayza. The title "Banu Qurayza" is truly NPOV, since it takes no position on the morality of the conflict and its conclusion.

<dd>Sure, lets rename the Battle+aftermath article, no dispute on my side. But the fact remains that <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Qurayza_16f3.html" title="Banu Qurayza">Banu Qurayza</a> is the name of a tribe that lived for several hundred years, and having a tribe article consisting of 2/3 about a single event is not neutral in it self, quoting <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue weight</a>.

<dd>That is because Moshe is deleting everything new i add, and then people argue "pov Fork". That is not honest. Original content will not appear just as with any other historical account, but secondary sources are plentifully and the subject of the article is so controversial that there is no risk of running out of information, we have after all access to 1400 years of scholarly comments.

<li>Khaybar is a place about which much can be written outside of the battle. Moreover, the "Battle of Khaybar" is well known as a distinct event. The Banu Qurayza are a tribe, not a place; moreover, they are a tribe about whom virtually nothing is known beyond the fact that they were massacred. There is no comparison between the two. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 15:33, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Minor webgame with the prod removed for the reason <i>article is factually correct and not advertising</i>. The game scores about <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22World+Rugby+Manager%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22World+Rugby+Manager%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">seven</a> Google hits. I don't believe the material is either <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">independently</a> <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> or that it meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">inclusion criteria</a>, regardless of whether or not it is factually correct or advertising. <a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 21:31, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I didn't write the original article but fixed it up a little to be factually correct. This may be a minor game when compared to visitor numbers across some other catagories/sports, but in its area does well as a google search for <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=rugby+manager+games&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=rugby+manager+games&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">rugby manager games</a> shows by placing it in 5th place as the highest web based game in the genre. A game not being huge does not mean that it is not relevent to those interested in the subject area, and surely wikipedia exists to cover the relevent information or options in any sensible genre? 21:48, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not entirely, Wikipedia exists as an encyclopedia of material that needs to meet two criteria:
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verification</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable third party sources</a></li>
<li>Material that meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">notability</a> criteria.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Right now, neither of these appear to be met- I could make a game to simulate being a <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netball.html" title="Netball">Netball</a> manager, and it would certainly be the top hit seeing as it would be unique, but it still wouldn't get an article because it doesn't meet the two criteria. Having a high Google rank in its own category doesn't address the lack of sources. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 22:13, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK, no big deal. I'd spent a while trying to find a game like this so thought others might be interested, thats all. I found several other similar sized games on here that I'd enjoyed so thought I'd help out by fixing up the description of this one. I'm not sure the netball analogy is relevent though as netball is a niche sport played by high school girls and watched by nobody except their family, while Rugby is one of the most popular sports in many countries including Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa, France, Wales, Ireland, Scotland and more recently Romania and Italy. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Grandad80 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandad80_66bb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandad80">contribs</a>) 12:13, 18 December 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<p>The result was <b>Delete, unless cleaned up.</b> While Vashti's comment below is well-reasoned, there are flaws within it. First and foremost, copyright laws of the United Kingdom are not so much a concern to the Wikimedia Foundation as are copyright laws of the United States, where most of the Wikimedia servers are hosted. Also, the non-commercial aspect of fair use is one that we should be reluctant to breach; the goal of Wikipedia is to be a free encyclopedia, and non-commercial images and articles are contrary to that goal. Finally, judging how much fair use is allowed is a tough call to make. An argument could be made that one solitary image of an ident encompasses a majority (or even 100%) of the ident's content, as frame-by-frame, little change occurs in many idents (particularly early 1950's/1960's still idents).</p>
<p>Because Wikiwoohoo has offered to rewrite the articles after the new year, I won't delete the articles at this time. What I'm doing instead is removing the images for the time being, until the entire article can be re-written. If it's not done within a reasonable amount of time (three weeks or so), I'll delete them entirely. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 03:59, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I do this with a heavy heart, but these ident pages fail <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIR_1f27.html" title="WP:FAIR">WP:FAIR</a> with the large number of irrelevant images to the articles, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>. My greatest concern is with the large number of images on all of these pages, which could land Wikipedia in a lot of bother, as they are not covered by fair use. Anything that can be should be merged into the relevant channel article, but I think it is the time for all these articles to go. Wikipedia is not <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_Ark_5464.html" title="TV Ark">TV Ark</a> or <a href="http://www.thetvroom.com" class="external text" title="http://www.thetvroom.com" rel="nofollow">The TV Room</a>, which I feel are more appropriate places for ident information and articles like these.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - There are a lot of images but they should come under fair use - they're all relevant to information given on the page, they're all low-res still images and as the BBC and E4 don't sell their idents its impossible to cause them any financial loss. I disagree with the idea that there are more appropriate places for this information. This is an encylopedia of knowledge. We can't remove information from it just because people can find it somewhere else, what's the point in that? ~~ <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeteb16_cdfa.html" title="User:Peteb16">Peteb16</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - some of these images (e.g. <a href="../../../i/t/v/Image%7EItv-beach.jpg_9d38.html" title="Image:Itv-beach.jpg">Image:Itv-beach.jpg</a>) are hardly low res. I have reservations as to the legality of the current use, but I am not sure on the legal standing, if anyone can confirm the legal status my vote becomes delete. However, I do think some action is needed, I cant see the point of images such as Image:ITVNC Ceased broadcasting.jpg and I think these articles in many cases would be better folded into the channel they are talking about e.g. ITV1 stuff goes to <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV1_cc0b.html" title="ITV1">ITV1</a> <a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPit-yacker_4192.html" title="User:Pit-yacker">Pit-yacker</a> 00:07, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I don't agree that the articles fail those sections at all. Section 3 - The pictures are there for illustrative purposes, to illustrate the idents. Are you seriously suggesting that someone might pirate a video sequence from one still of it? Would you prefer that, rather than having an image to illustrate each ident, that the articles carried descriptive paragraphs? "A picture is worth a thousand words".</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Section 5 - This is a matter of opinion. Personally, I think these articles are encyclopaedic.</dd>
<dd>Section 8 - The images are not decorative - they "identify the subject of the article" in the most literal sense! The articles document the various series of idents, and as such, I feel that they make a very significant contribution to it. As for the absence of a fair use rationale on the images, that's not a reason to delete the articles, that's a reason to add the rationale to the image pages. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVashti_aa77.html" title="User:Vashti">Vashti</a> 09:13, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep all</b> as per above. I suggest that one still from each ident is far below the legal threshold for fair use - isn't it something like 4% or 10% of the total? The images illustrate the content of the articles and are not just lists of pictures, nor do they replace the channel's use of idents. There is no free alternative, the material is previously published, and I do consider these summaries to be encyclopaedic and of historical interest. <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright_law_of_the_United_Kingdom_64c6.html" title="Copyright law of the United Kingdom">Copyright law of the United Kingdom</a> states <i>"s29.—(1) Fair dealing with a literary, dramatic, musical … for the purposes of research for a non-commercial purpose does not infringe any copyright in the work provided it is accompanied by a sufficient acknowledgement …"</i> - Wikipedia is surely non-commercial research?

<li><b>Comment</b> For Wikipedians unfamiliar with British network television, since the style of a range of different striking images/animations/scenes for idents instead than one or two standard idents was pioneered by BBC 2 in the 1990s (which oddly barely gets a mention in these pages), this has been a common ident pattern for network TV channels in the UK. These ident schemes (effectively a form of advertising) can be expected to change substantially every few years. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:55, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Please don't delete</b>. I diagree strongly with this nomination on the grounds that since a lot of work to include correct facts has gone on, the articles are no longer simply collections of images. The separate articles regarding BBC One idents document was has effectively become a part of British culture. To delete these would be incorrect, certainly The TV Room to name one presentation website does a similar job to the BBC television idents article, but in my opinion, the article is better; it goes into much more detail and the images help to illustrate the facts put out, rather than simply being collections of similar images. I woul very much recommend the articles are not deleted, but if necessary, the amount of images trimmed and more relevant text added. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwoohoo_4afe.html" title="User:Wikiwoohoo">Wikiwoohoo</a> 17:41, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep ITV Idents and Presentation</b>, unlike the BBC ident articles the images shown are mostly captures by myself, and are not taken from other websites, so therefore are not found elsewhere on the web. On the ground of there being other sites in existences like 'The TV Room' or 'TV Ark', these sites are run by small teams or individuals and thus are not particularly frequently updated.

<dd>Just something to bear in mind.

Television presentation should be given a mention on Wikipedia (I have edited some of the BBC articles myself), but admittedly the articles are extensive and probably do not come under "fair use".

<li>"2. Has had a charted hit on any national music chart." This criterion is documented in the article, under the singles section.

<li>"A good online resource for music and musicians is the All Music Guide (<a href="http://www.allmusic.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.allmusic.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.allmusic.com/</a>), which gives a level of indication as to what a band or musician has done."

<p>When you're old and you hear some young kids having a conversation along the lines of:</p>
<p>Young Kid 1 - "Got my first Budchievement last week." Young Kid 2 - "That's great man...congrats! How was it?" Young Kid 1 - "I can't remember." Young Kid 2 - "Ahhhh, that really is a Budchievement!"</p>
<p>you can have a silent chuckle thinking about how you helped that to happen.</p>
<p>Save Budchievement, save the world.</p>
