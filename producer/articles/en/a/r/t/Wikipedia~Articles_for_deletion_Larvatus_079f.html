<dd>843 hits in Google (did you discount Wikipedia mirrors?) is not much for a supposedly well-known Internet activist. For example, usually all university professors who have written even few papers get that many hits and we don't think they are notable based on that alone. I think pretty much everyone here agrees that <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archimedes_Plutonium_ac8f.html" title="Archimedes Plutonium">Archimedes Plutonium</a> deserves his own page as a notable eccentric, but let me present this as a precedent: Edmond Wollmann gets 864 Google hits and is known among many Usenet participants as the winner of the not-so-prestigious "Kook of the Millenium" award by the alt.usenet.kooks crew. Yet his article was deleted because of lacking fame, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Edmond_Wollmann_5181.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Edmond Wollmann">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Edmond Wollmann</a>. <a href="../../../j/n/i/User%7EJni_807c.html" title="User:Jni">jni</a> 12:09, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It is helpful to search for the right thing. The Google Groups search is far more relevant to <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">Usenet</a> personae than its Web counterpart. (The latter reflects mainly the hits for my Alonzo Church <i>Festschrift</i>, my LiveJournal entries, and postings on privately maintained specialty web sites.) Thus we get 11,300 postings signed or referencing "michael zeleny" (<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22michael+zeleny%22&amp;start=0&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;filter=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22michael+zeleny%22&amp;start=0&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) plus 9,730 mostly distinct postings signed or referencing "mikhail zeleny" (<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22mikhail+zeleny%22&amp;start=0&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;num=100&amp;filter=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22mikhail+zeleny%22&amp;start=0&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;num=100&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). Not too shabby for painstakingly handcrafted messages. For comparison, a notorious spammer claims a lower total of 17,700 postings signed or referencing "<a href="../../../s/e/r/Serdar_Argic_12f5.html" title="Serdar Argic">Serdar Argic</a>" (<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22serdar+argic%22&amp;start=0&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;num=100&amp;filter=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22serdar+argic%22&amp;start=0&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;num=100&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>). <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarvatus_255c.html" title="User:Larvatus">Larvatus</a> 12:43, 16 December 2005 (UTC)larvatus</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> given the number of hits in Google and Yahoo (more hits than Google), and given that these hits bring up a large number of articles from countries other than the US, it would seem that Zeleny is suitably well-known to retain the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm a usenetter and I remember encountering Zelenys' postings. He was well known - even imfamous - in his day.

One small thing - I would remove the comment "He is not known to have grown up" from the article - it doesn't add anything to the article, which gives a fairly good summary of Zelenys' personality. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutarch_18bf.html" title="User:Autarch">Autarch</a> 14:53, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> I nominated the article for speedy deletion in the first place, and I contend that it was appropriate to do so on the basis that it is a vanity page and not notable. Michael wrote the article himself and added himself to the <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">Usenet</a> page. The first paragraph of the Larvatus article says: <i>Zeleny is a Usenetter known for lumpen-intellectual net postures, an absurdly pedantic sense of humor .... extravagant litigiousness, and nothing else of real consequence.</i> Is there any way to interpret this other than a self-definition of "not notable"? <a href="../../../t/w/p/User%7ETwp_3cd5.html" title="User:Twp">Tim Pierce</a> 19:49, 14 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As a side note I will add this: I don't bear Mikhail any ill will and am kind of amused to see thirteen-year-old flamewars dredged up in this context. I nominated this biography for deletion because it seems to be a profound violation of Wikipedia guidelines. The fact that he, or I, spent a lot of time flaming each other on Usenet is not a reason for either of us to have a biography to ourselves, and I would be quite happy if both of them were deleted. <a href="../../../t/w/p/User%7ETwp_3cd5.html" title="User:Twp">Tim Pierce</a> 19:49, 14 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think this issue has very much to do with your happiness, Tim. For better or worse, both of us have contributed to Usenet culture. Other people have recognized our contributions as notable or notorious. Since then, Usenet has been recognized as a legitimate subject for social (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0818677066/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0818677066/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>) and technical (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1852335327/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1852335327/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>) study.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I will not affect a neutral position in this debate. The relevant part of my partisan views worth advancing in this context is the lasting value of the Usenet culture. In this connection, I shall make three points. <b>1.</b> The idea of a reliable information medium and resource emerging from an open, self-correcting Internet forum has its unique origin in the Usenet. Wikipedia is a natural development of its precedent. Among many subcultures that deserve to be commemorated herein, Usenet stands out in its affinity to the forces and interests responsible for enabling this commemoration. We are history in its making. Let the record show this. <b>2.</b> Wikipedia <i>thrives</i> on unabashed promotion of personal and partisan agenda, prominently incorporating <i>self-promotion</i>. Encyclopaedic neutrality is not an attitude suitable for elective adoption by any single individual, but a painstaking product of innumerable individual conflicts. I am far from the best authority on applying stylistic guidelines to my own case. If it is judged worthy of preservation by the Wikipedia community in virtue of its substance, others can attend to its style much better than I. Otherwise, its stylistic faults are immaterial. <b>3.</b> As to the question of this or that subject being worthy of encyclopaedic mention or commemoration, it is seldom subject to definitive contemporaneous adjudication. This is particularly obvious in matters of culture, where popular success in one's lifetime affords no guarantee of lasting influence. <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van_Gogh_78b2.html" title="Van Gogh">Van Gogh</a> lived out his life as an obscure, parasitic non-entity, while <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bouguereau.html" title="Bouguereau">Bouguereau</a> basked in the loftiest honors and highest wages doled out to any artist. Our culture is impoverished by the shortage of contemporary records pertaining to social failures redeemed by posthumous acclaim. This lack is nowise compensated by the profusion of testimonials amassed in their lifetimes by the practitioners of officially certified arts. Storage is cheap. Memory is valuable. Make our memories matter. <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarvatus_255c.html" title="User:Larvatus">Larvatus</a> 23:46, 14 December 2005 (UTC)larvatus</li>

<li>That strikes me as an excellent example of appropriate deletion criteria, actually. I think that Godwin's Law makes Mike Godwin a significant figure in the history of Usenet because the Godwin's Law meme became so widespread. So I think Godwin qualifies as notable but that neither McElwaine, Archimedes Plutonium, nor Wednesday do (and, for the record, I count myself as a personal friend of Wednesday's). If someone wants to put a list of my contributions to Usenet in an article, fine; if the Wikipedia community doesn't think that's notable and wants to delete it, that's also fine. Looking at the Larvatus autobiography I don't see any explanation of why you're a notable person, what notable contributions you have made to Usenet, or why "Larvatus" is a notable name. I'm sorry, old foe -- I think it's clearly a vanity page. <a href="../../../t/w/p/User%7ETwp_3cd5.html" title="User:Twp">Tim Pierce</a> 17:12, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The category in question is not concerned solely, or even primarily, with technical or structural contributions to the Usenet. Over the past fourteen years, I have attempted to contribute to its style and content. Whether or not one judges that to be notable or notorious, depends on his metric of note. Several people have credited my efforts in philosophical debate (<a href="http://rideau.carleton.ca/philosophy/cusjp/v16/n1/cohen.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://rideau.carleton.ca/philosophy/cusjp/v16/n1/cohen.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>), agonistic banter (<a href="http://www.20six.fr/Phersu/archive/2003/10/29/1fb2nhjd1hlj.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.20six.fr/Phersu/archive/2003/10/29/1fb2nhjd1hlj.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>), and antagonistic persiflage (<a href="http://david.shackelford.org/?p=108" class="external autonumber" title="http://david.shackelford.org/?p=108" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>). I even claim having taken his breath away from yonder exemplary Usenet persona, <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Godwin_f7e2.html" title="Mike Godwin">Mike Godwin</a> (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.books/msg/e53db071eaf293c5?hl=en&amp;" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.books/msg/e53db071eaf293c5?hl=en&amp;" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>). Prior to the collation of old Usenet posts by Google, my generous fans regaled me with my own archive (<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22zeleny+archive%22&amp;start=0&amp;hl=en&amp;filter=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22zeleny+archive%22&amp;start=0&amp;hl=en&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>). Elsewhere, I have published a well-received scholarly book (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=zeleny+anderson+alonzo+church&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;filter=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=zeleny+anderson+alonzo+church&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>) and purged a publicly traded company of its child molesting founder (<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/larvatus/29125.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.livejournal.com/users/larvatus/29125.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>). Again, anyone is welcome to find all of this perfectly negligible. But the determination of notable or notorious character of Usenet personae is not entirely up to any given individual. In the present instance, I submit that other Usenetters have gone on record attesting to my contributions in a sufficient number and adequate manner. Likewise, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, as regards <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Pierce_1c58.html" title="Tim Pierce">Tim Pierce</a>'s track record of purging improperly created "alt." newsgroups. <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarvatus_255c.html" title="User:Larvatus">Larvatus</a> 19:50, 15 December 2005 (UTC)larvatus</li>

<li>As for "prolific output and longevity," merely posting on usenet for years does not give you the right to a wikipedia page. The only question is whether this person is notable, and as far as I can see, his main accomplishment has been causing some alleged rapist to leave the USA. Not quite enough if you ask me...--<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierremenard_b03f.html" title="User:Pierremenard">Pierremenard</a>

<li>Setting aside the point that the alleged rapist is worth $100M, and his flight from the U.S. leaves a $1B publicly traded company rudderless, I agree with your objections. Hence my attempt to sum up my dubious discursive accomplishments. For whatever it's worth, I have my small but solid Usenet constituency. The category wherein I fit myself for our present purposes is that of Usenet people. For obvious reasons, it cannot comprise a <i>Who is Who</i>. But neither should it be restricted to a handful of "movers and shakers", even if anything of that sort could be reliably identified. We are documenting the emergence of a new culture, and its progressive and spastic refinement and retrenchment. This task calls for a great deal of tolerance. <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarvatus_255c.html" title="User:Larvatus">Larvatus</a> 22:17, 15 December 2005 (UTC)larvatus</li>

<li>The claim that this is a vanity page does matter, yes. See <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_guidelines_9511.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity guidelines">Wikipedia:Vanity_guidelines</a>. You make some arguments above that you are notable in the Wikipedia sense, but you're hurting your own case by being such an advocate. If a dispassionate person were to write the article, and make some effort to cite sources that are "<a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">credible, neutral and independent</a>", it would go down a little easier. As it is, it looks like Mikhail Zeleny primarily wants to keep the Legend of Mikhail Zeleny alive via Wikipedia. But what if said neutral person should edit this down, per Tim Pierce, and focus on the actual, verifiable sources of notability (as opposed to his failure to live up to his early mathematical promise, unverifiable allegations of teenaged "civil disobedience" in Dzerzhinsky Square, and the claim that his former girlfriend is married to Blixa Bargeld, which must be close to the very essence of grasping for notability)? When you expunge the unverifiable (claims to have named the Free Software Foundation), self-regarding ("attack philosopher"), and self-aggrandizing from the article, you are left with the facts that (1) he once sparred with some people who are <i>genuinely</i> notable for their achievements on Usenet, (2) he was given the thankless task, with which grad students are so often burdened, of assembling some papers in honor of his teacher, to be published in a volume likely read mainly by library cataloguers (Amazon rank 2,438,004!), and (3) he <b>publicized</b> his girlfriend's allegations of abuse by her father (slightly different than "purging" a company of him)---a decade and a half ago! Self-authored comparisons to Van Gogh notwithstanding, in other words, a non-notable person distinguished mainly by his desire to promote himself on the internet.

<li>One notable advantage of acknowledged autobiographies is the assumption of personal responsibility for their claims.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Zeleny (Larvatus) reached the highest level of USENET notability for non-crackpots. All of the following are verifiable evidence of USENET notability, and if Zeleny is not a notable USENET personage, who else could possibly qualify for the honor? Within USENET, Zeleny made the Net Legends FAQ and (unfairly, but whatever) the USENET Kooks list. Off the net, his discussions with Godwin made the Wall Street Journal, some English-lit professor tried to have him banned for discourse alleged to be harmful to her students, as did an Australian philosophy professor he had made a fool of. Zeleny's postings got Richard Stallman to post personally in misc.gnu.discuss. Tushar Samant created a Zeleny Archive, long before the days of weblogs. Again, all preceding facts are a matter of public record. Few posters were as prolific in as many newsgroups, or as well-known short of being a USENET founder or uber-admin (e.g. Gene Spafford, Steve Bellovin). This is a no-brainer: keep the entry.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Zeleny's significance is rather dramatically quantified by the fact that he is the only Usenet poster, out of several hundred thousand, to have ever had an unsolicited third-party archive created and devoted solely to his postings. The archive was formed by Tushar Samant in early May of 1998 (see threads in rec.arts.books with "Zeleny Archive On-Line" in the title) and initially contained 980 of Zeleny's articles. The archive was created on the basis of the high intellectual and rhetorical level of Zeleny's postings; as far as I can remember all other repositories of specific individuals' postings were just mockery of crackpots, as with (e.g.) Plutonium or McElwaine.

<li><b>Comment</b> The current Wikipedia entries do not adequately convey Usenet's importance or Zeleny's status within "the Net", which as of the mid-1990's simply meant the Usenet. Usenet as a technology (let alone a subculture) was of comparable import to the WWW, ARPANET or Sendmail, and of greater import than BitNet or Wikipedia. Some of the customs and innovations now taken for granted, especially the multiply-indented interlinear reply format (stacks of "&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"), were developed on Usenet. Zeleny was exceptional for (1) the number of long and high-signal postings (not just one-liners, in-jokes, flames, mutual adoration, XOXO and other material typical of high-volume posters); (2) the number of sources, often recherche, cited or quoted in his postings; (3) the number of excellent translations of sources that he posted in the course of discussions; (4) the extent to which he used and treated Usenet as a scholarly and archival medium, including full quotation of the history-to-date and comprehensive interlinear reply within each posting; (5) the level of erudition displayed and complexity of vocabulary deployed (many people at the time remarked on both of these points); (7) the number of phrases and expressions coined, often as trenchant witticisms within a serious analysis of some text or issue; (8) the number and diverse range of newsgroups in which he was a leading or notable personality; (9) the number and extent of the episodes where his postings had effects beyond the Usenet, such as the Wall Street Journal coverage of his Internet dispute with Mike Godwin. Godwin is remembered in the Wikipedia for the phrase "Godwin's Law", but he also introduced the term "Zelenites" for Zeleny's fellow travellers on the Usenet. I don't know of many, or any, other Usenet personalities who were notable enough to earn a similar coinage. User:Sqwik</li>
