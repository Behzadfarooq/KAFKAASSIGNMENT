<ul>
<li><i>Do you want to move it to Birth of Kingston Rossdale?</i> What part of "isn't all that notable, even to magazines like <i>People</i> or <i>Hello!</i>" did you manage to overlook? It wasn't all that long a clause, really.</li>
<li><i>And how many sources would I need to present to demonstrate notability here? At what point would you agree with me that he's notable?</i> Probably about the time you present a source demonstrating he's done something more notable than gurgling and pooping. Of course, if you have any sources for notable gurgling and/or notable pooping, I'll accept that, too. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 07:53, 8 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't have any sources about him doing anything notable, but I've already made the argument (as I always do in these cases—we had a fuss over Britney's baby, I think his was deleted, but JFK's prematurely deceased baby was kept) that notability is assigned and doesn't necessarily have anything to do with accomplishments or actions. If people <i>think</i> the baby is notable—and that can be demonstrated by public interest manifested in the press—then he's notable regardless of anything else. I'm not interested in what this newborn has accomplished, but rather in how many people are aware that Gwen was pregnant and that she recently gave birth. And I think there's a pretty big number. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:10, 8 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>I've already made the argument...that notability is assigned and doesn't necessarily have anything to do with accomplishments or actions.</i> Which was, as I pointed out, irrelevant, but I guess you missed <i>that</i>, too.</li>
<li><i>I'm not interested in what this newborn has accomplished, but rather in how many people are aware that Gwen was pregnant and that she recently gave birth.</i> So this is the logical place for information on Gwen Stefani's pregnancy, as opposed to, say <b>the actual article on Gwen Stefani</b>? (<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airplane_%28film%29.html" title="Airplane (film)">"No... That's just what they'll be expecting us to do!"</a>) Besides, who's going to look this name up? The only articles it links from is from the parents's articles -- and if you're coming from there, <b>you already know everything that's in -- or could be in -- the article</b>. Meaning it's, well, worthless, unless you want to add in the information about the notable gurgling and/or notable pooping.

<dd>That is a good point. I would argue it is not possible to compare a Countess with a singer's baby, not even if she is the Queen of Pop, because the Countess has a RL nobility title.&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 16:26, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If we're going for notability, though, I'm sure that more people have heard about Gwen Stephani's baby than some random Countess in the Netherlands. That would be even more true if we were to talk about some other celebrity kids' pages that have been redirected, like <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Preston_Federline_5125.html" title="Sean Preston Federline">Sean Preston Federline</a>, or <a href="../../../s/u/r/Suri_Cruise_64f5.html" title="Suri Cruise">Suri Cruise</a>. In both cases, the only "notable" thing the kids did was be born to really famous parents - exactly what qualifies the Countess. (Don't get me wrong - I'm in favour of <b>deletion</b>, I just don't see the point of indiscriminately collecting articles about non-notable members of the royalty.)

<dd>Not that I like medieval titles that were left behind by most countries in the world, mind you. However, it is my belief that, by using the 100 year ahead test, there are more chances for a dutch to have heard about the Countess (as she may be included in history books due her affiliation with the Crown, minimun as it is) than the baby of a famous singer (which may very well discover an AIDS treatment in the future). I don't like nobility titles, but if determined countries still use them, it is because they believe in them (if not the people, the government). -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 17:08, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Anytime someone's article includes the phrase <i>"nth in line to the throne"</i> where n is in single digits, it's pretty guaranteed that person's entry gets kept, rightly or wrongly.
