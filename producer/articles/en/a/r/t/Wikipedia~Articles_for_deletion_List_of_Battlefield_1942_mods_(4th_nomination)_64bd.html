<p>This has been nominated at least three times previous; in the time since, it has not improved, only gotten littered with cleanup tags. As I see it, fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and is comprised basically of links to other sites- linkspam, anyone? The whole premise of it existing- <i>which spawned one of the largest modding communities in the history of gaming</i> - is unsourced and entirely POV. Looking through wikipedia, I find few other modding pages for any other video game, even those with mods up the wazoo- Warcraft III, Counterstrike, etc. The few I find are confined to <i>one</i> mod, such as <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garry%27s_Mod_2f9d.html" title="Garry's Mod">Garry's Mod</a>. We should put this article out of its misery, or let it be transwikied to somewhere else- but not here! <font color="#FF9900"><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Fuchs_e635.html" title="User:David Fuchs"><b>Dåvid ƒuchs</b></a></font> (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Fuchs_fab2.html" title="User talk:David Fuchs">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Fuchs_d754.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Fuchs">contribs</a>) 20:15, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Game magazines tend to mention the most notable mods, and I'm fairly sure that with some research, independent and verifiable sources can be found asserting the notability of mods. However, the nomination concerns the <i>list</i> of mods, not the notability of each individual mod.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> For starters, the CNN article <i>War games see sales spike</i>, the Tech TV X-Play review of 1942 mods. I would point out though, it need only have wide recognition within the Gaming community to avoid NN- something it has is spades as well. Various mods regularly appearing in industry magazines such as <i>PC Gamer</i> in addition IGN and other online web sources results in more notability and recognition then many commerical titles. <a href="../../../b/f/e/User%7EBfelite_e603.html" title="User:Bfelite">Bfelite</a> 16:03, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>And the reason this hasn't been put into the article at any point in the last 8 months is? And notability isn't automatically extended to every mod living and dead for this agme just because a few of them got reviewed.

<dd>My point, however, is that it has <i>not</i> improved, even with all these AfDs. Unless all of the mods can be sourced for notability, and are going to be, they should be deleted. So far, despite the large amounts of time since the last AfD, little has been done to improve. Saying 'we'll fix it' doesn't fit in this case. <font color="#FF9900"><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Fuchs_e635.html" title="User:David Fuchs"><b>Dåvid ƒuchs</b></a></font> (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Fuchs_fab2.html" title="User talk:David Fuchs">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Fuchs_d754.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Fuchs">contribs</a>) 23:22, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It really hasn't been a large amount of time since the last AFD, especially considering that there are 21,000 other articles tagged for cleanup too. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 06:59, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, but it HAS been a significant amount since the AfD before that. No work was done, despite the copy and paste 'Keep and clean-up' votes. Guess what? No cleaning up happened from June (the time of the AfD) to December, the time of the last AfD. Then lo and behold, at the last AfD, the same people who said 'keep and clean up' then disappeared never to be seen turned up! Can you guess what they said? Correct! They said 'keep and clean up!'. Can you guess what happened after the AfD dissolved into a trainwreck of non-consensus? Why, absolutely NO clean-up work was done once again. And this in spite of numerous people claiming there are multiple sources of notability. So here we are, 3 non-consensus AfDs later, into our 4th one, and the article is STILL exactly the same as it was the time of the 1st AfD. Any questions? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 15:15, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Its not exactly the same, there are more references establishing notability, such as <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2003/03/25/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://money.cnn.com/2003/03/25/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for instance. <a href="../../../b/f/e/User%7EBfelite_e603.html" title="User:Bfelite">Bfelite</a> 15:41, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It's easy to see exactly how much the article has changed.

Perhaps this is not a satisfactory pace for you, but it's certainly not "exactlty the same" (some reliable sources have been added, for instance) and it is fast enough progress for me. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 16:10, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Fine, lets nit-pick over a word. Geez. The point was that at no point in the last 8-9 months was enough work done on the article to address the issues raised at an AfD, and as a result is nominated again relatively quickly. The fact that the article was nominated 4 times in less than a year should be considered a teeny-tiny hint that the article must have some major failings that aren't being addressed. But if you would rather argue over my using a word in slightly the wrong situation instead of trying to address major failings in the article, that's fine by me. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 16:40, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I do think it's important to rebut some of your exaggerated comments on this AFD. It is unfair to claim the lack of editing on the article to support your position that it will never be fixed, when in fact editing has been done. I don't think the insertion of at least three first-rate sources (CNN, Washington Times, PC Gamer) is insignificant, so your exaggeration is more than slight. For the second point, you're right: Four nominations (note: only by three distinct editors) suggest that some wikipedians have a problem with the article (and I do believe it needs more work still). But on the other side of the coin, the keep arguments by editors in good standing along with the work done on the article since its first nominations should suggest that other wikipedians do not believe those problems are insurmountable. That should be taken into account as well. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 18:11, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per Scottie theNerd and RockMFR, plus was nominated too recently anyway. Constant renominations is just stupid. Battlefield 1942 mods are undoubted notable (not all though obviously, but then again it doesn't even come close to listing all of them), after look and see for yourself that a heap of the mods even have their own pages! <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 13:18, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, just took a second read through the nominator's reasons for deletion (not that I really needed too, for an obvious case of keep like this article I knew they would be wrong!). Anyway... I came across something which was so <i>funny</i>, the nominator makes references to not finding lists of mods for even big famous games such as Counter-Strike!! gee, I wonder why that is?! Could it be because Counter-Strike is itself a mod! (though of course it has some mods itself, just obviously the scope and number of mods that would exist for a mod is vastly limited compared to otherwise) It always disturbs me a little whenever somebody tries to nominate for deletion something that would be controversial (as this obviously is as it has survived several times before) while at the same time showing a complete lack of knowledge of the subject area. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 13:26, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: It <i>is</i> possible to "mod" a mod. While Counter-Strike isn't a particularly good example, <i>Desert Combat</i> for BF1942 has been expanded further by certain communities to form mods like <i>Desert Combat Extended</i>. You said it yourself: even <i>Counter-Strike</i> has mods. I don't see why you're slamming someone for having a "complete lack of knowledge" when you admitted that it's feasible at the same time. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 14:37, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Sorry sorry, I did go ever so slightly over the top in my comment.

<li><s><b>Strong Delete</b></s> (See below) - Once again we reach this point due to ne'er-do-wells swanning in, saying 'keep and clean' and disappearing with no intention of doing any clean-up work themseleves, and only returning to the article when it's nominated for deletion again to make there cut-and-paste point again. (In fact I see several familiar names who have voted keep and clean on numerous articles and then ****ed off without doing the work, only to appear later and vote to keep an article that has no work done on it.) This article has been in this state for NEARLY A ****ING YEAR! How much time does this article need for all the vast wealth of sources the keep voters claim exists to be included in it? Face it, no-one gives a damn about improving this article because it is what it is: A directory of links designed to advertise, and as such is completely unencyslopedic and uncleanable. In 6 months time, this unedited article will just get nominated yet again, and the whole wretched process begins again. Does this article serve Wikipedias interests? No. Does it serve the interests of the various people who have put links to their project here? Absolutely. Stuff arguing about it's relevance in comparison to other pages or other mods. That's not the point. The point is that THIS article is essentially a steaming shit-heap that no-one is prepared to touch.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 14:02, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Links aren't sources. What we have in the article are links to homepages and links to lists of mods on other sites, but absolutely nothing establishing the notability of any of the mods. And I see no reference to CNN anywhere in the article. Once again these 'numerous' sources that establish notability appear to be as substantial as the early morning mist, and just as hard to get a hold of. Mod databases and homepages don't count as multiple non-trivial media mentions.

<li>You can't really claim that since a source is not immediately accessible to you (<i>i.e.</i> online) that it is not a valid source—<a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> of the other editors!

<ul>
<li>I'm just pointing out the problem with saying 'It was mentioned in this place' when you can't provide a copy of it to back your claim up. AGF fails here because this article was set up to neither help nor hurt wikip[edia specifically, but rather to attract people to a mods individual webpage. This article provides no ionformation on the mods, it hasn't since it's creation. All it say is if the mod is alive or not and a link to the home page, which brings us right back to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a directory of links or an advertising facility. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 16:28, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Consider this. If a user comes to Wikipedia for information, and then finds the article they are looking for in fact contains absolutely no useful information and just provides a link to an off-wiki site, somethings wrong. If users have to leave wikipedia in order to find <i>any</i> useful information about something beyond whether or not work is ongoing on it, then what is the point of wikipedia? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 16:43, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Brighterorange, all those references refer to the same mod. As much, two references one, while the other references a second.

<li><b>Comment</b> Far more then nonverifiable mods were removed. For example, <i>PC Gamer</i> mod of year winner <i>Eve of Destruction</i>, given a nationally recognized award- was removed- becase the people seem superbly ignorant about what they are editing.

<dd>Okay, as thats a slight affront to me, I feel I should respond... <i>I think it's rather offensive that you list an AFD then try to discourage discussion</i> - AfD's <b>are not votes</b>, as Wikipedia clearly states. If you'll look above, you'll find lots of <i>keep</i>s- but no reason for the keep. The point is not to say I want it to be kept per XX, but to contribute to an ongoing discussion. Secondly, to the <i>Maybe that means it deserves to stay, especially when so many people think it's a relevant topic?</i> That's certainly one way of looking at AfDs. But seeing as its been no consensus all of them, that basically means that there's a loud enough kicking and screaming faction that it can't be deleted in full conscience. I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing, but just because it survives doesn't really make its merit. Finally, to the most important part: <i>Plus I am not happy with the assertation "all the others basically just have 'was ranked....'".....basically you've just shown that you don't care what kind of evidence is shown for notability.</i> WP:NOT calls for <b>multiple, independent sources</b>- in other words, ModDB, a massive modding site, is only one. Just because its on one site doesn't make it notable (for a sort of comparison, just because a book's for sale on Amazon and has been rated does not make it notable under wikipedia guidelines). I'm glad you disclosed your vested interest; as I stated above I believe that in its thinner form it could easily be merged into the BF1942 article, but people keep on adding back in the cruft, which suggests that once again, if the AfD is no con, it will just become bloated again. A merge is more effective. Qestions/concerns, PM me. no need to clutter up the AfD unless it is directly related. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Fuchs_e635.html" title="User:David Fuchs"><b>Dåvid Fuchs</b></a> [<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Fuchs_fab2.html" title="User talk:David Fuchs">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Fuchs_d754.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Fuchs">contribs</a>] 03:08, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Per Havok, If you just agree with what someone else already said, it is perfectly reasonable and accepted practice to just say you suppor their previously stated positon. There is no need to write out a new pithy comment each time if someone has already captured well your belief on the matter.

<dd>Ok, I want to shout. "Keep and cleanup" is not a valid opinion if the article stays the way it is. If you check the article history, back in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Battlefield_1942_mods&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=2621320" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Battlefield_1942_mods&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=2621320" rel="nofollow">March 4, 2004</a> (yes, just shy of <b>3 years ago</b>) the article got a table for the mods. Do you see? The table was first created 3 years ago and since then more fields were added to the table, the table became a little more beautiful, but the article stayed in the same way, without reliable references. "Keep and clean" is not an option because nobody cared about this article. Those who voted "Keep" never cared about checking the previous versions of the article, nor helped with the clean up. They either are gamers who would object deletion of even "List of RGB colors used in Master Chief's helmet", have only edits in articles related to video games, or they were interested in the topic because they play Battlefield and want to have a quick list of mods so that they can download them. Truly speaking, if not for my complete blank of the article and <a href="../../../b/f/e/User%7EBfelite_e603.html" title="User:Bfelite">User:Bfelite</a>'s effort to find references when adding new mods, the article would have spent 3 more years in the same state. So, next time anyone says "Keep and cleanup", please stop shouting blasphemies to your Halo mates, or congratulating yourself in how many enemies you killed on the night, sit down and edit the dang article to shape. We don't need keep votes, we need people cleaning the article. Thank you.</dd>

<li><b>Comment on comment</b> The user didn't say the consensus was <i>keep</i> three times, rather that it was kept three times.

<li><b>Delete</b> (I changed my mind again) - The article is rapidly going back to how it was.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't see what you mean about "<i>..rapidly going back to how it was.</i>", the article is better now then its ever been. That an article will revert or not is not the subject of this AfD, the subject right now is verifiability, and right now it has sources for its entries.
