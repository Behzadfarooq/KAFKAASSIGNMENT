<p>Libel. Defamation. Nonsense. Identifying individuals by name and alleging irrationality without an exposition of the irrational ideas nor the logic used to claim irrationality. Content unbecoming a resource. From my web site: "when I created the recommendation for deletion, I did not sign my name to it. The next day my rationale for deletion was followed by a caption: "The preceding unsigned statement was contributed by Wyatt Ehrenfels [my IP address]." I deleted this caption, but on roughly half my visits to this page, I find the caption restored, so there's at least one person in my midst who feels my identity should be public knowledge. Fine. So let's reveal the identities of the individuals defaming the alleged kooks in the alt.usenet.kooks news group and, if we can't penetrate the identities of these anonymous sources, then as journalists, Wikipedia administrators should treat these individuals the same way journalists treat unnamed sources. Carefully. Confirm the rumors before releasing the article. If you have to release the article, withhold the identities of the alleged kooks. If you're going to reveal the identities of the alleged kooks, throw in a number of disclaimers. It's the absence of these disclaimers that undermines the neutrality of the article."</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, it will get cleaned up over time. Those that remember Usenet will remember this newsgroup. Heck, I think I was listed on it once. Ifnord 04:08, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This is a part of Usenet history.

<li>I seem to remember an earlier deletion debate on kooks. Result was that reporting on a Usenet group defaming people is okay as long as we don't do it ourselves.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Very visible usenet group.

<li>Do not keep. Remember the knock Wikipedia took in the press for the Seigenthaler incident. Just be fair. If you are going to identify individuals by name, at least have the journalistic integrity and objectivity to include a 3-4 sentence paragraph quoting the views of the individuals being summarily judged as irrational. <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.129.121.254.html" title="User:67.129.121.254">67.129.121.254</a> (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.129.121.254.html" title="User talk:67.129.121.254">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.129.121.254_9df1.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.129.121.254">contribs</a>)</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Neutrality problems are not addressed by AfD. I challenge you to find <i>anything</i> in that article that is not worded in a neutral, factual way, and discuss it on the talk page. What alt.usenet.kooks <i>itself</i> does you may well find objectionable, but the article in no way, shape or form claims that the "kook" label is appropriate to the individuals listed—of which, I'm fairly safe to claim, you are probably one. It is true, however, that the list of individuals should be restricted to notable instances (Archimedes Plutonium and Wollmann spring to mind), not just list any random recipient. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 17:01, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The Seigenthaler article was worded in a neutral, factual way as well. But the civilized world cringed at Wikipedia upon learning of this piece. What you are doing is participating in slander. And that's exactly what it is (a) in the absence of your own names and (b) in the absence of the ideas (and/or equal-time statements) of the (c) individuals named in this entry. This strikes most civilized people as dirty. The statement from the preceding contributor "I'm fairly safe to claim, you are probably one" (i.e. a kook) is just additional evidence of a lack of value neutrality. Even if you are not an administrator or co-creator (i.e. just a passer-by putting his two cents in) it still speaks volumes as to how this entry is used and to whom it appeals. No one would be interested in creating or reading this entry if it were not a defamation delivery device. <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.129.121.254.html" title="User:67.129.121.254">67.129.121.254</a> (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.129.121.254.html" title="User talk:67.129.121.254">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.129.121.254_9df1.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.129.121.254">contribs</a>)</small>
<dl>
<dd>"The statement from the preceding contributor 'I'm fairly safe to claim, you are probably one' (i.e. a kook)". No. This again highlights the misconception. I implied you were probably mentioned in the article as having been labeled a kook by the newsgroup to baldly demand the article be deleted. This in turn was based on previous experience—unsurprisingly, the vocal critics of the article in the past have been those individuals named. Whether you are actually a kook is another matter—personally I'd vote "no", since you're much too calm and rational. I still apologize for the remark, since the implications are also clear.</dd>
<dd>"No one would be interested in creating or reading this entry if it were not a defamation delivery device." Now you are the one engaging in unsupported statements, even if they don't defame anyone's character. We have many articles on notable newsgroups. That <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alt.fan.warlord.html" title="Alt.fan.warlord">alt.fan.warlord</a> is less controversial than this one is obvious, but that doesn't mean the article on this newsgroup should not exist. By that reasoning we could well claim <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alt.religion.scientology.html" title="Alt.religion.scientology">alt.religion.scientology</a> should be removed for its negative statements on Scientologists and their religion. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 18:16, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By your logic, if I heard rumors that you were a pedophile, and then I decided to devote a Web site to reporting rumors that you are a pedophile, and it ends up ranking highly in a Google search on your name, all I have to avoid culpability is claim, "I am just reporting a rumor."
