<p><b>Delete</b>. As far as I can tell, most of the content of this page is untrue (Google doesn't seem to back any of it up) and this is just a page made as a joke by some of his students. – <a href="../../../d/r/w/User%7EDrw25_6c73.html" title="User:Drw25">drw25</a> <a href="../../../d/r/w/User_talk%7EDrw25_ca31.html" title="User talk:Drw25">(talk)</a> 18:22, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Name in quotes in google does show many races participated in by the subject, but not much else. Name with any of the claims ("the curry house", "Claudia Schiffer" etc.) return no results. Appears to be hoax with just enough true information in it to give semblance of legitimacy. --<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 18:30, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Hopefully the jokesters got their jollies before this is removed. interestingly, the reference to his performance of Rach3 with the Dallas S.O. is a strangely cultivated one to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Hough_a795.html" title="Stephen Hough">Stephen Hough</a>. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 19:31, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Save</b> Keep the page! he is actually a concert pianist, i can get proof</li>
<li><b>Save</b> This is Robin Sedman-smith, The running part is true, and i am a Concert Pianist,</li>
</ul>
<p>However i was trained at the Royal Northern College, and performed rach 2 at the age of 17 with the Shrewsbury Symphony Orchestra, not the wildly exaggerated claims made by some of my students. I did help fund The Curry House, and own 40% equity in the business.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I even found that some of your student's claims were true; that's not the point, are you notable enough for inclusion in an encyclopedia? As the facts appear to fall out, I think not. Don't take that as an insult, neither am I or are most people. --<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 13:07, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Save</b> Because the article is true and he really is noteable</li>
<li><b>Save</b> I am a friend of Robin and know a lot of this information to be true (definately the part about his Curry House business)</li>
<li><b>Save</b> You people have obviously never a tasted a true CurryHouse curry.</li>
<li><b>Save</b> I've heard he actually has a hand in the making of the curries. But it's just Curryhouse folklore</li>
<li><b>Save</b> I have eaten in his CurryHouse. It was a most enjoyable meal. I would like to congratulate Mr.Smith on making such good curries. I would be interested to know the ingrediants in his curries. Perhaps one day he could cook one for me at his house?</li>
<li><b>Save</b> I, too, have had the pleasure of eating in his Curry House. However i was disappointed to find, when i went through to the kitchen to compliment the chef, that the real Smithy was not there. I've heard theories that he is actually just a myth. But I can have no qualms with Smithy, he sounds like a real nice guy.</li>
<li><b>Save</b> SAVE SMITHY!!!</li>
<li><b>Save</b>&#160;:D!</li>
<li><b>Save</b> "Smithy" as he is known to us in the cross-country world, or The Smithster, if you will, has a huge reputation and is a legend in some parts of the world. For what reason would this page be deleted? I fail to see the logic in it.</li>
<li><b>Save</b> Having forgotten about this page for a few days, it seems that</li>
</ul>
<p>Robin has quite a following. Certainly he is an impressive force at running, i have seen his photo many times in the local news papers, and on saturday night i was treated to a magnificent performance of "The Symphony for Solo Piano" by C.V<a href="../../../a/l/k/Alkan.html" title="Alkan">Alkan</a> from the Smithster, he is one of the few pianists to master this composer, well up there with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc-Andre_Hamelin_1a40.html" title="Marc-Andre Hamelin">Marc-Andre Hamelin</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Ogdon_a89a.html" title="John Ogdon">John Ogdon</a> in terms of tehnique and musicality, I really believe he is worthy of an article.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Save</b> I have also have had the pleasure of eating in his Curry House, simply georgous curries. He is an amzing cross country runner having competed in all the major cross country championships throughout the UK, so what gives you the right to delete his article? Further, he is an a talented tiddlywinks player, currently running the school tiddlywinks club at Adams' Grammar School in Shropshire, where he teaches the German language. As a friend of Robin I disagree with the deletion of this page. I was also stood with the camera crew on the set when Robin performed his stunt double for Les Battersby off Coronation Street.</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Vanity and its obvious that many of the <b>save</b> votes are done jokingly not fitting the matter of the etiquette of <a href="../../../a/f/d/AfD_0ef6.html" title="AfD">AfD</a>--<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysepsion_8adb.html" title="User:Dysepsion">† Ðy§ep§ion †</a>(<a href="../../../d/y/s/User_talk%7EDysepsion_77d7.html" title="User talk:Dysepsion">Talk</a>) 20:42, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
