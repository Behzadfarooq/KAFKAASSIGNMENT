<p><b>Declined</b>. Sorry, but as "Sean Devoy" is not a Greek name, especially not in 479 BC, I do not believe this is true. If you can provide an online source, so I can actually see it said, please do so.</p>

<p>Sean Devoy was born on November 9, 479 B.C. Born a intelligent boy was not what the the Spartans were looking for. As the Spartan slaves(the helots) out numbered the Spartans by a ratio of 5:1, the Spartans were only interested in raising strong children for war. Naturally the more intelligent students were alienated and left alone, but Devoy's intelligence would prove worthy in times of crisis. Not only was he handsome, he was cunning. Proving himself to be be quite quick in battle descisions, Devoy was a star pupil in the eyes of his teachers. Devoy grew into a cunning yet decietful man, over the next years. Devoy was appointed to a general in 461 B.C. One year before the helot revolt. When the helot revolt started in 462 B.C the Spartans requested help from the Athenians. It was General Devoy whom convinced Lykourgos, the ruler of Sparta, that accepting help from the Athenians would show great weakness in the eyes of the other city-states. This would prove to be costly for the young general, as this decline of the assistance of the Athenians led to a rivalry between the two city-states. Sean Devoy was shortly hanged for his actions, his actions in the Peloponnesian wars also contributed to his punishment.</p>

<p>Gorg-Hans Reinhardt (March 1st, 1887 to November 23rd, 1963)) was Colonel General of the Third Reich's Panzer Group 3, 3rd Panzer Army, Army Group Center and sentenced to a 15 year sentence at the Nuremburg Trials for War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity.</p>
<p>World War Two In Feburary of 1934 Reinhardt was promoted to Colonel and soon after to Major General in the German Army. For his achievements in the Polish campaign, the beginning of WWII, he was awarded the Knight's Cross and promoted to Lieutenant General. During the Polish campaign, he commanded the 4th Panzer Division, the first Division to break through the Warsaw defenses in the Siege of Warsaw. After this victory, most of the Polish forces retreated out of Warsaw, leaving only four Battalions left to defend against the incoming Divisions of Germans. After the Polish campaign, he was moved to the western front, where his raids in the Ardennen and English Channel got him promoted to General of the Armor Branch in June of 1940. After the French campaign, Reinhardt and his Division were preparing for Operation Sealion, the invasion of Great Britain. Under the command of General Rundstedt, he was to be among the first Divisions to land. However, the operation never occured.</p>
<p>in June of 1941, Reinhardt was moved to the eastern front where he took command of the XXXXI Army corps in Russia. He led attacks through Russia until Leningrad, the farthest north of any other German Commander. After being pushed back during the winter of 1941/42, he was awarded the Oak Leaves for his defensive efforts against the Russian counter-attacks. Through 1944 he led defensive fights back through Russia back to Poland and Prussia.</p>
<p>On August 16th, 1944, he became the Commander in Chief of the army group center, later known as the Army Group North. This new post consisted of all troops and defensive measures in Poland and East Prussia to prepare for the Russian attacks. He was soon relieved of command after differing opinions with Adolf Hitler. He shortly retired from all active duty in early 1945.</p>
<p>In June, 1945, Geor-Hans Reinhardt was arrested by the United States Army and tried during the Nuremburg Trials. He was found guilty War Crimes, consisting of murder and ill-treatment of POW's and Crimes Against Humanity for the murder, deporation, and hostage-taking of civilians in occupied countries after pleading not-guilty during the High Command Trials of the Nuremburg Trials. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison but released in 1852.</p>

<p>Hearst Burchard was a pirate and literary critic of Romanian/Germanic descent. Born in 1836 Burchard was the son of German-Romanian baker and underworld figure Dashiell Burchard and Sonia Fleischmann a seamstress from Burchenau. On reaching his tenth birthday Burchard ran away from home and signed aboard a British Merchant Ship as cabin boy. He spent six years working for the British merchant marine.</p>
<p>On August the 12th 1853, Burchard jumped ship in Kingston, Jamaica and fell in with the infamous Captain Lionel Scoresby with whom he worked for four years until Scoresby was murdered by his first mate in the Lancashire Run Mutiny on 1857. Here Burchard’s seafaring career ended. He travelled to Kansas where he spent some years as a fur trapper before converting to the Quaker faith in 1861. Through this faith he met and married Edna Stevens, daughter of the famous Quaker clergyman Henry Stevens.</p>
<p>In 1864 Hearst published his first book of literary criticism entitled: Romantic Poetry and the Leviticus Principle. The work suggested that poems by Byron, Shelley, Blake and Coleridge were encoded with references to ancient Hebrew laws as set down in the Book of Leviticus. This thesis was met with an enthusiastic response by the president of the Literary Gentlemen’s Book Club at Yale. Hearsch was invited to become a writer-in-residence at Yale and accepted. It was during these years that he published his work on Elizabethan poetry: The Comparative Values in Marlow, Johnson, Shakespeare and Spenser Considered. The book wasn’t as well received as his previous work and upon discovery that he had impregnated the younger daughter of the Assistant Dean of Law Melissa Pike; Hearst was dismissed from his residency.</p>
<p>Not much is known about the subsequent life of Hearst although it is known that he walked into a Boston saloon sometime in 1874, asked for whisky and shot the bartender dead when asked for payment.</p>
<p>Hearst died on the 22nd of November 1886.</p>

<p>According to believers, the <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> cover shows a group of mourners standing in front of a freshly dug grave. Around the "grave", there are several symbols, including a doll with a cracked head represents McCartney's fatal injury; a toy car on one knee and a bloody left-handed driving glove (Paul is left-handed). Within the flowers, comprising the three-stringed, left-handed guitar shape, the word "PAUL" followed by a question mark can be seen. Lastly, Paul appears to be the tallest in this picture but in real life he is not the tallest, suggesting that the person in the picture is not really him.</p>
<p>McCartney is the only person holding a wooden instrument, representing his coffin, and the instrument is the only one that is black, representing death. The instrument is a <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cor_anglais.html" title="Cor anglais">cor anglais</a>, the only instrument shown on the cover which is not used in a marching band. Paul's "true" instrument would have been the <a href="../../../t/u/b/Tuba.html" title="Tuba">tuba</a>, which is sitting unused at feet of the wax figure of Ringo. McCartney is the only person with a hand over his heart, a religious symbol for blessing the dead. There is also an open hand immediately above Paul's head. In some cultures this supposedly represents that the person is dead or about to die.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>If a mirror is laid horizontally across the words "LONELY HEARTS" on the drum on the cover of <i>Sgt. Pepper</i>, the mirror image spells "1 ONE I X HE ^ DIE". This has been interpreted by believers in two ways.</p>
<p>The first is the 1, the "ONE" and the I each represent one of the Beatles, while the "X" signals one is missing. The second interpretation is that the date of Paul's alleged death is given. In this interpretation, the "1" and "ONE" make the number 11, meaning November. The "I" and "X" are taken to represent Roman numerals making the number 9. According to this interpretation, the message is either "<a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11.html" title="September 11">11th September</a>, he died" (using the British system of writing dates) or "November 9th, he died" (In 1966 November 9th was a Wednesday, referring to how he died on a Wednesday morning at 5 o'clock) (using the American system). However, the American system was not familiar in the UK, and as the album was by a British band with a cover by a British artist (<a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Blake_%28artist%29_6eb3.html" title="Peter Blake (artist)">Peter Blake</a>), it seems unlikely the latter would have been used. Neither date systems would fit with the theory that McCartney died during the recording of <i>Sgt. Pepper's</i>—the album was recorded between December 1966 and June 1967, with an additional session in July 1967.</p>
<p>In both cases, the arrow formed between "HE" and "DIE" appears to point to Paul.</p>

<p>On the back cover of <i>Sgt. Pepper</i>, McCartney is facing backwards, supposedly because he was dead and replaced with an impostor in the photograph. Also, George Harrison is pointing to the lyric "Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins" from the song "She's Leaving Home", allegedly a reference to the day and time when Paul crashed and was killed (It should be noted that if this and the "1 ONE I X HE ^ DIE" clue are both to be considered valid, the latter clue could not refer to September 11, 1966, as that date was not a Wednesday.) The words next to McCartney's head are "Without You". Although, George Harrison is not pointing to the clue. He is actually making an "L" for the word "love". The "O" is missing as Paul is faced backwards.</p>

<p>The inside cover of the <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> album has Paul wearing an emblem on his shirt sleeve whose initials have been suggested to be "O.P.D.", for "officially pronounced dead" or "original paul dead". However, in fact it reads "O.P.P." (the second P is partly obscured by a crease), and is a badge for the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Provincial_Police_d304.html" title="Ontario Provincial Police">Ontario Provincial Police</a>.</p>

<p>Lennon's dramatisation of the demise of <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tara_Browne_affd.html" title="Tara Browne">Tara Browne</a> in the first part of "<a href="../../../a/_/d/A_Day_in_the_Life_a6f0.html" title="A Day in the Life">A Day in the Life</a>" has been suggested by some to be an account of Paul's death. According to this theory, he was driving erratically under the influence of hallucinogenic compounds ("he blew his mind out in a car") and crashed because "he didn't notice that the lights had changed." The line "They'd seen his face before" is suggested to refer to the fact that many of the witnesses of the crash knew what Paul looked like, at least <i>before</i> the alleged disfiguring accident.</p>
<p>According to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_Anthology_ccf2.html" title="The Beatles Anthology">The Beatles Anthology</a></i> book, Paul McCartney crashed his moped while riding alongside Tara Browne sometime in early 1966. This left McCartney with a cut upper lip (the scar can be seen on close examination of <i>Revolver</i>-era photos ) that encouraged him to grow a moustache to cover it.</p>
<p>The gibberish at the end of the song on the original UK <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gramophone_record.html" title="Gramophone record">LP</a> and eventual CD edition of the album, the so-called "Inner Groove", when played in reverse has been interpreted as, among other things, "Will Paul be back as <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a>?". The commonly accepted interpretation however is "We'll fuck you like a superman", as described by Paul McCartney in his biography <i>Many Years From Now</i>.</p>

<p>Paul's <i><a href="../../../f/i/x/Fixing_a_Hole_04e5.html" title="Fixing a Hole">Fixing a Hole</a></i> contains lyrics that may refer to his alleged fatal head injury: "I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in, and stops my mind from wandering", which led many believers to the conclusion that Paul's accident happened during a rainstorm. Others interpreted this line to be a reference to his fans weeping for him.</p>
<p>Paul's <i><a href="../../../l/o/v/Lovely_Rita_6e3f.html" title="Lovely Rita">Lovely Rita</a></i> contains "...I took her home, I nearly made it..." which has been interpreted as hinting to Paul's failure to reach his destination due to the crash.</p>
<p>Harrison's <i><a href="../../../w/i/t/Within_You_Without_You_e21e.html" title="Within You Without You">Within You Without You</a></i> has the lyrics "life goes on within you and without you" and what could be interpreted as the sounds of weeping near the end.</p>
<p>At the end of <a href="../../../s/g/t/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band_%28Reprise%29_755b.html" title="Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)</a>, between the drawn out lyrics, hearts and club, it sounds as if someone in the background is screaming, "Paul is dead! He's really really dead!". It is actually John asking "Paul, could you hold my guitar for me?" .</p>
<p>"Billy Shears" is the name of the lead singer for the fictional Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band that the Beatles were originally planning to "play" on the album. Though this concept was largely discarded, the end of the title track includes a lyric referring to the "one and only Billy Shears", played by <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ringo_Starr_ef1f.html" title="Ringo Starr">Ringo Starr</a>, who sings the lead vocal on the next song, "<a href="../../../w/i/t/With_a_Little_Help_from_My_Friends_b233.html" title="With a Little Help from My Friends">With a Little Help from My Friends</a>."</p>

<p>The Beatles are dressed up as four different animals on the album cover: a <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbit.html" title="Rabbit">rabbit</a>, a <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippo.html" title="Hippo">hippo</a>, a <a href="../../../b/i/r/Bird.html" title="Bird">bird</a>, and a <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walrus.html" title="Walrus">walrus</a>.

<p>When the cover is held in front of a mirror, the word "BEATLES" becomes a telephone number (often said to be 231-7438 when held in front of a mirror or 531-7438 when held upside down, but many others are suggested). Upon dialing the number, the story goes, the listener would hear the message "you're getting closer", receive information about Paul's death, win a trip to his grave, or even talk to him in the afterlife. Similar to <a href="../../../8/6/7/867-5309.html" title="867-5309">867-5309</a>, the numbers were frequently called by curiosity seekers, causing much annoyance for their actual owners.

<p>The fifth magician: The inside sleeve of the album states, "Away in the sky, beyond the clouds, live four or five magicians..." If the magicians are taken to represent The Beatles themselves, then the fifth magician could be interpreted to be Billy Campbell, Paul's replacement, if not early members <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuart_Sutcliffe_9f17.html" title="Stuart Sutcliffe">Stuart Sutcliffe</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Best_e979.html" title="Pete Best">Pete Best</a>, both of whom are often referred to as being a "<a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifth_Beatle_c388.html" title="Fifth Beatle">Fifth Beatle</a>", or more likely <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Martin_fbf9.html" title="George Martin">George Martin</a>, their producer, who is usually called "The Fifth Beatle."

<p>The booklet that accompanied <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> contains a number of scenes from the film which are suggested to contain clues.</p>
<p>The first shows McCartney dressed as an Army sergeant with a card on his desk that says "I WAS", suggested to indicate that the man WAS Paul. The card is actually the original British war poster on which the Uncle Sam "I Want You!" poster was based. Paul is also seated beneath a pair of crossed flags, as they would appear on the grave of a military serviceman.</p>
<p>Shortly after this, there is a black-and-white <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fisheye_lens.html" title="Fisheye lens">fisheye lens</a> image of a dinner party. If the viewer holds it sideways and squints, it appears to be the image of a crushed skull.</p>
<p>In a scene in the middle spread, Paul is not wearing shoes, as further alluded to on the cover of the <i><a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbey_Road_%28album%29_f735.html" title="Abbey Road (album)">Abbey Road</a></i> album. His shoes are next to Ringo's bass drum, which says "Love The 3 Beatles". The multi-exposure image of George Harrison shows a head-on car collision about to occur in the upper corner. In another page featuring a still from the dancing scene, McCartney wears a black <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnation.html" title="Carnation">carnation</a> while the other three Beatles wear red ones. Paul's explanation for this is that they had run out of red ones.</p>

<p>The George Harrison track, "Blue Jay Way", may be heard as a <a href="../../../e/u/l/Eulogy.html" title="Eulogy">eulogy</a> to Paul (with the lyrics "please don't be long, please don't you be very long, please don't be long, or I may be asleep..."). Also, some have claimed that when the chorus is played backwards, the following phrase is said, "He said 'get me out'. Paul is what is. Paul is Hare Krishna it seems. Paulie is bloody" and "Paulie got his face knocked in."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> The song is actually about George waiting for Derek Taylor to help him move into his LA home on Blue Jay Way on a foggy day.</p>

<p>According to <i>The Beatle Plot</i>, reversing this McCartney song produces the words "Why doesn't she know me...I shed the light...dead." It may also suggest "Why does she know me?".</p>

<p>The John Lennon track "<a href="../../../i/_/a/I_Am_The_Walrus_bd81.html" title="I Am The Walrus">I Am The Walrus</a>" allegedly implies that McCartney died on a "stupid bloody Tuesday"; if we are to believe that McCartney died "Wednesday morning at five o'clock", as in "<a href="../../../s/h/e/She%27s_Leaving_Home_a2da.html" title="She's Leaving Home">She's Leaving Home</a>" from <i><a href="../../../s/g/t/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band_4fdc.html" title="Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band">Sgt. Pepper</a></i>, this could translate to be Wednesday morning UK time, while it would still be Tuesday evening in the U.S. West Coast. The chant at the end of the track, played backwards, seems to reveal "Paul Is Dead, Paul Is Dead..." And when played forwards to the end, contains a portion of a <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> radio broadcast of <i><a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Lear_d511.html" title="King Lear">King Lear</a></i> which mentions, "O, untimely death!" John had simply turned on the radio while recording and the "King Lear" bit was a coincidence. Also, right at the end, if reversed a voice allegedly says, "Paul is dead, his head off lies with his spirit." In the middle of the "I Am The Walrus" music video, John seems to point at something in the road. As everyone looks, you see Paul nodding his head when he sees, then you see a white car (possibly an Aston Martin) driving by 3 stone walls.</p>

<p>Some believers have interpreted what is generally agreed to be Lennon saying "<a href="../../../c/r/a/Cranberry_sauce.html" title="Cranberry sauce">cranberry sauce</a>" at 3:55 into "<a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawberry_Fields_Forever_0a7f.html" title="Strawberry Fields Forever">Strawberry Fields Forever</a>" to in fact be "I Buried Paul". In his book <i>Summer of Love</i>, producer <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Martin_fbf9.html" title="George Martin">George Martin</a> confirms John was indeed saying "Cranberry Sauce, my mother made it for me." Lennon has also gone on record via radio shows to confirm he said "cranberry sauce." <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_Anthology_ccf2.html" title="The Beatles Anthology">The Beatles Anthology</a> Volume 2</i> CD, as well as some bootlegs, includes alternate takes of the song which also confirm this.</p>

<p>The North End Connections are a musical group, call them rap if you want... but they are just a bunch of natives, singing songs about how drunk, dirty and stupid natives are. They are from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, native central.</p>
<p>Their name comes from the area of town that most dirty natives come from, the North End, the shittiest part of Winnipeg, besides Transcona.</p>
<p>Their most popular song is "The RCMP always chases me", it talks about the every day activities of a stinky native, huffin gas, robbin shit, curb stompin white kids, shaking babies and so forth.</p>
<p>If you want to hear this hilarity go on Limewire and search them up, songs are; "the RCMP always chases me", "Imtermission" and "100 natives runnin".</p>

<p>Componematizing is the gerund form of the word componematize. To componematize means to break a vector into its simple and separate x and y components. This term was originated by a Mr. Matthew Harmon, a highly respectable physicist who currently teaches at Los Alamitos High School in Los Alamitos, California. He coied the term while trying to come up with simple lingo with which to explain to his eager students how to solve the challenging physics problems that are presented in class. Componematizing helps in all mechanics problems (as well as other areas of study) of physics such as projectile motion problems, ballistic pendulum challenges, and questions involving forces and/or torque. It has proved very effective in the explaining as well as understanding of all problems in a physics course which may include components of vectors.</p>

Historic Olympic Airways virtual / TAE virtual is a new virtual airlines which fills the gap for virtual pilots who wish to fly vintage aircraft and routes used by Olympic Airways &amp; TAE from the company's beginnings in 1957 up to today, utilizing all the decommisioned aircraft.</p>
<p>As a virtual pilot flying for HOAv / TAE, you will be able to fly classic turboprop and airliners of yester-years, along with island hopping light aircraft. Here is a small list of the aircraft available for use:</p>
<p><br />
Fairchild 24 (TAE) DeHavilland DH82a Tiger Moth (TAE) Junkers 52 (TAE) Douglas DC-3 / DC-4 (TAE / Olympic) Douglas DC-6 NAMC YS-11A DeHavilland DH106 Comet 4B Boeing 707-3xx / 720 / 727 / 737-2xx / 747-2xx Airbus A300 B4-200 Shorts SD-330 / Skyvan Dornier Do228 Briten BN2A Islander Learjet 25B / 25C</p>
<p><br />
Olympic Airways spanned the five continents of the globe, so destinations are plentiful and diverse. Even if you wish to fly with light aircraft, the Greek mainland and isles are exceptional for VFR flight with airports for beginners all the way to experienced virtual pilots who will have to tackle some of the most dangerous and demanding approaches found anywhere!</p>

<p><i>A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America</i> is a book by <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Takaki_5910.html" title="Ronald Takaki">Ronald Takaki</a>. It deals with the subject of minority perspectives of multicultural America, incorporating quotes, folk songs, letters, telegrams, and photographs into the text. It deals with, in roughly sequential order, Native Americans, African-Americans pre- and post-slavery era, Irish, Chicanos, Chinese, Japanese, Jews, and ties up the book with a current (for the time the book was written) summary of where minorities are now. Each chapter talks about the history of a different ethnic group, and covers over a period of time public attitudes towards the minority, public policy, laws for or against the minority, and attitude of the minority towards their situation. A theme going throughout the entire book is the 'us against them' attitude that the ruling structure has towards the minorities, from the fear of the "giddy multitude" in colonial times, to the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_Exclusion_Act_4141.html" title="Chinese Exclusion Act">Chinese Exclusion Act</a> being created to 'protect' white labor, to the modern day accusations that "Hispanics [...] tak[e] jobs away from "Americans"" (A Different Mirror, page 424)</p>

<p><b>Bridgewater railway station</b> is the terminus railway station on the former Adelaide-Bridgewater railway line which is located in the <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide_Hills_650a.html" title="Adelaide Hills">Adelaide Hills</a> suburb of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgewater.html" title="Bridgewater">Bridgewater</a>. It is located 37.3km by railway from the Adelaide Railway Station. The line from Adelaide to <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belair.html" title="Belair">Belair</a>/<a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgewater.html" title="Bridgewater">Bridgewater</a> opened in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1883.html" title="1883">1883</a>. Until 1987 suburban railcars used the station as the terminus on the Adelaide-Bridgewater line. Passenger services to the station ceased due to low patronage, the terminus becoming Belair. In 1995 one of the two Broad Gauge (1600mm) tracks from Adelaide to Belair was converted to Standard Gauge (1435mm), now the old line between Belair and Bridgewater is a Standard Gauge track. Several freight trains pass through the station each day, including the 4 times a week Overland passenger train to Melbourne.</p>

<p><i><b>(T)Raumschiff Surprise</b></i> is a <a href="../../../g/e/r/German.html" title="German">German</a> motion picture written, produced, directed by and starring <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Herbig_8526.html" title="Michael Herbig">Michael "Bully" Herbig</a>, along with Rick Kavanian (who also acted as a co-author) and Christian Tramitz, who have also worked together in Herbig’s previous motion picture <i><a href="../../../d/e/r/Der_Schuh_des_Manitu_649a.html" title="Der Schuh des Manitu">Der Schuh des Manitu</a></i>. In 2004 it became the third highest-grossing German movie following <i><a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_Waalkes_9440.html" title="Otto Waalkes">Otto - Der Film</a></i> and <i>Der Schuh des Manitu</i>.</p>

<p>The year is 2004. In the <a href="../../../n/e/v/Nevada.html" title="Nevada">Nevada</a> desert, a pig music box is crushed under the wheel of a car which transports a general to the facility called <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_51.html" title="Area 51">Area 51</a>. An alien has been apprehended, and the experts are quite confused about its nature. The general decides to have a personal look – and beholds a human-like figure with pointed ears wearing cowboy attire, an iron neck collar with chain, and who greets him with an affected “Hey, what’cha looking at?”</p>
<p>Three hundred years in the future. The Earth is attacked by Martian colonists under the command of the Regulator and his <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asthma.html" title="Asthma">asthmatic</a> second-in-command, Jens Maul (Kavanian), and they are winning. Earth's Ruling Council under Queen Metapha (<a href="../../../a/n/j/Anja_Kling_8002.html" title="Anja Kling">Anja Kling</a>) is desperate enough to undertake time travel to undo the past: in the year 2054, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mars.html" title="Mars">Mars</a> had been colonized thanks to alien technology which had landed into human hands in Nevada, in the year 2004. And they are all desperate enough to have the most unlikely candidates attempt this dangerous mission: the crew of the (T)Raumschiff <i>Surprise</i> – desperate simply because the crew commanders Captain Kork, Mr. Spuck (“Mr. Spit”, a 35 year old ‘Vulcanette’) and Mr. Schrotty (“Mr. Junky”) are extremely gay!</p>
<p>At the very moment, the <i>Surprise</i> commanders have other difficulties to take care of: they have entered themselves for the Miss Waikiki election in Honululu and are ‘training’ hard to keep in shape, which includes affected singing, weight-measuring in anti-gravity conditions (for which Mr. Spuck proves even more than “far too fat to fly”). For that reason, they don’t want to be disturbed and at first ignore the calls from Earth; only an urgent fax – and the prospect for having their leave cancelled for disobeying orders – make them change their mind. But since it is too far for beaming, and the ship’s drives cannot make “Mopsgeschwindigkeit” (“pug dog speed”) because of a “marten damage”, they decide to take a taxi.</p>
<p>Soon a cab hovers into the taxi bay, with a hunk of a man – for whom Spuck immediately falls for – at the steering wheel: Rock (<a href="../../../t/i/l/Til_Schweiger_7c16.html" title="Til Schweiger">Til Schweiger</a>). Rock proves to be good enough to drive his gay clients through the blockade, but his taxi gets wrecked in the process and he steadfastly refuses to part company with the trio unless he gets a new one, so he accompanies them into the Council chamber. When he meets Queen Metapha, however, his resolve for getting compensation is temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>The crew is instructed in the use of the time machine (in the shape of a sofa) and given two additional tools for the operation: a <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swiss_Army_Knife_69fa.html" title="Swiss Army Knife">Swiss Army Laser</a> and the manual for the time machine. But just as the preparations are complete, the Martian army attacks the capital, and commando units break into the Council Chamber. Schrotty is lost when he dives off the sofa to retrieve the manual (and is later executed by getting hit with a frying pan on the head); Rock decides not to stick around after all and hitchhikes a ride in the machine; and Metapha is urged to join the expedition as well to get her out of the enemy’s hands. However, Maul’s men find the manual, and this enables the villain to build his own time machine – a hover <a href="../../../m/o/p/Moped.html" title="Moped">moped</a> – and follow the fugitives.</p>
<p>When the travelers come around, they find themselves in the year 1304 (Rock: “It’s not so far off”) – right into a tournament in England, held by Lord William the Last (<a href="../../../s/k/y/Sky_Dumont_3328.html" title="Sky Dumont">Sky Dumont</a>)! After a short fight with the attending guards, they are overpowered and the men thrown into prison; William takes a fancy on Metapha, however, and wishes to marry her. He also confiscated Spucky’s <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polaroid.html" title="Polaroid">Polaroid</a> camera, with which he zestily takes a lot of pictures. Rock is sentenced to fight in tomorrow’s jousting competition against a rival champion, as William’s oily herald is quick to suggest.</p>
<p>In the dungeons, Spucky and Rock are having a most intimate – and ambiguous – talk (though on Rock’s side it remains strictly non-sexual) which fans Kork’s jealousy (he sits in an inconvenient position, which makes him see only shadows). On this occasion, Rock produces a music box with a piggy figure, his most treasured memento from home.</p>
<p>The next day, Spucky and Kork, chained together at their necks, are set onto the sofa, and the sofa onto a <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyre.html" title="Pyre">pyre</a> to have them burned as warlocks. Rock competes at the joust clad in a shockingly pink armor suit, courtesy of Mr. Spuck. But the expected adversary is missing, in his stead none other than Jens Maul appears as a Black Knight. When Rock (who is, of course, a bloody amateur in jousting) loses and is sentenced to join the others on the pyre, Metapha impulsively persuades William to have her go along. Maul, as the hero of the competiton, is unable to prevent them from activating the time machine as he is being hoisted into the air by the celebrating crowd, and William makes a few last pictures with the camera. When the sofa vanishes right with the flash of the last picture, however, the herald is quick to denounce William as a warlock and assume the throne for himself.</p>
<p>The next station is Nevada, all right – but the Nevada of the 19th century, the era of the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild_West_dfa6.html" title="Wild West">Wild West</a>. While Rock and Metapha begin to have an argument about their growing feelings for each other and the time machine is wrecked by a speeding train, Kork – who is in need to relieve himself – and Spucky – because he is still chained to the captain – go into a wooden box, which seems to be a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privy.html" title="Privy">privy</a> but turns out to be the wardrobe of the new sheriff (who does not appear in this movie). While inside, the two quickly change clothes (Kork gets the sheriff’s star) and then quickly fall into an argument about Spucky and Rock’s “amorous” talk back in the dungeon. The debate is broken up by the arrivals of Jens Maul – still in his medieval black armor – and the most notorious bandit in the area: Santa Maria (Sky Dumont in a cameo of his role in <i><a href="../../../d/e/r/Der_Schuh_des_Manitu_649a.html" title="Der Schuh des Manitu">Der Schuh des Manitu</a>).</i></p>
<p>While Santa has a meeting with a bunch of nice old ladies before he goes off to sell a pub for a “Stammlokal”, one of his henchmen takes on Spucky and Kork (ostensibly the new sheriff). The only thing he manages to do, however, is to sever the chain connecting the two; any other action is forestalled by Metapha, who knocks him out from behind. In the meantime, Maul tries to steal the group's Swiss Army Laser (which they have accidentally dropped) and to escape on his time moped, but its conventional top speed leaves something to be desired; Rock is able to catch up with him on horseback, catch him with a lasso and capture the laser and the moped, which the group uses to escape this inhospitable era. But in the timestream they realize that they cannot properly control the vehicle; in a brief moment in which it returns to reality, they jump off, and the moped vanishes once more in time.</p>
<p>Just as the quartet is about to take their bearings (as it turns out, it is finally 2004 Nevada), Jens Maul shows up once more, having painstakingly re-assembled the pieces of the smashed time sofa with the help of the manual. He and Rock come to blows with their Swiss Army Lasers, and just when Maul is ready to deliver the coup de grace, the UFO arrives and hits him on the head, knocking him cleanly out.</p>
<p>To everyone’s surprise, the UFO turns out to be not bigger than a tablet – and from within a boisterous, beer-drinking and very rude alien hardly taller than a human hand emerges. When the creature chokes on a sip of beer, Spucky tries to help by offering him Maul’s asthma spray; but the device creates serious over-pressure and – well, scrap one alien.</p>
<p>Before the local authorities arrive, Rock disintegrates the UFO with the laser, and the group scrambles onto the sofa. But the control panel shows that it is overloaded with exactly 76,375 <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilogram.html" title="Kilogram">kilograms</a> – just as much as Spucky happens to weigh. With a heavy heart, Spucky decides to remain behind, and after a tearful farewell and a final gift from Rock (the music box) the rest of the group activates the time sofa.</p>
<p>Back (and now) in the present, Spucky tires to convince the military that he is a time-traveling alien having come to save the world. The big wigs don’t believe him – until a buzzing reveals a futuristic gadget Spucky had pocketed just before departing the Surprise and stashed into a most private place: a thermometer with a vibratory alarm.</p>
<p>When Kork, Rock and Metapha return to 2304, they find the Surprise crew giving them a hearty welcome, among them Schrotty (alive again) and Spucky, now at the age of 335 (Vulcanettes can age up to 400 years). Of course, with his presence in the altered timestream, Spucky has not hesitated to bestow his own personal touch upon the new world. And so the Surprise commanders get to attend the <i>Miss Waikiki</i> competition after all, not suspecting that Jens Maul is ready to have the last word about this….</p>

<p>While popular at large with the audience, some negative criticism has been mad about the movie as well. Some critics complained about the lack of witticism which had made <i><a href="../../../d/e/r/Der_Schuh_des_Manitu_649a.html" title="Der Schuh des Manitu">Der Schuh des Manitu</a></i> popular, while homosexual associations criticised its protrayal of gay people, claiming that it would reinforce stereotype impressions.</p>

<p>The Bridgewater line opened in 1883 and departed from the main Belair line east of Belair station, and headed east,then turned south through <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belair_National_Park_74d7.html" title="Belair National Park">Belair National Park</a>. It turns east, near the old <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Park_de71.html" title="National Park">National Park</a> station used to be, it then passes trough the <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_Sturt_138f.html" title="Upper Sturt">Upper Sturt</a> station.

It then runs northeast to <a href="../../../a/l/d/Aldgate.html" title="Aldgate">Aldgate</a> station, and continues to run east until it reaches the Bridgewater station. In 1987 passenger services to Bridewater ceased mainly due to low patronage, Belair then becoming the terminus. In 1995, one of the two <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broad_Gauge_9c96.html" title="Broad Gauge">Broad Gauge</a> (1600mm) lines between Adelaide and Belair was converted to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_Gauge_6ba8.html" title="Standard Gauge">Standard Gauge</a> (1435mm) as part of the Adelaide to Melbourne standardisation project. The track that goes from Belair to Bridgewater is Standard Gauge, which prevents suburban railcars from going to Bridgewater and beyond. A number of freight trains can be seen on the track between Belair and Bridgewater, including the 4 times a week Overland passenger train to Melbourne.</p>

It was orginally founded in 1979 in Australia, when Helen O'Grady, a trained teacher, drama teacher and actress, hired a hall and commenced affordable after school drama classes for young people from 5-18 years of age.</p>
<p>Her aims to provide a self-development drama programme encourage:</p>
<p>1. Enthusiasm, energy and a positive approach to life. 2. Ongoing confidence. 3. Self esteem. 4. Skill in verbal communication 5. Effective social interaction.</p>
<p>Her legacy continues and the Helen O'Grady Drama System has now become one of the largest worldwide drama schools of its kind, with over 50,000 children attending classes each week. In the United States the school is called Dramakids International.</p>
<p>Each Academy has a Principal responsible for the overall development of each local school. The Principal attends the studios regularly and works alongside the students and teachers.</p>
<p>Students attend fast-moving classes for one-hour a week, according to their specific age-group. Parents Days and an annual Production allow parents and guardians to see first-hand the progress of the students. The curriculum, developed over 28 years, is ongoing and progressive, and the students start at age 5 and remain in the Academy until 18, without ever repeating a lesson.</p>
<p>Duncan Rice became the African Development Director of Helen O'Grady (Africa)CC in January 2006 with the aim of the Academy developing in the rural communities of Africa. He was Head of Drama at St John's College School, Cambridge, in the United Kingdom for ten years before becoming the Helen O'Grady Principal for Northern Ireland. He ran one of the largest branches in the world wide network of the Helen O'Grady Drama Academy with over 1300 students.</p>
<p>The Academy operates in 8 cities in South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Zamibia.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-01_4d50.html" title="Edit section: Flint Falcons">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Flint Falcons</span></h2>
<p>The Flint Falcons were a semi-professional football team in Flint, Michigan from 1992 to 2001. It all started in 1992, when the Falcons were born into the Michigan Football League. After a 4-5 inaugural season, the Falcons reached for the sky.</p>
<p>In 1993, the Falcons went 8-1, outscoring their opponents 279-32, and winning the MFL Championship 30-10 over the Grand Rapids Crush. In 1994, the Falcons repeated as MFL champions, defeating the Kalamazoo Tornadoes 31-6, and finishing the season with an 8-0 record. The 1995 season was so close, but yet so far for the 12-3 Falcons, as they won their third consecutive Conference title, but could not make it to the championship. The 1996 season was bitter sweet, finishing 14-3, and reaching the championship game, only to lose 17-14 at the hands of the Downriver Raiders.</p>
<p>After that, the Falcons fell off the charts for a while, finishing 6-5 in 1997, going 3-5 in the Mid-Eastern Football League in '98, and going 3-3 in 1999. In 2000, the Falcons became an independent team, finishing with a lowly 2-3-1 record, the first tie in franchise history. In 2001, that all seemed to change. As a member of the young Ohio Valley Football League, the Falcons took the OVFL by storm, finishing 13-3 overall, and falling one game short of the OVFL Championship. Although things seemed well on the field, all was not well in the front office.</p>
<p>The Flint Falcons folded after the 2001 season due to a lack of cooperation between the ownership, coaches, and players. At one point in the season, the whole coaching staff resigned.</p>
<p>In 2002, former Flint Falcons Coach Mathews who resigned in 2001, started a new franchise called the Michigan Admirals, Admirals are members of the NAFL. In the summer of 2003, former Flint Falcons Prince Goodson and Charles Lawler created the Flint Fury, who currently play in the MCFL and brought back many former Falcons to the roster.</p>

<p>The Crab Bowl is an American college football game series played between the University of Maryland Terrapins and the United States Navy Midshipmen. Although not part of the more popular college bowl series, it has generated quite an intense rivalry between the two colleges. The games, dating back to the early 1900s, have been punctuated by malicious hits, stolen mascots, and on-campus vandalism.</p>
<p>The series is not played frequently. The last game between the two teams was in 2005. Maryland defeated Navy 23-20 at M &amp; T Bank Stadium in Baltimore.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-01_4d50.html" title="Edit section: The Danbury 11">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Danbury 11</span></h2>
<p>On Tuesday, September 19, the city government of Danbury collaborated with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in a sting on 11 day laborers who were gathered at a downtown park looking for work.</p>
<p><br />
A law enforcement agent, disguised as a contractor, lured the workers into a van with the promise of work and drove them to the Danbury police station, where federal agents seized them and drove them away to jail in Hartford, then on to detention in Boston. The day laborers said they were never questioned about their legal status before the arrest.</p>
<p><br />
Immigrants and their local allies called an emergency picket of Danbury City Hall on September 19 to protest the mayor's perceived involvement in the sting. In the week leading up to the emergency demonstration, ICE yieled to public pressure and released the names of the men, who became known as "the Danbury 11". Media estimates were that 200 people attended the protest and the rally that preceded it.</p>
<p><br />
Six days after the protest, four of the Danbury 11 were released on bail. The remaining seven, however, were moved to two separate prisons in Texas, making it more difficult for families to contact them or petition for their release.</p>
<p><br />
On Wednesday, October 12, the ICE conducted a series of arrests in Danbury, raiding the homes of 3 immigrant workers and arresting a fourth on a traffic stop for improper use of a turn signal.</p>
<p><br />
In all of the arrests, Danbury police admitted to collaborating with ICE.</p>
<p><br />
By mid-October, public pressure and dedicated legal defense by the Yale University Jerome R. Frank Legal Clinic and Waterbury attorney James Welcome led to the release of 5 more detainees on bail from prisons in Texas. One client reported to attorney Welcome that prison officials left him at a gas station in a remote area of Texas after dark. The two remaining detainees were denied bond hearings and "voluntarily" -- that is, from inside a prison -- accepted deportation to Ecuador.</p>
<p><br />
The legal cases of the Danbury 11 are currently pending in court. A public defense of immigrant workers in Danbury -- known as the Campaign to Stop the ICE Raids in Danbury -- was initiated by a group of community leaders, including:</p>
<p><br />
Leonel Villavicencio, President, Danbury Area Coalition for the Rights of Immigrants Franklin Peña, President, Ecuadorian Civic Center of Danbury Wilson Hernandez, Vice President, Ecuadorian Civic Center Pastor Juana Jourdain-Villavicencio, Hispanic United Church of Christ Father Hector León, Our Lady of Guadelupe Juan A. Sánchez, President, Dominican Civic Club of Danbury Christopher Towne, Danbury Coalition for Peace</p>
<p><br />
WHY IS DANBURY OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE?</p>
<p>Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton is the founder of Mayors and County Executives for Immigration Reform, a national network advocating extreme measures against immigrant workers. The group held a D.C. summit in the spring that drew 100 elected officials from 26 cities to hear speakers from the Bush Administration and major right-wing think tanks.</p>
<p><br />
Activists assert that Danbury is a testing-ground for Boughton's group and federal agencies like ICE. They anticipate that repressive tactics against immigrants in Danbury will soon be exported to other areas of the country.</p>

<p>Rabat Medina</p>
<p>Rabat Medina Culture The main colors of the Rabat Medina and beige walls with dark red doors to each of the souks (this is what the stores in the medina are called). Many people go there everyday to get everything that they need. Almost anything you want or need, can be found in the medina. The Rabat Medina has the least aggressiveness when trying to get people to buy things from any other medina in Morocco.</p>
<p><br />
Different Sections There are many different sections of the medina. There is the tourist section, the movies and frames section, clothing and shoes section, and rugs section.</p>
<p><br />
Shopping Vocabulary Combien – how much Souvenir shop – le magasin de souvenirs Jeweller’s – la bijouterie Butchers – le boucherie Cake Shop – la pâtisserie Sweet Shop – la confiserie</p>

<p>Provisions sugar – le sucre butter – le beurre milk – le lait eggs – les œufs flour – la farine bread – le pain rice – le riz tea – le thé coffee – le café</p>
<p><br />
Things to Buy Some of the types of things to buy at the Medina are tourist goods, clothing, electronics, accessories, food, rugs, frames, and movies.</p>
<p><br />
Clothing In the medina there are many types of clothing sold. There is a section with modern clothes. These clothes are usually replicas of popular designer brands. The main two brands used in this are Diesel, and Dolce and Gabbana. Traditional clothing is also sold. Some of the women’s traditional clothing is Jabadors, Takshitas, Salhams, Jalabas, and Caftans. Some of the men’s traditional clothing is Jabadors, Jalabas, Tarboshs, Kaftans, and Barnos.</p>
<p>Electronics Cameras, computer programs/games, and cell phones are all sold at the medina. They are sold for low prices.</p>
<p>Shoes All throughout the medina there are leather Moroccan slipper shoes everywhere. They are natively called babouches. Modern shoe replicas with brands such as Puma and Converse are also sold, usually in sizes up to 39 or 40.</p>
<p><br />
Food Many different spices are sold in the food section of the medina.</p>
<p>Rugs There are many rug souks throughout the medina. Rug store owners will usually make their customer sit down in their store and watch their rug demonstration while drinking mint tea. All different types of rugs are displayed to the customers hoping they will like something they see.</p>
<p>Frames By the main movie section of the medina, there are places where pictures can be matted and framed. This price to frame a picture depends on how big the picture is and which frame is chosen. To frame without a mat usually costs anywhere from 50 to 100 dirham.</p>
<p>Movies The movies in the medina can be found almost everywhere. While walking through the medina people come up to you to try to sell DVDs. These DVDs are usually not very good quality. Good pirated DVDs are in the set up stores with the stars on the back of the casing explaining what type of quality the DVD is. Movies are usually sold in French and English. Good quality DVDs usually cost ten dirham.</p>

<p>John Ramos was born in Chihuahua, Mexico and was raised in Southern California. He studied art and design at Cal State University Long Beach and began publishing his own prints in 1980. The now infamous "Hussong's Cantina" print was first published in 1979 and began the series of fine art prints that now number over 80 different images.</p>
<p>Ramos paints images from his travels through Baja California and Coastal Mexico, along with nostalgic images of the classic cars of the California lifestyle. "Wish-you-were-there" scenes with beaches, hammocks, palapas, and surfing, to the new "urban cityscapes" of San Francisco, John Ramos paints what he sees from his own unique perspective and the perspective of the viewer.</p>
<p>The original watercolor and oil paintings have luminous and vivid colors that create the crisp details in the large variety of subject matter that Ramos paints whether it’s a field of marigold flowers, the chrome of a vintage Woody, or the purple reflections of the sunset on the bay.</p>
<p>Ramos continues to travel Baja California to fish and paint. He also paints along the Central Coast of California and Big Sur for the pleasure of painting out on location. And, he also likes the subject of vintage architecture and the classic neon signs of San Francisco to paint in his "urban landscapes" series.</p>

<p>Knightstone comics are famous for their 'Tekken' comics. They have had the 'Tekken Saga' and the 'Tekken 2' comics, however they also have 'Playboy knife' They were planning on making this into a mini series until they lost their license to Dark design. Their storyline can be read on the website below. Knightstone comics had to gain the 'right' to sell the Tekken comics, because tekken belongs to Namcom, this is probably why they lost their licensing 82.45.161.73 21:21, 30 November 2006 (UTC)(Shifre, Zeybey)</p>

He is the son of Steffler Sr, owner and chairman of MCW.

He always wears his trademark red glasses and keeps his hair colour red. His most used wrestling move is "Jr Bomb". Steffler Jr is known as "The Boycotter", derived mainly from his tendency to beat up and walk out on his tag team partners. He has a son named Steffler II Jr.</p>
