<p>I originally nominated this for speedy deletion but the creator of the article laughed at it due to the nomination of several of his articles yesterday for deletion. However, this article should be deleted because it is <i>an empty or very short article providing little or no context</i>. There really is no such thing as <i>Islamic athletics</i>, no specific relationship between <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics.html" title="Athletics">athletics</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturner</a> 00:54, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It looks like the submission of the possible copyright violation was incomplete - Deiz has to follow the instructions at the top. Additionally, I'm not sure if there is a violation, since the site has a pretty lenient policy: "Permission is granted to all to take material from this site, subject to the following two conditions: (1) Material used must be attributed to www.islam-qa.com , (2) Material must be reproduced faithfully and without alteration or omission." <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 10:09, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I personally have nothing against this article, indeed it's interesting and scores well on the anit-systemic-bias-o-meter. However the copyvio (which is a section of rather than the whole article, I have now listed it at the relevant copyvio problem page) does not reference its source, rather it says "one scholar says..." which is as good as saying "my mate thinks..." or "this bloke down the pub said...". If it is properly referenced per point (1) from Schizombie then it's probably no longer an issue. <b>However</b>, the article still needs lots of work and it would be a credit to those who are spending time blowing hot air defending it on this AfD page if they focussed their efforts on wikifiing the article. For starters a going over by a native English speaker familiar with the topic and au fait with Wikipedia style policies is <b>urgently required</b>. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><b><font style="verdana" color="#990099">D</font><font color="#669900">e</font><font color="#9900CC">iz</font></b></a> 11:02, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Bro, queit it will ya? Why are you so gang ho on deleting? Stop making me answer to all of this, please! You saw it yourself, i expanded Islamic athletics to a full article in no-time, and the same can be with the other articles. As you said YOURSELF: "Islam is considered a <a href="../../../d/i/n/Din_%28Arabic_term%29_6751.html" title="Din (Arabic term)">dīn</a> (way of life) rather than a simple religion, we could connect Islam with practically any topic".

<p><b>Comment.</b> Someone added additional articles to be proposed for deletion above, after people had already begun expressing opinions (below) on this AfD. I've removed those additions, because it appears to me that adding articles to be deleted after people had already expressed opinions is a very improper abuse of process. The closing admin may wish to review this page carefully to ascertain which votes were cast before, during and after these changes. -<font color="#2000C0">ikkyu2</font> (<a href="../../../i/k/k/User_talk%7EIkkyu2_7356.html" title="User talk:Ikkyu2"><font color="#00FF00">talk</font></a>) 09:27, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ikkyu2, I think you are over-emphasizing the significance of that move regarding the related articles. You deleted the additional articles which was reasonable. But then to go back four hours later and add another comment regarding the move as well as clarifying your vote (which after your deletion was not ambiguous) is just rubbing it in. I talked to the editors whose votes appeared to be ambiguous or split between the original and related articles and they have all responded. Clearly all of the votes below relate to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_athletics.html" title="Islamic athletics">Islamic athletics</a> as they all clearly refer to the name of this article in some way, were cast before the addition or after the removal of the related articles, or were fixed after contacting the respective editor. To say adding the related articles was a "very improper abuse of process" is a complete exaggeration. Clearly, no harm was done and no careful review of this page is necessary. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturner</a> 11:09, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Some notable Islamic athletes in various disciplines would be good, too. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 10:46, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have uppdated the article, it is now nothing like it was when the previous votes where cast. Please considere that i just made a hasty work, let it show that there is lots to add regarding athletics distinctly governed by Islam, and how it formed during the history of Islam. Also note that this article is a part of the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_studies.html" title="Islamic studies">Islamic studies</a> --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 01:33, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I remain unconvinced. Somehow I think any topic could be protracted to appear more significant than it really is. The information you added to the article could easily be condensed into a single paragraph and, at best, be small section on another article. Note, also, that being linked from another page is not a reason to prevent deletion. In fact, I'm not even sure why it belongs in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_studies.html" title="Islamic studies">Islamic studies</a>.

<p>The nominators comment "There really is no such thing as <i>Islamic athletics</i>, no specific relationship between <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics.html" title="Athletics">athletics</a>" really shows how little he knows about this topic.

<p>Again i become upset at geting articles deleted due to not knowing enough about the subject --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 01:55, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I apologize if I am not educated enough about a topic. When an article sits unattended for two and a half months and when it pertains to something I believe I should have some knowledge of (in this case <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>), I have no choice but to come to the reasonable conclusion that there really is nothing noteworthy about the topic. But Striver, you also should not take offense at a request for deletion. It simply offers a chance to discuss the merit of an article. You, however, seem to be defensive whenever this arises. Given that Islam is considered a <a href="../../../d/i/n/Din_%28Arabic_term%29_6751.html" title="Din (Arabic term)">dīn</a> (way of life) rather than a simple religion, we could connect Islam with practically any topic. But we don't need an article about Islamic shopping, Islamic space travel, and Islamic web-surfing just because some (trivial) relationship exists between Islam and those respective subjects. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturner</a> 02:07, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I know everyone is going to get annoyed by this. Everyone... protracted AfDs are <i>not</i> my intention. I have added several AfDs and don't continue discussions unless absolutely necessary. I will respond to comments irrelevant to this AfD on Striver's talk page. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturner</a> 02:29, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Are athletics studies?</b>. Bro Did you read the fatwa section? Did you read the article i added? Did you read about how athletics got formed in the historical Islamic world? Sure you can say that in two sentances. If needed, i can say the whole <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> article in two sentances. But we are not here to delet, we are here to add, to create. Remember?--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 02:40, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Man, im going to sleep. But i urge you again: Go make yourself usefull, go google and EXPAND articles, not AFD them since you are are not sure if they can be expanded. Why do you think we have Template:--islam-stub--? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 02:53, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
