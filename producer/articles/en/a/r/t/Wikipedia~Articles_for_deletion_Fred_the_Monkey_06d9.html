<li><b>Keep</b>- very funny animation linked to above which also said it has won several awards. Doesn't that make it notable? --J2thawiki 17:03, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Hi, I'm the articles original creator. The article that was deleted was not nearly as expansive as this one. This one, if I do say so myself is amazing. yes, it is about an internet cartoon, but this internet cartoon is quite popular, and the page is not just a small piece on it: it is full coverage. So no, this article should not be deleted. It is not written like an advertisement, has a lot of information, and is just such a large coverage of the topic. No, again, it should stay. As for the guidelines, well, the article is not written like an advertisement, rather, like an encyclopedia. The site is well enough known I believe, and that is that. Please post here if you disagree.--<a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScabloo_3cc2.html" title="User:Scabloo">Scabloo</a> 23:24, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Kudos to the animation. It really <i>is</i> hilarious. But at this risk of getting "totally added" to the sign . . . the fact remains that unless someone can spell out what these awards are, so we can evaluate their importance, I'm afraid I just don't see how any of the criteria listed in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> are met. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 00:45, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b> As has been noted, the article is much more expansive than the one that was deleted last time. Also, I don't see how it's not notable. It won some awards and has a decent sized user base.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Once again, I ask: exactly what are these awards that it has won? Heck, I can actually truthfully claim that I'm an award-winning playwright. Am I notable now? (The award was best parody of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest_a2b3.html" title="The Importance of Being Earnest">The Importance of Being Earnest</a></i> in my high school English class in 12th grade.) If these awards that the web site has won are legit, then by all means share and that will certainly influence my opinion, and probably others' too. But as long as no one is willing to name them, that seems pretty suspicious to me. And if the awards are not legit, then what criterion of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> does this site meet? <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 19:00, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>'<b>Comment'</b> - Even so, it is obviously fairly popular. The forum has 669 members, 223708 posts and 4740 topics. It is obviously active, so we know that it isnt like the commic isn't well known. --<a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScabloo_3cc2.html" title="User:Scabloo">Scabloo</a> 21:36, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Answer:</b> - Not sure if I should reply to an unsigned comment but, intending to be polite, here goes. I mentioned that I found it not humourous merely because so many had found it funny - it was simply to balance those comments. I agree, it is not a reason to delete the article.

<li><b>Answer:</b> I'm not aware (correct me if I'm wrong) of it appearing in any publications outside Wikipedia. I assume that if it did this page would contain links to it. I think the question should be, "Why *IS* it note worthy? <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobinson_weijman_cd79.html" title="User:Robinson weijman">Robinson weijman</a> 14:25, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Because it is fairly popular, and it *has* gotten some daily awards on newgrounds. The creator also says he won an award at a local college.--<a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScabloo_3cc2.html" title="User:Scabloo">Scabloo</a> 19:14, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Then I suggest you add the awards to the article. Though winning an award at a local college does not make it noteworthy, I think.

<li><b>Comment</b>. There would probably be no harm in having a Wikipedia article about my niece's pet hamster, either. That doesn't mean there should be one. But the important thing is that at least we're acknowledging that the only <i>real</i> arguments anyone is presenting for keeping are <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/g/WP%7EBIGNUMBER_dfb6.html" title="WP:BIGNUMBER">WP:BIGNUMBER</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/h/WP%7ENOHARM_b472.html" title="WP:NOHARM">WP:NOHARM</a>. For the reasons put forth in their essay sections, I can't say I find any of those arguments particularly compelling such that they'd justify making this an exception to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I can't imagine that's anywhere near what <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> has in mind for a "well-known award". But again, it's just my opinion. And of course <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is a guideline, not a policy, and thus is more apt to be subject to exceptions than are policies. <i><b>I</b></i> don't personally feel this site should be given such an exception, so I still say, without hesitation, to delete. And I'd note that of the four who have thus far argued for "keep", one is the article creator and two of the other three are <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">SPA's</a>. But all of that said, others are certainly free to have a differing opinion, and if the article ultimately remains, as much as I'll disagree with that, it's probably not exactly going to make my Top 10 list of "Wikipedia articles with which I have a problem". (If it is deemed notable enough to stay, though, and if I'm featured as a Wikipeida villain in the next animation, then I'm going to try to press a claim of <i>inherited</i> notability and create an article for myself.)&#160;;-) <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 00:32, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - well, an award is better than none. Also, even though he can't prove i on the internet, the creator of the animation says he won an award at a local college. I know it probably doesn't count (It would be pretty crazy if it did), but i might as well mention it.Anyways - yes, 2 people who voted for Keep are SPAs, but it isnt like they are saying "Fred The Monkey FTW! Keep da Article m@te!" they posted a reply in, in my opinion, an accountable way. Finally, going back to your nieces hamster, in comparison, most likely no one publically knows, or really cares (no offense) about it. Here however, people do know, and care about the article / animation.--<a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScabloo_3cc2.html" title="User:Scabloo">Scabloo</a> 00:47, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Let me be clear that I didn not mean to suggest, even for a moment, that a SPA cannot contribute to the debate in an intelligent manner. I only bring up the point because it does at least call into question one's neutrality on the subject. I absolutely assume that all contributors to the argument are making their contributions honestly and in good faith, SPA or not. But I would argue that if a person hasn't done anything else or much else on Wikipedia besides work on Fred the Monkey, then it's at least possible that their perspective on whether that article should be kept may be a bit biased. Especially if the arguments they cite for keeping it are not supported by any Wikipedia policies or guidelines. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 20:20, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> So it appears a bunch of the keeps are SPAs. I've contributed to Wikipedia quite a bit in the past, just never made an account. All I'm saying is that it'd be a shame if the article was deleted again. So much was put into this one and it's so much better than the one that was deleted before it. Also, as has been noted, the site does have a pretty large following. The forums, while not as large as say IGN, they've still got a decent number of users and a ton of posts. The toons have been on newground.com and have won a few awards over there. So yes, they may not be the most well known awards, but shouldn't the fan base speak for something, too? <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstoc_cccb.html" title="User:Astoc">Astoc</a> 00:50, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree. Just because someone appears to have only contributed to the Fred the Monkey article doesn't mean that that's all that they have done.

It has already been deleated once, and I do not believe that when it has so clearly been improved from the previous article featured that it should be deleated again. I am a huge fan of the website, so I may be biased but I do not think that this has anything to do with the fact that I do not believe that it should be removed. It is a well rounded article that should not be removed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinja_is_the_new_black_b770.html" title="User:Ninja is the new black">Ninja is the new black</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ninja_is_the_new_black_53ca.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ninja is the new black">contribs</a>).</small></s><small>This Keep&#160;!vote was struck through by administrator <a href="../../../h/u/1/User%7EHu12_d0ca.html" title="User:Hu12">hu12</a> has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The nomination for deletion isn't because it's an animation; it's because it's not notable per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Homestar Runner, on the other hand, <b>is</b> notable per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, since I can point you to references to Homestar Runner in such non-trivial tech publications as <i><a href="../../../w/i/r/Wired_%28magazine%29.html" title="Wired (magazine)">Wired</a></i>, as well as in mainstream media like <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cincinnati_Enquirer_b945.html" title="The Cincinnati Enquirer">The Cincinnati Enquirer</a></i> and the <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Review_8dfa.html" title="National Review">National Review</a></i>. If the same could be said for Fred the Monkey, then this wouldn't even be an issue. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 21:45, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - 74.102.186.183's vote should not count, as IP addresses votes are not allowed to count. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackBear_4c4f.html" title="User:BlackBear">BlackBear</a> 22:25, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Everyone should remember (and I've now added the template at the top to serve as a reminder) that this is <b>not</b> a vote. The decision will be made by the merits of people's arguments, <b>not</b> on the basis of how many "votes" each side has. It is perfectly acceptable for an IP to offer arguments for consideration. In this case, even those voting to keep seem to acknowledge that the site doesn't meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. So that would mean that the question seems to be whether this site is worthy of an exception to that guideline. The arguments in favor of giving it an exception all seem to boil down to <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/g/WP%7EBIGNUMBER_dfb6.html" title="WP:BIGNUMBER">WP:BIGNUMBER</a>, or <a href="../../../n/o/h/WP%7ENOHARM_b472.html" title="WP:NOHARM">WP:NOHARM</a>. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 22:44, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment'</b> - Well, does the final desicion come down to you. The reason I ask is because since you still do not think it should be on the site, and it comes down to you, then all of this seems futile.--<a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScabloo_3cc2.html" title="User:Scabloo">Scabloo</a> 20:23, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Answer</b>. Absolutely not. It is an admin decision, and I am not an admin. Beyond how persuasive (or non-persuasive) others find my arguments in this discussion to be, I have absolutely no say whatsoever in the final decision. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 20:29, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
