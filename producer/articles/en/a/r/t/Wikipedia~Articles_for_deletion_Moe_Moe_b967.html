<p>Non-notable doujin (which is a nice way of saying unlicensed fanfic, most of the time) game. Google has nothing relevant, Whatlinkshere doesn't seem to indicate that it's important in any way, and there are no sources besides the game's official site (which is in Japanese). This was prodded, but the prod was removed without comment, which isn't helpful at all. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:19, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>; isn't the reason that there is nothing relevant on Google or other pages all the more of an indication that it is beneficial for such an article to exist? Many people use Wikipedia as well as Google for searching sources. It is particularly the fact that there was minimal information on the net that struck the idea that creating such a page might be helpful to people seeking information on the game. HOWEVER! If it is precisely the lack of information on the page that has led to the suggestion of deletion, please say so, and remedies can be made. If there are other reasons, please also say so; because, it is still quite confusing as to why submitting information on a game (not a detailed guide, but just one to introduce it) that doesn't have a lot of information on the rest of the net is a reason for deletion. If there exists an article on a subject that would be otherwise hard to find on Google, it might be better to keep it. Thank you. --FrostShaman 09:20, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There's no indication that there are any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that have ever commented on this game. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 09:24, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are clear indications that this game is special in its own way. For one matter, as a Doujin game, it features not 1 on 1 combat, but 2 on 2, making it a more diverse form of multipler gameplay. Secondly, the terrain of the stages varies. In other words, there are raised platforms and whatnot, resembling those found in games such as the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Smash_Brothers_b70b.html" title="Super Smash Brothers">SSB</a> series. Both of these factors are elements that many <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doujin.html" title="Doujin">Doujin</a> Fighting Games lack, making this one of the few that feature both. The definition of importance or the presence of reliable sources doesn't seem concrete, since, as mentioned, this game is in fact notable for bringing the elements of 4 players and a variant terrain into a Doujin game, and does the main site not count as a "reliable" site? Therefore, I still argue that this page should be kept. Thank you once again for your comments. --FrostShaman
<ul>
<li>The main site is a primary source. There are no secondary sources. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 09:45, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Under the page Verifiability, it is not mentioned that any second source are needed so long as there is a site from which information is drawn from. It just so happens that the site is in Japanese, and, in accordance with deletion policies, sites of foreign languages or sites with verifiability problems are not absolute reasons for deletion/deletion may not be needed. It is because the game has little publicity that there are few sites pertaining to the information, and the very source of this information is the main site. So, unless it is doubted whether the main site provides information that contradicts what is written in this page, there should be no reason to doubt this <u>verifiability</u>. If anything else, I think the page should be keep, and, at the least, modified to a stub. --Caskyl</li>

<ul>
<li>As far as I can tell, the <b>Notability</b> section lists out specific points of notability, as it is true that few <u>Fighing</u> games, let alone Doujin games, have combinations of all these aspects. --Caskyl</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Wikipedia articles are not created b/c they might be beneficial to the subject of the article. Also, it is not enough that subject is <i>special</i> in any way. Also, Wikipedia does not list every Doujin game there is. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinhan_d563.html" title="User:Shinhan">Shinhan</a> 19:00, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see it mentioned anywhere that Wikipedia <u>should</u> list out and talk about all Doujin games. It only seems to be hinted that this page is potentially helpful to those who seek information on the game, and, if I recall correctly, articles on Wikipedia should not be bound by restraints as long as it doesn't violate any rules or regulations. And here, it doesn't seem like any of the regulations are seriously violated. --Caskyl
<ul>
<li>I wish it were not so, but notability guidelines are here to stay, and this game is definitelly not notable. Find some other way to promote your game and come back here once you get enough media attention to merit a wikipedia article. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinhan_d563.html" title="User:Shinhan">Shinhan</a> 22:40, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> In addition to some features not enjoyed by many more "notable" fighting games (i.e. <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul_Calibur_b36b.html" title="Soul Calibur">the Soul Calibur series</a>), it also features a number of characters from popular Japanese products which most certainly *are notable.

<li>Problem is, it seems to be unlicensed fanwork based on those characters, and there's so much of that that a line has to be drawn. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 14:55, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Fair enough, however, one must take into account the bizarrely unique methodology that goes around in the world of doujinshi. It's a veritable phenomenon, which I assume stems from the fact that Japanese copyright laws either (A) allow for such things vs. more contemporary Western laws, or (B) nobody bothers to enforce them if they do. Just because we do not understand it, or do not think it is useful, doesn't mean it's worth chucking out a window. Furthermore, you have to admit, it's a well-written article; that in and of itself is with at least a small margin of error on the side of "keep" in the Wikipedia of today. 24.161.191.234 18:26, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ack, sorry for not putting this in above. Anyway, for those of us who are not satisfied with what we find on Google, mayhaps it is worth a search in the game's native Japanese? I went ahead and did it for you, have a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22%E8%90%8C%E3%81%88%E7%87%83%E3%81%88%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22%E8%90%8C%E3%81%88%E7%87%83%E3%81%88%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">look</a>. 24.161.191.234 18:30, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
