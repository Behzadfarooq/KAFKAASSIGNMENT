<dd><s>I think the point the user was making</s> I misread, so I'll say that my point is that the key to Wikipedia is wikilinks, interaction of articles. It would take the creation of articles on the dorm halls, which don't merit articles. Aside from linking to the university, this article would be an orphan. Give it a brief mention in the VT article, but it doesn't even deserve a merge. <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeke_11ee.html" title="User:Teke"><font color="maroon">T</font><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeke_b34c.html" title="User talk:Teke"><font color="gray">k</font><font color="maroon">e</font></a> 06:25, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think we need an article for each school's SGA. If a school has a high-profile <u>academic</u> program, that may be worth a separate article.

<li>I withdraw my objection above to a merge based on the general consensus here. I've created a section for it at <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_Tech_campus_85cc.html" title="Virginia Tech campus">Virginia Tech campus</a>. Could the closing admin <b>redirect</b> the article to <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_Tech_campus_85cc.html" title="Virginia Tech campus">Virginia Tech campus</a>? RHF is only at Virginia Tech - nobody else calls their "dorm council" RHF - and so VT's campus page is the logical place to redirect the article. If someone has a great objection to redirecting it to VT, the other place to redirect would be <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Association_of_College_and_University_Residence_Halls_74a9.html" title="National Association of College and University Residence Halls">National Association of College and University Residence Halls</a>, which, as the name implies, is the national organization for RHF-like entities.

<p>The full name of this new religious movement is apparently 'The Way The Church of Yahweh in Christ Jesus', sometimes rendered with a dash between "The Way" and "The Church" and sometimes not. Searching on just "The Church of Yahweh in Christ Jesus" gets just 159 Google hits, and Google actually trims that down to just 14 when it eliminates similar entries. All 14 hits appear to be message boards or Wikipedia mirrors -- you'd think that if this was a notable denomination, we'd have at least <i>one</i> newspaper or magazine or journal article on it. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:33, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>It was no different than this article by The <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christadelphians.html" title="Christadelphians">Christadelphians</a> to which it resembles in beliefs.</i> Well, that may appear true from your perspective. However, you may not realize -- we're not talking about the merits of the <i>groups</i>; we're talking about the merits of the <i>articles</i>. This means that it doesn't <i>matter</i> whether TCOYIJC is "a cult like <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven%27s_Gate_5d0a.html" title="Heaven's Gate">Heaven's Gate</a>, the Branch Davidians led by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Koresh_ffce.html" title="David Koresh">David Koresh</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Jones_fa6f.html" title="Jim Jones">Jim Jones</a> and The People's Temple" or not -- that has absolutely no influence on the decision.

<li><b>Keep:</b> Thanks for fixing my errors, and sorry about the mistakes, but you do realize that those alone are no reason to delete the page. I'm not sure what you count as interesting though, since this is the guideline: <i>Name at least three interesting and unrelated properties of the number.</i> It does not say <i>mathematical</i> anywhere, and by my count there are at the very least two, if not up to four interesting facts on this page. -JesterJester (not logged in currently)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. From my point of view, it makes no sense to delete this when we have <a href="../../../i/n/t/Category%7EIntegers_a721.html" title="Category:Integers">Category:Integers</a> with a happy percentage of the other integers we know and love. Is 270 less deserving than <a href="../../../2/6/9/269_%28number%29.html" title="269 (number)">269</a>? Or <a href="../../../1/5/5/155_%28number%29.html" title="155 (number)">155</a>? How about <a href="../../../%E2%88%92/4/0/%E2%88%9240_%28number%29.html" title="−40 (number)">-40</a>? I don't think so. The nom seems to feel that some numbers are more important, or more <i>notable</i>, than 270. I'm not sure why that should be the case. Aren't they all equally important as abstract representations of an underlying reality? As such are we in any way equipped to differentiate between the <i>notable</i> and <i>not notable</i>? If these questions all have simple answers, perhaps we should make this a group nom to eliminate all the less important integers that are weighing so heavily on the reputation of this reference work. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 04:05, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Time for a history lesson. WP:NUM originally said every integer from 1 to 1024 was going to have its own article. The deletionists howled. So it was changed to 1001, then down to 257. The deletionists were still howling their tired old "numbers are infinite" argument. So WP:NUM went down to 200. The deletionists are still harping on the "numbers are infinite" argument. They're not going to be happy until the article on 42 gets deleted.

<li>Anyway, to answer your question. De Menezes, bad intelligence. Alpizar, no intelligence. Kahar, potentially very significant implications. <a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizzaMargherita_c94c.html" title="User:PizzaMargherita">PizzaMargherita</a> 19:40, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>According to this Independent article, the headshot/lethal force policy is only for suspected suicide bombers. Otherwise its a shot to a torso <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/crime/article624165.ece" class="external free" title="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/crime/article624165.ece" rel="nofollow">http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/crime/article624165.ece</a> <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 22:15, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>...thus confirming that shoot to kill has never been abandoned, especially not because of the de Menezes incident. Not surprised to be honest. The reason to keep STK is clearly political, the day STK goes, Ian Blair goes. Anyway, point taken about Kahar arguably not falling in the category for which STK is applicable, though I'd disagree.

Wikipedia can have "many encyclopedia articles on topics of historical significance that are currently in the news" (from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>) but is this event historically significant?

<li>"Keep" - I thought the idea of wikipedia was that anyone or anything of any significance could be looked up. Mike Smith is a leading member of a political party and leader of an association aimed at changing our politicial spectrum from the current one dimentional - same government (no matter who you vote for) - to a multi-dimentional conviction political spectrum we all need if democracy really does exist and isn't just part of some alice in wonderland lie! If this gets deleted, then I'm going to expect that similar artciles on other leading political activists and commentators be deleted (mmm who should we start with?). Lets have a cull of such people on Wikpedia. Or is this censorship politically based? If this goes, I will be nominating a long list of people who should join it!86.20.41.187 23:14, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is saying something when I, as a Leftist, defend the right of CDA figures to have entries on Wikipedia, but I feel I have to. "Homey" has made sneering anti-socialist, the-free-market-is-the-answer-to-everything remarks which make me, as a Leftist, hate him/her far more than traditional conservatives who at least aren't Thatcherite cultural vandals. As is often the case these days, what unites people like me with traditional conservatives, against the new centre ground, is greater than what divides us ... certainly, I feel that Homey's obsessive personal agenda is irrational and wrong-headed. We should <b>not</b> be deleting articles about people just because they aren't ultra-populist Americanisers, which I think is Homey's real motivation (he/she would, judging by the remarks I quoted above, be just as likely to want to delete articles about traditional socialists such as myself). <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobinCarmody_3768.html" title="User:RobinCarmody">RobinCarmody</a>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Whether or not the article remains or is edited or deleted must be left to Wikipedia. I would simply comment as follows.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, you may feel that notes on the Chairman of CDA are relevant to anybody researching the CDA article on Wikipedia. You may also feel that the references to the landmark internet libel action Keith Smith v Williams will be of use to internet law researchers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, I have reviewed the current content of the article and find no falsehood in it. Providing 'citations' even for such mundane matters as (eg) my membership of the RICS, is less easy than it sounds.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thirdly, recent 'vandalism' of this article appears to have been instigated by Tracy Williams, the loser in the recent landmark action Keith Smith v Williams and her associate Ed Chilvers, who has indeed published on the internet an abstract concerning what he believes to be the 'facts' of the case. <a href="http://www.lvl9.org/article.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.lvl9.org/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lvl9.org/article.htm</a>. You may gather from this that there is bad blood between Chilvers and myself.</dd>
</dl>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Mr Smith is not a "leading figure of the Tory right". In fact he is not even a member of the Tory Party having left some years ago when they failed to measure up to his pristine standards. Mr Smith is the leader of the miniscule CDA a right wing pressure group which exerts no pressure, is generally unheard of and which, when it is so, becomes the subject of mockery and derision.

<li>I'm going to vote <b>keep</b>. The article has been allowed to fall into a state of disrepair, with GLF and his friends adding a disturbing amount of trivia, dubious assertions and unverifiable original research. There's little question that much of the current piece is vanity, and should either be deleted or significantly truncated. Notwithstanding this, Lauder-Frost is a public figure (of sorts) in the United Kingdom: he once held a leadership position in a fringe organization, and has been cited in the mainstream media numerous times. This article is in desperate need of revision, but the subject is above the threshold of notability in my eyes (unfortunately). <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 02:42, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>:I have commented on the Talk Pages, all ignored and abused. But points in the above need comment. Lauder-Frost resigned from the Monday Club (at the time had 1660 members and about 45 members of both houses of parliament) before any arrest or charges were brought. He has appeared in several news interviews in the past decade. As for letters to the editor, these equate to a public statement by the individual. If in a political position they carry importance. As for friends/supporters of GLF supporting his entry, how does that differ from this concerted attempt by similar politically-minded friends on Wikipedia ganging together to destroy it? <a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESussexman_47c3.html" title="User:Sussexman">Sussexman</a> 06:43, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>Based on the length of the article one would think Gregory Lauder-Frost is the most important person in UK politics today and one of the most important people who has ever lived.

Editors who were banned by the ArbComm from this article have been flouting the ban by editing as anon IPs from a dynamic ISP and a circle of Lauder-Frost's friends and supporters have expanded this article to excruciating lengths and are tenacious in defending the inclusion of the most trivial of details such as who attended what dinner. The only surprise is that they have not (yet) posted the menus on the rationale that they give the reader a sense of the importance and dignity of the occasions.

<li>What has the CDA got to do with GLF's article - other than Homeontherange has got his teeth into that also?Lightoftheworld 16:08, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>GLF was a very prominent figure on the respectable Tory Right. He consistantly supported the traditional wing of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative Party (UK)</a> and spoke out constantly for his beliefs. He was a principal officer and activist in the most prominent Tory pressure group ever. No (referring to comment above), he was not an MP (selection has been tightly controlled by liberals since the mid-1980s) but he did more for Toryism than any of the time-serving careerists who do absolutely nothing for conservatism.</p>
<p>Lets be absolutetly honest here. He/his article has been attacked almost from inception by the likes of CJCurrie and his friend Homeontherange, as well as GroundZero on every pretext they could possibly think of. Homeontherange tried before (December) to get this article deleted when it was a fraction of its present size. Now he is trying again. (He has also attacked just about everyone and every group with any association with GLF with the most self-righteous, cynical, and sarcastic comments imaginable). Homeontherange has now used as his principal arguments vanity/flattery and lack of sources. Yet when more sources were added following that complaint he deleted them anyway. (Please name me one article that displays as many sources as this biography?) As for the vanity/flattery bit I would argue its garbage because I cannot see anything there that is untrue: it is a political biography of a figure who was extremely active in his cause.</p>
<p>Now I understand that some of you may be Left-wing and see Lauder-Frost as 'the enemy'. That he may (have) been. But give him credit for supporting what he believed in, just as you do. Thiose interested in British politics will normally have heard of him. One further bonkers comment by the detractors: that of "anonymous" posters. You all know this is just yet another excuse to attack those you don't like. Please grow up. We are ALL anonymous. Calling yourself 'The Mummy' and flagging up a template saying you're a native English speaker tells us nothing. Get real and get decent. Wikipedia's policies, so many of you say, are "civility" and "good faith". I don't see that present in so many of the detractor's comments. Lightoftheworld 15:59, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b></li>
<li>"Those interested in British politics will normally have heard of him." I'm sorry, but that statement is simply untrue, for the very good reason that he's never achieved anything - unless you count attending dinners, writing letters to newspapers and contributing to obscure periodicals which probably count themselves fortunate to have a circulation running into four figures. You just don't get it, do you? It's nothing to do with being left or right wing. To take an example - and I stress I am not comparing the two men in terms of their beliefs - I personally have a deep loathing of Nick Griffin and all he stands for, and in terms of the political process he's a nobody; I do believe however that there needs to be an article on him, because any survey of the British political and cultural landscape which leaves him out will be seriously deficient in explaining the events which affect anyone who lives in modern Britain. On that criterion, GLF is simply a nonentity. I realise he's important to his friends, as we all are; unfortunately that doesn't make him interesting to anyone else, and Wikipedia doesn't exist to provide a fan site for anyone. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Burnett_2542.html" title="User:Stephen Burnett">Stephen Burnett</a> 20:17, 5 June 2006 (UTC).</li>

<li>Almost certainly this <b>entirely new</b> "Stephen Burnett" is a sock-puppet of one of the detractors. Of course everything Lightoftheworld has said is absolutely correct. GLF was very prominent in his day and he was a research assistant for <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Biggs-Davison_64e8.html" title="John Biggs-Davison">John Biggs-Davison</a> for two years at Westminster. He is well known. I once attended a meeting, about ten years ago, at which <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Redwood_dc2f.html" title="John Redwood">John Redwood</a> was the speaker. During questions he sat and answered them, and looked totally disinterested. Then someone quoted GLF. Redwood's face actually lit up and he stood up, to answer with difficulty. This is not a fan mail from me but a statement of fact. <a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESussexman_47c3.html" title="User:Sussexman">Sussexman</a> 07:36, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I notice from your user page that you claim to be a lawyer; perhaps, then, I ought to excuse you for having picked up a few dirty habits. Trying to discredit someone by slinging mud without a shred of evidence, in the hope that some of will stick, may be a well-established legal practice. It's less successful in an environment with more rigorous standards of debate, and a proper right to reply. As I have a user identity and a posting history going back 12 months, accessible at a click, it's not even very bright, as smear tactics go. Let's be charitable: perhaps you've misunderstood the term, and you simply use it to describe anyone who doesn't agree with you. Still, thanks to you we have yet another of GLF's great achievements to add to the record: the mention of his name once caused John Redwood to get off his backside. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Burnett_2542.html" title="User:Stephen Burnett">Stephen Burnett</a> 19:32, 6 June 2006 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hallo Gregory - I cut down, clarified and, I think, greatly improved the article, responding to the numerous requests for editing in this AfD. I didn't edit it out of personal malice or political ill-will, and I am not conscious of working to any agenda other than a desire for Wikipedia to be respected for well written, accurate, comprehensive articles. Please don't refer to me as your "opponent": I am nobody's opponent. My area of expertise is African comparative religion and history; I am not particularly interested in British politics, but I know how a good article should be structured. I am becoming a little tired of you describing me as "scum", "evil", "Marxist" and a "coward and a smearer" because you don't agree with the way I have edited your autobiography. If you have specific criticisms of my editing, let's discuss them on the GLF Talk page - I'm sure we can agree on content and wording - but lay off the personal attacks on me, the nominator and other editors. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumansdorpie_a9a9.html" title="User:Humansdorpie">Humansdorpie</a> 09:24, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Having waded through the article itself and the comments thereon it is clear to me that although he appears to be rather dotty Mr Lauder Frost has a place in the polis and so deserves an entry in the wikipedia. Nevertheless the present entry is far too long and self-serving. It requires severe pruning.

<li><b>Weak keep, broaden scope, and expand</b>. Beyond a simple dicdef, there's a social aspect to this. However, forums are not the only place where this type of thing happens. Double submissions happen with all manner of things: reservations, purchases, registrations, etc. So, what might be better is to rename the article to something more general and cover this broader range of conventions. Discussion as to what kind of software mechanisms are sometimes used to avoid double submissions would be a worthwhile addition to the article. – <a href="../../../z/a/w/User%7EZawersh_d0f7.html" title="User:Zawersh">Zawersh</a> 06:23, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>For those who are new to Wikipedia editing, I should explain that here on Wikipedia editors are often judged by their contribution history. That is, on the merits of their work here. People who don't create an account or sign in are often seen as novices or people unwilling to stand behind their edits. If that bothers you, the easy solution is to create an account. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 02:49, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Notable person; well-known in Western martial arts circles. There's a lot in life you can't find on Google, you know. Ken</p>
<p>Ott Jud is one of the most important grappling master in Western Martial Arts. Many of the fight books of the 1400s and 1500s describe and illustrate Master Ott's grappling techniques. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.244.39.29 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.244.39.29_1e1b.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.244.39.29">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p><b>Keep.</b> Expand, if anything. It looks to me like 71.244.39.29 knows a thing of two about Mr Jud, and I'd like to know more about him. In any event: no reason to dump him other than the article is short of content, and that can be ameliorated. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeaconse_8001.html" title="User:Deaconse">Deaconse</a> 04:28, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Keep...There is a trend in the Martial Arts community over the last decade to delve into the traditional arts of Western Europe. This has coincided with the translations of many period manuals. Ott is well known as a wrestler, and students of both western martial arts, and eastern systems, such as Judo/Jujitsu use sources such as Ott to determine the history of grappling techniques......where certain holds originated, and what variations were common between the different styles.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.177.96.38 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.177.96.38_e35d.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.177.96.38">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li>Sorry for my short explanation. The article is basicially a short summary of books 1 to 6, focusing on the war against Voldemort, which is the main plot element of the books anyway. As such, all the information is already available on character pages (particularily <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_%28character%29_66bc.html" title="Harry Potter (character)">Harry Potter (character)</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Voldemort_f4c6.html" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a>) and pages about individual books.

<li><b>Keep</b> - 1) That <i>"An individual academic program at a university is generally too narrow a topic to warrant an article of its own"</i> is a point of view of your own. hundreds of people apply to these programs and having been one of those i would dearly love to see an objective source about it other than from its own website and very dubious entries on collegeconfidential. 2)<i>"This appears to be nothing more than an abbreviatied college catalog description, somewhat in the nature of an <b>advertisement</b> or <b>recruitment</b> materials. There does not appear to be any historical, social, academic, or political accomplishment or achievement of note atributable to this program."</i> that could be because nobody has put any in yet, or it is still too early, call me biased but i am sure at least some kind of "accomplishment or achievement" will happen sometime in wikipedia's lifetime and should a wikipedian wish to record it down he will happen upon this article. something that doesn't meet standards for an article now doesn't mean all of it should be deleted. don't throw the baby out with the bath water. 3) the last argument that there could be too many JDP's to cover as wikipedia articles... well.. i hear alex S on that one. actual PEOPLE spend years going thru these programs and even more years after seeking employment and a place in society based on the credentials and experience they gain from these programs. It is a life changing decision to join one, and i would at the very least prefer a resource on wikipedia to research. the seeming consensus on redirecting it to the wharton page where there it merely mentions <i>"Wharton Undergraduates may pursue a dual degrees in engineering through the Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology (M&amp;T) and international business through <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Huntsman_Program_in_International_Studies_and_Business_feaa.html" title="The Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business">the Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business</a> (ISB)."</i> is not going to help a lot. and yes i declare my own interest in this to the extent that i have gone and put up a huntsman article, which is far from perfect (i am quite new to this) now but could be a lot better with a lot more work. go ahead and list it for deletion if you want, but i hope more people support me on my rebuttals of points 1-3 and find that it actually does deserve an article by itself. over to you. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShawnthe1_9203.html" title="User:Shawnthe1">ahwang</a> 03:00, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>hm noted. didn't know cos i only started surfing around this corner of wikipedia i think 2 days ago. well anywaes, i hope the present incarnation is far more wiki-worthy. i shall be waiting around to have a feel of its general reception before working on it some more next weekend, got to go back into my dull dreary army camp soon&#160;:( and by working on it some more i mean reworking what is publicly available from the official site into something that people can truly use and is not quite so verbose. i'm somewhat cheered that you didn't immediately AfD the new article. any pointers? <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShawnthe1_9203.html" title="User:Shawnthe1">ahwang</a> 10:09, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Speedy Delete</b> Ok where do we start, this article is 100% pure unadulterated SPAM and its sole purpose is to advertise one company belonging to one individual and provide backlinks to various websites controlled by that individual.

<li><b>STRONG Keep</b> I'm sorry but the easyGroup is one of the most significant companies in the UK and western Europe today.

<li><b>Comment</b> To clarify what's going on here, the user nominating this article tried adding links to etaxis.co.uk and eminicabs.co.uk to the article <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minicab.html" title="Minicab">Minicab</a>, and created EasyPizza which had a link to easypizza.co.uk. A simple examination of those pages show them to be all part of the same <a href="../../../s/e/o/SEO_d889.html" title="SEO">SEO</a> machine. Going one link deep in on any of those websites reveals dozens of (often hidden) links to other websites, and these three sites link to each other. Because of my SEO suspicions, I nominated EasyPizza for deletion, not knowing that there was a legitimate easyPizza company run by <a href="../../../e/a/s/EasyGroup_e8d6.html" title="EasyGroup">easyGroup</a>. During the AfD, other Wikipedians uncovered links to notable sources mentioning the real easyPizza, so I withdrew my AfD nom and fixed easyPizza to refer to the notable company. <a href="../../../l/o/w/User%7ELowercase_608d.html" title="User:Lowercase"><span style="color:#09f">lowercase</span></a> 07:38, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't Mittal is more famous in the UK. He is richer and more important on a global scale, but he's in a business that sells to other businesses, so it is of little interest to those who don't read the business pages. Stelios operates a high profile consumer brand and is familiar on TV. He has certainly been famous in the UK for longer. Abramovich is famous with the general public because he's associated with football, not because he made billions in oil and alunium; Sugar was also been involved in football and has his own TV show; and Branson is head and shoulders above all other British businessmen in fame because he's a marketing genius and has been involved in many consumer businesses. Steelmaking just doesn't interest the British general public much, especially when the plants are overseas. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiccadilly_69e2.html" title="User:Piccadilly">Piccadilly</a> 06:15, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> notable is matter of opinion. Site has over 100,000 unique visitors a month. Alexa is a weak search site and using it to verify notability is a weak argument. Alexa still shows old design which was changed weeks ago. Google search results shows 16,600 results for a search on ircdig and Google gives ircdig.com a page rank of 4. I would call that notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> Why do all you care so much about deleting this article. I agree with packVillian, the article is informative and not advertising. There are numerous other similar articles for most torrent search engines. Looking through most of your guys contribs, it seems all most of you do is recommend articles for deletion. Give the guy a break. It seems well written and nuetral. And yes I registered an account specifically to comment on this but I have been a participant on wikipedia for years.

Further, due to the shenanigans in the 2002 election, she would be notable from that alone. Basically, there was a big fight between her and the Democrat party. She tried to become a Democrat and steal the Democrat nomination (ala Pat Buchanan / Reform Party). I didn't see this AFD when it first came out. As such, there are a bunch of deletes in the now-several days old AFD. If there are no responses after this one, I would encourage the closing admin to relist it for further consensus. (If other people reading this still feel she is non-notable, ok, that's fine, I'm not going to get too upset over it - just if nobody but the closing admin reads this, it's probably worth further consideration since the seven people voting to delete are probably aware that she has any notability beyond a failed candidacy.) <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 03:03, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b>. As an admin who watches articles related to the LaRouche Movement, I don't care one way or another. Spannaus is a figure in that movement, but her overall notability (such as it is) rests in her U.S. Senate campaigns. As with other LaRouche candidates (see <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janice_Hart_3c1c.html" title="Janice Hart">Janice Hart</a>), Spannaus' minor degree of success seems to have been based on ignorance of her positions rather then knowledge of them. How many articles do we have about people who's chief claim to fame is getting 20% of the vote in a statewide election? However if there is a considerable lack of reliable sources to base an article upon, then it may be impossible to write a verifiable, NPOV article about her. In that sense it may not meet the notability standard of having reliable, 3rd party sources. It's up to you, closing administrator!

<li><b>Keep</b> First of all, the nominator did not disclose that this article has been nominated for deletion twice; there was no consensus first time and keep (by a wide margin- 13 to 5) the second time. Much like the <a href="../../../g/n/a/GNAA_29cf.html" title="GNAA">GNAA</a>, there's no reason to keep re-nominating an article. Second of all, while I feel that this list is POV, it's at least POV that pretty much everyone can agree with- not many people are going to tell you that <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Rigs_345a.html" title="Big Rigs">Big Rigs</a> was a particularly great experience. The fact that there's already a note to use the talk page before adding to the article certainly helps its cause. As a huge gamer, I greatly despise gamecruft on WP, but in my opinion, this isn't it. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 12:56, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And, by the way, if you look at the talk page, the note in the main article is true- each game somebody wants to put on the list is first proposed to the community (via the talk page), or else it's simply removed from the page. Thus, while the article is POV, at least there's a consensus as far as what belongs on the list and what does not. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 13:02, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep but rewrite beginning</b> While the list itself is a good collection with references, the article before the list itself is indeed very POV, especially the "2D as out-of-fashion" section which is disputable from many angles including the many popular 2D games released for newer handheld consoles including not only the likes of the Gameboy Advance but also of mobile phones.

And about the "2D out of fashion theory": the only systems where they're considered "hip" are lowly handhelds and Java games (for technical reasons, mostly, but even on those platforms, developers and manufacturers are striving for "3D at all costs" strategy too, so there's definitively a bias or policy in the industry. <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpiVictor_855c.html" title="User:EpiVictor">EpiVictor</a> 17:47, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Two reasons for nomination. "Not a Dictionary" is the main one. The second is that the page did contain text that was proposed for merge into two other articles. I have performed the merge and turned it into a disambig page, but I keep coming back to the "Not a dictionary" reason. Thus the seciond is a subset of the first <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 13:06, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I really should write more clearly. What I mean is that a "pole" as an object, is something that requires a dictionary definition, not an encyclopaedic definition. As an article here it is not <i>important</i>. As a disambig page it is not important either because wikilinks to Pole (object) are, to me, not encyclopaedic links, so should not really exist either, though links to a particular kind of pole, such as a barber's pole make perfect sense because they are enclyclopaedic. Lack of this disambig page ought therefore to lead to better articles since they will, one hopes, link to the correct places. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 13:20, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>While I agree wholeheartedly that the pre-disambig version was not bad it was pretty much a duplicate of the two pages it was suggested for merge into, and was by no means expansive enough to be what it purported to be - a set fo definitions of poles which are objects. After the merge it became a page which is either incomplete and needs strengthening with everything one couold possibly disambiguate a pole to be, or is a duplicate of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Pole.html" title="Pole">Pole</a>, which I should doubtless have found before nominating it. There is thus an argument for turning it into a redirect page instead of deleting it. It is a very week disambig page as it stands. I was frankly unsure which course to take, hence the nomination whcih will give correct guidance. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 13:55, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>From the talk page, posted by User:216.183.37.60 on 19:45, 1 October 2004:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Given that Laos, Burma and Viet Nam are all republics, and totalitarian ones at that, I find it impossible to believe that a group made up of people pretending to royal status in the countries in question would be able to have any dialogue whatsoever with the Communist governments of Laos, Burma and Viet Nam. Even in Europe, such as in Austria, Greece and Italy, no republic would even deal with an actual royal figure until they disavowed their favored status and accepted the legality and legitimacy of the ruling government.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Further, in the article posted by the same clique which posted this on the "Vietnamese Constitutional Monarchist League" it says that they hold that the last legitimate ruler of Viet Nam was the French puppet Emperor Bao Dai. Therefore, how could they hope to have a dialogue with a government they refuse to even accept as a legitimate power? Additionally, the website for the British House of Commons, which lists all committees of every kind, has no mention of this group, and it seems highly unlikely that they ever would considering that the United Kingdom and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam fully recognize each other, have exchanged ambassadors and are on friendly relations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If the British government was actually sponsoring a group composed of royal pretenders claiming status from the countries in question, and working in opposition to the ruling government, I assure you the Vietnamese government would protest loudly and probably break off all diplomatic relations with the British. -Nguyen Van Tuan</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Al Cabino has launched this campaign. It ahs been covered by major news sources. Why should it be deleted? Maybe people recognize him as a sneaker celebrity, and there are around 19,000 signatures on his petitions. I mean like geez, Guy Goma has his own page, and he didn't do anything.Also, it has nothing to do with slow newsdays. Guys, this page on Al Cabino is not just about the petition campaign going on now! He has a movie deal and a book deal in the works, so why should we delete the page on the basis that there are slow newsdays? Harrydude 17:38, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article was <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedied under CSD A7</a> before, but apparently recreated. Since another attempt to speedy would probably just begin a cycle of delete-recreate-delete ad nauseum, I have brought this to AFD. Subject has not done anything of note for inclusion in Wikipedia, even for a model. Therefore, I propose that this article be deleted unless we can find some reason why she should have an entry in a general encyclopedia. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Beaudoin_Jr._f03b.html" title="User:Joe Beaudoin Jr.">Joe Beaudoin Jr.</a> <sup style="font-variant:small-caps;"><a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoe_Beaudoin_Jr._eb69.html" title="User talk:Joe Beaudoin Jr.">Think out loud</a></sup> 18:09, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>AFAICT, most ghits are commercial sites, many linked to each other. What we need for WP inclusion is a <i>neutral</i> site, that reliably indicates to us that she is <i>well known</i>, i.e. notable per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. If there is one, I couldn't find it.

<li>Any notable persons are acceptable for WP, porn stars or not.

Just a bunch of interlinked ads and promos do not confer notability. There must be a neutral source (e.g. that does not get money from promoting the person) that vouches for notability. If you think a person is notable, all you need is to point to <i>one</i> such neutral and reliable source, and it's a keeper.

<li>So from now on, if this one gets kept, all an aspiring porn star, eager for free Wiki advertizing has to do, is get in a minor dispute with an agent, have a minor lawsuit, get cited for it in the porn press, and voila - instant free lifetime wiki-publicity. Somehow I don't think this is what our Founding wiki-Fathers had in mind for an <i>encyclopedia</i>, nor is it my own read of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28pornographic_actors%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28pornographic_actors%29" rel="nofollow">porn notability criteria</a>, but I could be wrong. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 00:31, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article has almost no content. "Napsis" gets about 940 Google hits, many of which are completely unrelated. Article doesn't really assert notability, and I can't find any myself. (Their product, nTPV, may well qualify for an article, but that's kind of unrelated.) It was tagged for cleanup in October, 2004 (not that there was anything to clean up, really), and in August, 2005 <a href="../../../h/o/p/User%7EHopeSeekr_of_xMule_05f3.html" title="User:HopeSeekr of xMule">HopeSeekr of xMule</a> added a notice that said <i>"This is a non-notable company that was created by a person from auna.net, a Spanish ISP. It is thus probably purely self-promotional and thus should be removed."</i> Not surprisingly, doing that didn't get the article removed, but what <i>did</i> happen is that <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_espinola_f2ae.html" title="User:Steve espinola">Steve espinola</a> removed the notice <i>and</i> the clean-up tag. Steve espinola is now apparently blocked for sockpuppetry and there was apparently some kind of a thing going on over there that I don't really want any part of, but despite the apparently unrelated dramatics, the article doesn't seem to meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 18:24, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> While there are lists, articles, books, etc. elsewhere about the "worst films ever" WP can't have an article by such a title (unless it were about one of those specific books), so the title seems a reasonable way to address the topic in an encyclopedic way. The criteria for inclusion seems narrowly written enough so that wikipedians don't simply add their own most hated movies. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 19:08, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I guess I'll be the first to stab at a controversal issue. First off, the original nomination was more focued on morality and "unnatural love." This article really has more to deal with notability. And when I review the article itself, it could be condensed. I honestly believe that this article is a <b>keep</b>. Having notability from an actress that meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a>, should be enough to keep an article afloat. I'm going to borrow some text from <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> and use it in this context, "Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable." Being involved with an actress that is notable, and under those circumstances should keep this article afloat. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> 06:20, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, the Traci Lords controversy was notable... and it pushes this back into the keep column, along with its IMDB entry. The reason for the original VFD nom (from the link supplied by the nominator) was bogus since morality has nothing to do with it as far as I'm concerned. Although... this keep vote shouldn't be take as any kind of support for articles on porncruft like Electric Blue 1-27 and 29-X. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 10:10, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per GWO/Gareth Owen. Traci Lords made <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000183/bio" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000183/bio" rel="nofollow">"somewhere between 80 and 100 X-rated movies between 1984 and 1986"</a> we can't have an article for every one of them. We probably do want to have an article for some (she was one of the top stars of her time, even besides the scandal), but I see nothing about this particular movie that makes it stand out.

<li>I will move it to wikibooks. The comment that this is an attempt to use wiki as a web hosting service is unfair. This tutorial page is an attempt to provide needed documentation for free for an open source project. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ecarew (<a href="../../../e/c/a/User_talk%7EEcarew_45e7.html" title="User talk:Ecarew">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ecarew_7500.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ecarew">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Transwiki</b> to wikibooks. This is uncyclopedic material, but I'm sure it'll make a wonderfull addition to wikibooks. Maybe wikibooks needs a bit of a publicity drive so more people will realise it exists and will try over there first for this kind of thing. <a href="../../../y/d/a/User%7EYdam_9ecb.html" title="User:Ydam">Ydam</a> 20:36, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge with Android</b> Along with all the many terms listed there. It's a valid idea that if humans start to build robots that very closely resemble humans, they will build robots that very closely resemble creatures which are similar but not human. A group of star trek fans might create a robot designed to mimic a <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulcan.html" title="Vulcan">vulcan</a>, which would not fit the traditional definition of <a href="../../../a/n/d/Android.html" title="Android">android</a>. Such robots are likely to created by hollywood for entertainment, or by the toy industry, for entertainment or education. An 'anthroid' featured in the scifi short story 'Super toys last all summer long' which became the basis for the film AI.

<dd>RVDDP2501, don't take the afd personally, its not to undervalue your hard work. The concern is that your subject may not be appropriate for an encyclopedia on notability grounds. If you can show <i>verifiable</i> proof that this comic is read and known widely enough, your article would pass the Afd test. I also suggested that the highly commendable project, <b><a href="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Andorozon" class="external text" title="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Andorozon" rel="nofollow">Wikifur</a></b> may a better home (with a better audience) for your efforts.

<p><b>Keep</b>/<b>Clean up</b> Why is the Extinctioner artical up for deletion? If it is just because of its popularity, then it has already been proven that the Extinctioner comic series already has a large fanbase with numerous fangroups and a distrabution region that spreads over two continents. It may not be as popular as "Spiderman", "X-men", "Daredevil", or "Star Wars", but many underground comics are not widely known. Does the artical provide too much information? In a sense, yes. It focuses too much on the characters themselves than the actual history of the continuity of Extinctioners and the comic's history. If the artical in question is being targeted because of it's assosiation to Furdom, then there is no reason to continue this discussion. Should Extinctioners move to Wikifur? No, I do not believe that it should. If I may, I would like to point out several other comics, such as Shanda the Panda[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanda_the_Panda" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanda_the_Panda" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>], Atomic Mouse[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Mouse" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Mouse" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>], Albedo Anthropomorphics[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo_Anthropomorphics" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo_Anthropomorphics" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>], and Buck O'Hare[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucky_O%27Hare#Comic_book" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucky_O%27Hare#Comic_book" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>], are not apart of Wikifur despite the fact that they are listed as Furry Comics[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_furry_comics" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_furry_comics" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>] right here in Wikipedia.

<p><b>Weak keep</b>&amp;<b>Transwiki</b> Upon further revision of this article, I've noticed that it does, indeed contain a uselessly large amount of information. It should be cut down to a minimal size, with only a short summary of main characters as a group, and the rest should be transferred to a main article on Wikifur. Though the article has a right to exist on Wikipedia, it does not need more than a simple summary and a link to a more thorough article on a personal site. Dikastis</p>

<p><b>SHAWNTAE HOWARD, CREATOR</b> Extinctioners is a quarterly comic not an annual, but due to injuries, graduate studies, and serious family issues over the past 2 years, yes, it has come out with only 2 issues a year, the primary comic and it's annual. However, I do not see why that would cause it for grounds for deletion from wikipedia, nor do I personally consider the comic book 'furry' since it also features a main human cast so I'd say I personally feel a little insulted that the idea that it belongs on wikifur is it's appropriate location. The creator of the page did indeed e-mail me and asked me for permission to create the page, which I consented and gave him information on character bios, which he used in his article (such as the person who created the less detailed wikifur page did). The company that the comic is published by has been in existance for 10 years and still is currently publishing, infact an issue of Extinctioners is available for pre-order right this moment in the current month's Diamond Previews listed under Shanda Fantasy Arts. It's readership spans the globe, with the internet only helping it's notority, with only the limited resources of foreign readers being able to easily aquire an issue. The comic has also spanned a number of yahoo fan groups with memberships in the thousands. I'm not sure who reported that the book was not worthy of a wikipage in the first place, probably out of some sort of spite, but if onther comic related material can have a page I don't see why this one doesn't as well. It's a comic that's been in existance for 10 years now, regardless of it's frequncey of issues per year, there still are issues per year, with the latest currently in production from me (and it's page lenght went from 32, to 48, now down to 40 of which I do all of the work on from writing, penciling, inking, and greytoning, so yes, it takes a one man production crew time to complete when I'm also a working teacher who's taking graduate classes and supporting a family at the same time.) I'm not sure if this is enough proof to maintain the page on wiki, but if no, please feel free to e-mail me at howart@peoplepc.com and I can further answer any inuquires. Additional note, a poster stated that the last publishede issue was March 2005, this is incorrect, the latest issue #15 came out just 2 months ago, the SFA page has not yet been updated by it's webmaster. <a href="http://www.rabbitvalley.com/item_6468_1959___Extinctioners-Volume-2-Number-15.html" class="external free" title="http://www.rabbitvalley.com/item_6468_1959___Extinctioners-Volume-2-Number-15.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabbitvalley.com/item_6468_1959___Extinctioners-Volume-2-Number-15.html</a> Is proof of its existance and availability.</p>

<dd>Just checked on WikiFur, and they already have an article on Extinctioners. The main characters have their own articles there, which I do not think should be done here.

<p><b>Shawntae Howard: Creator</b> Perhaps it is felt that it belongs on Wikifur is because the main characters happen to be humaniod animals. However, I as it's creator do not consider the comic "Furry" as it is traditionally thought of at all, and while the individual who worked on the page focused on those characters, they were in the process of including the human characters from the comic as well, as he was asking for information about those particular characters as well. Also, I notice that on wikipedia an article for the comic Gold Digger, written by Fred Perry is allowed, a comic that also started out with a strong anthropomorphic cast and features human main characters as well, yet it is not recommended that this article would be an excellent article for Wikifur. I've noted that there is an article on Albedo Anthropomorphics, a sci fi comic with an all anthropomorphic cast on Wikipedia, yet it hasn't been recommended as an article best suited for Wikifur (when it could be argued that that book was a large influence in the creation of many anthro related comic book titles, including the much acclaimed Usagi Yojimbo, who got it's start within the pages of that comic.) May I also note that very short articles on the 'furry' comic titles of Furrlough, Wild Life, and Genus have Wikipedia articles, yet not comments that these would be best suited for Wikifur, when techincally since they do advertise themselves AS furry comics, it would make since that is where they belong. If it's a question of who publishes Extinctioners, would it be more relevent if it were published by Antartic Press, who I am ironically in negotiations to do just that? Evidence of it's continued production can be seen here: <a href="http://www.furaffinity.net/full/99828/" class="external free" title="http://www.furaffinity.net/full/99828/" rel="nofollow">http://www.furaffinity.net/full/99828/</a> ,</p>

These are examples of pages currently in production for the next issue (Apologies for not adding shorting links, I'm not familiar with how to do that on these pages).</p>
<p>It is also stated that the reasons it would be better on Wikifur is because it already has an article done by someone on it, but may I also point out that many of Wikipedia subjects are repeated on Wikifur as well, such as the above stated articles on Antartic Press, Gold Digger, Atomic Mouse (also published by Shanda Fantasy Arts), and Furrlough to just give a brief example. Granted, one source may be more informative than the other depending on the individual who wrote them, however, I haven't seen complaints that one belongs on the other as I have with the Extinctioners article, which may now be on Wikifur, but was not as detailed as the one on wikipedia until the creator of the article just recently moved it there due to this complaint and deletion hearing. And if it is felt it is a bit 'heavy' for wikipedia due to it's amount of informative information about the characters, then I'd like to point out any of your other superhero article such as Justice League or X-Men related characters. The fact that so much information on each character can be found should be a testiment to just how much the individual who created the page has gotten from the comics and online sources. Perhaps if the creator trimmed down the amount of images in the article to just one per character it discusses that would be acceptable, though I'd like to point out these links: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-men" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-men" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-men</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Frost" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Frost" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Frost</a> as an example of an article with multiple images featuring a single character.</p>
<p>Or is the bottem line that because the book is published by an independent company rather than one of the mainstream companies it's validity as a wikipedia article is not as up to standard or is it it's content that makes it so (which again, I'll say again, if its due to the anthropomorphic cast that has been talked about in the article thus far is the issue, there are a number of human ones too, if humans make people less xenophobic). I do not say that Wikifur is a bad place, nor that I'm disturbed that an article on it has appeared there, but I as the creator, do not consider the comic furry anymore than the creator of Gold Digger or Ninja High School would just because they use anthropomorphic characters in their story telling. I hope that's not the case, because if someone decides to do an article on the currently acclaimed small press comic Mouse Guards, I hope it too won't be considered more appropriate to be a wikifur article because it's cast are anthropomorphic mice. 207.69.137.34Shawntae Howard</p>

<dd>Mr. Howard, My comment about this article being a bit heavy for the general WikiPedia has nothing to do with the fact that the article as it currently stands is primarily about the anthro/furry characters. Rather, it is about the sheer number of images, and the level of detail. The weight of the characters, for Ghu's sake? Date of birth in a non-standard year count (when is year 989?)</dd>
<dd>your pointing out Emma Frost as a comparison is partially invalid, as there is more text per picture, and the images are scattered throughout the text. In Extinctioners, once down into the character info, there is almost 50/50 text to image. I have also pointed the main author of the page toward some templates the Comic Project has that I thought might be useful. <a href="../../../v/i/k/User%7EVik-Thor_5caa.html" title="User:Vik-Thor">VikÞor</a> [[User talk:Vik-Thor|Talk]] 03:08, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b>/<b>Clean up</b> I'm a little bit disturbed, actually, that this entry is being contested on the grounds of popularity rather than factual validity or intellectual property. There are no certain stipulations in the Wikipedia policy that outline exactly how popular certain media or certain topics must be in order to justify their existence. I think the reasons for this are clear. Wikipedia would lose a lot of its intellectual appeal if it filtered articles on the grounds of popularity. An infrequently visited article isn't irrelevant, and no one can truly predict when a thread will be popular or unpopular. The other arguments for the removal of the Extinctioners entry seem to imply that the author of the article did not have permission of the creator, which he did (see Mr. Howard's entry) or that the article is being used as a 'marketing tool', an expression just as subjective as 'popularity'. If file space and/or bandwidth are the core issues behind the loosely used expressions I just stated, we can take steps to reduce image file size and streamline the article. However, this is likely not the issue since it was stated that the entry receives little traffic. I don't wish to slander anyone with claims of bias, but I can't help but think that irrational and emotional motives are governing some of the claims to remove this entry. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.174.54.67 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.174.54.67_0dda.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.174.54.67">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<p><b>Keep</b>/<b>Clean up</b> The Comic is past it's peak but still very Notable in underground circles. I've seen Extinctioners Full sized Plushes, two video games, Custome Heroclicks, A role playing game, a Soundtrack and there are at least Two Spinoff comics, purhaps more I Havn't located yet. it's been featured by Diamond Preveiws twice, and it has several fanclubs that have dozens of members. It's very underground, and fans aren't totoaly organized but they DO number quite a bit. Shanda Fantasy Arts isn't "Next to Self-Publishing" Either. It's a private publishing group run by comic book insiders. its very small-print but well known in underground comic circles. They've worked with Stan Lee, Dan Decarlo and Stan Sakai in the past. Exticntioners IS well know, just in a diferent way. I say the article should be cleaned up for Wiki standards, IE Drop the extensive profiles and talk a bit more about the actual history of the comic rather than it's fiction. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Joshua the samurai (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Joshua_the_samurai_293a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Joshua the samurai">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p><b>Keep</b> To Vik-Thor OH, well, that makes more sense then and gives some concrete information of what can be done to prevent the page's deletion. Now the page creator actually has something to go on, because before, one has to admit, the reasonings given for possible deletion were a little on the vague side. I will inform him to reduce the number of images and needless data then. Out of curiosity and personal noisiness, just why was the article nominated for deletion in the first place? What was the inital grounds or complaint in the first place? 207.69.137.13 Shawntae Howard</p>
<dl>
<dd>The first reason for deletion is the one right at the top of the list, under the big red box. Basically, it's a question of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> as defined by the site guidelines.<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> 04:59, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><s><b>Keep</b></s>: Then I would assume that since it has been proven contrary to the point that the topic has more notability than originally thought and it has as much notability as other comics that currently have articles on wikipedia, that the issue for deletion, if that is afterall the primary reason for it's possible deletion, has been more than met? Again the latest issue of the comic was released in February 2006, it's next publication is in the current Diamond's Preview for release in August 2006, evidence presented in the form of links show that it has a very active online presence with an active fan base. And that it is considered a comic book first, not pigeon holed as a "furry comic". In addition, Extinctioners has gotten a full page review 3 yearas ago in The Comic Buyer's Guide and received a B rating and it is currently listed among other comics in the 2006 edition of the Overstreet Price Guide, currently available in any national book store such as Barnes and Noble or Borders.207.69.139.9 Shawntae Howard</p>

<dd>For the record, it's common practice to point out new or short-edit-count users in AfD discussions, because often they're being recruited to join the argument on the incorrect consideration that AfD is a vote, which it is <b>not</b>. Taking a poke at someone for doing what's pretty well standard procedure is not a good way to make an impression in an AfD discussion. Second, I'd like to point out that while the notability guidelines are just that, they're also the basis for keeping or deleting about every article of the hundred or so that hit AfD every day. Finally, I'm kind of trying to help *keep* the article, so I'm a bit upset that you'd suggest I'm doing something to not keep it. Please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>.

<dd>I will be pleased to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> when others do the same, sir. You tell me to assume good faith, but permit Bwithh to continue assuming lack of good faith withotu comment, and then tell me that something that <i>clearly</i> states it is <i>not</i> a guideline is, in fact, a guideline. I am not attempting to "make an impression". I am pointing out inconsistencies that others have not mentioned. I would ask you to please reconcile your words with your actions, sir. If you wish to continue conversing I will see about creating a user account so that you do not have the impression of holding a conversation with a shadow, but until such time, I remain respectfully anonymous. 12:32 EDT 07 June 2006
<dl>
<dd>What I'm trying to do is keep this discussion from going to hell, and while I do agree that Bwithh has been actively pointing out new editors and has made a couple of comments I'd rather he hadn't, arguing with him over it is basically counterproductive. As for notability, I'd suggest you take a look through the AfD pages for previous days and survey how many of them use 'NN' or 'non-notable' as an argument. Once again, I'm not against the article - I'm going to give it a rewrite this evening and try my best to save the damn thing. If you'd like to continue discussion, I suggest you do so at my talk page. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> 16:44, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As it has been pointed out its pretty standard to note new users and editors with a short history in an afd discussion (for similar reasons, we have the the warning sign template for this kind of situation). This practice doesn't break the good faith guideline. Anyway, I apologize if certain people feel offended at my occasional attempt at humour (I try not to be too serious all the time in the afd process). I'm not opposed to furry fan culture per se. I just feel that the hard work going into the Extinctioners article is more suited to a home on the excellent Wikifur project than in a general encyclopedia, in terms of notability etc. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 21:56, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello:</p>
<p>My Log in Name is Lordgriffin, and yess I woudl like to talk about Extinctioners. i hope this is within the scope of what is permissible. I am currently a Major in military Inteligence deployed with the U.S. Army in Iraq, and I am a fan of teh comix.</p>
<p>Your service is gowing and known and it was quite extraordinary that you posted on extinctioners, and I admit i am a little distressed that you ight delet it. I do not know much about your administration but if tere is a large concern about content, it woudl seem a better policy, if yoru able, to screen these things BEFORE hand.</p>
<p>I thin what concernes me most is he way our society looks atthese policies, it is actually more accepted to write and draw about torture and murder, then it is to be suggestive about sexuality.</p>
<p>Your site is of course yours, I hope you will find Extinctioners DOES have a place here, but I recognize you will do what you consider best for your site</p>
<p>If allowed a Vote I vote to KEEP Extinctioners</p>

<li><b>keep</b> in this case, verifiable legitimacy is determined by the presence of a figure within his or her respective field insofar as that presence is discussed in the article itself, not said figure's presence within that field as represented in a search performed on yahoo! or any other such drag of mainstream domain. a verifiable presence within an artist's respective field, to all intents and purposes, then, remains a highly subjective evaluation; unfortunately, it may very well be up to the article's creator, ultimately, to determine the ultimate legitimacy of all content within the article in question, including but not limited to the article's subject. as the submission policy is currently written, the creator assumes all [forms of] liability for the information contained within the article -- unless the creator is found to be in violation of copyright law as presented to the creator under the policies of the site, or has submitted something libelous to which an outside party to this discussion can later make a claim after having witnessed the article in question, there doesn't appear to be a case for its deletion. --Brandon8ter 23:56, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Google doesn't tell the whole story. This guy has apparently several lawyers poring over the net looking for mention of himself. He's quite notable for the sheer number of lawsuits he's promised against his critics. One of the ones he actually filed, "Crookes v. openpolitics.ca", has very substantial implications for the use of wiki to debate politics in Canada, and will likely become a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_1332.html" title="Canadian Charter of Rights">Canadian Charter of Rights</a> case soon.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Obviously the article needs to be renamed but the material is verifiable, and the people above clearly have not done their research, not even looking for the back links or the stories in the Canadian press. As the primary funder of the GP of C in 2004, Crookes is very hard to separate from the rise of that party to national prominence. In 2001 he was notable in the rise of the GP of BC too. Both of these parties have had a substantial impact on politics, if only by splitting votes. There must be some consideration also for people who actively try to suppress mention of themselves, which is notable in itself.Crekshin</li>

<p>This seems like a very specialized part of a fictional world.

<p>I can find zero Google hits for "switch perception" which refer to this company. There are only three hits for "Switch, Inc." + "Hugo Carrillo", and of those hits, one is a press release and the other hits don't seem to exist any more (or at least the page they go to no longer contains the information). The "famous and acclaimed" movie director Hugo Carrillo does not exist at imdb. There is a director named <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0889829/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0889829/" rel="nofollow">Francisco Vargas</a>, though no executive producer by that name that I can find, but I don't know if the person I linked to is the same person or not. Ricardo Bárcelo-Villagrán also does not exist at imdb, and only has four Google hits.

<li><b>Defence</b> I am the author of the article. I take all your points and I was at pains to point out that this is an artist's cv which usually accompanies exhibitions and publicity. While it may seem like vanity publishing to some, this is the accepted method for artists to have written documentation of their work. It is not an ego trip in my opinion as I am attempting to only put down salient facts relating to my work.

<li><b>Thanks</b> Thanks Bachrach44. I didn't understand the way that Wikipedia works. I apologise for any inconvenience caused. I also note in the vanity guide page that short biogs can be included on the user page. It seems obvious now but I didn't appreciate that at the time.

<p>Contested PROD. Article doesn't give much information, and I don't see what could be added - anything that refers to athletics in the three major governing bodies (NCAA, NAIA and CIS) could go there, while anything else is either apparently not notable enough ("only followed by competitors and their close friends and families") or would be put into an article for that particular governing body. <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzzy510_a9be.html" title="User:Fuzzy510">fuzzy510</a> 23:24, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is an important topic and this article needs to be improved. Breaking things up obscures the broader picture. That's why Britannica is divided into a "Micropaedia" and a "Macropaedia". This article needs to explain the context, eg how did college athletics get started? What are the landmark developments since then? How do the three major governing bodies relate to one another? Why is it so much more prominent in USA than elsewhere?

<p><b>the business of building an encylopedia</b></p>
<p>A 'encyclopedia' is a store-house of knowledge covering all topics, just as a dictionary is. That includes individuals, organisations, objects and interests. To the communities of Australia our work is of current and historical relevance, as it is world-wide as an example of art, freedom fighting and social justice. A true 'encyclopedia' is one that is compiled objectively, outside of the ethno-centric value systems of an elite (in this case the millioneth of a % who own a computer and have access to the internet.) If you regard your monitoring and contributions here to be of significance then it will encompass that and accomodate the value of our accomplishments. Look through the links for the events and actions we have facilitated and read the responses and impetus they have generated and then ask: 'What have I created and accomplished and, bearing that in mind, what power do I have to eradicate information about others who are inspired to create history?'</p>

<p><i>History, til this point has purely been a record endorsing the self-serving interests of the rich elite. One potential benefit of the internet (when it becomes accessible to the poor) will be the opportunity to break that standard. Instead of remaining an account which justifies the excesses of a few who reserve the tools that preserve information for themselves, the stranglehold may be broken. Let's hope that accounts, such as the music of social justice, illuminate a pathway to this.</i></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hey gang, sorry about all this, but I'm new to the rules of Wikipedia. I wrote the expanded text entry for 'The Ocean Blue' over the past few days. I am indeed a third party and just a die-hard fan and collector for the past 16 years. I've met the band once about a decade ago, but always keep up on their current goings on. It wasnt until after I wrote the Wikipedia entry this weekend, that I realized that I was writing in the form of a 'biography', when I SHOULD have been writing in the form of a true 'encyclopedic' entry. I will gladly clean up this entry to make sure that opinion, conjecture and bias are removed. I just wanted to try my best to write a solid, fact-filled submittal. Please feel free to help me correct any errors or Wikipedia rules that I may have broken. Everything I've written I can backup with hard-copy from my collection, but since much of the band's hey-day was 'pre-internet', its tough to cite facts with an online link. In addition, the bands website features an email, so I'm sure the group can clear up and confirm any questions of accuracy. Thanks folks, MAPAZ. MAPAZ 01:27, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
