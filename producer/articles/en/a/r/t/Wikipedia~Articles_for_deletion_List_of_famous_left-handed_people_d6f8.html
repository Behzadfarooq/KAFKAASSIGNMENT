<li><b>Keep</b>. Left-handedness is a fascinating subject of academic study where it is linked with other character traits; having such a list is therefore helpful.

<dl>
<dd>Because famous people have usually become famous for something exceptional they have done (<a href="../../../c/h/a/Chantelle_Houghton_3e80.html" title="Chantelle Houghton">there are always exceptions, of course</a>), so readers may wish to spot themes and trends in the list of people provided. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 13:54, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>People wishing to "spot themes" should either read about the studies done or conduct their own. Using this list is an arbitray and inaccurate method, and it would be a disservice to whatever people to represent it otherwise. Plus, as you already say, there is hardly a trend that will encompass even the majority of these people, because the only real theme here is that they share an arbitrary criterion.

<p>I'm terribly sorry to put this ugly box here, but I really want to get people's attention to clarify a point. Some people have realized this but from the discussion it is clear that not all have. A number of people are suggesting that this article be changed into a category. I think that you should know that the reason that this list article is here at AfD in the first place is likely because I placed Category:Famous lefthanded people on CfD about 9½ hours to prior (or it could be just a coincidence). At any rate, it may be prudent to let the CfD run its course and then possibly re-list this AfD at that time (or at least be aware that the category may no longer be there by the time that the AfD is closed). --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/f/t/User_talk%7EAfter_Midnight_381d.html" title="User talk:After Midnight">0001</a></small></sup> 21:42, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> There is a major psychological irony here that should be noted. Left brained dominated people (a majority of right handed people) tend to think far more often in terms of ego/power/hierarchy and competition. Whereas left handers are mainly co-operative non-power seekers (Einstein, Gandhi, Bob Geldof etc.) Thus the right handed become aggravated and incensed in any possibility where their ego/power/hierarchy is threatened. This list is a good example. What this list does is proffer examples why the human species should think more in terms of the right brain/left hand. It is the higher genius element that we can all tap into. Repressing or deleting this information just continues the retrogressive and/or destructive trend of the "left brained dominated".<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Earthacademy (<a href="../../../e/a/r/User_talk%7EEarthacademy_c4cc.html" title="User talk:Earthacademy">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Earthacademy_1470.html" title="Special:Contributions/Earthacademy">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> boy I sure hope that last entry was meant as a joke. Actually, I think one of the problems with the list is its inherent lack of objectivity. It's a pretty safe bet to assume the list is maintained by left-handed people who undoubtedly are in fact seeking something that ressembles a "list of left-handers that left-handers can be proud of", like Einstein, Gandhi and Bob Geldof. On the other hand, the list is fairly harmless and you do get to learn interesting things like how <a href="../../../p/o/l/Pol_Pot_2322.html" title="Pol Pot">Pol Pot</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_the_Ripper_b953.html" title="Jack the Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a> are really co-operative non-power seekers (or so Earthacademy would want us to believe). <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 22:40, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Interesting but some of the information is incorrect e.g Hitler wasn't left handed [<a href="http://www.holocaustcenterbuff.com/hitler.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.holocaustcenterbuff.com/hitler.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] the Devil may have been though&#160;?</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - WP is <i>NOT</i> a list of random things. This is amazingly broad, at least 1/3 of the worlds population is left handed and guess what, there are a LOT of famous people.
