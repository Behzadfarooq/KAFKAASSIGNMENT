<p>Early January, following the traditional festival of the Three Kings, also called 'the Three wise men', the French eat the 'galette des rois'. This, to the sheer delight of the local bakers, who sell these cakes with a trinket inside it, by the millions each year.</p>
<p>The traditional feast is celebrated by many churches on the 6th of January. In France, however, the feast of the 3 Kings is celebrated on the second Sunday after Christmas and is called 'Epiphany' after an ancient Greek word meaning 'to appear'.</p>
<p>Teh 'Galette des rois' literally means 'the cake of the kings'. Eating the galette does no longer have much religious significance in contemporary France, although the theme is rooted in religious traditions. With much fanfare, the trinket-hiding galette is presented at dessert during an evening meal between friends and family.</p>
<p>The person who finds the trinket is chosen 'the king' or 'the queen' and is crowned with a little paper crown provided along with the cake. He or She will then have to invite the friends or family present to a feast where another galette has to be served.</p>

<p>Storm 106 is a web based radio station broadcasting from Ireland. Storm 106 commenced broadcasting in January 2002 on 106.2MHz FM. In 2004, pressure from the Communications regulator ComReg have forced the station into a clandestine existance. The station can still be heard on 106.2MHz FM in parts of NE Ireland, however this is a relay of their webstream at <a href="http://www.storm106.com" class="external free" title="http://www.storm106.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.storm106.com</a>. No mention is ever made on live broadcasts of an FM frequency - only their website and it is not known if the signal on FM is being operated by the station.</p>

<p>Deadline Auto Theft tis a <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> independent film written and directed by <a href="../../../h/2E/b/H.B_%27Toby%27_Halicki_62c3.html" title="H.B 'Toby' Halicki">H.B 'Toby' Halicki</a>. It centers around a group of car thieves and the 48 cars they must steal in a matter of days. The film is infamous for having wrecked and destroyed 186 cars in a 17 minute car chase scene and a 40 minute <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car_chase.html" title="Car chase">car chase</a> scene. The cars were a 1974 Bricklin SV-1 and a 1973 Ford Mustang Mach 1 named <a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleanor.html" title="Eleanor">Eleanor</a>. <a href="../../../h/2E/b/H.B_%27Toby%27_Halicki_62c3.html" title="H.B 'Toby' Halicki">H.B 'Toby' Halicki</a> simply went out his way as a directer by combining the best of Gone In 60 Seconds and The Junkman. He was able to reprise he role as the legendary car thief who can't be stopped. He asked his friend <a href="../../../h/o/y/Hoyt_Axton_4dee.html" title="Hoyt Axton">Hoyt Axton</a> to play the police captain hot on his trial. It simply turns into the most brilliant films ever made.</p>

A South American drug lord pays Pace and his team to steal 48 cars for him, all but one, a 1973 <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Mustang_816d.html" title="Ford Mustang">Ford Mustang</a> Mach 1, are in the bag, so they set out on the job while the police frantically try to track him down.Pace is the inadvertent symbol of that symbiosis: both investigator and thief, his heists carefully restricted to vehicles insured by the very companies that then hire him to investigate his own crimes, Pace is not between two worlds (as the ad copy would say) but at the heart of a ceaselessly functioning mechanism. As Pace prepares to rip-off the fastback, codenamed "<a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleanor.html" title="Eleanor">Eleanor</a>", in Long Beach, he is unaware that his boss (Jerry Daugirda) has tipped off the police after a business dispute. Their efforts pay off when Pace's boss double-crosses him and tips them off on his next job. Police pursue Pace in "Eleanor", Detectives (Butch Stockton and <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Woods_abdc.html" title="Phil Woods">Phil Woods</a>) are waiting and pursue Pace through five cities as he desperately tries to get away. the last of the cars needed to fulfill their contract, through southern California as he tries to get away. Contained the longest car chase in movie history at the time as well as a record stunt jump as part of the finale of a 40 minute car chase. The car chase contained several accidents including one unscripted accident caught on film. When the chase ends Pace simply spots another Eleanor at a car wash, and then Pace pulls into the car wash parking lot and gets out of the stolen Eleanor and the car wash girl asks Pace "Do you want it Spray Wax." Pace says "No just wash it." then Pace walks off the lady at the car wash and says "Is this your car." and the lady says "Yes it is." and "Apparently they have to re wash the car, you just right to the managers office and I'll bring the car back there for you." and then Pace drives off in the stolen Eleanor from the car wash, he quickly switches the plates and drives off into the sunset.</p>

Charles Edward Christopher Sr., a longtime Tulsa civil rights leader, died Tuesday. He was 80. Funeral services are set for 10 a.m. Saturday at Christ Temple CME Church under the direction of Jack's Memory Chapel Funeral Home. Christopher was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and attended Ohio State University in the 1940s. He graduated from the Chicago College of Optometry in 1950. That same year, he and his wife, Anita Williams Christopher, were the first black people to open an optometry practice in Tulsa. He was a director of the Northeastern District of the Oklahoma Optometric Association from 1971 to 1974. Christopher took an active role in city politics, serving at various times as president of the Target Area Action Group and chairman of the Coalition for Community Development. He also was a commissioner of the Tulsa Urban Renewal Authority and vice president of the National Citizens Participation Council. For several years he served in a variety of leadership positions at the Moton Health Clinic. In 1973, he was the author of a well-publicized private report that criticized the Tulsa City Commission, the</p>
<p><br />
Tulsa Urban Renewal Authority, the Tulsa Housing Authority and several other agencies for segregating Tulsa's black population on the north side. In 1974, Christopher was elected chairman of a citizens committee that advised the City Commission on distributing federal community development funding. In 1987, he became the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit that sought to prove that Tulsa's commission form of government unconstitutionally discriminated against black residents by diluting their votes and preventing black leaders from winning elective offices. City voters approved a charter change that did away with the commission form of government in 1989. In 1990, the results of the city's first City Council primary guaranteed that two members of the first council would be black. "I feel good tonight," Christopher told the Tulsa World after the primary. "Today, history has been made." In 1993, he was one of three finalists to fill a vacant City Council seat. Christopher was a member of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. In 2001, he was honored with the Image Builder Award from the North Tulsa Heritage Foundation. Survivors include his wife of 54 years, Anita Christopher; four daughters, Marilyn Christopher of New York City, Gloria Jennings of Indianapolis, Leslie Christopher of Tulsa and Jan Christopher of Dover, Del.; a son, Charles Christopher II of Dallas; and five grandchildren.</p>

Acoustic Research (“AR”) was co-founded in 1954 by audio pioneer, inventor and researcher Edgar Villchur. AR was established to produce the model AR-1, a loudspeaker design incorporating the acoustic-suspension principle based on patent No. 2,775,309 granted to Edgar Villchur and assigned to Acoustic Research in 1956. The acoustic-suspension woofer provided an elegant solution to the age-old problem of high bass distortion in loudspeakers caused by non-linear, stiff mechanical suspensions in conventional loudspeakers. The acoustic-suspension woofer (sometimes known as “air suspension”) used the elastic cushion of air within a small, sealed loudspeaker enclosure of about 1.5 to 1.7 cu. ft., to provide the restoring force for the woofer diaphragm. The entrapped air provided a linear spring to the woofer's diaphragm, enabling it to move back and forth great distances (“excursion”) in a linear fashion, a requirement in the reproduction of deep-bass tones. As such, the AR-1 set new standards of low-frequency performance and low distortion that were unsurpassed for many years; in fact, the best loudspeakers fifty-years later continue to use the acoustic-suspension principle for high-quality bass reproduction. The small size of the high-performance AR-1 (dictated by the design requirement of acoustic suspension) was an unintentional dividend that helped usher-in the age of stereophonic sound reproduction. Two bookshelf-sized loudspeakers were far more acceptable in a living room than two refrigerator-sized boxes heretofore necessary to reproduce sub-sonic bass notes.</p>
<p>Edgar Villchur's technical innovation was based in large part on scientific, objective-test techniques and research, all of which was publicly shared in the form of written documents and response-measurement graphs and diagrams -- unheard of in the industry at that time. Acoustic Research, under Villchur's leadership, was also innovative during this period in the way in which the company offered equal opportunity, liberal benefits, insurance and profit sharing to every employee.</p>
<p>In 1958 AR once again pioneered in loudspeaker technology with the introduction of the model AR-3, which used the AR-1’s acoustic-suspension woofer in conjunction with the first commercially available hemispherical (“dome”) high-frequency tweeters available in a loudspeaker. For nearly ten years after its introduction the AR-3 was widely regarded as the most accurate loudspeaker available at any cost, and was used in countless professional installations, recording studios and concert halls. Many well-known professional musicians used AR-3 loudspeakers due to their life-like, accurate sound reproduction. In the early 1960s AR conducted a series of over seventy-five live-vs.-recorded concerts in which the sound of a live string quartet was alternated with the reproduced music played through a pair of AR-3s. In this “ultimate” subjective test of audio quality, the listeners in these concerts were largely unable to detect the switchovers from live to recorded, a strong testament of Acoustic Research audio quality. AR went on to introduce many other notable designs, and by 1966 the company had grown to hold 32.2% of the US domestic loudspeaker market, based on the Institute of High Fidelity Manufacturers statistics for that year. This was the highest product market-share ever held by a loudspeaker manufacturer since the days statistics have been kept in the industry. (ARHPG_2006_TomTyson)</p>

Kabyar is the Burmese word for someone of mixed race. It literally means 'half and half' in this context, and in English is usually rendered as 'half caste'. Kabyar is primarily used to refer to the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Burmese_2fd3.html" title="Anglo-Burmese">Anglo-Burmese</a> and also the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Indians_00d3.html" title="Anglo-Indians">Anglo-Indians</a> who once formed a large and influential community in the country, and it also refers to the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burmese_Chinese_477c.html" title="Burmese Chinese">Burmese_Chinese</a> who are of mixed Burmese and Chinese or mixed Chinese and European descent. It must be noted that the term Kabyar does not, to Eurasians in Burma, have a derogatory meaning like the English term 'half caste'.</p>

<p>&lt;A squad of semi-pro atheletes who dominated the University of Maine Intramural Sports System from 1992 to 1996. The team consisted of a number of team captains from various HS teams from southern New England who negotiated a treaty in the early 90s to dominate University of Maine intramural sports for four years.</p>
<p>Of particular note, Team Schlong won the 1996 Floor Hockey Championship, defeating a team which included a members of the UMaine NCAA DI Ice Hockey Players.</p>
<p>Feared for their thuggery and gang signs and respected for their sheer dominance, Team Schlong lives on in the nightmares of rival UMO intramural teams.&gt;</p>

<p>Upon entering Trinty, Sam Straw, son of Great Britain's Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Jack Straw, made a great name for himself. He was requested by many to lead the offical council for student affairs as only a freshman, but, because of a strong commitment to his academics and to his family, he graciously declined, hiding behind a shadow of bashful humility. After only a three year carreer at Trinity, Sam, to the dismay of his family as well as his piers, sought something more, and in doing so decided it would be in his best interest to withdraw from his studies and focus his intellegence on the existential issues toward which he felt a particular magnetism.</p>
<p>He went on to achieve feats far different from those in the future imagined for him by society. The once promising boy slipped into an existence not only of disripute, but of anonymity. No longer was he Favorite Son of New York STRAWMAN, but instead, a faceless member of the masses. He became a slave to his needle as he lied, cheated, and stole to maintain his habit. As his relationship with his parents struggled for existence, he made the aquaintance of the infamous leader of the occult, His Holliness, Tanzin Calligula Belatrovius. Under the guidance of he Holiness he abandoned his western judeo/christian values and threw himself fully into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cause_86eb.html" title="The Cause">the Cause</a>. Sinking further and further from his roots, his family feared that he would never be returned to him as the innocent boy who had left them. His breeding overcame his corruptment and Sam Straw found his way safe after the awful massacre of Tanzin Belatrovius and many of his followers. Safe in body, but not safe in mind. Sam Straw collapsed under the psychological pressures remaining after his tango with the end of bodily existence. Although invited by Princeton to complete a preparatory tenure term, he declined and sunk into a state of complete mental indulgence feeding his feelings of insecurity and aggression. This, and a penchant for painkillers, landed in the hands of wiz kid Doctor Fontodi Macabre. He was cured of the scourge of drugs that plagued him and he returned to his tender family although it now lacked a member. He now cradles his long lost ego in the twilight of even his idols.</p>

<p>The G35 is a revolutionary adapter to enable the use of regular 35mm lenses on a digital video camera, while maintaining the desired depth of field, viewing angle and with low loss of light. The concept is to combine artistic flair with modern digital technology, at a price that is more affordable than the current P+S Technik Mini35 Adapter.</p>
<p>Although the production version is not commercially available, beta testing is underway with the next generation HD cameras.</p>
<p>Current adapter support is for;</p>
<p>DVX-100/a HVX-200 XL1/2 Sony Z1U/FX1</p>
<p>With lens adapter mounting for Nikon, PL, Canon EOS and FD.</p>

The presentation of the article is in my own words. I realize that I am a newbie at preparing and submitting articles. The source is identified in the article referred to above.</p>

<p>Toadbert is a Toad from the normal(future) Mushroom Kingdom in Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time. He accompanies Peach and Toadiko on their trip to see that past mushroom kingdom, where he is quickly lost along with Princess Peach in the past when the time machine used to go back in time turns up in the future again, broken. During most of the time you see him he is suffering from memory loss. It hurts his head just to try to remember the aweful event that caused Peach to go missing. He has, however, drawn a picture of images that he remembers, that helps explain what happened. You first meet him inside of the Yoob's belly, where he is trying to save the captures Yoshis. There he doesnt seem to mind that he can't remember his past, he just plans to forget and play happily with the yoshis, unlike many amnesia suffering characters, who tend to moarn their loss of memory. He is an overall nice guy, and likes to help out. He constantly adds the phrase "By boogity" to the ends of his sentances. Near the end he remembers his past after getting hit on the head by a falling Kylie Koopa. He and Kylie then team up for a brief time to tell Mario and Luigi about his newfound memory.</p>
<p>Appearance: Wears thick, black rimmed glasses, an orange and yellow tie, and has a blue mushroom head with white spots.</p>

Officially named the Smith and Wesson .44 Hand Ejector 1st Model 'New Century,' it became popularly known as the 'Triple Lock' owning to it's extra locking lug on the cylinder crane. This extra locking mechanism was deemed necessary oweing the increased power of the new .44 Special cartridge, which was a lengthened version of the old .44 Russian. Considered by many, including Elmer Keith, to be the finest revolver ever made, it was only manufactured between 1908 and 1915. In total 15,376 specimens were manufactured and S&amp;W was sold out completely by 1917. S&amp;W ceased production for a couple or reasons: the British/Canadian Army were purchasing the triple lock in large quanities for WWI, in .455 Eley, and thought the shroud would collect dirt; S&amp;W could save $2.00 per revolver by eliminating the shroud and third locking lug. The shroud would come back in 1926 with the 3rd Model Hand-Ejector but the fabled 'Triple Lock' was gone forever.</p>

<p>Chess is the most popular game in the world. It was invented by a smart minister in India. A king wanted to play a two player war game. So he called on this minister. The king loved chess so much he played it while he was going someplace by pinning the pieces to the board! Chess has had many changes since it was invented. There are 7 ranks: Amateur (Class D) Amateur (Class C) Amateur (Class B) Amateur (Class A) Master, International Master, and Grandmaster. Chess consists of a board with 64 squares- 32 white squares and 32 black squares. It has 16 pieces on each side. There are 8 white pawns, 2 rooks, 2 knights, two bishops, 1 king and 1 queen. And black has the same pieces. Some of the best chess players (grand masters) were Bobby Fischer, Anatoly Karpov, Vishy Anand, Judith Polgar, and Garry Kasporov. Chess is definitely full of strategy and fun. Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess www.chesskids.com Beggining Chess</p>

The Destruction of Black Civilization is a book authored by Chancellor Williams, discussiong the history of Africa and Black Africans from 4500 B.C. to the present day. It discusses how Egypt was originally a Black civilization which evolved to its highly advanced state through the ruling and efforts of its Black populace, before being destroyed or conquered by successive waves of immigration and invasion by White and Semeitic settlers and armies. Williams states that the low level of civilization of Africa and its peoples after these invasions is the result of the long, drawn-out conquest of Lower (Northern) Egypt and the effects of these invasions on the population and civilization of Upper (Southern) Egypt.</p>
<p>It is a notably afro-centric work; Williams makes numerous generalizations (positive and negative) about both Black Africans and the White and Semitic invaders. In example, "For the Asians are a very smart and very cunning people." (Williams, p. 71), and "Full advantage was taken of the fact that Africans are a very religious people." (Williams, p. 58). Despite these and similar discomforting generalizations, the book makes several extremely strong arguments regarding the 'Blackness' of Ancient Egypt, and the origins of the first great civilization being one of Black Africans. He cites the example of the noticeably negroid features of the great sphinx and various other statues and inscriptions as evidence.</p>

<p>Rotund, jolly actor John McGive stars as Roswell G. Flemington, a former Navy man who insists upon running his business and his home in strict Navy maritime fashion. This includes running clocks that give the hour in Navy fashion "Bell" sounds, whistle calls--calling shipmantes (his employees) to duty, clanging bells, and of course extremely loud Naval gun blasts. Navy military music completes this well-written, creative episode. Moreover in military fashion he addresses his wife as "Madam." i.e, "Madam, I'll have you know..."LOL "Sounds and Silences" was written by Rod Serling--the Best of the Best!</p>

757 is the area code serving Southeatern <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a>, incluing the Cities of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chesapeake.html" title="Chesapeake">Chesapeake</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampton.html" title="Hampton">Hampton</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norfolk.html" title="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newport_News_8b0b.html" title="Newport News">Newport News</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffolk.html" title="Suffolk">Suffolk</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_Beach_7a56.html" title="Virginia Beach">Virginia Beach</a>, in addition to numerous counties. More than just an area code, '757' is often used to describe the region. Also known as <a href="../../../t/i/d/Tidewater.html" title="Tidewater">Tidewater</a>, or <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampton_Roads_cf0c.html" title="Hampton Roads">Hampton Roads</a>, the region is unique in that many of the cities are adjacent. A Virginia law prohibits cities from being part of counties.</p>
<p>While the different communities of the 757 are transparent for many residents who may live, work, shop and commute in any number of the adjacent cities, local politics prevents the mergers of the cities and thus any recognition as a major population center.</p>
<p>In recent years, the term '757' has taken a place in pop culture getting shout-outs in Rap songs as well as from professional atheletes.</p>

Mystical Seven is a secret society founded at <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan_University_934b.html" title="Wesleyan University">Wesleyan University</a>, CT (also known as M7 or Mystical 7). While offically acknowledged in 1837, thought to have played a hand in the founding of the school in 1831. Orginally a literary society that had 7 branches at schools in the south, but during the Civil war contact with the other chapters were lost never to be reforged. Currently several societies claim to be the orginal Mystical Seven. It appears as though they lost their literature and traditions, which when were later found gave another group the oppurtunity to step in and claim they have the society's true spirit.</p>

<p>Kamaljit Jhooti's stage name Jay Sean was adapted from taking the 'J' from 'Jhooti' and 'Sean' from 'Shaan', a name that his family affectionately called him which means star. However, this anglicisation has been criticised by many Asians for him apparently not being proud of his Panjabi origins.</p>
<p>He grew up in <a href="../../../h/o/u/Hounslow.html" title="Hounslow">Hounslow</a>, which is located near the world famous London <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heathrow.html" title="Heathrow">Heathrow</a> International Airport which is west of <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. He is a follower of <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikhism.html" title="Sikhism">Sikhism</a>, although he does not wear a <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turban.html" title="Turban">turban</a>.</p>
<p>Jhooti started his hobby of <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rapping.html" title="Rapping">rapping</a> at the age of 14, in a hip hop duo called "Compulsive Disorder" with his cousin Pritpal. He went by the name MC Nicky J and Pritpal went by the name MC DNA. "Compulsive Disorder" later gained the attention of local radio station <a href="../../../d/j/_/DJ_27a5.html" title="DJ">DJs</a>.</p>
<p>Jhooti went to a private boys school. He was one of the brightest boys in the class with ten grade A's at GCSE and 4 A level's that, although rejected by <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Cambridge_5f20.html" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge University</a>, won him a place at <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Mary%2C_University_of_London_2f01.html" title="Queen Mary, University of London">Queen Mary, University of London</a> to train as a doctor. Two years later Jhooti secured a one million pounds record deal and dropped out to follow his true love: Music.</p>
<p>Jhooti's only obstacle was frequent attention to his <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">race</a> rather than his music. Regarding the fact that he grew up in a extremely diverse country such as the United Kingdom, he developed influences from his Black, White and South Asian Friends.</p>

<p>"One Minute" was the first full track Jhooti had written himself. It was passed on by a friend who passed it onto other friends and it eventually landed in the hands of British Asian Music Producer Rishi Rich.After hearing the demo Rishi Rich asked Jhooti to come to the studio and got him to do a impromtude performance in front of his managers, 2Point9 management.</p>
<p>After he dropped out of studying medicine at <a href="../../../q/m/w/QMW_e68f.html" title="QMW">QMW</a> in East London where he had been for two years, Jhooti joined with the Music producer, <a href="../../../r/i/s/Rishi_Rich_848c.html" title="Rishi Rich">Rishi Rich</a> and Punjabi Singer, <a href="../../../j/u/g/Juggy_D_fd93.html" title="Juggy D">Juggy D</a> during the summer of 2003 and started to work on material.</p>
<p>As Jhooti had gotten deeper into the music industry, he had expressed his love for <a href="../../../r/%26/b/R%26B_2a8f.html" title="R&amp;B">R&amp;B Music</a>. The biggest year for Jhooti's career had to be <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, when he released his first album and had chart-topping hits. Jhooti was introduced into the musical scene with hits like "Dance With You" (Nachna Tere Naal), "Eyes On You" and "Stolen". Jhooti is hard at work on the follow up to his Rishi Rich produced debut album "Me Against Myself".</p>

The Rainbow Warrior was the first navy cruiser of the Canadian Navy to come into existance. The name "The Rainbow" was made a mockery of and contributed furthermore to the idea that Canada would continue to have a weak navy. A name given to the Canadian navy was "The Tin Pot Navy" which meant it was weak, and bearly capable of doing its job.</p>
