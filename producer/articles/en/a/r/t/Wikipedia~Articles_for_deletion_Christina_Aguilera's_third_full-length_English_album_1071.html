<li><b>Keep</b>. For our purposes here, there's no difference between it being already released and yet-to-come. People are always making that distinction, but it's wrong. We're talking about providing information here. Information exists regardless of whether the album is released yet or not, so we provide it. The "crystal ball" argument is completely wrong, because we should only be dealing in verifiable information—predictions other people have made, and information that has been officially confirmed. So the only question is notability. Well, I think this is a notable subject. Christina is very famous and popular and there's plenty of talk about her next album. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:55, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can see that point, but then theoretically the album could generate a huge buzz and yet not get an official title until a week or two before release; I think in this case we'd still want to provide the information. The issue of the title becomes irrelevant; the question is just the notability of the topic. I would think if an upcoming album is getting a lot of attention, we'd give it an article regardless of whether it's been officially given a title. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 11:13, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

You admit that the article is based on speculation and the only justification that you can give for the keeping of that article is "theoretically the album could generate a huge buzz". If the only justification that the only supporter of the article is one solelly based on possible speculation, then it is obvious that there is no reason to keep the article.

<li><b>Comment</b> I believe that there is, in fact, a very strong difference. Wikipedia aims to be an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a>. According to the definition, it's articles should bear important and relevant information on some subject. The article listed for deletion is purely speculation and rumors and I don't see how speculation and rumors can be considered important or relevant on any subject, let alone an encyclopedic article. Besides, I don't see how that article can ammount to something other than that: a source of rumors and speculation. When the album is released I don't see why it shouldn't be covered by a wikipedia article. Until then, I believe that it would be wise to leave the rumor-spreading and speculation-creation to webforums, blogs, IM chats and other related media of communication. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> 11:26, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It looks to me like everything in the article should be verifiable. Even things that can't be verified as fact can be verified as notable rumors. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 11:28, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikipedia is about verifiable facts not verifiable rumours. If people want advance information on an album in production they should look at other mediums, such as blogs. An article entitled Christina Aguilera's third full-length English album does not belong in Wikipedia. When a release date is announced and the album is titled an article could be created. <a href="../../../m/o/v/User%7EMovementarian_d2cf.html" title="User:Movementarian">Movementarian</a> 11:48, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Until the album has a name it shouldn't be discussed in it's own article. The mistake people make is wanting to create new articles for everything and fragment information. I'd be happy with <b>merging</b> into Christina's article, though. Christina's quote at the start needs sourcing. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:40, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> anything useful with the main Aguilera article, otherwise let's wait till the release at least has a title before doing an article about it. Crystal ball otherwise. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 13:29, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>None of it is speculation. Think for a minute. It is, in a sense, speculation to say that there will be a U.S. presidential election in 2008. Because who knows, really? But we have an article on it...why? <i>Because it's a notable topic and information can be verifiable whether reporting past events or reporting what other people have said about future events, and past events relating to those future events.</i> I really get tired of the "crystal ball" stuff. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:41, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>We know that there will be a U.S. Presidential Election because it is madated in the constitution. <s>But since you bring it up, notice that there is not an article entitled <a href="../../../2/0/0/2008_Presidential_Election_c75b.html" title="2008 Presidential Election">2008 Presidential Election</a>.

<li>We report other people's speculation. Like, duh! And my first point was a philosophical one—you don't really <i>know</i> any future events will take place. And here's another point—<i>even if Christina doesn't release a third album, the topic itself is still notable</i>—she's been recording, people have been talking about it, it's acquired a significant degree of fame, and a significant amount could already be written about it. So really it has nothing to do with the album being released or not. You need to base it on the subject's <i>notability</i>, that is to say, on the importance attached to it by people. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:30, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think we will have to agree to disagree. You think that because someone that is notable says they will do something it should be immediately placed into Wikipedia (I hope that I am not misintrepeting your position, if I am I apologise). I think we should wait until it has happened. <a href="../../../m/o/v/User%7EMovementarian_d2cf.html" title="User:Movementarian">Movementarian</a> 06:35, 11 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, not necessarily. It depends on whether what is said amounts to notable information. (Also, I naturally regard <i>saying something</i> as an action, therefore that—the act of communicating—has already happened—it is in the past, and thus can't be speculation.) And to have an independent article you need a collection of notable info that would not fit properly into another article. It makes sense to me to have this as an independent article...I think any question about this should arise from whether to merge verifiable info, or keep it here as its own article (and we know it will eventually get one anyway, of course). I see no reason not to do the latter—I feel people are making arbitrary cut-off points, such as it having an official title, or being released. To me, what matters is that you have a collection of notable, verifiable info that works as an independent subject. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:27, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see where you are coming from and I better understand your position, however I disagree that requiring an album to have a title is an arbitrary cut-off point. I think having a proper title is a key element to having an article. If a member of a royal family gets pregnant should we make an article called (using the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Orange-Nassau_d8f9.html" title="House of Orange-Nassau">House of Orange-Nassau</a> as an example) Prince Willem-Alexander and Princess Maxima New Baby or should we wait until it has a name? <a href="../../../m/o/v/User%7EMovementarian_d2cf.html" title="User:Movementarian">Movementarian</a> 18:24, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
