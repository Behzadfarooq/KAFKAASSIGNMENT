<li><b>Keep</b>. It seems excessive to delete an entire list because of a disagreement with the inclusion of individual articles on the list. If someone wishes to make a study of cycles this is an excellent resource, and is exactly the sort of thing that Wiki provides so well. This complements <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_calendars.html" title="List of calendars">List of calendars</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_dynamical_systems_and_differential_equations_topics.html" title="List of dynamical systems and differential equations topics">List of dynamical systems and differential equations topics</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_timelines.html" title="List of timelines">List of timelines</a>. Such lists, by their nature, flirt with original research. It is useful to have read this <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a>. The claim of original research in this case is dubious, as cyles is the research topic of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Foundation_for_the_Study_of_Cycles_0b90.html" title="The Foundation for the Study of Cycles">The Foundation for the Study of Cycles</a>, an organisation which has existed since 1941 and has been subject to articles in <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_%28journal%29.html" title="Science (journal)">Science (journal)</a>, a reliable source, in <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1944Sci...100Q.514." class="external text" title="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1944Sci...100Q.514." rel="nofollow">1994</a>; and <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecology_%28journal%29.html" title="Ecology (journal)">Ecology (journal)</a>, another reliable source, in <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=00129658%281943%292%3C267%3AFFTSOC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-x&amp;origin=ESA" class="external text" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=00129658%281943%292%3C267%3AFFTSOC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-x&amp;origin=ESA" rel="nofollow">1943</a> - enough to justify notability according to current Wikipedia criteria.

<li>Inclusion in the list means that things are considered periodic in time. Waves are generally from a point of view of being periodic in space. Of course they will be overlap, and so the two should be linked. The periodic phenomena category is not well formed. It includes disasters that are not at all periodic and that category would be better replaced with another. I was attempting to set up a better category and that led to this attack on cycles material to try and keep me busy so that I could not do that. Also I would argue that a list may be more comprehensive than a category because it is not intrusive to articles. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 05:43, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Sorry Michael, but this list contains topics which are totally unrelated except from the fact that that they may have anything to do with cycles.

<li><b>Keep</b> wikipedias coverage of cyclic phenomena is woeful. After the last AfD on the topic wikipedia no longer has normal article on the topic, so we are reduced to this list. These things have a long cultural history of study. It is something that man has studied from day one. The entire <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">hindu</a> meta-physics is based around cycles in cycles, see <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yuga.html" title="Yuga">Yuga</a>. In China the <a href="../../../i/_/c/I_Ching_a792.html" title="I Ching">I Ching</a> is strongly linked to cycles. Cycles of sun and moon define our calendar and gave rise to likes of Stonehenge. This tradition has led to cycles being being a key part in early attempts to understand our world such as <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a>, which in turn I suspect being part of the motivation of hard scientist to remove. It is a complete misrepresentation to link study of cycles to just Dewey, many other have studied cyclic phenomena for instance <a href="../../../l/y/a/Lyall_Watson_58db.html" title="Lyall Watson">Lyall Watson</a> devoted a most intriguing chapter of <i>supernature</i> to the diverse natural phenomena which follow the cycles of the sun and moon. And yes there is a good reason for <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organic_farming.html" title="Organic farming">Organic farming</a> (actually <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodynamic_agriculture.html" title="Biodynamic agriculture">Biodynamic agriculture</a> might be more appropriate) to appear, as one of its key principals is planting in time with the moon. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 09:29, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

If <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodynamic_agriculture.html" title="Biodynamic agriculture">Biodynamic agriculture</a> is allowed, then one should explain at that entry <i>why</i> it is in. In other words, if kept, this list should make the case for its existence at each entry, so that the list is actually informative rather than appearing to be an indiscriminate collection of unrelated information I think. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 15:23, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>And when maintaining the list, one should not include all and everything related to cycles, but only the most relevant things. That is, one should pick and choose. So, tides and moon phases should be in, while <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodynamic_agriculture.html" title="Biodynamic agriculture">Biodynamic agriculture</a> should be out I think, as it is too unrelated. And for example, <a href="../../../w/o/m/Woman.html" title="Woman">woman</a> should be out, even though a woman has a monthly cycle. In short, adding things which have something to do with cycles, but not a lot, hurts the readability and information value of the whole thing I think. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 15:27, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> -- It's a random assortment of things that only broadly can be considered "cycles." <a href="../../../k/e/a/User%7EKearnsdm_f635.html" title="User:Kearnsdm">Kearnsdm</a> 04:49, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I was surprised when I took a look to see that the list actually is organized and not a complete disaster. My primary objection would be that topic is too ill-defined and would accumulate everything under the sun (including potentially <a href="../../../w/o/m/Woman.html" title="Woman">woman</a> as Oleg points out). My own answer to this would be to tighten up the introduction to the list to eliminate the kinds of things not currently listed. Further trimming is also highly recommended. As for the OR complaints... Lists have always felt slightly OR-ish to me (e.g. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sexually_active_popes.html" title="List of sexually active popes">List of sexually active popes</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_Presidents_by_height_order_a0e5.html" title="List of United States Presidents by height order">List_of_United_States_Presidents_by_height_order</a>). Is this list more OR-ish than that? In my opinion, no. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 14:06, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - looking at the "what links here", there seems to be no article that <i>requires</i> this list, and its generality seriously compromises keeping it for its own sake. As DGG points out, some of the looser inclusion arguments could lead to any number of items being added to the list. Inclusion criteria which would prevent this would seem to leave little need for this list, although sections might turn out to be useful somewhere. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 08:08, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Indiscriminate collection of information. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 13:54, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Proposal</b>. As the concern with the list itself is mainly that it is "indiscriminate", and as this discussion is not simply a majority vote, but a means to discover a solution, as indicated by <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolling_is_not_a_substitute_for_discussion_3eba.html" title="Wikipedia:Polling is not a substitute for discussion">Wikipedia:Polling is not a substitute for discussion</a> - would it be appropriate for us to be looking for a solution, such as the criterion mentioned above, for how best to compose this list? <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 13:58, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The most contentious section of the List appears to be the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cycles.html#Physics_cycles" title="List of cycles">Physics cycles</a> section, followed by the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cycles.html#Organic_cycles" title="List of cycles">Organic cycles</a> section. Leaving those two sections aside, what other items on the list do people object to? <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 14:15, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
