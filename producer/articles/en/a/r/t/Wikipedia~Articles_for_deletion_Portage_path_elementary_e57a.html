<ul>
<li>And yet, because of my actions, the school (through the work of another editor) has been expanded to a good level. The work of stopping articles from being prematurely deleted is not trivial as you would have me think. I am trying to accurately reflect community consensus, and try to allow school articles be improved rather than deleted, and all that I have to show for it is other editors picking apart my rationale. The above just shows that letting articles exist, rather than deleting them, is valuable. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> 16:57, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>First, it is exceedingly presumptious of you to claim any credit for anything here. You have <i>zero</i> credit here. You did, and continue to have done, <i>nothing</i>. You cited <i>no</i> sources. You provided <i>no</i> content. The article as currently written could have been as equally created from a redlink as from the 9 words that it contained at the time of nomination. You aren't improving the encyclopaedia in the slightest, and have contributed nothing at all towards its improvement by your actions here. You aren't doing any work at all here, trivial or otherwise. <i>You did zero work here.</i> In fact, <i>your actions are the direct causes of extra, unnecessary, work</i>. Had you done any work at all at the time of prodding, the article may not even have been brought to AFD in the first place (per the nomination). But you didn't do a single iota of work, and hence all of this extra time and effort expent on the parts of other editors, as a consequence of your just doing nothing, has resulted. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:34, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article is more than a sentence now, and cites five sources: a government report, a database of the school's demographics and test scores, and three separate magazine/news feature articles about this particular school's educational/development programmes and use of computers — all of which are from sources independent of the school itself. It even links to more source material not used by the article. Per the references and further reading sections of the article (q.v.), it satisfies the primary criterion of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:16, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as notability has not been demonstrated. I don't think that any of the sources provided by <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> show notability. First, as to the government report: Generally, the existence of non-trivial third-party coverage of a subject shows notability of that subject because it shows that the outside world (represented by the publishers of the source) deems the subject notable. However, a government report about a school is not published because anyone deems the school <i>notable</i>, it's published because government schools are accountable to the public. So a government report does not show notability. (Yes, this conclusion is contrary to <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, which explicitly blesses "schools inspection agencies," but <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> does not enjoy consensus approval.) Second, as to the database of the school's demographics and test scores: this is a trivial source, like similar reports on local restaurants. Third, as to the source titled "Teaching Technology To Kids": that report is not, primarily, about this school, which merely serves as an example (along with at least one other) of a school using technology in the classroom. The existence of that report doesn't show notability of the school, it shows notability of the topic of <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instructional_technology.html" title="Instructional technology">Instructional technology</a>, which as you can see we have an article on already. Fourth, the other two sources (that I can access--the link to the third is down) are local and as such are not sufficient to show notability (otherwise we'd be keeping lots of articles about local businesses, which are featured in local papers all the time). <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 16:00, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
