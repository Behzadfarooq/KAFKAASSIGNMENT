<li><b>Keep</b> It's definitely of popular culture significance - this phenomenon has some similarity to "All your base are belong to us" with the popularity of the modified music video clip. Some claims this does not belongs to encyclopedia, yet AYBAB2U shouldn't be here either based on the same line of reasoning - worse as it is just a made up music video based on a game opening and a catchy Engrish tagline, vs this is a real incident. For AYBAB2U it has absolutely no educational value, nor unencyclopedic as some may say, yet it's a keeper because of its popularity.

Not resolved!” is a universal answer to all the conflicts on earth. "I face pressure. You face pressure.

<li><b>Keep""".I read through all the comments, and most importantly Wikipedia’s Deletion policy. Neutral point of view, verifiability, no original research, copyright issues. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion</a></b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I don’t see any problems with this article on the above 3 main criterias. I also looked at some of the examples listed in “problem articles with alternatives to deletion,” no major problems there either.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The main issues people brought up are:</dd>
<dd>1. Not encyclopedic and not notable. For example, “meaningless, nonsense, ridiculous, no long term impact, etc. etc. etc. Per Wikipedia itself, "the reason, "unencyclopedic" is not an argument at all but just another way of saying should be deleted.”’</dd>
<dd>2. Remove the Chinese/foreign language.</dd>
<dd>3. Delete per nom.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Not encyclopedic, not notable, nonsense, and meaningless</b>. These are all very subjective comments. My guess is that there are far more people who think the article and incident is notable, meaningful, encyclopedic, etc. This incident has stirred debate among almost everybody in Hong Kong. There is not anyone in Hong Kong (adult at least) that does not know something about the incident and have an opinion about this. There also has been "intellectual/intelligent" dicussions about this whole affair. I guess the people who says the incident and article are nonsense are the same people who says that the masses are fools.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Remove the Chinese</b>. It’s great there’s some Chinese translations, phrases. Why? For me, it’s research purposes. I don’t know Chinese well, but having some Chinese here allows me to search further for OTHER, non USA resources (whether it be websites, blogs, news sites, etc.). If everything was in English, it would limit my ability to search for the other 50% of non English sites.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Delete per nom. This argument has no facts to support why article should be deleted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Conclusion.</b> I am not convinced the article should be removed. No clear and convincing argument to remove the entry other than OPINIONS. There are no clear and convincing violations of neutral point of view, verifiability, no original research, copyright issues.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, the incident may become insignificant to some and maybe in time, but for now it is not. Yes it may not be encyclopedic for some, but at the same time, we have to ask ourselves is Wikipedia really just an encyclopedia in the traditional Britanica sense? What is “encyclopedic”? My feeling is what makes Wikipedia so powerful is the collaborative efforts AND the ability to obtain any INFORMATION about anything, anywhere, etc. badbatzmaru 20:21, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Let's not forget that the first language of many HK residents is English, so this is their Wikipedia, and this is where they come to get well-researched background on current cultural phenomena. Uncle Bus is clearly a current cultural phenomenon in HK, and our article provides well-researched background. There is no reason to delete; in fact if the article didn't exist it should be created. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 21:02, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> It would be a travesty and a disservice to information seekers everywhere if this article is removed. I believe Wikipedia is an international source of information, not just an American one. Granted, not many Americans care about the Bus Uncle, but this is one of the most talked about news event in Hong Kong this year, one that has even penetrated Western media. --<a href="../../../u/c/l/User%7EUCLARodent_889d.html" title="User:UCLARodent">UCLARodent</a> 22:38, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. First, it's no harm. Second, users have the right to know more about this "news". Third, Wikipedia should be always welcoming the true things that happened in the world. Forth, it MAY not be interested by many people does not implies it is worth to be deleted. e.g. Some of the schools or colleges in Hong Kong have their own article in Wiki, but EVEN the students of the school MAY NOT be interested in the article. You can imagine how few people is going to read those articles. However, by using the same logic, is it worth to be deleted? Hong Kong user: Dk4ofjoshuayhyu</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> it got reported in international news. Quite frankly, I'd've probably said "keep it" even if it hadn't, but this counts as notable by anyone's standards. LupusCanis 14:49, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. While I'm rarely persuaded by the arguments of something being a "notable internet meme", this one clearly seems to be—Huge ammounts of media coverage, and great popularity in Chinese internet communities, but it has spread beyond that and became a general cultural phenom, and indeed, an international one. While I wouldn't go so far as to say that it has reached the state of being as influential and notable as <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goatse.html" title="Goatse">Goatse</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base_belong_to_us.html" title="All your base belong to us">All your base belong to us</a>, it is fairly close.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In addition, I think many of those expressing the opinion that this article should be deleted are losing sight of the article itself and instead focusing on the non-logged in users and brand new users, many of whom may indeed only be here to contribute to this discussion, and perhaps they do not express their opinion or argue their position in the best way; this is however irrelevant. Looking at the article, and just the article, I see a notable subject, with several references, and overall a good encyclopedia article. Granted, this is a problem of AFD and indeed, discussions on Wikipedia in general, but I feel its necessary to bring it up here. The closer of this debate should take this into account.
