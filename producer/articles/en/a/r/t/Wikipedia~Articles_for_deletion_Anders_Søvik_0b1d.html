<p>The result was <b>delete all</b>. Although on individual opinions it was 3 to 6, two of the "keep" opinions were not well argued, as were two "deletes", and one "keep" was "very weak", so it's more like 0.5 to 4. I don't believe a relist would have brought many new arguments, but the generally high level of discussion in this AfD is commendable. The articles can be recreated, of course, if these people do get to play at a more professional level or become otherwise more notable. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 13:12, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Contrary to the beliefs of the article creator, these footballers do <i>not play in a fully professional league</i>. In other words they don't meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines for sportspeople. I would clean up the articles of the team players who actually have played professionally, and whose professional league appearances are <i>verifiable</i> - alas I could see only one notable player in their squad. <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunkmorten_c486.html" title="User:Punkmorten">Punkmorten</a> 09:43, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Are Skeid really an amateur team? They played in the <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adeccoligaen.html" title="Adeccoligaen">Norweigian First Division</a> (the second level) until 2005, and will do so again from 2007. I find it rather hard to believe that they are not a professional club; at the very least, some of their best players could be contracted a professional basis. The <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skeid_Fotball_5b4e.html" title="Skeid Fotball">Skeid</a> article does not make this clear. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 10:01, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The guidelines state, though, that a player must play in a fully professional league. So even if some of these players have pro contracts with Skeid, they don't meet the guidelines unless the league Skeid are in is confirmed as fully professional. It's the same situation as Conference players in the UK - some are full-time professionals but the league is not <i>fully</i> professional so they don't qualify unless they have experience at a higher level..... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 10:14, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Until I can make any sort of decision I need to know which leagues in Norway are professional. I am assuming the <i>Adeccoligaen</i> (First Division) is fully professional - can anyone confirm this? What about the Second Division? <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 12:16, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Very weak keep</b> at the moment, since it seems that the Adeccoligaen is professional. Additionally, the fact that the team has contributed national reps would seem to suggest as much. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:54, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Weakest of all possible keeps</b> until we have clarified the notability guidelines for footballers. The term "fully professional" is flawed IMHO, as for example the Swedish <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allsvenskan.html" title="Allsvenskan">top league</a> team <a href="../../../g/e/f/Gefle_IF_89d7.html" title="Gefle IF">Gefle IF</a> has a few semi-professional players, which would make the top league not "fully professional" and thus deem a lot of players in other teams not notable when in reality they are very notable indeed. Generally, I am of the opinion that most players who has played regularly for at least a season in any of the top two divisions of countries the size (in terms of football interrest and level of football played) of Norway or larger have established notability. Weak keep only as the articles in question are sub-stubs at most. – <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a> <small>• <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a> •</small> 15:40, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</s>

<li><b>Comment</b> Even without getting into a debate about the pros and cons of conferring inherent notability on the thousands of semi-pro footballers in the UK alone, the simple fact is that the guidelines clearly state that a player must play in a fully professional league to be notable, and therefore non-professional players by definition cannot be considered to pass the guidelines! <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 00:26, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b> per nom. I would much prefer an unambiguous report that these players meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> rather than a string of "um, maybe" reports. Thus I don't think <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> has been established. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 17:06, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep all</b></s> (or redirect to <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skeid_Fotball_5b4e.html" title="Skeid Fotball">Skeid Fotball</a>); <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> actually says:
<blockquote>
<p>Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports or other competitive activities that are themselves considered notable</p>
</blockquote>
Since the <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adeccoligaen.html" title="Adeccoligaen">Adeccoligaen</a> is the second highest league in Norwegian footy, which seems to me to fall within the sense of "the highest level", I would think that these would merit inclusion. Semi-professional footballers, just like professional ones, may or may not be notable depending on the circumstances. Norway, India, Iceland, &amp;c, &amp;c, rely mainly on semi-pro or amateur players for even senior leagues and sometimes for their international teams. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 15:10, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Two mistakes here. The point about "highest level" pertains to non-league sports. For league sports which are mainly professional, such as football, we have the guideline "fully professional". These players fail this guideline. And why group Norway with C-class leagues like Iceland and D-class leagues like India? The Premier League and national team in Norway are composed of fully professional players, right there is more than enough for Wikipedia to cover with the current guidelines. <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunkmorten_c486.html" title="User:Punkmorten">Punkmorten</a> 21:40, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
