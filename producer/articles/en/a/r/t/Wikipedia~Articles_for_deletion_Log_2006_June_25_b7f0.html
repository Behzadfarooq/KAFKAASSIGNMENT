While considering this vote I went over to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Webcomics_eab2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics">Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics</a>. It was interesting to note that the members of the project have been through a process of attempting to formulate rules on deciding which webcomics were notable and appear to have been unable to reach a consensus - though, under strong guidance from <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a>, there seems to be a positive movement toward shifting webcomic stubs from Wiki onto <a href="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Comixpedia.org</a>. Unfortunately, the general attitude then is to leave the AfD process to clear away any mess. I would have hoped that members of the project would have taken more responsibility for their own area of interest and made positive decisions themselves as to which articles are worth keeping and which are not. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 08:29, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Delete as completely idiosyncratic non-topic. We have no article on the <b>topic</b> of Channel 20 TV stations in the United States because being assigned to channel 20 tells you nothing intrinsic about the nature of the station. if someone had written a meaningful, sourced, encyclopedic article on "channel 20 TV stations in the United States" this list could be a section within the article. But there is no such article, because this is not an encyclopedic topic.

<p>I just noticed that most of these lists include <i>cable channel assignments</i> mixed in with <i>broadcast channel assignments</i> without any indication of which is which, which makes it quite an intriguing intellectual puzzle to devise any plausible use for the list. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:53, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm not sure what you're asking, but... the articles on channels 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 say they include broadcast stations only; 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 say they include broadcast and cable; 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 are simply lists without explanation other than the title; 19 and 20 simply repeat the title without explaining whether a "channel 20 television station" means broadcast or cable channel. I am not sure how anyone could "just" edit them without individually checking every station on the list. It could be argued that the lists which only include broadcast stations are slightly more useful than the others because have some use in determining whether there is a possibility of the stations interfering with each other, but a category would do just as well. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:12, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete all</b> per nomination. These stations on each list have no significant connection with each other. For two stations in different cities to be on the same channel would only be meaningful if viewers were to carry their television sets from one city to another without being willing to change the channel on their sets when they arrive. By contrast, stations in the same geographical area have the same potential viewership, and stations with the same network affiliation broadcast many of the same programs as each other. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 02:14, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

They seem more "in place" there in my opinion - I meant it for someone in, for instance, Atlanta, who wanted info on <a href="../../../w/s/b/WSB-TV_f5c8.html" title="WSB-TV">WSB-TV</a>, and who would blindly type in "channel 2", to get a link to the article. It was only meant to be a dab list, which also explains why stations that used their cable channel in their branding were on the list (i.e. <a href="../../../w/z/v/WZVN_cbe0.html" title="WZVN">WZVN</a> would be referred to in the community more as "channel 7" than "channel 26"). As a "list" article rather than a dab page it seems less useful. I have no opinion on the deletions of the articles as they are now (hell, I'd even lean towards delete if forced to choose), but would support a merge back into the "Channel x" articles. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirjtc2_8434.html" title="User:Kirjtc2">Kirjtc2</a> 02:57, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, based on your comment, if you think it makes sense to have lists at simply <b>Channel X</b> titles, it makes sense to have <b>List of channel X TV stations in the United States</b> re-direct, doesn't it?? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgia_guy_82ac.html" title="User:Georgia guy">Georgia guy</a> 02:59, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> including cable channels on some of these makes them spectacularly not useful.

<li>You're missing the point. Lists of stations in states or markets, or of network affiliates, are more notable because the bond between those stations is stronger (competition and being "sister stations" respectively) than just being on a random channel. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirjtc2_8434.html" title="User:Kirjtc2">Kirjtc2</a> 21:25, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>The difference is that a list of stations by affiliation or market means a lot more than just listing them by channel number. Would you call a list of stations with female news anchors whose last name begins with S "still a list of TV stations"?

<li><b>Keep</b>. Unusually, I find myself advocating the keeping of an article others think should be deleted. Keep because the list is not inherently POV, and can, with work, be made to be an extrememly useful source of information (see <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_that_have_been_considered_the_greatest_ever.html" title="Films that have been considered the greatest ever">Films that have been considered the greatest ever</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_and_video_games_that_have_been_considered_the_greatest_ever.html" title="Computer and video games that have been considered the greatest ever">Computer and video games that have been considered the greatest ever</a> etc; hence it may be advicable to move this page to Film sequels that have been considered better than the original or something like that). IMDB may not be the ideal metric, but at least it is a fairly large sample size, and provides a place to start. Perhaps in future this article could cite critics such as Ebert, who have gie their views on sequels that are better. But, as long as the article says "this source says that this was better than that, this other source disagreed", it is not inherently POV. Yes, the article needs work. But no, it should not be deleted. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 09:16, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

I sincerely applaud its creation and the initiative of its founders. I heartily propose that official Wikipedia policy be changed so that every single deleted article or article section gets automatically transwikied to Antiwikipedia instead. Let's create some coding to streamline and automate that process, so it runs as fast as possible.

<dd>The issue with IMDB is that it is not a definitive source it's just a poll of people who vote on what they think. There are many different barometers of deciding what makes for a quality movie.

<dd>I disagree. If guidlines are made for the article so that it isn't called better just because of a few votes, I think a poll is an accurate sorce for if it is better than the original. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibout_ac75.html" title="User:Wikibout">Wikibout</a>-<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikibout_dc98.html" title="User talk:Wikibout">Talk to me!</a> 15:44, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: IMO, this article is inherently POV and violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> because the act of choosing to assess a pair of films for inclusion in the list is arbitrarily decided by the editor.

So however careful the editors are, it will always fail <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. The article's current POV crowbarring in of films that do not fit the alleged selection criteria is just the icing on the cake.

The Monday Club retaliated by accusing him and a number of other members of trying to mount an internal coup. The news coverage, which is very likely to be in more than just the <i>Times</i>, clearly meets the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> standard that "the person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person."

<p><b>Delete</b>. Another non-notable vanity article from the Monday Club set. Went to some dinners and edited a club magazine. Homey 04:15, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I realise this article may not appear significant, but the technical crew consists of only a very select group of people, while many students at Calday Grange (which I may add consists of around 1600 people) would like to be a part of it. It commands great interest in the school community, and this page gives the best practical means of supplying information about it which is wanted by many people. Besides, It's a reasonable article, as far as I can see it's encyclopaedic in the way it is written and isnt wikipedia supposed to be about supplying information, "notable" or otherwise? And why does it matter if YOU consider it notable, if it's supplying information that is useful to other people?<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Vwozone (<a href="../../../v/w/o/User_talk%7EVwozone_8713.html" title="User talk:Vwozone">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vwozone_4a71.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vwozone">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>I'm not a "notability" freak and I tend to vote against deletion on those grounds more than most wikipedians, but this really is silly (see my comments below). If you want people to know about it -- make your own web page (which is easy) or start a Calday wiki or something. Google will do the rest for you. As you well know, a lot of people in Calday will have no interest in being a member of the team. Again, think what would happen if every group had a page? Wikipedia is not a useful billboard.

<li><b>Delete</b> About as non-notable as one can get. I am an Old Caldean and had great involvment with the technical crew when I was there and I really don't think this can be said to deserve an article in its own right. When I attended the school, it had a very large number of clubs and societies. Are we to see an article on each one? For every school? What is more, this article really only covers a very recent group of members. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Davey_cdfc.html" title="User:Francis Davey">Francis Davey</a> 19:56, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I can say with absolute certainty that there is a large number of people with an interest in joining , having been approached personally many times. The article does not only cover a small number of members, it merely names the current team amongst the large amount of information on other aspects. "...Are we to see an article on each one? For every school?..." Allowing one article does not mean there will be a sudden influx of every school club in the world making a wiki. You may well see this as uninteresting or insignificant, but what bad effect will come of leaving it to be read by those who are interested? I really see no downside in leaving a small wiki alone - it's not harming anyone, and if you dont want to read it then you needn't search for it.</p>
<p>... Incidentally, mr davey, I should be interested to know what lighting equipment was in use in your time with the technical crew at calday - I should be willing to bet it was probably the same old ancient strand stuff we're using now!

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, we see this all the time from a lot of schools. We can't have an entry for every school's A/V club, or chess club, or dorm council.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is getting silly. I thought the idea of checking for "notability" was to prevent people creating badly written pages about their friends - not to delete encyclopaedic articles regarding something perfectly reasonable.

<li><b>Comment</b> It would be useful if you signed your comments and indented any comments you have on what other people are saying. It quite difficult to work out the thread of what you are saying because you aren't following accepted conventions on a page like this (that may be why some of your comments have been deleted, though they should not have been - its trivial to re-instate them). So please can you impose some structure on what you say and don't repeat yourself? You seem to be directing various comments at me personally, but I'm not clear which ones or what you think I have said.

<p>I don't even know where to begin here. The title of the page almost makes my case for me.

<p>Hey Danny,ever read this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> I just joined only about an hour or two ago,and like I usually do on sites I just join,I forget to read the rules.I also have a reason for the title crap,whenever I searched under the name of "Megaman Timeline" I got timeline for X3,and BN5,and Classic Megaman 8 yadda yadda.I had also just learned that how to make new topics because the searchword I looked up didn't have any article in Wiki.So I had to put WikiMegaman Timeline.I admit from only skimming I know a screwed up from what I know at least once.And it is not fancruft!Thats not even a word in the dictionary!Maaayybe speculation but not fancruft.I'm just stating the facts of the timeline by using the dates to organize it.And another thing captain noob biter,I freaking misunderstood the declaration of a discussion in your deletion policy and erased all of the Proposed to be deleted stuff.I did not intent to make this this worse,like I said I am a N00B.GET IT?</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks for the link, though it is naughty to delete other people's comments - please leave them where they are next time, and respond underneath. The information in the election article is plenty IMO - the guideline says "only if and when there is enough independent, verifiable information to write a non-stub article on a candidate should one be written". On the evidence of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Ball_78a5.html" title="Greg Ball">Greg Ball</a> as it stands, there is not enough information of this kind. The printing of a full letter text in the latter doesn't fool me that the article is stubby and contains POV soapboxing. Leave it in the election article IMO.

<li><b>Keep</b>, no harm and this small amount of information is no less than the little summaries on most of the book stubs. The books are notable and deleting these serves no purpose but to create more work for those creating them later. It's also good to have a broader diversity in books even if they are sub-stubs. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 07:34, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>If there were evidence of any constructive editing work being undertaken I would start to support your argument. But these stubs are old stubs. Since there has been no substantive editing to these articles since creation, it seems to me that no work is likely to be done. This discussion is surely nothing to do with diversity but to do with quality. The quality is simply not present. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 07:42, 25 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are completely right... but, I'm not seeing why that's grounds for deletion. They aren't bad articles... they are sub-stubs. We have many articles like this around Wikipedia on subjects that are notable and they serve as placeholders that do no harm. I did the base work for creating most of the sura articles for the Qur'an... and most of them are still stubs... but, many of them have provided an easy base for expansion by various editors. Creating an article usually takes more motivation than adding a sentence to an already existing article. I figure that someday (who knows or cares when) someone will see "Islamic Way of Life" and add some fact about how it sold X copies in Pakistan... or anything... and it will expand. If I thought it was doing any harm or was in any way biased I'd vote for deleting it... but, it's not. I guess we just differ in opinion. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 07:50, 25 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is the benefit of this process. We disgree. But we are neither of us important in the discussion except me to propose and you to oppose. You see sub-stubs as valid. I see them as invalid (no motivation to do more means no article). But others will review the articles and consesnus will be reached. And this is the reason I proposed these articles for deletion. I do not see wikipedia as a system of placeholders, but as an encyclopaedia. I thus feel that articles which do not meet notability for themselves shoudl not be present until that notability can be asserted within the article. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 07:59, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. The fact that other stubs exist (and need expansion) is no reason they should also not be deleted like these. This is not a discussion on whether the respective stubs are "good" or "bad", but whether they are worth being in an encyclopedia in their current empty form. We don't need placeholders, we need articles. And it's disheartening that none of the Keep proponents have volunteered to expand the allegedly important stubs. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 08:38, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I thank you for the acknowledgement of good faith. It is good faith; I believe in the continuous and never ending improvement of wikipedia. Even so, the creation of stubs is not a substitute for the creation of articles. If one cannot create an article that is sufficient to be at the very least a valid stub then one should not create the article at all. A sub-stub simply fools the reader into believing that something is present when it is not. This devalues wikipedia as a whole. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 10:50, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> IMO, stubs for books are not bad things as long as they refer to notable books.

<p><b>Comment</b> I have now withdrawn 2 of the articles fomr the nomination because I see sufficient assertion of notability.

<p>i made a effort to track the book covers for the rest of the books, but could not find them. As i said, this is since its harder to find this things online in enligsh, maybe a Arab speaker could google them. Anyhow, i feel i have done my share, i have saved the articles that i created. Regarding the other books, i advocate the solution that maximizes the chances of information beeing add: To keep the articles. Their notability is not disputed, only their not having a big enough article. An they are not going to get any bigger unless given the oportunity. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 17:29, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A look at <a href="http://www.fordhallfarm.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.fordhallfarm.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fordhallfarm.com/</a> will confirm that there are 2900 people in the UK who have put money into this scheme and that over £575,000 has been raised. The farm is not particularly under threat from developers but simply coming to the end of it's lease. If successful the land will be owned by all of the people who have subscribed under a community land initiative, a scheme which probably merits an entry in it's own right. National newspapers are following the progress of this in The Daily Telegraph (Weekend section) on 17th June and The Guardian (Society section) on 21st June. I have no connection with the farm (apart from I intend to buy a £50 share before 1st July) - but I do think it's an important initative and warrantentry in Wikipedia on the basis of organic farming and community land ownership issues. As this is the first entry I have ever written, I would be grateful for any help in fitting in with Wikipedia protocol rather than simply rejecting my submission</dd>

<li>just thought i'd put in my 2 cents on this. I'm a long time worker on the A&amp;W article, and I had made a separate page for the menu a few weeks ago. Surprise, surprise, it was deleted a week later. then another person went and made another one as per my suggestion on the A&amp;W Restaurants talk page, before he made it the rest of the way through the talk page. I'm saying <b>Delete</b> only because it's been tried before. and when it is deleted (which it most likely will be) I'll put the original text back on the page from before I made my first attempt at it. Sorry for being so long winded, but I felt that I needed to explain. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetStormer_996d.html" title="User:NetStormer">NetStormer</a> 03:49, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Okay; it's clear that it's not going to be kept, but I want to make clear my reasons for moving the material to this article (I am *not* the original author of the actual content). As (to all intents and purposes) this list was reference material, it was badly positioned amongst the primary article content, where it disrupted the readability of the main article body. Whilst it could have been moved to the end, I felt that it was likely to grow and be added to. To avoid the parent article becoming overly long, I felt it made more sense to put it in its own list article. Some points...

<p>An article about this person was previously speedy deleted as a non-notable biography (A7) and it was tagged A7 after being recreated several months later. However, the article makes assertions of notability and I think that an AfD discussion should determine whether they make the subject notable enough for an article. My opinion is to delete. If the article is deleted through this AfD, it can be speedy deleted if recreated, as long as it is substantially similar. If the article is created a couple of more times, I would suggest that it be protected against recreation. The author said that he saw his name here and decided to add content. I'm guessing he meant a red link, but the only link to the article is from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_male_mixed_martial_artists.html" title="List of male mixed martial artists">List of male mixed martial artists</a> and he added it himself. Perhaps there used to be another link or he forgot that he added it in January. If the article is deleted, then I suggest <b>deleting the entry on the list</b> to discourage recreation.

<p>I believe that my entry would be notable by the standards set by the MMA project on Wikipedia. "At face value, this would appear to include most professional mixed martial artists, but in practice should probably include those who have had at least one, and preferably several fights in an established professional fight promotion (e.g. not a startup promotion)." Since I have had several fights in Rage in the Cage, one of the longest running MMA shows in the United States, I would say that is noteworthy. Also I was one of the last to compete in the event before it became completely sanctioned. I would say any promotion that is about 10 years old is not a 'start up' and is pretty noteworthy. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jammer871 (<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJammer871_7034.html" title="User talk:Jammer871">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jammer871_67a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jammer871">contribs</a>).</small></p>

So you're discounting my participation in a MMA promotion that's existed for 10 years? I'm sure if I hadn't been more dedicated to my education I'd have participated in a lot more bouts. Also <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherdog.html" title="Sherdog">Sherdog</a> isn't the most reliable database either. 3 of my fights aren't listed there. Many smaller events results were sent in, but never put up on Sherdog. Full Contact Fighter's database is more comprehensive. Also my participation in MMA has extended me into to coaching as well. I also continue to referee at local <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazilian_Jiu-Jitsu_8a36.html" title="Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</a> and submission grappling events. I've done a lot more in the sport than a lot of people who just talk about it. Maybe you don't deem it important, but I feel I've earned my stripes.

<li><b>Comment</b> The list of MMA fighters in this encyclopedia will naturally include people who are notable in their own regard within other fields who have crossed over into MMA. This sort of thing is particularly popular and notable in Japan (where Pro Wrestlers, Sumo Wrestlers, traditional Martial Artists and comedians have all recently participated in MMA), and even in the USA there was a serious attempt to get a <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Rogan_c67d.html" title="Joe Rogan">Joe Rogan</a> vs <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesley_Snipes_c770.html" title="Wesley Snipes">Wesley Snipes</a> fight organised within the <a href="../../../u/f/c/UFC_e9e8.html" title="UFC">UFC</a>, America's highest-profile MMA event! <i>Of course</i> we should mention in a notable person's article if they have crossed over into MMA, even if their participation in MMA itself would not on its own make them notable.

Rage in the Cage is an established MMA promotion and <a href="http://fcfighter.brinkster.net/eventsearch.asp?EventID=136" class="external text" title="http://fcfighter.brinkster.net/eventsearch.asp?EventID=136" rel="nofollow">FCFighter</a> lists events from it since 1998, but it is regional in character and is probably the MMA equivalent of Single A or AA minor league baseball. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 06:30, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
It is a regional promotion and started off as such, but many fighters have moved on to the bigger events. It's become the 3rd longest running MMA event in the country, behind the UFC and I believe Extreme Challenge. Many fighters from out of state compete, and have competed, as well as several ex UFC fighters. It would be fair to be called around AA or AAA minor league baseball. I only would think that the article should stay to show that people involved in the sport on that level are actual people. I included personal stuff, like about my career, that I felt would help humanize the article. Plus I am still looking to fight again and would like to be able to expand on that. I also fought in Combat Zone in Massachussetts which is a very good show that is similar to Rage in the Cage in the sense it's helped propel many to greatness.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. As per a note I placed on the WP:MMA talk page: "I'm currently marshalling my thoughts on this one, but I'm erring on recommending delete on this one and expanding our notability standards section. When comparing RITC to my "regional" promotion, <a href="../../../c/a/g/Cage_Rage_8676.html" title="Cage Rage">Cage Rage</a>, I can't think of a fighter with 4 (or even 6) fights who I would write an article on who is not also, or has been, a champion at his weight class. I can think of several Cage Rage fighters who have more fights but no championship that I would consider notable. I also consider Cage Rage to have a higher (i.e. national/international level) profile than RITC."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Jon, whilst I agree that many notable fighters have fought in RITC, that does not in itself make every fighter who fights there notable; it makes the <i>promotion</i> notable. I think this is a debatable case that I suspect we'll use to help refine the WP:MMA notability standards, but I think it's probably going to be a delete. For now, however, please consider me <b>Neutral</b> on this one. — <a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEstarriol_Esperanza_23fc.html" title="User:Estarriol/Esperanza"><font color="green">Es</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEstarriol_eb96.html" title="User:Estarriol"><font color="blue">tarriol</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/t/User_talk%7EEstarriol_4f49.html" title="User talk:Estarriol">talk</a></sup> 07:35, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>, personally I think we should only have articles on fighters who have fought in the UFC or Pride, or have at least 20 fights otherwise. I disagree with deleting his name from the list, however. Simply de-redlink it, lists are supposed to be more comprehensive than categories, i.e. they are supposed to include people's names who may not necessarily qualify for a page themselves. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 20:41, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I wrote the article (sorry if it's badly written, as I'm new to this) because it is a staple of SF Bay area life (at least Silicon Valley from my experience) and I hear constant inquiries about it, what is it, how do they make it, why is it so black, etc. It is a topic of discussion at any BBQ or place where it's served; it also struck me as a bit of an odd and noteworthy thing with an interesting history that would fit in at Wikipedia - i.e. you hear about Fred Steak and go to Wikipedia to find out what it is (I in fact did that before deciding to write an entry). And the recipe is not directly for it, but an entry on how one might make this product elsewhere in the world, i.e. additive knowledge on a food item (which I admit does stray close to a recipe, but that's not the main point of the article). Feel free (obviously) to remove pricing (provided again for additive info on price escalation) or otherwise fix the article. And it's not a prank, as I thought it was interesting and worthy of an entry.<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMushero_3e8a.html" title="User:Mushero">Mushero</a> 03:09, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If you study enough conspiracies, you'd realize that since a minor population only believes in them, its either too difficult to PHYSICALLY prove it, or its just beyond the leap of evidence. That is where Wikipedia has failed - its failure to address <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_sense.html" title="Common sense">common sense</a>, whichi I hope it has an article on, if not, that would be sad. But conspiracies are hidden too well to be, "verified," to the point where everyone would accept it. It is not OR. How many times do I have to tell you people?

<dd>It is misleading to use bad Google searches to deny that a subject has many webpages on Google. The following accurate Google search shows thousands of hits for the Shefa group connected with Conservative Judaism. Check it out yourself. (Obviously most of these may not be a valid hit, but that is of course true for <i>all</i> Google searches. Do not apply a criteria to this one article alone that is applied to no other article! ) Look, I have no problem with people saying "Delete because it isn't notable", but then I do insist that this policy be applied to all groups, and not to this group alone. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%2Bshefa+%2Bconservative+%2B%28Judaism+OR+Jewish%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%2Bshefa+%2Bconservative+%2B%28Judaism+OR+Jewish%29" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Bad faith deletion of new article on <i>Shefa</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Huh? Why are people trying to delete an article on a very real group? The claim made on the Shefa Network page is false. The <b>Shefa Network</b> is a real group within <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Judaism_e32a.html" title="Conservative Judaism">Conservative Judaism</a>, and in fact is already larger than many organizations that Wikipedia already has many articles on. The Shefa Network already has:
<ul>
<li>Several hundred members</li>
<li>A journal</li>
<li>An official website and e-mail listserv</li>
<li>They have sponsored two major conferences</li>
<li>More activities are planned for the immediate future (Shefa Israel Mission over the Winter break this coming year, and tentative plans for a high profile musical event)</li>
<li>The development of two new websites designed to be part of a unified gateway into Conservative Judaism.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Sadly, the two people attempting to delete this entry <i>refuse to even discuss the issue on the article discussion page</i>. They have made no attempt to even research the issue. Note the timestamps; they tried to delete the article within <i>minutes</i> of its creation. Attempting to delete a page without even trying to ascertain the facts is against Wikipedia policy.</dd>
<dd>If someone somehow still doubts that this organization exists, I can arrange for an interview with its founder, or its journal editor, webmaster, and members of this organization who have been to Shefa's academic conferences. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 14:18, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Promotional, nonencylopedic article written in the first person by someone obviously extremely involved in the group. This individual is obviously unaware of Wikipedia's editorial policy, and has been extremely confrontational, defensive, and combative. He or she is also obviously puffing the importance and notability of the group and its "academic journal." If it is in fact notable, it should be rewritten from scratch, probably by someone not as emotionally invested in the organization. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENTK_0383.html" title="User:NTK">NTK</a> 14:25, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>NTK is saying untruths. No one here has made any statements about the importance of Shefa;s journal. He has simply made a string of ad homenim and false attacks, none of which have anything to do with the actual article. He is trying to delete the article because he dislikes me, which is a violation of Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>

<ul>
<li><b><s>Strong</s> Strong Keep</b>. The article does require more work in order to assert the notability of the organisation and would benefit from additional references. Conservative Judaism is a large movement worldwide. Any sub-group that has been in existence since 2004 in a global, Jewish movement is itself notable. Some that have existed for a shorter time are notable anyway. I'm concerned that the AfD nomination came so quickly after the article was ceated. Generally that implies bad faith to me. There is enough notability about this organisatiomn to warrant an article. This article is notable as an article, but I re-emphasise that it requires further work. However, it is only a couple of hours old. Don't we normally give peole time to create serious articles? <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 15:00, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Timtrent/Fiddle Faddle came in after RK canvassed six users and a Wikiproject page complaining of persecution. A rapid nomination for deletion is hardly bad faith when the article is of such low quality, obvious bias and exaggerations, and given the author's past history. It did not take me more than a few minutes to find that this "group" is nonexistent on the web and that its "journal" is not present in major university libraries. 20K website hits goes more to show obscurity than to show notability. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENTK_0383.html" title="User:NTK">NTK</a> 15:29, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's kind of you to wave some sort of accusation at me. However the fact that I came here after I had my attention drawn to the article has no bearing on my views. I see nothing wrong with RK's drawing my attention to the article. I had no need to take any action - I could have ignored his note entirely. I am sure he felt I might be interested. I was. And I have placed my thoughts here. I have also placed thoughts in the article's talk page. I looked at the author's past history. A 12 month thing in April 2005 expired, surely? So raking that up now seems to me to be rhetoric. Please stick to the article, not the personalities. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 15:39, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I accused you of nothing, I only pointed out the fact that you were canvassed—you on the other hand accused me of bad faith. And yes, it is considered problematic for users to spam talk pages in order to "save" their articles from deletion. I personally avoid voting on nominations I have found out through canvassing, especially when it is the author or the nominator who is canvassing. As to the parole issue, you will note that 12-month period is reset every time it is violated, and in any event personal attacks are <i>never</i> permissible. ArbCom rulings are hardly irrelevant, especially given that this user has previously been banned from editing Judaism-related articles for an entire year. To ignore that would be to make ArbCom toothless, and ArbCom is the one tool, if sometimes ineffectual, to protect WP from persistently abusive editors. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENTK_0383.html" title="User:NTK">NTK</a> 15:47, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nonetheless, whatever route I came here by, my opinion is my opinion. The matter in hand is the article. Please stick to discussing that. It is not rhetoric that keeps or deletes articles. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 15:54, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree, however the whole purpose of AfD is to determine the consensus of Wikipedia editors. When an editor attempts to subvert this process by canvassing "votes" from people he believes to be sympathetic, these opinions must be taken in that context. I was not attacking you, I was providing that context. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENTK_0383.html" title="User:NTK">NTK</a> 16:55, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I disagree with you. "providing context" means stating that "Several people have been cavassed for their opinions. It does not means stating "this perosn came here becuase he was canvassed" As you will also see the cancassing has drawn at least one "delete" opinion. These things tend to work out in the end and the correct consensus is reached. It doesn't matter whetehr we agree with the consensus. What matters is that the article is viewed on its merits and only on those. This discussion was moved to the talk page. It wouls be far more useful to keep it there. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 17:00, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I carefully searched for the term 'network' also, and both other organizations use it. The Moslem UAE based Hospital fund one specifically uses the term "Shefa Network" in the article I cited above, and the Jewish charity fund uses "Shefa's Jewish Shareholder Engagement Network". I think part of notability is <i>distinguishability</i>, which is rather weak here. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 02:06, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't mean distinguishability within WP - then DAB will take care of it. My point is that in this case of a newly formed organization of marginal notability, confusion with a name that is used by others with somewhat similar missions (religion related charity organizations), and some from fairly different religions like Islam and Judaism, does not help the case for establishing notability of this specific entry. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 12:17, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> because although Conservative Judaism is a big movement, this group is not and therefore wikipedia can not have articles on every single group of people that decide to form a group.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I find it difficult to argue for either keeping or deleting, using the "high-school" test for notability: Vanity edits are not notable, but individual high schools are notable to some populations: their students and teachers (and perhaps people in the vicinity). I simply don't know enough about Shefa Network online to know whether this article was a vanity article promoting someone's small operation or an article giving information about a phenomenon people would be interested in as third parties. If Shefa Network wants itself known on Wikipedia, try to do some groundwork on the Internet and publicizing the Shefa Network first. (I had a few qualms about the notability of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judeo-Paganism_8ace.html" title="Judeo-Paganism">Judeo-Paganism</a> after starting that article, but I had seen more than one website about it (although many of the sites that I've found recently were copies sporked off of the Wikipedia article; "Jewish Pagan" seems to get more unique results than other items, but such item on Google could refer to a list including Jewish people and Pagan people), I had also noticed that people had linked to it and sporked it to pagan-oriented online encyclopediae, and I notice now that there have been newspaper articles about Judeo-Paganism - and thus I have little difficulty in concluding that Judeo-Paganism is notable. I don't quite see the same amount of notability in the Shefa Network - make yourself heard more, then you'd get noticed and become notable.) — <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickyrab_21c2.html" title="User:Rickyrab">Rickyrab</a> | <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickyrab_2fd1.html" title="User talk:Rickyrab">Talk</a> 13:25, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Reasons to keep this article</li>
</ul>
<p>I have repeatedly offered to set up interviews between Wikipedia editors and people at the <i>Shefa Network</i>. Tellingly, <i>not a single person trying to delete the article</i> has accepted this offer. They also refuse to read the sources that were given. Why? It is especialy bizarre that while people who know nothing about this group are trying to delete its article, members of all of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Judaism_e32a.html" title="Conservative Judaism">Conservative Judaism</a>'s organizations are now working with Shefa. At this point it is no longer a matter of personal opinion. It is a now a <i>fact</i> that:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Members of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Committee_on_Jewish_Law_and_Standards_b696.html" title="Committee on Jewish Law and Standards">Committee on Jewish Law and Standards</a> are contributors to Shefa</li>
<li>Members of the faculty at the movement's rabbinic seminary (Jewish Theological Seminary of America) are contributors.</li>
<li>A growing number of rabbis from the <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbinical_Assembly_6c41.html" title="Rabbinical Assembly">Rabbinical Assembly</a> are contributors</li>
<li>Faculty from Conservative Judaism's <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomon_Schechter_school_6589.html" title="Solomon Schechter school">Solomon Schechter schools</a> are working with Shefa.</li>
<li>Shefa Newtork has already held two conferences, and two more events are already being planned, as well as yet another journal.</li>
<li><b>At this very moment</b> people from the Rabbinical Assembly are preparing for a tele-conference with multiple people from Shefa about the new Shefa websites, and coordinating with the new Conservative Judaism websites.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It seems that <i>zero</i> of the people trying to delete this article were aware of any of these facts. Since they now know these facts, one would imagine that they would change their mind. Let's note that the Shefa Network is more influential than dozens, perhaps hundreds, of other groups that currently have articles on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Note that the history of the delete attempt is even more telling: A handful of people started an attempt to delete this article <b>within minutes</b> of its creation. They are not applying that normal Wikipedia standards that we apply to all of our other articles. Worse, they <i>refuse</i> to even obtain any facts, sources, or talk to the many people involved. Isn't it obvious that some people are trying to delete this article <i>despite</i> its merits for inclusion? <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 14:24, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>RK, I think you may have some misunderstanding regarding WP, on several fronts. First, you seem to be trying to cast suspicion on other contributors. It doesn't in the least matter if your suspicions are 'well founded' or not. The WP policy is that we <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">accept good faith</a>, as long as we want to be <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a> and to edit here, and that means we must not cast suspicions or worse, attack the integrity or judgment of others. And let me say that the speed of the PROD or AfD's appearance is not an issue - lots of new articles come up for deletion as soon as they are born. The motivation for the deletion nomination of such articles is immaterial - only the facts relative to WP inclusion policy matter. Assuming you want to push for inclusion of this article, which is a legitimate aspiration, you should move away from attacking others (again regardless of the merits), and focus instead on the WP criteria for inclusion. Now you raise some points above that to you seem like they 'justify' inclusion. But again you are off target. WP is not an institution that 'interviews' potential inclusion candidates. WP is an <i>encyclopedia</i>, that bases inclusion criteria on published reliable notability of the article subjects. Either there is <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliably sourced</a> <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> or not. Being 'influential' or 'important' is not a WP criterion - being proven notable per reliable sources is. So what you should do, is look for verifiable reliable neutral published sources that prove that the article is notable. Thanks, <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 14:52, 30 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would add to that. Despite believing that notability is proven, I see no real attempt to enhance this article to prove that notability beyond the slightest doubt. <i>Knowing</i> that somethng is notable is not the same as <i>proving it</i>. I understand RK's belief that the deletion attempt was remarkably fast, and that it might be sectarian inspired and I can see how assuming good faith is hard in view of what could easily be viewed as "aggressive edits" to place what seems to me to be a disproportionately great number of banners at the head of the article by the same editor. However, the banners are designed to be helpful. And it woudl behove knowledgable editors to edit the article to enance it, thus seeking to guarantee its place here. The energy spent on rehetoric woudl be better spent on research, and assertion of notability. Wikipedia os not an exercise in oratory. It is an exercise in researching and citing facts. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 15:19, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Given what's been said, I don't see the harm in allowing the article to remain and be improved (I'm just a newbie, but I'd like to learn what I can &amp; work on various Wiki articles, including this one: already fixed a few minor inaccuracies). And given that <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> "is not an actual policy or guideline" and that understandings of what would prove this group "notable" or not vary, I hope that the article will not be deleted. Since <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="extiw" title="m:Wiki_is_not_paper">Wiki is not paper</a>, there's plenty of room; the Shefa Network article is not cluttering the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Judaism_e32a.html" title="Conservative Judaism">Conservative Judaism</a> category, for which there are only 16 pages--there are 36 for the category of <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Judaism_0be8.html" title="Orthodox Judaism">Orthodox Judaism</a>, including organizations like <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shema_Yisrael_Torah_Network_de96.html" title="Shema Yisrael Torah Network">Shema Yisrael Torah Network</a>, where the objections that have been raised here would also be relevant--I certainly have no objection to articles on both! --BeccaB 16:17, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> After looking at the article I see various issues with it including:
<ul>
<li>Massively undersourced</li>
<li>No real attempt to establish notability</li>
<li>Reads like a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> piece</li>
<li>Not wikified</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these are peripheral but the lack of establishment of notability for inclusion and the fact that it reads like a prop piece for the group are what sways me, if this article is cleaned up though I'd be more than willing to revisit this and I may try to do some cleanup myself later if I get a chance. <small><a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegasus1138_bb01.html" title="User:Pegasus1138">Pegasus1138</a></small><sup><a href="../../../p/e/g/User_talk%7EPegasus1138_96b0.html" title="User talk:Pegasus1138">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pegasus1138_f4b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pegasus1138">Contribs</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Pegasus1138_eec2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Pegasus1138">Email</a></sup> ---- 21:40, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Where do you see RK's vote above? I do see lots of comments by him, but not an actual vote by him. Also, he has yet to respond for my request for proof of reliably sourced notability. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 02:45, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think one has to accept that RK feels his vote has been cast, and as a strong keep. I would far rather he had devoted his energies to improving the article than to the rhetoric he has used here and elsewhere, and to replying to you (and, indeed, to me), but it is "clear" that he probably feels his oratory is equivalent to a strong keep. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 09:53, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have just spent some time tidying some aspects of this article. I have cited references to the items on the Shefa Network which appear in the media, and have also made the link to the new (and by no means yet notable) conservative judaism website. While that site is not yet notable it is also very new. While my opinion is alredy clearly stated that I already believe this article asserts sufficient notability, I feel these edits remove some other people's arguments against notability, though I appreciate that others will hold a different view. I believe we must apply a uniform yardstick to notability. I feel sufficient work has been done already, but do not dispute that more work can be done. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 11:09, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - it seems to me that the main argument against this article is that the organization is considered non-notable. But since Wikipedia isn't paper, and articles like this don't take away space or attention, even the most ardent deletionists accept a pretty low threshold for notability. The policy asks that there are independent sources that confirm the existence of groups such as this, and it's pretty clear to me that this is a real thing. I guess my question to those of you who voted delete, is this: W<b>hat evidence, specifically, would you require to see before you accepted that this organization is notable, i.e., that you'd change your mind?</b> And please be as specific as possible. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 02:55, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I personally would like to see it cited and described in some respectable neutral publication. Since I myself supplied one of the links in the article, I would know 'respectable' and 'neutral' when I see them, but anyone can judge for him/herself, of course. But your thrust is correct, because that's <i>exactly</i> what's needed here - real proof of published notability, not a lot of hand waving. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 03:22, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Why not? Francis Davey, what significance does any of that have? DaveG, i know for a fact theres no copyvio, beacause i helped write the text for the schools main website, and none of it is copywrited. The article has now been made less 'crap', modulus 86, Fan 1967, what pictures? and this does provide useful and wanted information for those members of the school who are just curious of the activities of the ccf, and those who are considering becoming part of it. Additionally mr davey, what part do the afformentioned societies play in the ccf? as of now, none. What harm can be done by leaving it? Maybe someone can answer this uestion, i can't myself, if you don't want to read it, don't! it's as simple as that.

<dd>That's a debatable claim I think. However the 'Superpower Criteria' are not reliably sourced and should not be used to make these judgements. In fact we, as editors, should not be making these judgements ourselves. What we need is to find reputable academic sources which advance this claim. If 'China is a superpower' has become part of the academic consensus of International Relations then you can edit the relevant articles accordingly. But if you can't find such a source then don't do it (<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>).</dd>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete</b>. After discounting newer editors (100 edits or less), I see four commenters for keep versus eleven for deletion. The established Wikipedians who argued for the inclusion of this article said relatively little in so doing -- this may yet other case where outside vote solicitation was ultimately self-defeating, as the dialogue was muddied by editors unfamiliar with Wikipedia.

<li><b>Update 2:</b> a reference has been added for the Strange English Project. As for Hess's own information, that can be found in the Hess article also on Wiki which has the Hess main page.

<ul>
<li>The Strange English project was not a commission. It was an idea I came up with at Hess and implemented at my local branch. When the main office learned of it, they thought it was a great concept and spread it internationally via their curriculum publications (which, in addition to being "in house" are also sold globally), putting OO comics into classrooms around Asia. I'm aware of PA's school activities (as well as the one time use of <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur_Comics_f693.html" title="Dinosaur Comics">Dinosaur Comics</a> in a Japanese classroom), however, this is on a much larger scale, which is why I argue it qualifies as notable. It's a case of a webcomic being officially adopted by an educational organization for the purpose of instructing students of various levels. As far as I know, this is the first instance of a webcomic being endorsed in such a way and on an multinational scale. At the very least, it is an important event, since Hess has over 60,000 students (according to them), all of whom are affected by the curriculum created by the main office. Sorry if this wasn't clear in the article. And you don't have to take my word for it: check Hess's website and Taiwan business listings to see how large they are; Hess is not a small company. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 01:41, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I was very much <i>not</i> referring or comparing to PA's school activities (which aren't even mentioned in their article). I am referring to projects like their involvement with the <a href="../../../e/s/r/ESRB_999d.html" title="ESRB">ESRB</a>, and the multitude of mini-comics they've done for a number of different companies, one of which by itself (which, I feel, is comparable to OO's volunteer work) would not even come close to giving PA their own article. That you posted a call to action on the front page does nothing to help me believe it deserves an article on its own merits. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 10:29, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My understanding is that it's quite normal to do a "call to action" when a comic's respective Wiki page is up for AfD (many non-comic pages have had similar "rallies"). It helps notify people who may not otherwise be paying attention that something is happening, since not everyone is on Wiki as frequently as others. I think your comparison of OO's work and PA's work with the ESRB and others is a bit off. To me, an educational institution is significantly different from marketing (which is the general category the ESRB example falls under). I won't go into it too much here to avoid clutter, but one way they're different: marketing is very short term in its scope and effect, while a school curriculum has a much more lasting impact on those who experience it. That's why I compared OO's Hess involvement with Tycho and Gabe's visits to schools, since it's at least in the same field. Wiki has many articles on types of curriculums and education developments, because they are notable due to their impact. I think it's arguable that the number of notable marketing campaigns is far fewer in number (at least, those notable in the sense of having a lasting impact on society beyond simply inserting a phrase into the public awareness for a time). So, for me, having had OO contribute to the curriculum development of a school that teaches thousands is a more significant achievement than if OO had, for example, drawn some art for an organization to use for ads. You seem to disagree on this point, which is fine. But I hope you understand my reasoning on this matter. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 01:26, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Saying it's not notable enough for wikipedia is ridiculous. Information is what wikipedia is for, whether it's that notable or not shouldn't be a factor. It's not your place to judge what is notable or not. Neopets R God 03:28, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It isn't uncommon for "notable" achievements to go under the radar at times, so it's perhaps a bit short-sighted to limit it to what is on searchable venues. The vanity is an addressable issue. I haven't read the comic, but the issues brought up can be taken care of without deletion.Yansen 07:19, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>, though it would probably be wise to address the vanity issues. I would first point out that by some people's definitions, no web comic is very notable in some sense ( with this coming down to how many internet users are even aware of web comics, to which I don't really know ). Granted I really don't have a good idea of which web comics are "notable" ( in the sense of web comics, assuming that some fair number are to be judged notable despite my first remark ), though apparently a large number are given a glance at the WP's webcomics project page. So while it is of concern that a lot of the editing was done by one of the web comic's authors, this can be remedied ( and in the meantime a marker could be added ). My keep rating is weak both due to the fact that I really don't know what "notable" for a web comic would be, and because I admittedly read the comic ( I'll let you all pick which reason's more important...&#160;:) ) DAG 10:06, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I am apalled by the double standards applied here. How does basic, unbiased information suddenly become advertisement just because the authors entered it and not a casual observer, who might not have nearly as much to say on the subject? By such standards, any encyclopedic work which contains more than a passing mention on a subject is advertisement. It's also a comic with a large following, so you can't say it's not in any way notable. Even if I hadn't been a fan, I would raise these objections in the interest of fairness.

<li>Assuming by "primary source" you mean the comic itself, the article has at least two reputable third party sources: the Hess activity book, which I have given publishing details for, and the site that shows Emi-chan was invited to host a webcomics panel at a major convention. So the third-party requirement is fulfilled to the extent possible (I would not expect any webcomic to have as many third party sources as, for example, a historical or current events article).

<li>By "credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy," we mean things like articles in mainstream newspapers, magazines or academic journals, not webcomics fan blogs and the like. Our standards for sourcing and accuracy in an encyclopedia article need to be as least as high as that of a junior high school research paper. If this topic is not covered by multiple, non-trivial, reliable, reputable sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy, then we should delete this article, because we are not working on building an encyclopedia full of unreliable, error-riddled trivia. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 05:06, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hmmm... okay. If I'm reading what you and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a> are saying correctly, there may be a slight problem. I don't think it's possible to write a useful article on even as widely-known a webcomic as Megatokyo whilst meeting these requirements, though I could be proved wrong. (The current Megatoyko article definitely appears to have verifiability and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> problems, but at least some are down to carelessness). Of course, it's possible to get some of the information from "credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy", but I'm not convinced you'd get a significant amount of information that way. - <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakomk_1f87.html" title="User:Makomk">makomk</a> 00:47, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think I understand what you mean, Dragonfiend. From the guidelines: "One of the keys to writing good encyclopedia articles is to understand that they must refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have already been published by reputable publishers." Since this is a webcomic, summaries of the comic itself are allowed to use the comic as a "reliable source." So I think we can all agree the character and plot summaries that make the bulk of the article all satisfy verifiability since it is possible to read the comic and confirm what's stated (i.e. the summaries refer to a published primary source). The claim about the forum size is also verifiable simply by going to said forum. The Strange English Project already cites a reference published by a "reputable publisher" (i.e. Hess, whose credentials are quite good in the field of educational publications). And the comments made concerning OO's staff changes are based on statements made by the creative team themselves; publicly viewable direct quotes satisfy the verifiability requirement, especially since I used the ones that were archived (this is as opposed to direct quotes that are not publicly viewable, such as through email, or those that are not archived, like forum threads which can be deleted at any time, which are not verifiable). For example, if John Kerry published an opinion on his blog, said opinion could be added to his Wiki article since it's a publicly viewable direct quote from him that can therefore be referenced in the future (but only in its archived form, so it doesn't disappear). The same type of citation is made here. Not every article requires the same type of references in order to be reliable and accurate; in this case, since there are only a few claims beyond plot summaries, the amount of references is few, though their quality - and associated notability - is high. So the purpose of the verifiability requirement, making sure articles aren't "error-riddled," has been satisfied, since no errors are present in the article and it is possible to prove so with the references contained therein. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 01:20, 24 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, actually what we mean by "credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy," are things like articles in mainstream newspapers, magazines or academic journals. Things like webcomics or blogs or online forums, on the other hand, generally do not have a reputation for fact-checking, accuracy, or credibility. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 05:07, 24 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In that case the article satisfies the requirement to the extent necessary, since it has a reference in the Hess book, which could count loosely as an "academic journal." The book underwent a process of peer review and editing, which is the important feature of a third-party source (in contrast, a non-peer reviewed academic journal would not satisfy the verifiability requirement). I don't think there are any webcomic articles that use third party sources for plot and character summaries (since using the primary source of the comic itself is superior to a third party source for that info). So, the verifiability requirement has been met for this particular article. When OO does other notable things, I'll be sure to watch out that editors reference "credible, third-party sources" to verify it as has been done already. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 14:15, 24 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So, your only claim of a credible third-party source is a single clasroom exercise that you created with your webcomics? According to your vanity article, "The Strange English Project began in July 2005. Xuanwu, then an English teacher in the Republic of China (ROC) working for Hess Educational Organization, took OO comics and blotted out the dialogue. ... The Strange English Project itself has become adopted by Hess and is now part of its recommended games and activities..." I'm not convinced that classroom games and activities found in a single book are notable, or that you creating a game about your webcomic is a very good third-party claim of notability. Also, your promise to continue your vanity edits to your vanity article don't give me much hope for this article. Let's delete this unverifiable vanity article. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 17:46, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I recommend you re-read my earlier posts, as I make clear why a "single classroom activity" is important when said activity is then applied on an international scale. If you disagree with this, that's fine, but I think you understand why I view a book published by Taiwan's largest English education curriculum provider as a good third-party source. On another note, your RfA made it clear you're supposed to behave with civility, not engage in bad faith comments by using the word "vanity" like a slur. Please be more polite to your fellow editors.

I find it tremendously interesting that there are Wikipedia editors who want to pursue academic respectability -- which they will probably never achieve -- at the expense of the one thing which undeniably makes the whole enterprise worthwhile from an outside standpoint. -- An anonymous <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stumpers-L_f146.html" title="Stumpers-L">Wombat</a></li>

<dd>Comicgenesis is not Geocities. It's an online publisher of webcomics, not a free website host. It does have some quality control, and it is essentially the 'amateur wing' of Keenspot. "Strange Candy" (Okashina Okashi) is well-known, with links from Megatokyo at one time; it's one of the more established comics on Comicgenesis/Keenspace. If you felt OO didn't satisfy WP:WEB, then neither would almost any other Keenspace/Comicgenesis comic, as webcomics are rarely referenced or reviewed in print and therefore do not usually satisfy #1, except for those that have won awards (#2); what is your criterion for keeping the entries of any of the others? Do you feel they are also not notable enough to be included in the Wikipedia? I still say keep; I feel that deleting their already-existing entries is contentiously and arbitarily destroying valuable reference material for which Wikipedia is well known. Of course, you're the editors, it's your wiki, it doesn't aim to be complete, and you are of course free to disagree. 81.2.97.157 18:57, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is that just because it is published by a publisher with some standards for content acceptance <b>DOES NOT MEANT THAT IT IS NOTABLE</b>.

It <i>deserves</i> its own article.

<li><b>Keep</b> Point 1 - This webcomic fluctuates between 3rd most popular and 15th most popular comic on <a href="http://guide.comicgenesis.com/KeenspaceNumPL_1.html" class="external text" title="http://guide.comicgenesis.com/KeenspaceNumPL_1.html" rel="nofollow">ComicGenesis Top 50</a>, ranked by pages served(Ghastly omitted) . Point 2 - Wikipedia editors tend to flag all webcomic entries as Vanity, due to the webcomic owners over-editing the pages for correctness. Point 3 - You can verify it's popularity from the third party <a href="http://extremetracking.com/open?login=okashio" class="external text" title="http://extremetracking.com/open?login=okashio" rel="nofollow">stat tracker</a>. Point 4 - You can verify it's popularity from it's own links to top webcomics (ranked 101 out of 6500, that makes in the top 1%),Point 5 - Wikipedia should no more be used as a staple of content's popularity than google. It's not the end of the world if Wikipedia does delete an entry, but by deleting everything that "isn't popular enough" to an objective value to be included creates a barrier to entry that discourages people from contributing anything in the first place. - <a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKisai_fcf1.html" title="User:Kisai">User:Kisai</a> 00:47, 26 June 2006 (PDT)

<li><b>Comment</b>: 1) Being about the 10th most popular webcomic on a particular free webhosting site is rather trivial when you consider the tens of thousands which are not on that site. If being number 10 on this website were that big of a deal then their would be plenty of reliable sources writing about this webcomic and the creator of this webcomic probably wouldn't have to write an article about themselves. 2) This is not flagged for <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a> because the webcomic's author simply corrected some errors in the article. It is flagged for vanity because the webcomic's author created the article and has edited it heavily ever since. Check out the history <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Okashina_Okashi&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Okashina_Okashi&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> which clearly shows the webcomic author creating the article and making about 60 edits to it, more than all other editors combined. Check out this diff <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Okashina_Okashi&amp;diff=19071017&amp;oldid=10948734" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Okashina_Okashi&amp;diff=19071017&amp;oldid=10948734" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> which shows the webcomics author making 14 consecutive edits to the article over the course of several months in which they add 20-some odd paragraphs of completely new content. This is the furthest possible thing from someone simply correcting mistakes in an article about themselves; this is the absolute definition of <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a> where someone creates a lengthy encyclopedia article about themselves. 3) We don't have inclusion standards for web sites based on their traffic. If an extremely low traffic site has a huge impact on culture that is verifiable through reliable sources (it's written about in the New York Times and Wired Magazine, for example) then we might write an article about it. If a high traffic site is unverifiable through reliable sources, then we can't have an article, because we're building a reliable encyclopedia. 4) Simlar to your first point, being just outside the top 100 on a site that measures a fraction of all webcomics is rather meaningless and trivial. 5) This isn't up for deletion because it "isn't popular enough." it's up for deletion because it violates a large number of guidelines and official wikipedia polices, from <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> to <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> to <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and beyond. Finally, are you the same "Kisai" that's listed as being one of the two "folks behind Comic Genesis"? <a href="http://www.comicgenesis.com/about.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.comicgenesis.com/about.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> If so, that would be a good thing to disclose in order to minimize any conflict of interest issues inherent in telling people how notable the webcomics hosted on your site are. If not, sorry for the mix-up. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 06:27, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as per above; Google is not the only search engine in the world, nor is it an absolute authority on notability. Plus, this article might be vanity, but it will definitely not be that way in the future after the article is given time to stabilize. This is a collaborative encyclopedia, and thus we must work on articles to bring them to an acceptable level of quality. I believe a lot of people forget that sometimes and would rather take the easy way out. —Michiel Sikma (<a href="../../../m/s/i/User%7EMsikma_222d.html" title="User:Msikma">Kijken</a> maar niet <a href="../../../m/s/i/User_talk%7EMsikma_e16b.html" title="User talk:Msikma">aanraken</a>) 06:08, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>These are not personal attacks - these are factual. Neuropean is a sockpuppet and it is surprising how many of the Hockey lads are making a point - astonishing how interested they all are in this article. I tried to AGF but it is not possible when there is clear getting their own back going on. It has nothing to do with the way people are voting (but don;t forget AfD is not a vote ebeven though some don;'t get that) - this is people playing sily buggers.

<p>Well Mr Melnikov, thanks for your constructive criticism. This was my first attempt at posting on Wikepedia - absolute newbie - and I'd thought that I'd post a short article about HypnosNLP. Rather naively I hadn't read the guidelines and have now amended the article keeping it short and informative and hopefully within the ToS. Actually FYI we're very much in business but the blog does need a bit of work. Regards, Greg <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by HypnosNLP (<a href="../../../h/y/p/User_talk%7EHypnosNLP_ac38.html" title="User talk:HypnosNLP">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HypnosNLP_39a1.html" title="Special:Contributions/HypnosNLP">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Yea, I'd like to say good job at your amendments to the article. Other editors would have likely attempted to remove the warning or even personally attack the users who placed it. It's certainly looking alot better. It might actually be applicable to remove this from AFD, but I dunno how this would work: Most AFDs are actually questionable enough to get debate.

<li>I found another large chunk on another website, so that's at least two copyvios. Most of the rest has that "copyvio feel" too, so I've trimmed the article down to a stub. They certainly seem to have released a record on a real indie record label, but only one: WP:MUSIC appears to require two, or some other reason for notability.

<li>I think you're right... it's not cited and it's either OR or they didn't cite where the knowledge came from (which doesn't necessarily make it copyvio... but, plagiarism)... but, I think a references tag will cure that... and, if something isn't sourced after a while it can slowly be removed as it's questioned. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 00:05, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

It's very informative about a fledgeling BJD company! The company is totally notable. There is an entire thread 60+ pages long on Den of Angels the largest english BJD forum on the web. Where threads rarely get over 10 pages. <a href="http://www.denofangels.com/forums/showthread.php?t=55466" class="external text" title="http://www.denofangels.com/forums/showthread.php?t=55466" rel="nofollow">Doll Zone Supporters Alliance</a> If a BJD comapny can get that much attention on DOA then they are certainly worth mentioning. The reason they are mostly bought on eBay is because the Chinese site only sells the dolls within China. This is a very common practice in Asia where you have to live in a country A to order something from a company located in country A. It's very hard for people to make a site in a language that they are not completly fluent in. So it's just easier for them to sell through a rep who prefers eBay. There are thousands of totally legitimate companies selling on eBay. Jerrysugarav 07:02, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

I was very excited to find a few articles on dollfies here and it would be a shame to see this one go.--Mandypandy 14:31, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I'm a ABJD fan, but this company isn't really world-culture important, other than perhaps a mention on the main ABJD page. I don't think listing all 25 or so abjd companies on here is important, considering how small these companies are. There is a whole BJD wiki for detailed info on BJDs, only general info is really relavent to this Wikipedia.

<li>As Danaar pointed out i am not a regular because this is my first article the other two people i don't think helped out on this article but as you just said i am new. so just like you i would like to note that you are as well so does that mean we shouldn't listen to your vote too? i think everyone has the right to vote and be heard.Amarazyxxie 02:19, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually, There is no vote! The administrator will take into account what people say, but can make either determination. (And, I have nearly 500 edits over several subjects, mainly art and japanese subject matter). People with few votes, or who have vested interest in the article, usually aren't given as much consideration. Mythdoll simply isn't notable, they haven't had books (or other articles in news and media) written about them or their products, their stock isn't used to calculate stock market indecies.

<li>Also, that's a lot like the Pokémon test. Saying "We have a lot of articles on non-notable topic A, so we should allow articles on non-notable topic B" is fallacious reasoning.

<ul>
<li>FYI, I'm not saying individual schools are inherently notable. I don't think they are; neither are individual churches, post offices, supermarkets, shopping malls, etc. However, if it is that schools are inherently notable (without conceding the point), then the same logic applies to churches. It isn't two wrongs making a right, it's consistency. Until then, it's every article judged on its own merits.<a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 17:22, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Saint Francis Episcopal Church, Potomac Parish, is an Episcopal church located at 10033 River Road in Potomac, Maryland. The church is a member of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington and one of the two churches in Potomac Village. Its bell can be heard throughout the village every fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>History The church was founded in 1955. It is named after Saint Francis of Assisi.</p>
<p>Philosophy St. Francis is firmly grounded in the tradition of the Anglican Church. The Episcopal liturgy is very important to the parish.</p>
<p>Day School One of the most important missions of the church is the operation of St. Francis Episcopal Day School, which comprises students in preschool through grade 5. The current Head of School is Patricia Talbert Smith, formerly of Norwood School, who began her service to St. Francis for the 2005-2006 school year and was officially installed as Head of School in December 2005.</p>
<p>Student Ministries St. Francis has a vibrant Student Ministries program which supports students in grades 7-12 (younger students participate in a Sunday School program).</p>
<p>Services During the school year, St. Francis offers three services on Sunday morning. The 8:00 service is the shortest of the three and has no music. The 9:00 is consistently the most well-attended service; on peak Sundays such as Easter Day those desiring well-placed pew seats for a group should arrive at least twenty minutes in advance of the service. The 11:15 service has music just as the 9:00 does but is smaller.</p>
<p>In the summer months, only two services are offered at St. Francis: 8:00 and 10:00.</p>
<p>The Holy Eucharist is given at most services at St. Francis. Typically, one to two services at each time per month celebrate Morning Prayer, in which the Holy Communion is not given. Communion at St. Francis is open to all baptized Christians, regardless of denomination; however, St. Francis welcomes visitors of any religious background to services.</p>

<li>I find that lists are not encyclopedic unless they are a <i>necessary</i> part of an article (to better explain or describe the significance of the article or to contribute to a greater understanding of the article). If including such a list in the article itself would make the article itself unwieldy, then creating a separate "article" for the list is fine. However, a list like this does not do anything to help us better understand anything about Prime Ministers of Canada or better explain the significance of the subject. As it serves no such purpose, I consider it listcruft. Just because <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not paper</a> does not mean it is a place for trivia or indiscriminate lists of things, per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">WP:5P</a>. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 04:43, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This appear to be another hoax article about an upcoming album.

A new album from a popular singer, due to be released in <i>"early to mid 2006"</i> (i.e. any time now) would certainly have more in the way of reliable online references by this point.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I <i>really</i> don't like the new speedy keep guideline (note: guideline, not policy) and this AFD is a poster child for why it is bad. The purpose of it is to stop articles from being repeatedly brought up for deletion in a "forum shopping" situation or as an annoyance tactic. That, however, is not the case here. We're five months into the six month moratorium and this is obviously a good faith nomination. Anyway, enough of my rant ... as for the article itself ... the website never met <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, a guideline which has not changed in the last six months. It has an alexa ranking of 180,522. <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&amp;url=wrestlecrap.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&amp;url=wrestlecrap.com" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> Googling finds only self-generated and blog hits.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I fail to see how this qualifies for a speedy keep. I agree with the points brought up by BigDT. It comes off as advertising and saying something is "notable among internet wrestling fans" doesn't make it notable in general. I am a fan of their site, and I do listen to their radio show, but the site has a lack of content (due to bandwith costs), and a low alexa rating. It does come across as cruft, and should be removed. If it is not removed, it should be cleaned up extensively. --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgwerworldz_a32c.html" title="User:Burgwerworldz">Burgwerworldz</a> 09:28, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>If the books are notable, that doesn't automatically make the website notable. I don't know, though, that it is definitely a given that the books are notable. There is one overriding concern about both - are there ANY independant resources? Media mentions? Book reviews? Anything? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 13:51, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, we disagree about the books and website thing, I think they go hand in hand. Regardless, <a href="http://www.ecwpress.com/books/wrestlecrap.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ecwpress.com/books/wrestlecrap.htm" rel="nofollow">ECW Press</a> isn't some vanity publisher, so that really should be taken into consideration. But since you're asking about sources, keeping in mind that third party wrestling commentary is a bit of a niche, we can start with the Canadian <a href="http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/01/21/320002.html" class="external text" title="http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/01/21/320002.html" rel="nofollow">Canoe</a>, and I'll note a number of Wrestlecrap citations and mentions at Google News throughout the wrestling community, on and offline. That may not be enough for some people, but it's more than enough for me. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 14:01, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article you linked is a good start ... any non-trivial, non-self-generated third party references are good for showing notability and for having a good article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. WrestleCrap is probably the most popular wrestling-comedy url and arguably the most well-written of any wrestling site out there.

<li>The site has a fairly low amount of material, and it's simply just a cult website. I think the poor alexa rating really makes this grounds for deletion, and I'm stunned that more don't agree.

<li><b>Keep</b> - it is very notable among the pw fan community, with its site maintainers having published a few notable works.

<li><b>Delete</b> Judges are not automatically notable. And certainly having an ISBN or media coverage isnt. I don't see how her childhood or the book makes this remotely encyclopedic.

<li><b>Must Keep</b>. This fad has mobilized more YTMNDers than any other, it has taken on a life of its own and is no longer relegated to the confines of YTMND. Not just a simple YTMND meme, it is almost a way of life. The naysayers are being more vocal because the people who understand it are too busy participating.

<li><b>Must Keep</b>. This YTMND fad brought all YTMND'ers together. It really gave people a sense of comradery. Please do not delete.I would just like to quote .. "naysayers are being more vocal because the people who understand it are too busy participating." so true. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE: people who are suggesting deletion also suggest deletion of OTHER YTMND.com wiki's. Just because it happened on the internet doesnt mean it isnt history, okay? And a reply to "Aren't most notable fads more than 24 hours old?" No. This one became so instantly popular it was notable within just a few hours of it's creation. <a href="../../../n/1/c/User%7EN1CK70_3113.html" title="User:N1CK70">N1CK70</a></li>

<p>This page appears to me to be no more than a toy owner's description of his or her toy. I can find no other references to this PollyPocket character, and even the description says it is a toy "owned by two girls in Lamar, Missouri". As such I do not believe it has a place in Wikipedia.
