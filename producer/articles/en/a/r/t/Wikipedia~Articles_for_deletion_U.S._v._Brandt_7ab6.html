<li><b>Keep</b> - This should be closed since I nominated it and am withdrawing the nomination (I think that's how it worked).

<li><b>Keep</b>. Where to start? First of all, I've never noticed any AfD about notability of a USSC case, all of which are of course notable. Even so, the USSC (and any other court) may often cite case law from other jursidictions, so there is certainly no reason that a case from a lower court should not be encyclopedic just because it's from a lower court. I can't tell much about how important this particularly case really has been, but a draft-era case in which someone you so pointedly refer to as a "draft dodger" was cleared by a federal circuit court seems unquestionably notable to me. If <a href="../../../s/y/l/Sylvester_Stallone_7277.html" title="Sylvester Stallone">Sly</a> had a similar legal case at this level, it should certainly be mentioned in wikipedia (but I see no mention of anything like that). <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> 01:25, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, this is not a USSC case. It is an appeal of a local court case. Hence it is essentially a local court case, which is decidedly not notable. It had zero media coverage at the time, and has zero usage for anything other than talking about Brandt's biography. Interestingly, and hypocritically, something of actual note, like <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_Watch_ec7c.html" title="Wikipedia Watch">Wikipedia Watch</a>, which has meaning well and truly beyond Brandt, is apparently on the road to deletion. There is more than 1 thing wrong with that logic. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 06:12, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>An "appeal of a local court case" is essentially a local court case, and therefore non-notable? What about <a href="../../../r/o/e/Roe_v._Wade_9976.html" title="Roe v. Wade">Roe v. Wade</a>? Essentially no cases start at the USSC; they are <i>all</i> appeals of (more) local cases. In this case a federal appeals court took a case of the US government against a private citizen; this is hardly a "local court case". It got no media attention in 1970? How do we know? Whether it has been an important precedent in draft law I am not qualified to judge, but it is not obviously non-notable. Finally, comparing this to any other AfD is just silly, unless you're comparing it to another appeals-level decision. I'm afraid there's some politicking here I don't get, since I don't even know who Daniel Brandt is, and I don't particularly care; I'm basing my opinion entirely on the article and the fact that a federal appeals court decision on a draft-era case looks notable to me. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> 06:42, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good point. "We don't know" whether this had any media attention or was notable. Almost certainly it didn't. Unless it definitely did get media attention or was used in some cases then it is most certainly not notable. As for the Roe v. Wade case above, that obviously had some claims to notoriety. What claims does this have? I'll tell you what - in 2004 in Australia there was a High Court case of R v Vizard against <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Vizard_6b2a.html" title="Steve Vizard">Steve Vizard</a>, who was the founder of <a href="../../../f/u/l/Full_Frontal_cb22.html" title="Full Frontal">Full Frontal</a>, a comedy series, and also a prominent lawyer. He was found not guilty. There was also a Supreme Court trial of R v Trinh &amp; McLean where 2 teenagers were found guilty of the murder of 2 Filipino prostitutes that they said they were forced to kill because of threats from the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hells_Angels_5373.html" title="Hells Angels">Hells Angels</a> who are the largest organised crime group operating out of Darwin. Now, which of these 2 is the most notable? Steve Vizard's one was in a higher court than Trinh &amp; McLean's. Or, wait, what about <a href="../../../r/_/v/R_v_Murdoch_8805.html" title="R v Murdoch">R v Murdoch</a>? That one wasn't in the High Court either. Maybe that one isn't notable. LOL. I can think of dozens of High Court cases that are not remotely notable and haven't been used for anything. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 12:15, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Very good point. I guess that the problem here is that his privacy is already breached by Google when they publicly released his name, and then secondly by Wikipedia creating an article about him. So the damage has already been done. This article does not further damage his privacy. Indeed, there is an argument that Google had already breached his privacy and hence that Wikipedia did not worsen the existing privacy breaches, and hence did nothing wrong. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 06:15, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, that's not true. This was an appeal of a local court case. There is a whopping great difference between this kind of thing and a trial of murder or something like that. Do we include every single appeal in here? It's absurd. People are still questioning the notability of something like R v Trinh &amp; McLean, the most important case in Australia of 2004, yet someone is saying that this unheard of case should be included in here, when it has no significance to anything, other than to Brandt's personal biography. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 06:10, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. SCOTUS cases are inherently notable. And Zordrac's argument is absurd; the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over very few things, almost EVERYTHING starts off as a lower court case. Name the dozen most important cases in US legal history, and I'll bet 10 of them started off as appeals of lower court cases. Zordrac doesn't understand how the US legal system works. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 07:43, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Again, not a Supreme Court case. This was merely an appeal from an administrative hearing. The decision has not been cited by any court since 1976.

<li>Just so you know, my Dad had an almost identical case to Brandt's.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't think Brandt's notability or privacy are pertient issues to this discussion. The notability of this particular case should be the matter at hand.

There is no evidence presented that this case is particularly significant, or significant at all, that it established any notable legal precedent, or that it has been referred to in any way in any legal or historical writings. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 07:38, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
