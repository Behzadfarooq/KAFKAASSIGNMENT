It is a premier and renowned mountain biking recreation destination that readers would like to know more about. This article provides <i>specific</i> links to locations to ride and the best rides that other editors can contribute to. That information would probably be overlooked by readers at the more general links that the <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Tamalpais_2fe1.html" title="Mount Tamalpais">Mount Tamalpais</a> article has already been reduced to.

<dd><b>Comment and brief essay</b> - I am a member of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cycling_e7bf.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cycling">WikiProject Cycling</a>, and a personally non-neutral partisan of <a href="../../../c/y/c/Cycling.html" title="Cycling">cycling</a>, but all WikiProjects must conform to Wikipedia's policies. Wikipedia is an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a>, and not a general-purpose information appliance for any particular group of users. Perhaps the most basic feature of encyclopedic content is that it has been published in a reputable source already; see: <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTRIBUTE_be04.html" title="WP:ATTRIBUTE">WP:ATTRIBUTE</a>. Everything we write on Wikipedia has to be attributable to a reputable source. That's why, among the <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycling.html" title="Bicycling">bicycling</a>-related articles, there seem to be so many articles about elite <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycle_racing.html" title="Bicycle racing">bicycle racing</a>, and fewer articles about the bicycling most bicyclists actually do: bicycle races are widely reported in <i>published sources</i>, whereas much of non-competitive bicycling gets less press. The key to writing an <i>encyclopedic</i> article about a cycling-related topic is to get the article's information from published sources, and cite them all properly. Doing that generally avoids these article deletion nominations.</dd>

Someone merely needs to research the cycling literature and find multiple published sources documenting the history of mountain biking on Mount Tamalpais. I can recall reading about the legendary "Repack" race years ago (mentioned in <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Fisher_0910.html" title="Gary Fisher">Gary Fisher</a>, but also unsourced there, regrettably). There have probably been notable bicycle races on or around Mount Tamalpais, reported in published sources, which could go in the article without dispute.</dd>

<li><b>Rewrite within another article.</b> The article looks like a content fork, and the how-to style isn't very encyclopedic. On the other hand, there's some significant history of mountain biking that happened on Mt. Tam. I'd suggest removing the driving directions from the article and adding some history of the pioneers of the sport as practiced on Mt. Tam. As far as the trail descriptions are concerned, they can either be covered by an external link, or summarized with a couple quick sentences. The pictures can be included as a gallery within another article. As far as the merge goes, I'd suggest putting the useful content either in <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Tamalpais_2fe1.html" title="Mount Tamalpais">Mount Tamalpais</a> or <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Tamalpais_State_Park_1ea3.html" title="Mount Tamalpais State Park">Mount Tamalpais State Park</a>. I'll also mention the <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mountain_biking_in_British_Columbia_c2bc.html" title="Mountain biking in British Columbia">Mountain biking in British Columbia</a> article as a precedent. I created that article several months ago by splitting off some content from <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mountain_biking.html" title="Mountain biking">Mountain biking</a> that was digressing from the main article content. Also, I'll mention that my opinion was solicited in the discussion, but when that happens, I don't always vote "keep" indiscriminately. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> - <a href="../../../e/l/k/User_talk%7EElkman_bf81.html" title="User talk:Elkman">(Elkspeak)</a> 14:19, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> â€“ You're right about the historical information, <i>however</i>, note that there's very little historical information in <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mountain_Biking_on_Mount_Tamalpais_6cea.html" title="Mountain Biking on Mount Tamalpais">Mountain Biking on Mount Tamalpais</a> and that that information <i>is already in</i> the <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Tamalpais_2fe1.html" title="Mount Tamalpais">Mount Tamalpais</a> article. If the historical information on mountain biking on Mt Tam got to be extensive enough, that could justify a breakout article from the main "Mount Tamalpais" article. However, as it stands, the real reason for the present breakaway article is to include largely unencyclopedic content. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 20:08, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

I suggest putting the how-to, travel-guide information on Bicycling Wiki, which <i>wants</i> this information, and working on an encyclopedic version of the article for Wikipedia, which can for example survey the extensive cycling literature references to mountain biking in the area, and link to the eponymous Bicycling Wiki article for the travel guide material.

<li><b>Keep</b>, Mountain Biking on Mount Tamalpais does make some very strong <i>claims</i> to notability. Such as being the "birthplace" of mountainbiking and having had famous races there. I'm going to take the word of members of WikiCyling on this for now.... but it would help a lot if we have a few sources for these claims. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 20:49, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, disagree with nom.

<li><b>Delete</b> or transfer the info somewhere else but not in Wikipedia. When it comes down to it Wikipedia is NOT a travel guide (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>), mountain biking guide, how to guide, or any other kind of guide - its and encyclopedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> - mountain biking at this location appears to meet notability criteria and is certainly of interest to the cycling community. However, I agree with others who have noted the article does need a rewrite so that references/citations are provided and to make the style more encyclopedic. A 'guide style version' could live on in the <a href="http://www.bicyclingwiki.com/index.php?title=Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://www.bicyclingwiki.com/index.php?title=Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Bicycling Wiki</a> <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 22:27, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

According to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> we shouldn't allow it. Good start but I don't quite see an legitimate article. If you want to do the pictures maybe you should have a gallery at the commons and then link the main article about that area. with all the stuff that needs to be improved I think this could probably be 2 - 3 tiny paragraphs.I recommend the information be copied to a usser sub-page as a personal experience tab for exemple.--<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 03:49, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> â€“ if this article is kept, it will have to be knocked back to a short stub immediately. So far, I've heard some good arguments on the <i>potential</i> for an encyclopedic article on mountain biking on Mt. Tamalpais, however, I haven't seen anybody make a good case for keeping the most of the existing content. The "travel guide" style content flat out goes against the guidelines of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and belongs in Bicycling Wiki, not Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 07:12, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, the development of Mountain Biking and its association with this area makes it notable for inclusion in Wikipedia. However, much of the existing content needs editing and perhaps some deletion, with proper referencing of sources, including its historical notability. I suggest the article is cut back to a stub. I was contacted to participate in this discussion as a contributor to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cycling_e7bf.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cycling">Wikiproject Cycling</a>. --<a href="../../../t/i/r/User%7ETirin_6dbf.html" title="User:Tirin">Takver</a> 12:53, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with Takver, the are is very important for mountain biking history and I believe is notable enough to be included here. But I also think much of the content must be deleted or transwikied or something. Maybe it can be left as a cycling-stub. --<a href="../../../s/u/l/User%7ESuleyman_Habeeb_491e.html" title="User:Suleyman Habeeb">Suleyman Habeeb</a> 18:10, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> â€“ I've taken the liberty of transwiki-ing this article to Bicycling Wiki. (Most of it, anyway, they don't allow image uploads.)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Thanks for transwiki-ing. I'm checking on the image uploads with the Bicycling Wiki proprietor.

<li><b>Comment</b>: There doesn't seem to be consensus for deleting the article.
