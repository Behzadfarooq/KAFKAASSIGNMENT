<p>Isn't the consensus to be keeping high schools? This entry is actually well-written. Keep, I suppose. <a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhymeless_6a19.html" title="User:Rhymeless">Rhymeless</a> 06:46, 18 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, <b>there is no consensus.</b> Whenever there has been an attempt to establish one, the opinions among those participating has been very close to evenly divided. I don't mind hashing over high schools but I really do object to what occasionally seem to be misrepresentations of policy. Every VfD discussion on a high school starts from ground zero. Those who say "it should be kept because its a high school" or "all high schools are notable by definition" are stating their own opinion, not established policy or consensus. Those who say "Delete, non-notable" are stating their own opinion, not established policy or consensus. In practice the probability of getting listed on VfD and the vote balance is strongly affected by the quality of the article.

<li>Comment: The school doesn't bill itself as a high school, but as a <a href="http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00218021/00218021se27?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=secondary+school&amp;edition=2e&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;hilite=00218021se27" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00218021/00218021se27?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=secondary+school&amp;edition=2e&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;hilite=00218021se27" rel="nofollow">secondary school</a>, accepting students in grades 7-12. That covers the high school years, but would open the door to articles about junior high schools. I'm tempted to vote keep since it covers the high school years, but I don't like the slippery slope possibility, and there is nothing particularly notable about this secondary school. Neutral. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESWAdair_e7db.html" title="User:SWAdair">SWAdair</a> | <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESWAdair_58bb.html" title="User talk:SWAdair">Talk</a> 07:20, 18 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<li>Please be aware of national differences. Though this is in Alaska, it's not at all aware for what you would call a high school to be called a secondary school or secondary college in several other countries. Furthermore, in many other countries, there's <i>not</i> a split between junior and senior high. So if you were to vote to delete on that slippery slope basis, you'd basically be setting a precedent to delete the vast majority of high schools in at least Australia, and probably others as well. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 13:22, 18 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<li>Actually, I was aware of this. That is why I didn't vote on St Francis of Assisi School (VfD listing immediately below this one), since that school is in a nation where "secondary school" has an entirely different meaning. Because this article is about a U.S. school, where there normally is a distinction, I'm not comfortable voting either way. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESWAdair_e7db.html" title="User:SWAdair">SWAdair</a> | <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESWAdair_58bb.html" title="User talk:SWAdair">Talk</a> 00:05, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hmmm, there are redlinks that need to be unwikied, but the coverage is excellent. Additionally, the case for notability is genereally made. I suppose I have to say "keep," since I think our only criterion for schools should be notability. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:05, 18 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep notable HS's delete non-notable HS, just like anything else. This one, however, seems to be a student-run or at least partly student-run public high school, which seems interestingly notable to me. <b>Keep</b>.--<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_J._Howard_705c.html" title="User:Samuel J.

<li>Borderline <b>keep</b>, mostly because the article is more complete and more interesting than most high-school-VfD-candidates The writer respected Wikipedia enough to <b>complete</b> a decent short article before pressing the "save page" button. I believe it was perfectly appropriate to list the article for VfD, and perfectly appropriate to decide, after discussion, to keep it.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not notable. Nothing in the article is notable. Reads like Dennis' description of how his commune is governed in <i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i>. Are these voting rules even worth mentioning? They seem quite normal. The problem with such high school articles is that even when detailed like this, they come out mostly the same: nothing but non-encyclopedic fluff about the school as it exists at the moment. If many graduates begin talking about the wonderful (or hideous) education at Steller Secondary School or this school is being talked about in educational journals or even if it was getting press in the local community for something unusual, it would have some notablity. Otherwise, just a school like any other. Yes, it is an alternative school. But nothing here makes it look like an especially different sort of alternative school. <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJallan_8e41.html" title="User:Jallan">Jallan</a> 17:22, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Please note that Steller's philosophy makes it a very unique school. As soon as I talk to Dorothy (the principal), I should be able to directly implement it rather than just having a link. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStellertony_0b0c.html" title="User:Stellertony">Stellertony</a> 00:00, Sep 20, 2004 (UTC)</li>
