<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - Editor <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a>, with all due respect, is incorrect. The <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hallow.html" title="Hallow">Hallows</a> article, while possibly constituting a stub that is under construction, already constitutes (after only 2 days of existence) far more than a simple "dictionary definition of a word", although it certainly contains definition material (cited to dictionary). The article also links to the existing <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hallow" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hallow" rel="nofollow">Wiktionary entry</a> on the word, for a "more proper" definition and derivation reference. There are well cited definitions and usage examples, regarding <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween.html" title="Halloween">Halloween</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hallowmas.html" title="Hallowmas">Hallowmas</a>, and a well cited reference to Hallows literature (Tolkien's use of Hallows in <i>The Return of the King</i>). The "Immediate Deletion" recommendation appears to be connected to the ongoing debate at the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_7748.html" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a> article on the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Talk%7EHarry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_6608.html" title="Talk:Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Talk Page</a>. Admittedly, the article was also created in response to the same debate. The reason to keep is this: As the seventh <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._K._Rowling_604a.html" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> book comes closer to release, many many young people and adults will be looking for information on what <i>Hallows</i> might refer to, and it is the Wikipedia editors' duty to at the very least provide information on what the Hallows "currently are" (outside of the Potter books). That said, speculation about what Rowling's <i>Deathly Hallows</i> might be, should be at the very least restrained and controlled, if not banned. --<a href="../../../t/-/d/User%7ET-dot_4520.html" title="User:T-dot">T-dot</a> (<a href="../../../t/-/d/User_talk%7ET-dot_eb45.html" title="User talk:T-dot">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_T-dot_d7c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/T-dot">contribs</a>) 12:01, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Virtually all the material in the article was exported from the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_7748.html" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a> article, which is the sole reason for the creation of this article. All the material fits the definition of a dictionary entry as described in the relevant page from what wikipedia is not. The current wiktionary entry is a one line stub. This article as it stands is exactly what ought to be on the wiktionary page. Now, I have no objection to the material being reinserted into the page where it came from, where it served to explain the rather obscure title of the book. But by itself, it is only a definition, because the word has no other real-life usage. This article has become the centre of a debate on the 'Deathly Hallows' page. I would not have taken this to AfD so quickly if it was a simple stub, but the conclusion of the content debate on DH rather depends upon whether this is in itself a legitimate article. I contend that its sole reason for existing is to contain a definition of the word for the benefit of the parent article, and it would much better exist inside that parent. As a separate article it serves to confuse rather than inform readers, who would expect the information to be in 'Deathly Hallows'.

<li><b>Keep and improve</b> Okay, right now the article is only a bit more than a definition, but it has improved, and I suspect it will continue to improve. This articles very existence has been helpful in reducing conflict about HP7 to this page. If the article can keep up a comprehensive list of non-speculation about HP7, but rather what Hallows are as used in various pieces of literature, I think it's worth keeping. <a href="../../../t/u/v/User%7ETuvas_f7a8.html" title="User:Tuvas">Tuvas</a> 16:11, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Quote from <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> referring to what a wikipedia article is.</dd>
<dd><i>Articles are about the people, concepts, places, events, and things that their titles denote. The article octopus is about the animal: its physiology, its use as food, its scientific classification, and so forth.</i></dd>
<dd>Hallow fits this description. It is an article about the concept of "Hallows". It talks about what hallows are considered in many contexts. Compare this to the same line for the wikitionary:</dd>
<dd><i>Articles are about the actual words or idioms in their title. The article octopus is about the word "octopus": its part of speech, its pluralizations, its usage, its etymology, its translations into other languages, and so forth.</i></dd>
<dd>This article does not fit this criteria. It doesn't deal with it's part of speech, puralizations, usage, etc. It only deals with the concept of Hallows, which are mentioned in many works of fiction. Thus I conclude that the article fits far better the entry for wikipedia than wikitionary. <a href="../../../t/u/v/User%7ETuvas_f7a8.html" title="User:Tuvas">Tuvas</a> 17:53, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Super speedy keep</b>, this article is far more than just a definition.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Not sure what it looked like when this AfD appeared, but right now it looks like a well sourced and very informative encyclopedia article about several different historical and mythical items referred to as "Hallows", far more than a dictionary definition. --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 18:02, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b>: I think we all know that Sandpiper has initiated this just to prove a point and to try to push speculations back into the HP article. This reason is already enough to debunk this deletion request. But we can also see that this article is absolutely not a "dictionary" entry since it contains a history of the word in the literary context (moreover, the fact that the Grail is a hallow, increases the value of this article in the perspective of a "arthurian legends" category). You see, hallows are not mere objects, they are a the very center of many, many myths, both christian and celtic, and that's precisely the focus of the article, to replace hallows in their literary context. Thus this article is extremely relevant, and certainly won't be deleted just because of some petty rivalries over speculations about a fantasy novel that has not much to do with the real focus of the article. Sandpiper seems to have forgotten that the word Hallow has existed way before HP, and that such an article is just an essential part of a bigger work here in Wikipedia, on english traditions, and always leading the discussion back to his own petty disputes about an ultra-minor aspect of Hallows, shows Sandpiper's unability to have a general view on things. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolken_de_Fanel_8812.html" title="User:Folken de Fanel">Folken de Fanel</a> 20:13, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
