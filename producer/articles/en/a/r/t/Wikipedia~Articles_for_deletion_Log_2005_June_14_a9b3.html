<li>This individual was a pretty big model in Houston in the 90s. He did work with models like Laura Kapriva and later Alexis Bledel (a famous actress). He was also the international face of XS cologne in the early 90s. True, his work is microcosmic, so if Wikipedia is being maintained only for a macrocosmic angle (rather than covering people of interest), then this should be deleted. I thought I'd put in my two cents. Louis Molnar, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ok, I've reconsidered because the subject matter was only proposed at the time of the original VfD; that it now exists is more than a mere question of notability, and I think this change does make the issue different enough from that which the original voters faced so as to not make that vote binding.

<p>What about it is joking? The whole thing seems very serious to me. Electoral rolls are an Easter tradition in my family, going back hundreds of years; I was thrilled to see this article created, finally explaining my family's long-loved food to the rest of the ignorant world. Don't take it down and keep the cycle of ignorance going! Yeah, I agree. It is a benefit to the whole of Wikipedia.

Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page. The result of the debate was <b>No Consensus</b> default to <b>Keep.</b> I count 33 Keep, 28 Delete, and 3 Merge (counting "rename" as a vote to keep, since we can't delete &amp; rename), which is roughly 44% Delete, 51% Keep, 5% merge; soundly <b>No Consensus.</b> <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 01:18, August 7, 2005 (UTC)

<li>A slight recount, as it appears the number of votes was a bit off: I see 30 Keeps and 30 Deletes. (The nominator's vote, even if the identity is in question, should be counted as a delete). Reviewing the "rename" votes appears that they are likewise split: there are 5 "Keep, but rename" (counted as Keeps), and 3 Rename <b>OR</b> Merge-- which should default to merge, rather than "keep" -- since we can't, as you say, keep &amp; merge. Plus, there are 3 clear "Merge with State Terrorism." (1 vote to delete the "troll nominator" was not counted either way). My feeling is that in this instance, Merge votes should be considered a special form of "delete"-- with a request to removing the separate article, and combine the factual info into another one. Thus, they should not be counted against "Delete" in the final tally. Thus, it's pretty much 50/50. Still a No Consensus, of course-- which is just why VfDs will continue to be problematic. --<a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">LeFlyman</a> 06:14, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This one was a difficult one to close. I considered leaving it alone, but it was the last one in the archive, so I decided to suck it up and close it. I used a pencil &amp; paper to tally votes, but I'm not suprised I missed some; it was just so blasted confusing. Anyhow, no consensus seems to be the right call. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 07:53, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Pardon me for having to edit this already existant VfD page, I do not happen to know how to archive this previous VfD page. I bring this page to a VfD delete for a variety of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I feel it is inherently biased</li>
<li>A page of this manner already exists dealing with Israeli state terrorism and this should be merged there AT THE MOST</li>
<li>This page could easily be renamed Jewish Terrorism as that it what it deals with and such a page is inherently biased as it attacks Jews</li>
<li>This page has been heavily edited by known anti-Semitic and anti-Caucasian racists [personal attack removed] ... and despite popular concensus in the real world that accusations against Israel are laughable, these claims have been allowed to remain on Wikipedia</li>
<li>The last time it was brought to VfD vote, there was not really a true concensus met and there should be a revote. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProudWHITEIsraeli_59d8.html" title="User:ProudWHITEIsraeli">ProudWHITEIsraeli</a> 00:50, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Brother, I assure you my nomination is completely in good faith, I merely seek to rid the world of the sick propaganda that the Socialist Establishment espouses, namely articles such as this one. My comments about "Mustafaa" were not meant as a personal attack and I am sorry if they have been interpreted in such manner, however I do not rescind my statements one bit. I beleive it has been established time and time again on wikipedia that Mustafaa is biased against Whites and Jews and anyone who is proud of their Whiteness and adherance to Judaism. Do I even need to point further than to the Islamic-Arab allusion his username alludes to than to prove that he is a Socialist Racist? But thank you for backing me up, I wish I could state myself so eloquently as you but yes, this article is very POV and has ZERO encyclopedic content. -<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProudWHITEIsraeli_59d8.html" title="User:ProudWHITEIsraeli">ProudWHITEIsraeli</a> 02:53, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Barring the nominator's user name, I think the article should be kept, but a rename sounds good.

The new title, IMHO, should be Violence committed by Israel. Plus, it could be hard to merge this article into State terrorism, since some of the acts committed by Israelis were not under the direction of the Israeli Government or, as pointed out, retaliation against attacks from the groups residing in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gaza.html" title="Gaza">Gaza</a>. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 07:57, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>While I agree with Slim and Jayig; I think its worht noting that perhaps this article is talking about the wrong things. You have to look at the fact that Israel in the not so didtant past sanctioned torture. Beond that, Israeli Tarrorim has a phenomenon is worht mention; that is simply because it exsists in a good portion of people's minds in our world, in needs to be adressed. I think this page addresses it in entirely the worng way. Rahter we should be looking at how and why people came to look at Israeli actions as terrorism in the first place, who those people are and why they came to their conclusions. --<a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELouieS_5c23.html" title="User:LouieS">LouieS</a> 14:07, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Louie, fairies exist in the minds of lots of people in the world, but that doesn't make them real. Our policies say we should cite the views of published majority- and significant-minority opinion (not tiny-minority opinion). When I last looked, not a single source was cited, so the article as it stands violates our content policies, and were it to be cleaned up to be in accordance with them, much of its current content would have to be deleted. The point is that it's unfair to single Israel out when there's no article on British terrorism, French terrorism, Italian terrorism, and so on. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:28, August 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am not a proponent of the singling out either. I think the solution here is to extend the information relating to other examples of state terrorism. Surely, this would help put things into perspective. This can start by extending the country sections of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html" title="State terrorism">State terrorism</a> article -- if a country's section becomes large, a new article should be created. I think the "don't single anyone out" argument should always be dealt with by extending the information that we represent rather than removing information. Should we not have created an article on Windows until we have Linux? The detractors can add balance by adding information rather than removing it.</li>

This account will probably be banned soon too since SlimVirgin said I can't return until I "prove I am not Alberinu". Right. Well that should be easy&#160;:-/. No worries though, I was just on a friends account reading this and decided to answer some questions, Ill probably stop editing after this. First off I am not Alberuni, I dont even know who that is, but if hes anti-Semitic then he deserves to be banned or whatever. For you nosy Commie bastards that want to know more about me, I am in my 20s originally from Tel-Aviv, now living in the United States, HAPPY? I started reading Wiki about 2 months ago and have been especially reading this page until I decided to stand up for Jews everywhere and VfD this POS. I'd just like to say all you a-holes who have accused me of racism while being blind to your own hatred of the White Race, you are truly HYPOCRITES.

<dd>Can it not state that the actions' being "terrorist" is disputed? Are you suggesting that there are no "Zionists" who have ever done anything that has been considered "terrorist"? We all know that "terrorist" is more a label than a description. As many others do, I try to minimise the label's use in WP, given that it's always POV, as you correctly note.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 13:12, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It may be able to state that, but if the "terrorist" nature is disputed, then it really shouldn't be the title, should it? And I am aware that there are Zionists who have done things that have been considered "terrorist", but I'm also perfectly aware that a lot of the actions are being moulded and exaggerated to fit that description, and when compared to acts of terrorism today (by palestinians, amongst others) absolutely pale in comparison when you look at the brutality and the targets. Different motivations also come in to play. Palestinian terrorism is aimed at death and destruction primarily, as is evidenced by increased violence the nearer peace seems to get, because it's ultimate objective is not a palestinian state but an end to Israel. The so called "zionist terrorism" was not about eradication of a state or deliberate killing of people, on any level, nevermind a primary level. Look at the attacks (and I refer mainly to groups, not lone lunatics like Goldstein), they're on HQs etc., calculated to achieve an objective. Palestinians blow up buses and shoot innocent people, things which cannot help their objective at all. Also see my response further down the page.Curiosity 14:20, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>In answer to those who may not understand why this is inherently biased, try this thought experiment: change "Zionist" into "Jewish" -- which is the POV this article is intending to perpetuate. Would "Jewish terrorism" be an appropriate topic here, or one that would be more fitting to an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitic_cf3f.html" title="Anti-Semitic">Anti-Semitic</a> site, such as <a href="http://www.rense.com/general21/pastzionist.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.rense.com/general21/pastzionist.htm" rel="nofollow">this one</a> listing "Past Zionist-Jewish Terrorism?" Or <a href="http://www.palestine-info.co.uk/am/publish/article_54.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.palestine-info.co.uk/am/publish/article_54.shtml" rel="nofollow">the Palestinian Information Center</a> which lists a litany of so-called "(Jewish) Zionist Terrorist" acts and "illustrates the brutal ugliness of the Jewish Zionist mentality" claiming, "the entire Zionist history, at least since the establishment of the malignant Zionist entity called Israel, has been a huge accumulative criminal file."
<p>The <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semantics.html" title="Semantics">Semantics</a> of the article is in large part the problem: using "Zionist" as an adjective to modify terrorism implies that there is a continuing, ongoing effort by Zionists (i.e. Jews) to commit terrorist acts -- tantamount to claiming Zionism a terrorist ideology. A less loaded title would be "Terrorism by Zionists", but that still suffers from the inherent problem of holding up and singling out a particular political group for indictment before all others. For example, while there is an entry for <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Republican_Army_c60e.html" title="Irish Republican Army">Irish Republican Army</a> there is no entry for IRA Terrorism. Likewise where are the Pakistani Terrorism or Kashmiri Terrorism articles? (I will grant that there is a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ETA_attacks_32f0.html" title="List of ETA attacks">List_of_ETA_attacks</a> -- but the ETA is an avowed terrorist entity) In fact, the only place on the Web you find the term "Zionist terrorism" is in anti-Israel or anti-Jewish sources.</p>
<p>And in my view, the only place on Wikipedia that would be appropriate to list so-called "Zionist terrorism" would be in a contextual article such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_terrorist_incidents.html" title="List of terrorist incidents">List_of_terrorist incidents</a> --<a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">LeFlyman</a> 16:57, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The difference between these articles, and those, is that Islamist Terrorism and Palestinian Terrorism are documented facts. The Islamist vandals like BrandonYusufToropov and Zero keep trying to push nonsensical and racist accusations into this article, when the articles on particular non-supported groups which have not existed for decades (such as <a href="../../../i/r/g/Irgun.html" title="Irgun">Irgun</a>) cover all REAL incidents of so-called "zionist terrorism" just fine without the need for this redundant article. The sole purpose of the Keep votes here seems to be as a jumping-off point for racist attacks.

<dd>Well, this is not the place for a lengthy discussion, but since your post relates diretly to to my point, I rebut the "indisputably an act of terrorism". The King David Hotel was not a hotel in the sense that it housed a bunch of tourists and honeymooners. "Ninety-two persons lost their lives in that stealthy attack, 45 were injured, among whom there were many high officials, junior officers and office personnel, both men and women. The King David Hotel was used as an office housing the Secretariat of the Palestine Government and British Army Headquarters." says Wikipedia, quoting the British House of Commons. Blowing up your adversary's HQ and army HQ is not the same as blowing up a hotel. Certainly in aerial warfare, for instance, the effort to drop a bomb on your adversary's HQ is made, despite the loss of life to innocent secretaries, janitors, and the visiting children of employees. If that is not described as terrorism, i.e. attacking civilians as your major target, then blowing up the HQ by planting bombs is not either. Blowing up a Motel Six is terrorism. Blowing up government and military HQ is guerilla warfare, even if the building has Hotel in its name. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 19:54, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, certainly more of an act of war than the WTC, which is an act of terrorism. Why wouldn't it be an act of war to specifically target the adversary's military HQ? Didn't the US attempt to specifically bomb the German military HQ in WWII? Because it was a suicide run? Compare to kamikaze attacks. Because it was without warning and without a declaration of war? Compare to Pearl Harbor. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 20:49, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Im sorry for continuing the discussion here (what's a better page we can talk on?) but I think the King David Bombing crossed the line. While the bombing had a military objective (making it a form guerilla warfare), the disregard for civilian life (a majority of the dead were civilians, including 15 jews) also qualifies this bombing as terrorism. I think it's similar to the bombings of police recruiting facilities currently seen in Iraq. Those also have military objectives, but are widely considered acts of terrorism. --<a href="../../../c/y/p/User%7ECypherx_7316.html" title="User:Cypherx">Cypherx</a> 20:56, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, as I've observed, we bombed the crap out of German government offices in Berlin in WWII and nobody suggested that was terrorism because of the civilian workers killed there. Compare to Dresden, which is much more controversial in terms of civilian losses for no explicit military gain. I didn't make this up; the international Laws of War allow for collateral damage proportional to the desired military objective; i.e. blowing up an enemy shipyard despite the loss of many civilians is permitted, versus blowing up a hospital to nail one annoying sniper on the roof is not. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 20:49, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No-one has mentioned the fact that a specific WARNING was given of the King David Hotel bombing beforehand. Had the warning been followed and the building evacuated, instead of the warning being dismissed, the casualties would have been far lower if any at all. The fact there was a warning, shows there was not an intention to kill people, especially civilians, certainly not as the primary motivation. Terrorist attacks try to kill as many as possible as a way of coercion, they deliberately target civilian populations. This attack was on a military target and efforts were made to keep casualties down. Once again, it's a stretch and definitely POV to call it 'terrorist', especially when compared to say al-qaeda/palestinian terrorism where the main objective is killing as many innocent people as possible. A bus/restaurant/disco is not a military target, so bloeing it up with intent to kill innocents is terrorism. Blowing up a political/military HQ after specifically warning the people you're going to do so and they should evacuate? If that's 'terrorism' then there are obviously drastically different levels of 'terrorism'. Yet another example of the anti-Israelis on here trying desperately to create an equivalency between actions that simply isn't there.Curiosity 11:35, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"No-one has mentioned the fact that a specific WARNING was given of the King David Hotel bombing beforehand." Staff at the King David Hotel are on record as saying that they were recieving daily (sometimes more often) hoax warnings during the period - enough that they effectively had no warning. So yes - technically there was a warning given but... lets not be too keen to run up to that moral highh ground.</dd>

<dd>BBC TV documentary last year where they interviewed all of the survivors they could find. One of the people they interviewed was the woman who took the warning call. She absolutely confirmed that she had recieved one - then explained why it was not acted upon. Alas you can't link to a TV broadcast (and they have no transcript online) so I'll wait till I see a transcript before altering an article in the main encyclopedia. Fascinating show they also interviewed the woman who made the call - who seemed terribly proud, much like the French Resistance Fighters you sometimes see interviewed. In her mind she was clearly a Freedom Fighter not a terrorist.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> this title, and rename the contents, or merge them with another article. The word "terrorism" is not defined, and there's no universally agreed definition, so it's a term that should be avoided, especially in titles; and where it's used in a title, it must be defined at the beginning of the article, using a definition accepted by academics and by the UN (there are several definitions in use by the UN). The article also needs to say what's meant by <i>Zionist</i> terrorism, and to describe whether and why an act of violence (carried out after May 14, 1948) intended to protect the existence of the state of Israel is considered (a) an act of self-defense by Israelis, (b) an act of aggression by Israelis, (c) either of these by <i>Zionists</i>, (d) an act of <i>terrorism</i> by <i>Israelis</i>, or (e) an act of <i>terrorism</i> by <i>Zionists</i>, unless the words Israeli and Zionist are being used synonomously here, in which case that needs to be stated upfront. Acts before May 14, 1948 are more easily described as Zionist violence, but then the article would have to cut off at that point to avoid the muddle, and many editors may feel that's a false cut-off point, as (largely) the same people continued to fight after that date as were fighting before it.

<dd>Sorry for reposting this from <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_terrorism.html" title="Israeli terrorism">Israeli terrorism</a>'s VfD page, but as I said there: "I strongly disagree with this reoccuring suggestion to merge Zionist terrorism and Israeli state terrorism. I think it's a worse violation of NPOV to associate the actions of pre-Israel paramilitary groups with the Israeli government than it is to have an article on Zionist terrorism. Irgun and Lehi were a small minority of Jewish militants in the 1930s and 1940s, and the majority disagreed with and distanced themselves from violence against civilians. You can't equate Irgun or Lehi with Israel. Flip the tables and see if this merge still makes sense. Imagine a Palestinian state is formed and now on wikipedia there exists an article called Palestinian state terrorism, detailing every attack on civilians performed by Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Izzadin al-Qassam, etc. Doesn't seem to make sense."</dd>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>(<b>Weak Keep</b> if we disambiguate the article by making it about pre-1948 terror by Zionist groups like Lehi, Irgun, and Haganah, the reasons, and the responses) - It seems odd to lump the actions of <a href="../../../l/e/h/Lehi.html" title="Lehi">Lehi</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/g/Irgun.html" title="Irgun">Irgun</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/g/Haganah.html" title="Haganah">Haganah</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/c/Kach_and_Kahane_Chai_c19d.html" title="Kach and Kahane Chai">Kach and Kahane Chai</a>, and the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Defense_League_6e46.html" title="Jewish Defense League">Jewish Defense League</a> together. These groups have nothing to do with each other except that they are Jewish groups - they would probably have radically different views of whether they or the others were Zionists, and had very different motivations for action, rather than a single philosophy. These incidents are covered in many places, and this article leaves open the question about whether any "terrorism" committed by Jews would not be considered "Zionist terrorism" -- would everything fit in this catagory? I think this is a case of the use of the word "Zionist" to mean "Jew", unless someone can convince me that this article could in some way be made meaningful. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 02:25, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Lehi, Irgun, Haganah, Kach, and the JDL have all committed violence against those they viewed as enemies of the state of Israel. (the interpretation of this violence as terrorism can sometimes get very subjective). If some religious group such as Satmars or Neturei Karta, or perhaps some group of ultra-leftwing socialist Jews were committing violent acts, they could not be considered zionist terrorists. So no, I don't think the article is assuming that Zionist = Jew.</dd>

<dd>I dunno, Cypherx, that seems tenuous, we are basically saying that unless one of the two or three explicitly anti-Zionist Jewish groups commits acts of terrorism it will be Zionist terrorism? Lehi and Irgun did not necessarily engage in terrorist actions against "enemies of Israel" (leaving aside they were pre-State), they engaged in often brutal terrorism with the purpose of achieving certain political goals that were not always directly related to establishing a state, while Hagannah's "Hunting Season" (listed in the article) actually involved cooperation with the British against Irgun and Lehi. Meanwhile, Kach is probably best described as a Jewish extremist group, (or even a supremicist group) its ideology is not a Zionist one. The point is that I am not sure why these groups should be lumped together. I agree that the actions of groups like JDL, Lehi, and the Irgun were often terrorist acts, but it seems to me this grouping of all of them under "Zionist" doesn't make any logical sense, and that only Neturei Karta violence would be excluded among all Jewish violence. The article lumps together a wide range of motives and beliefs under the epithet "Zionist" implying that Baruch Goldstein is equivalent to the Haganah is equivalent to the Stern Gang in goals and methods, which is inaccurate. I can't see how it will be cleaned-up.--<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 12:41, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think there's a fuzzy definition at work here. Is Zionism equivalent to Jewish nationalism? If yes, then the JDL (which concerns itself with Jews everywhere) can be grouped with Irgun, Lehi and Kach. Kach, unlike the JDL, is definitely a zionist group (by any definition of zionism). Their primary purpose is to expel arabs from Israel and establish a religious government there. Whether they're terrorists...I'm not sure, I've never seen anything except their support of Baruch Goldstein as evidence. --<a href="../../../c/y/p/User%7ECypherx_7316.html" title="User:Cypherx">Cypherx</a> 19:16, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The fuzzy definition is the problem. The meaning of the word "Zionist" in the context of terrorism is entirely unclear, and comes close to use as a epithet or propaganda, as can be seen in any Google search of Zionist + Terrorism. Again, this does not mean that terrorism was not used as a tactic by some Zionist organizations, but it implies (as Humus sapiens notes below) that terrorism was/is a primary tactic of Zionism and/or Jews. This article seems to include three unrelated topics: (1) the historical use of terrorism by Jewish groups in the Mandate against British and Arab targets (2) current groups that endorse terrorism as a tactic (JDL) and (3) controversal statements about Israeli state-sponsored terrorism. The first is historical (and covered in <a href="../../../l/e/h/Lehi.html" title="Lehi">Lehi</a>, etc), the second is about fringe criminals (and covered in JDL and other articles) and the third is controversal and politically charged (and the subject of many articles and fights in wikipedia) -- please explain why they should be in one article. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 19:35, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p><b><u><i>Britain: Inteligence elements warned of Zionist terrorism</i></u></b></p>
<p><code>Following the attack on the King David Hotel, the British were afraid of a wave of terror to be operated by Jews in London: a recently exposed document now reveals that the police was issued an order to follow every Jew arriving from the Middle East.</code></p>
<p><code>British inteligence services followed in the 40s after all Jews arriving from Israel due to their fear of "international Zionist terrorism." From documents exposed from the MI5 Royal Inteligence Archive, it was discovered that this concern increased following following the famous terrorist attack that Etzel members committed in 1946 against British officers in the King David hotel in Jerusalem.</code> (<a href="http://news.walla.co.il/?w=//390398" class="external text" title="http://news.walla.co.il/?w=//390398" rel="nofollow">Walla/Ruetres</a>) <font size="+2">***</font> <i><u>The Encyclopedia of Jewish History: Events and Eras of the Jewish People</u></i> mentions that the Etzel's <code>"terror versus terror"</code> policy, <code>"enabled extremist groups in the organization to commit terrorist acts and robberies on their own accord"</code> (p. 158). It also states that the Lehi <code>"committed many terrorist acts, directed towards the British"</code> (p. 159) <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 00:03, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not sure exactly what point is bring made, or what point should be made on this page. If the issue is whether Zionist groups did things that reasonable people would class as terrorism, then of course they did. What about the Irgun campaign in the late 1930s when several hundred Arab civilians were indiscrimately killed by bombs set off in public places like train stations and markets? Was that not terrorism? Similar things were done in the late 1940s. Morever, even the mainstream Jewish groups called it terrorism. The following is a typical public statement, from the Palestine Post of Dec 19, 1947. The <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine_Post_31d8.html" title="Palestine Post">Palestine Post</a> was a major Jewish newspaper (later renamed to the <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem_Post_ac05.html" title="Jerusalem Post">Jerusalem Post</a>) and the <a href="../../../v/a/a/Vaad_Leumi_2007.html" title="Vaad Leumi">Vaad Leumi</a> was a sort of governing body for Jewish affairs in Palestine. The "Yishuv" was the Jewish community in Palestine.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>WARNING TO TERRORISTS</i><br />
<i>At an urgent meeting in Jerusalem yesterday, the Vaad Leumi Executive issued a strongly-worded warning to the terrorists that "the Yishuv will not permit them to destroy the new world we are about to build." The Executive stressed that, against its will, the Yishuv had been plunged by the terrorists into a whirlpool of blood which threatened political suicide at a time when the community was deeply concerned with its safety and security and the transition to independence. The statement continued: "In the face of abominable spilling of innocent blood in our streets, which cannot be condoned because of the repressions of an outgoing Government, the Yishuv will rouse itself to a renewed and intensified struggle against its destroyers, to save its honour, existence and future."</i> --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 00:41, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I was saying that, while acts of violence/terrorism before May 14, 1948 can be described as Zionist, once the state of Israel is established, it becomes harder, especially as time goes on, to say which acts are Zionist, and which Israeli i.e. the actions of a group of people trying to defend themselves, where it would seem odd to call the response Zionist. This matters because of the cut-off point of the article. May 14, 1948 is the only obvious one, but I can understand why others would see that as arbitrary. It's a tricky issue. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 08:44, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the term "Zionist terrorism" is more loaded than I originally suspected. Try doing a google search for "zionist terrorism", the results are of a uniform anti-Israel political bias and use the term in reference to actions of the current state of Israel, rather than its para-military predecessors. So perhaps this isn't a good name for an article after all. There definitely should be an article documenting the terrorist activities of Irgun and Lehi, but what's a less loaded name we could use? --<a href="../../../c/y/p/User%7ECypherx_7316.html" title="User:Cypherx">Cypherx</a> 16:18, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>There already are articles documenting the activities of <a href="../../../i/r/g/Irgun.html" title="Irgun">Irgun</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/h/Lehi_%28group%29.html" title="Lehi (group)">Lehi (group)</a> -- as neither group exists today, the list of "terrorist activities" can be included in their own source articles, rather than breaking them out pointlessly. The problem lies in the contention of the political movement of Zionism itself being categorized as terrorist, whereas it was only in the extremist quarters (and early history) of the founding of Israel that this was the case. By those standards, the American Revolution's <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minutemen_%28militia%29.html" title="Minutemen (militia)">Minutemen</a> might be considered terrorists. --<a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">LeFlyman</a> 17:26, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree to a certain extent, judging by the google results it seems clear that the common usage of "zionist terrorism" implies that zionst <b>is</b> terrorism and that all Israelis (and most Jews) are Zionist terrorists. This is definitely not the article we want to have. Still, I think Islamic terrorism is a valid term, even though it only a small minority of Muslims are terrorists. Similarly we need to think of a term for terrorism motivated by Zionist ideology, (carried out by Zionist groups) which does not associate all Zionists with terrorism. --<a href="../../../c/y/p/User%7ECypherx_7316.html" title="User:Cypherx">Cypherx</a> 18:05, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I guess we could use the same approach that people use to disasociate Palestiaian Terrorism with all Palestians - oh gosh - they dont! Perhaps we could try to not have a double standard for a while? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 62.253.64.15 (<a href="../../../6/2/2E/User_talk%7E62.253.64.15.html" title="User talk:62.253.64.15">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.253.64.15_9c9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.253.64.15">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>I wonder about the absolute equivalency people try to cast between the two groups. Terrorist organizations are powerful political forces in Palestinian society and repeated polls have shown a majority of Palestinians support violence against Israeli civilians. As you will notice <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_terrrorism.html" title="Palestinian terrrorism">Palestinian terrrorism</a> currently has an NPOV notice because it's very hard to nail down what terrorism is and when it can be attributed to a group. So this isn't clear cut, but it's obvious to most people that violence commonly interpretted as terrorism has become a major part of Palestinian society, thus Palestinian terrorism is a valid term...though it must be applied carefully to not paint all Palestinians as terrorists or supporters of terrorists. In contrast terrorism plays a minor and mostly historical role in Zionism. Terrorist tactics were rejected by the mainstream Haganah and the groups that did employ terrorism (Lehi and Etzel) were much smaller and considered fringe. The post-Israel incidents of "Zionist terrorism" are very limited and in my opinion limited to actions of Kach and people associated with Kahane. --<a href="../../../c/y/p/User%7ECypherx_7316.html" title="User:Cypherx">Cypherx</a> 19:39, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not trying to draw absolute equivalency. Clearly, terrorist acts by Zionists have been few and far between compared to modern <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_terrorism.html" title="Islamic terrorism">Islamic terrorism</a>. But just as clearly, terrorism has been a force in the history of Zionism, and arguably played a major role in forcing the British to re-evaluate their occupation of Palestine, much as the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marine_Barracks_Bombing_d72a.html" title="Marine Barracks Bombing">Marine Barracks Bombing</a> arguably prompted the withdrawal of Marines from Lebanon. This deserves historical discussion. The fact that there was less of one than the other is irrelevant - the fact is, there is Islamic terrorism and there is Zionist terrorism. To delete or rename the article is tantamount to denying that <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionist_terrorism.html" title="Zionist terrorism">Zionist terrorism</a> ever existed. --<a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 19:49, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I was initially in favor of keeping the article but then discovered the term "zionist terrorism" has been co-opted. It does not mean terrorism committed by zionists such as Irgun or Lehi, but refers to actions of the current state of Israel that most people do not consider terrorism. For example, I think <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compassionate_Conservatism_6f9f.html" title="Compassionate Conservatism">Compassionate Conservative</a> describes a quaker...but tough luck, the term has been taken and its meaning can no longer be redeemed. Something similar has happened to zionist terrorism and we need to find a new term to describe it. --<a href="../../../c/y/p/User%7ECypherx_7316.html" title="User:Cypherx">Cypherx</a></dd>

<p>There is no such "separate" term-- it's 'just' terrorism. Creating a separate category of terrorism for militant Zionists is tantamount to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_anti-Semitism_dc04.html" title="New anti-Semitism">new anti-Semitism</a>: "Misrepresenting Zionism or singling it out for obloquy." There is nothing in Zionism, as a movement, which promotes terrorist acts, while it may be argued that the contrary is true (to an extent) with a number of Islamic groups-- particularly of the fundamentalist perspective. However, I would urge caution when using a term like "Palestinian terrorism" as opposed to specifying the actual organization responsible-- such as <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamas.html" title="Hamas">Hamas</a> or the <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Aqsa_Martyrs_Brigade_b062.html" title="Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade">Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade</a>.

<dd>Is creating a separate category of terrorism for militant Islamists then tantamount to anti-Islamic hatred? --<a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 19:49, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The argument could be made that certain aspects of modern Islam support and promote terrorism as a means to an end. See, for example, "The Religious Sources of Islamic Terrorism" (<a href="http://www.policyreview.org/jun04/bar.html" class="external text" title="http://www.policyreview.org/jun04/bar.html" rel="nofollow">Policy Review</a>, June 2004) and the <a href="http://www.policyreview.org/jun04/mazarr.html" class="external text" title="http://www.policyreview.org/jun04/mazarr.html" rel="nofollow">contrasting article</a> from the same issue, "The Psychological Sources of Islamic Terrorism" (by Michael J. Mazarr, professor of national security strategy at the U.S. National War College). Likewise, PBS's Frontline looked at <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/target/etc/modern.html" class="external text" title="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/target/etc/modern.html" rel="nofollow">"The Evolution of Islamic Terrorism"</a> and noted that, "[I]n 1995 almost half of the identified [terrorist] groups, 26 out of 56, were classified as religiously motivated; the majority of these espoused Islam as their guiding force."
<p>Now please find something in the mainstream that discusses so-called "Zionist terrorism" -- apart from anti-Semitic, conspiratorial or Islamic anti-Israel sites such as <a href="http://www.radioislam.org/historia/zionism/" class="external text" title="http://www.radioislam.org/historia/zionism/" rel="nofollow">Radio Islam</a> --<a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">LeFlyman</a> 20:30, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, there certainly can be zionist terrorists, and if the term "Zionist terrorism" were free of political connotations that's what we could call the collective phenomenon. Unfortunately the phrase already has politically charged meaning. In the links you provided "Zionist terrorism" is used by (1) Dr. Ian Steer, a nobody from Oxford writing a letter to the editor (2) Abdel Aziz Rantisi, Hamas spokesman (3) Al-Thawra, a Ba'ath party newspaper in Saddam Hussein's Iraq. It's simply not a neutral term! If any mainstream, unbiased sources used "zionist terrorism" then it would be fine as the name of a wikipedia article. But that's simply not the case. Anyone describing "zionist terrorism" is clearly speaking about current Israeli actions and has a serious political agenda. Seriously, look through the google results: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=zionist+terrorism" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=zionist+terrorism" rel="nofollow">Google</a> and try to find a disinterested party using the term "zionist terrorism". --<a href="../../../c/y/p/User%7ECypherx_7316.html" title="User:Cypherx">Cypherx</a> 22:20, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for making my point for me. Here are the 3 (!) BBC references noted, in context:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><i>It quotes Hamas spokesman Abdel Aziz Rantisi as vowing to retaliate for the attack. "Hamas will escalate martyrdom operations inside Tel Aviv and Jaffa and Haifa and everywhere. We are determined to wipe out <b>Zionist terrorism</b>," Mr Rantisi is quoted as saying.</i> (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/not_in_website/syndication/monitoring/media_reports/2286382.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/not_in_website/syndication/monitoring/media_reports/2286382.stm" rel="nofollow">"MidEast press pessimism over intifada"</a> 28 September, 2002)</li>
<li><i>"It takes the utmost in courage and integrity for a Jew to criticise Israeli behaviour and acknowledge <b>Zionist terrorism</b> past and present as one of the root causes of this conflict, together with Palestinian terrorism."

<li><i>"We expect nothing but failure, despite the promises he might receive during his tour," Al-Thawra, the mouthpiece of the ruling Ba'ath Party, says in a front-page editorial...Blair's trip aims at "containing the Arab public's anger at <b>Zionist terrorism</b> in Palestine and the crusade being waged against Afghanistan," the paper says.</i> (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1632943.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1632943.stm" rel="nofollow">Mid-East papers sceptical over Blair tour</a>, 1 November, 2001)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>And the page from JewishVirtualLibrary quotes from an anti-Semitic article:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><i>The editor of the Syrian Regime's daily, Tishrin, Muhammad Kheir Al_Wadi, wrote an article (January 31, 2000) in which he denies the Holocaust and accuses Zionism of being worse than Nazism... "While history turned the page on the Nazi acts, the <b>Zionist terrorist</b> acts reached their peak. They committed massacres against innocent people and led a policy of aggression and expansion.

<dd>Like I said above, "zionist terrorist" (the term used in both your links) still means what it appears to mean...that is a terrorist who is zionist. "zionist terrorism" has become a politically charged codeword for military actions of the modern state of Israel. "Zionist terrorism" is what we're debating on this site, and unfortunately its only usage is found among people with a strong anti-Israel agenda. It's too biased to be the title of an encyclopedia article. --<a href="../../../c/y/p/User%7ECypherx_7316.html" title="User:Cypherx">Cypherx</a> 19:33, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So you're saying that there are terrorists but no terrorism? An interesting point of view. I'm sorry it's starting to look like we're jumping thropugh hoops in order to make a point here. 62.253.64.14 19:38, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm saying there were terrorists, there was terrorism, but when you put the words together to form "zionist terrorism" you've made a statement of political belief. I don't like it, I wish we could use the term because it would make our lives easier, but seriously, I ask again: try to find a single disinterested party in the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=zionist+terrorism" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=zionist+terrorism" rel="nofollow">Google</a> search for "zionist terrorism". There are none.

<p>I also don't dispute that actions of the Irgun and Lehi groups were akin to terrorist activities in the years prior to Israeli statehood. These groups, which were rightly termed "Zionist" no longer exist. The JDL, which is not a "Zionist" organization, hasn't done anything of note in the last 20 years, unless you count attacking each other. Even the Anti-Defamation League has a page detailing the <a href="http://www.adl.org/extremism/jdl_chron.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.adl.org/extremism/jdl_chron.asp" rel="nofollow">JDL's sordid antics</a>. The problem, as noted by Cypherx, is that the title imputes an ongoing form of terrorism that is Zionist in nature-- which is a political epithet. Thus, I have a suggestion for a more neutral title: "Militant Zionism" -- which semantically makes more sense, modifying the form of Zionism, rather than creating a Zionist category of "terrorism" --<a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">LeFlyman</a> 20:02, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would support that in principle, as its a lot more descriptive, although a lot of the debate here seems to be about sematic equivalency. For example, is it fair to have a page that is headed 'Militant Zionism' describing Irgun etc. and not change the equivalent pages on other groups? I would personally favour changing 'terrorism' to 'militancy' in every instance, but I'd like to see somebody try it without a lot of time on their hands. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Lakeman_fa5a.html" title="User:Will Lakeman">illWill</a> 20:08, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm also starting to feel that the word "terrorism" itself is perhaps too loaded to be useful for wikipedia. We should delete the "______ terrorism" articles. Even when I consider a group like Islamic Jihad (who to me are clearly terrorist) I have to acknowledge that some of their actions can be classed as non-terrorist militancy (attacks on checkpoints). Now the way I divide terrorist and non-terrorist actions depends heavily on my POV. I don't think we can ever manage a satisfactory NPOV definition of terrorism. So why not drop the judgement of the action let the readers judge for themselves? --<a href="../../../c/y/p/User%7ECypherx_7316.html" title="User:Cypherx">Cypherx</a> 20:15, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Definitely, I think the any discussion of this topic will always stumble because the term 'terrorism' is inherently POV - I can't think of any type of military action that doesn't produce 'terror'. Also, I could think of numerous armies, groups and factions whose broad aims I support (including the allies in WW2) who have committed actions that I would describe as 'terrorist'.<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Lakeman_fa5a.html" title="User:Will Lakeman">illWill</a> 00:18, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I was thinking about this at work today. I agree that the vast majority of the use of the term "Zionist Terrorist" is by people who condemn their actions - these tend to be on the "sympathetic to -&gt; rabid support of" the Palestinian cause. But then I got to thinking - how many articels have I ever seen that use the phrase "palestinian terrorist", or "IRA terrorist" that are not written by people who oppose their actions and usually the cause they stand for. You just dont write "our brave terrorists went out and killed a bunch of people today - hurrah!" do you? As such if one is going to condone the use of the word in one context (palestinian, IRA, shining path etc) then it's more than a little out of balance to refuse to use it just because in your moral viewpoint they are doing something wrong. 62.253.64.15 19:45, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rather whimsical article about a de facto fanclub for <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Sea_Power_37fe.html" title="British Sea Power">British Sea Power</a> (a pop group). What do they do? They wear uniforms and go to a nearby pub. All jolly good sixth-form fun, I'm sure, but of such stunning importance that <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22third+battalion%22+%22british+sea+power%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22third+battalion%22+%22british+sea+power%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">Google has only 43 hits for <b>"third battalion" and "british sea power"</b></a>. This really is feeble by the standards of British Sea Power fandom, considering that <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=guitar+%22british+sea+power%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=guitar+%22british+sea+power%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google has about 101,000 for <b>guitar and "british sea power"</b></a>. If this article were named, say, "Third Battalion of British Sea Power", I'd suggest merging with <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Sea_Power_37fe.html" title="British Sea Power">British Sea Power</a>, but I can easily imagine that there is, or could later be, a BSP-unrelated, encyclopedic "third battalion", and creation of an article on that would then require disambiguation, etc. So I'll say that although the existence of the BSP "third battalion" is verifiable, it's significance is peculiarly low, akin to that of the many gaming forums and the like about which articles are routinely created but promptly VfDd and deleted. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 02:41, 2005 Jun 14 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I really dont think he is that important a person who needs a mention on wikipedia.As has been already said there are lots of VPs and good number of them have done wonders, livejournal having a more users that citizens in some countries isn't really a good reason to add livejournal's vp to wikipedia.Also a good deal of whatever he writes isn't useful to common public anyway. by Badrinath.V.S</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Anil was one of the early webloggers and that he continues to this day is amazing, and he's still one of the most high-profile ones. This, more than his position within a company, should certainly net him a place on Wikipedia if it's true that 270 other webloggers are listed. (On a side note, this concept of condemning anything containing the four letters "blog" in combination is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. What if someone registered "Gamehate" and went on to kill all pages with one-off Mario RPG characters?) Wootest 08:42, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> No one accomplishment may warrant his inclusion but the sum of them make him a noteworthy and recognizable figure on the Internet landscape. The page is NPOV and I doubt it is an attempt to push publicity like an artist or somesuch. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelfavia_326a.html" title="User:Michaelfavia">michaelfavia</a> 16:13, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'm disturbed by [User:Bloghate]'s attempt to delete pages of well-known and influential people in the context of an important emerging technology. Should we delete Jimbo Wales' page because he's "only" the creator of wikipedia? SixApart is a significant company in the context of computing today, and Anil has been an influential voice in the development of weblogs. Mamamusings 19:08, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Just because there are "lots of VPs" doesn't mean that Anil's work isn't worthy. If the only reason he was listed was because "he's a VP", then there's scant _information_ that adds to the body of knowledge of the Wikipedia. He's listed because he's "done something" and has been part of the formation of a new body of work, a new mechanism for communication and a new style for communication; and that would seem to be sufficient. On a side note, look at how many people have opinions on him. This doesn't suggest to me that he's a non-entity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> (minor) if "Dash is known for his love of all things Prince, and his encyclopedic knowledge of music breaks" is what passes for wikiworthiness these days, then fine, keep it. Or mebbe he needs to come in here and blow loud and hard his own horn. He's a likeable, intelligent person but *on his own* hasn't really "done anything" noteworthy that future generations really oughta know about. I mean, there's still Google (and his own blog). You can still find him if you want to.
<ul>
<li>The rest of this article is fine with me, and I do agree that that one sentence does not make him "wikiworthy". But one bad sentence is a reason to re-edit the article, not delete it entirely! Wootest 10:36, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> To my view part of the purpose and value of wikipedia above and beyond traditional encyclopedias is that it documents and explains emerging and obscure trends in culture and media, and provides a fairly authoritative source to point people to where there often isn't otherwise one. Blogging fits that bill, and Anil is certainly a prominent enough blogger to make the cut.jddunn</li>

<p><b>Comment:</b> Given that it looks like this article is going to be kept, I've just undertaken an almost complete rewrite of the article to remove unfactual information and to explain the example better. I also added a "Criticism" section in an attempt to balance things out. I've tried to keep things factual and balanced, but given that I have a strong opinion on this matter as a computer security professional, someone else should probably take a look at it to make sure it meets NPOV guidelines. --<a href="../../../x/c/a/User%7EXcali_e28f.html" title="User:Xcali">Xcali</a> 06:37, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep but verify</b> I usually disagree with everything he and (especially) his commentors say, but I suggest keeping. However, I also suggest making sure that the article reflects his POV.

While he does throw out red meat occasionally, at least he's not quite as bad as Atrios. LonewackoDotCom 20:45, Jun 15, 2005 (PST)</li>

<p>This one probably goes without saying. Not specific enough to be relevant to a wider article on the school, area, or city. No significant history to separate it from millions of other unimportant footbridges. Might be worth keeping if there's somewhere to showcase examples of articles people shouldn't write. Otherwise, bin it.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a civic structure that has an appropriately sized article written about it. I'd like to see an external reference or two, but other than that, this article appears to be pretty well complete and proper. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused">focused</a> 15:36, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, it's not a "civic structure that has an appropriately sized article", it's an ordinary footbridge. You won't find an external reference, because it's an ordinary footbridge which is in no way, locally, historically, politically or architecturally important. It's just one of millions of footbridges over millions of busy roads all over the world. This bridge is less qualified than your average Wikipedia user to have an article. This is "dangerous precedent" territory. <a href="../../../6/2/2E/User%7E62.252.32.13.html" title="User:62.252.32.13">62.252.32.13</a> 16:29, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I saw reference to "a number of accidents" prior to its installation. It's local importance is obvious for public safety. There is no "dangerous precedent" unless you think we're running out of paper, which we're obviously not. Average wikipedians are not civic structures; are not public works projects. "Ordinary" is not equal to "worthless". (Millions? Really? Where do you get that number?) I could even see where a little more expansion would be welcome. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused">focused</a> 17:52, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I say millions, based on the fact that UK railway network alone has some 10,000 footbridges across its length (around 2000 at stations), and that along 10 miles of major roads in this city, there are some 50 footbridges. I think millions around the world is a safe assumption.</dd>

<li>This doesn't in any way suggest anything remotely related to articles on trivial subjects. It deals with "X is a Y in Z", i.e. content-trivial, articles. <a href="../../../6/2/2E/User%7E62.252.32.12.html" title="User:62.252.32.12">62.252.32.12</a> 14:29, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, you didn't read the link I posted carefully enough. Jimbo Wales very specifically says "trivial articles". He very specifically says to cut good contributors some slack on their addition of trivial articles, even if we wouldn't want thousands of such articles in the encyclopedia. He's very clear about giving good contributors some room to do what interests them and that doing so is completely harmless and should be accomodated. Nuking a good contributor's well written article while they're on vacation (that they even posted notice of on their user page) is a very unfriendly, anti-community thing to do.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm absolutely stunned to find this on vfd, a day after I created it. 3,600+ Google hits shows that this is hardly a neologism, or original research (I've cited at least a half-dozen sources, including references to scientific studies using the term). This topic was not thoroughly covered anywhere else in Wikipedia, so far as I could find, and the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a> article is certainly long enough to justify a separate article on this related but distinct topic. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 14:45, 2005 Jun 14 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I obviously havn't gone through all 3000+ hits, but the majority that I saw had the world "self" tacked on as alliteration, not as a seperate term. compare to say, "assisted suicide" (684k hits) vs suicide. The two are sigificnatly diffrent enough because of the host of moral and legal complications, while I don't think self induced versus induced abortion is (yet). My point is that "self-induced suicide" is not a term used on its own, just the world self tacked on as an adjective.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 15:09, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It is hardly an alliteration if it describes a circumstance that is distinct from an "induced abortion". An induced abortion is <i>any</i> abortion intentionally induced by <i>anyone</i>. A <i>self-induced</i> abortion is not merely a medical term, but a sociological concept, motivated (as the literature shows) by factors distinct from those responsible for people seekign abortions from doctors. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 15:13, 2005 Jun 14 (UTC)

<dd>Let me try another analogy to get my point across. If you get it, but disagree, thats fine. There are cars. There are also sports cars. There are also red sports cars. Red sports cars are distinct both from cars and sports cars, but not enough to be its own term. Also, I've never heard the term used in medicine before, and couldn't find anything to lead me to believe otherwise. If it is a sociological concept and you can show me some textbooks, I'll drop my contention for VfD however.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 16:39, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, look at <a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2709601.html" class="external text" title="http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2709601.html" rel="nofollow">the Ghana study</a> cited within: "To obtain information on induced abortion, for example, interviewers asked women whether they had ever terminated an unwanted pregnancy, and if so, whether they had had a self-induced abortion <i>or</i> what type of facility they had visited to obtain an abortion." Clearly this is a distinct use. Per you analogy argument, a better analogy would be between race-cars and home-made race cars (a sub-category which I think would merit an article). --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 17:02, 2005 Jun 14 (UTC)

<dd>Unfortunately I'm not in a position to go looking up textbooks, so we'll just have to leave it at the sources available on the internet for now. I suppose you can go tell Gabriela Flores that the activity for which she's being prosecuted and may go to jail is not a real concept, so she's free to go. Or tell that to the Mississippi legislature, which passed a law that classifies self-induced abortions as deaths which affect the public interest, and requires physicians to report them to the local medical examiner. The statute describes "death caused by criminal abortion, <i>including self-induced abortion</i>, or abortion related to or by sexual abuse." <a href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/documents/2002/html/HB/0900-0999/HB0962IN.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/documents/2002/html/HB/0900-0999/HB0962IN.htm" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 18:57, 2005 Jun 14 (UTC)

<dd>True, you have been civil and presented a logical case. I apologize for the snippiness. However, I rest on my contention that the sources cited in the article (and many additional similar references that can be found on Google) provide more than enough proof of the notability and pedigree of the topic to justify an article without using textbooks for support. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 20:23, 2005 Jun 14 (UTC)

<dd>As a point of intrest, that bill died in commitee. My major problem here is I want to be convinced that the term we're using is right. in the <a href="../../../a/d/h/Adhd.html" title="Adhd">adhd</a> article, we've been having problems with <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_imbalance_theory.html" title="Chemical imbalance theory">chemical imbalance theory</a> which had a similar number of hits. Unlike in that case however, sorting out the bias of sites is very difficult, so I went with a gut feeling and put it on VfD. I still have reservations, but I can see I am going against consensus here. I'm going to wait a day for addtional comment, then I will remove the VfD.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 20:56, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Not to be nitpicky, but it was a proposed <i>amendment</i> to an existing statute that died in committee.

I see you used pictures from the show Elyse was on at the America's Next Top Model page. If there are no problems with those, there should be no problems with these. Also, Elyse Sewell's name has been listed on America's Next Top Model page as a contestant because writers of that page, not me, felt the listed contestants are what the show is focusing on each week for more than a couple of months.

<li><b>Keep</b> The entry on Elyse should be kept, because she is the only contestant on any season of Top Model to amount to anything in the modeling world that wasn't simply given to her by Top Model's producers. Elyse has appeared on the cover of an Asian edition of Harper's Bazaar in addition to working steadily in Hong Kong and other locations around the world. Keeping her entry provides a useful contrast to the sadly lacking modeling careers of the so-called "winners" of this increasingly laughable reality TV show and highlights its haphazard judging.--Schreck37 21:57, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Whether she's making a big name as a model is irrelevant; the point is that she has a good sized fan base and is going to be of ongoing interest to them, and to those who hear them mentioning her. She may not have won the TV contest, but she was by most reports the main reason the show was a hit -- such a significant hit that the UPN network remade their entire schedule to try to appeal to young female viewers, discarding boy shows like Star Trek: Enterprise. Since she has been published more than once as a humor writer (which ought to be mentioned in the entry), and her blog audience is growing exponentially due to her wit as a raconteur, this is not someone who is going to drop out of the public eye just because of not being a superstar in modeling. --Paul Kienitz 00:27, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Deanna (Revolution Radio)</b> - I enjoy playing Genetic Wuz. They have a unique sound which portrays the younger musicians in Europe who are having a go. I'm sick of commercial music. Its rubbish! Genetic Wuz is fresh and creative, which in my opinion shows up a lot of the commercial music we play it along side. I think this album is taking the next generation of musicians in another direction - young people are wanting to be different, to stand out, more than other generations have in the past. Of this, I'm a massive supporter. <small><i>Unsigned edit by 84.92.81.108 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.92.81.108_8dbd.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.92.81.108">contribs</a>)</i></small>

<dd>The sockpuppet remarks are directed at the jillions of unsigned new users voting here with no other contributions. Those are considered sockpuppets.

<li><b>Trying to figure this lark out.</b> vanity maybe but that is because I know more than anyone on the subject (though half of this article has now been deleted anyway). There are other people other than me who have looked at this site aswell. Plus I knew many people who wanted to hear a non-bias opoion about this band and how can they get it of of there official website. So if <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is not a set of rules then we have nothing to go by. except it does state that wiki editors like to use it as guidelines when deciding what to delete meaning this article would be fine. Criteria was radio and magazine coverage aka major media. Plus I remember someone saying crossrythms is a minor magazine? well sorry America but over here in Europe we might just have some different magazines than you do over there. Plus GW has been played on more radio stations than one (mostly in the UK though, sorry USA you miss out). --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant_Fletcher_ac8b.html" title="User:Grant Fletcher">Granted</a> 21:17, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)

<li>The problem is that we don't have evidence of the notability of this group. They may be played on radio stations, but we've got no way of knowing it. Just getting on a few radio stations may not be enough. Had you read my comment, I said that I was familiar with Crossrhytms. I event went so far as to try find its circulation numbers, but I failed in that attempt. I stick by my original statement--it's a niche magazine for those heavily into <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contemporary_Christian_Music_8d53.html" title="Contemporary Christian Music">Contemporary Christian Music</a>. Finally, an English wikipedia will tend to be somewhat US-centric due to the number of English speaking internet users in the US versus the number of English speaking internet users outside the US. It's a systemic bias that we constantly have to deal with here. --<a href="../../../x/c/a/User%7EXcali_e28f.html" title="User:Xcali">Xcali</a> 21:46, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

Maybe you guys don't think that is enough. It is obviously one music geek Vs. quite a few SW and comic book geeks (not trying to be offencive by the way, Kross admits it).

<li>Actually, you don't need one. Yoda English simply mimics German sentences structure, with predicate at the end of the sentence. It is a known source of jokes among syncronous translators: a German sentence may end with "nicht" ("not"), thus inverting the whole sense, to at unpleasant surprise of a parallel interpreter, especially when the sentence was long and translated piecewise: <i>"We agree with all your conditions, stated henceforth and herewidth, blablabla,... not!" <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 00:08, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</i></li>

<li>I would usually agree - the base policy being not to jump on new users - but looking at the comments left by "F White Dawg" and "TRU THUG" makes me fairly certain that their only purpose on wikipedia is negativity aimed at one particular user - BrowardBulldog. For a nice sample of <i>his</i> activities on Wikipedia, just look at the VfD entry for Wiked Wood. He has also been known to vandalise entries by placing an image of "White Dawg" next to a <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bentley.html" title="Bentley">Bentley</a> automobile in completely unrelated articles (such as <a href="../../../w/e/a/Wealth.html" title="Wealth">Wealth</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rich.html" title="Rich">Rich</a>). <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 15:29, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm confused: I don't think that it does.

<ul>
<li>After looking more carefully at the edits, I think what happened was that the previous VfD on White Dawg was still active; therefore, when it was nom'd again, people began adding comments to the bottom of the previous discussion. UncleG archived the previous discussion and re-posted the pertinent (current) comments all at once. I made the first edit to the freshly reposted VfD discussion. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 16:22, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep it</b> It is Star Wars Histroy collected though books and games. It should be here so Star Wars Fans can look up info if they need to. Also EU authors could use this when writing Star Wars books, it is very useful information for a Star Wars Fan.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant_Fletcher_ac8b.html" title="User:Grant Fletcher">Grant</a> disliked the fact that I voted to delete an article he created and in a really halfass attempt to spite me, VFD'd this article. He messed up though and didn't follow the deletion process, so I removed the notice (after considering who he was and why he did it), but I've deleted for kicks and so he can't claim I removed the notice without cause, I decided to complete the steps he didn't. Anyways, most of the entries on the list had their own pages, but I felt they should be condensed into a list (some of the entries range from 1-2 sentences to barely a paragraph). --<a href="../../../k/r/o/User%7EKross_94e2.html" title="User:Kross">Kross</a> 18:54, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> My own opinion is that the various SW lists need to be rationalized (does it really make sense to have separate lists for ancient, and minor, Jedis? and etc.), but simply deleting them is emphatically <i>not</i> the way to go. This whole VfD seems pretty lame- see also the VfD for the Wookies. The fact that the starter, and only other hostile user, are claimed to be the same person casts considerable doubt on the validity of this deletion request. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">maru</a> 19:18, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>; I haven't looked into it thoroughly, but this VfD nom shows every indication of being a revenge nomination.

<li><b>To all of the SW fans</b> I am sorry i offended you by calling this list of ancient jedi a waste of space. Though I still belive this file to be too big (and what is up with the "It should be here so Star Wars Fans can look up info if they need to", need it?). And I would like it if people stop calling me spitefull just because I VDF'ed an entry by a person who VDF'ed an entry of mine, it is not spite I just check his user profile thingy and saw that his two articles seem to be a bit less usefull than, lets say, a certain genetic Wuz article that I entered.

<p>I do not believe this article is vanity. New kach movement is a very famous movement worldwide and was started by the same person, Rabbi Meir Kahane, who started the Jewish Defence League.

<dd>In fact that's not true at all.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The editor has deleted it. However, for the record there have been far more occasions of prisoners at Guantanamao Bay desecrating the Qu'ran than the one or two occasions it has been harmed by the guards. Al Queda members are trained to make allegations of abuse while in custody and any allegations have been thoroughly investigated. Unfortunately, the media doesn't seem to be interested in offering fair coverage of this so I agree with Ed Poor that the bulk of the article should be about the actions of the detainees. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 03:18, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's hard to google for because they're not always called "H-cluster reductions". Some people call them "Glide cluster reductions", and some people don't group them together at all, just calling them the "wine-whine merger" and the "yew-hew merger" (or some other set of words that illustrate the point), and some people don't call them by any name at all, but just talk about the loss of /h/ before /w/ and/or /j/.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The difference between the vowels in <i>starry</i> and <i>marry</i> is phonemic, otherwise they would rhyme.

<p>Quote-<i>These developments (historical linguistic sound changes) had the effect that many related words would then have had different pronunciations, depending on whether or not the word contained a suffix beginning with a vowel. Thus related words such as "star" and "starry" would have had different stressed vowels ("star" would have the new lengthened vowel, while "starry" would have the original short vowel). To avoid such disparities of pronunciation between morphologically-related forms, (i.e. pairs of obviously related words), there occurred a process of analogical replacement (not a regular sound change), by which forms with intervocalic [r] (such as "starry") came to have the same pre-[r] long vowel as the forms with non-intervocalic [r] (such as "star"). (It was impossible for the analogy process to work in the opposite direction, since shortening the long vowel in the form with non-intervocalic [r] would have violated the phonological requirement that no non-schwa short-vowel could occur before word-final [r], or before [r] followed by a consonant.) This analogical replacement process is the reason why in modern standard English dialects the word "starry" now has a vowel which is similar to that of the word "star", but which is different from the vowel of the word "marry". (The original short vowel in "marry" remained unaffected by analogy because in the case of that word there was no morphologically-related form in which the "a" vowel wasn't intervocalic.)</i> <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.12.117.14.html" title="User:64.12.117.14">64.12.117.14</a>, 23:51, 2005 Jun 14 (UTC)</p>
