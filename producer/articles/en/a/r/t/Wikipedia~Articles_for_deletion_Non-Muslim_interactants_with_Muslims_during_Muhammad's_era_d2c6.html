<p>Someone asked why this particular time is relevant. It is relevant since Muhamamd is a very notable name. The list could be named "list of non-Muslims who meet Muhamamd", but that would excluded people who meet the Muslims that fleed to ethiopia. Those people where very prominent, the first Caliph was one of them, and another would become Muhmmads wife. So the list is expaned to include non-Muslims that where involved in such a notable situations. Remeber, people from 1400 years ago are not remebered if they where non-notable, specialy not non-Muslims in Muslim books. And c'mon, we have <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_Presidents_by_height_order_a0e5.html" title="List of United States Presidents by height order">List of United States Presidents by height order</a>.

<p>please consider that the events during Muhammads time are very notable to both Muslims and non-Muslim scholars of Islam, and also consider <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_US_Presidents_by_height_order_b374.html" title="List of US Presidents by height order">List of US Presidents by height order</a>.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 23:27, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Another thing, the list is not "to broad to be usefull", Muhammad did'nt live for more than a few years after conquering the Arabian penisula, so most people in the list are Arabs that didnt became Muslims during Muhammads time.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 23:29, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Are that period and people documented? Where they engaged in wars? Did they shape the life of 1 000 000 000 people? Where they involved in the unification of the Islamic empire? Do we have a List of Joseph Smith companions? We <b>do</b> have a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Sahaba_e160.html" title="List of Sahaba">list of Sahaba</a>. The people in the article are notble, each have their own article. We need somewhere where we can access all of them, in the same way we have a list to access all Sahaba. Its two sides of the same coin. People that lived during Muhammads time. The Muslims are called Sahaba, and there is a list of them. This is a list of the non-Muslims. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 15:07, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
