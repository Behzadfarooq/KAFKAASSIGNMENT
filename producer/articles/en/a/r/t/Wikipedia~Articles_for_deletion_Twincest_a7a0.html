<p>A neologistic dictdef, with a handful of "examples" from pop culture that don't actually use the dictdef. The single reference doesn't use the dictdef either. This page doesn't even establish the common currency that Wiktionary wants, let alone notability (in the form of references in reliable sources) or importance or anything but a definition and a handful of OR examples.</p>

<dd>I would like to point out that any term that finds currency among fanfic writers is going to be disproportionately represented on Google, while often not being represented at all in publications (as opposed to personal sites, fansites, and forums). This does not prevent a term used exclusively by fanfic writers from being a neologism. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 06:08, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Compromise? - merge/redirect</b> -- OK, I see your point and the consensus seems to be delete or merge (as noted below, I had overlooked the option of merging before). How about merging the content into the <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html" title="Incest">incest</a> article and then turning this page into a redirect (as it obviously has relatively wide use--even if only among fanfic writers)? The new section in the <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html" title="Incest">incest</a> article would be titled not "twincest" but something like "incest between twins" and would mention the term twincest only in the context of being a fanfic term. This would also avoid claims of NOR based on applying the term to particular instances in fiction or real life. I don't anticipate it would take me more than 5-15 minutes to complete the merge and subsequent cleanup. If you express your support for this proposal, I will go ahead and do the merge (without your support as hte nominator, it may seem as if I'm going against consensus even though at least 4 editors have supported <i>keep</i> or <i>merge</i>). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 06:55, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I performed the merge and some cleanup, but I don't think the <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html" title="Incest">Incest</a> article is the appropriate place for this, so I reverted the merge. <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html" title="Incest">Incest</a> is essentially affiliated with (and most often a form of) physical/emotional abuse. Incest among twins, on the other hand, is a subgenre of erotica, pornography, and fanfic. I have replaced the Twincest article with what I think is an improved version, and will add a few sources presently. As for <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, I agree with the proposal by <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">User:JoshuaZ</a> that the article should be renamed to "Incest among twins" -- I can do this once the AfD closes or you withdraw your nomination (if, of course, you think the new verison is satisfactory). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:08, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Neologism at best, seems to be mostly a fanfic/fanart term. A book search does turn up "twincest" in a fancy-sounding book called "An Anthropology of the Subject", but looking at the context it seems to be unrelated: "<i>a figure and a feeling that is simultaneously attractive and repulsive.</i>" At best, this would be a redirect to <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html" title="Incest">incest</a> or perhaps it belongs among <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_fiction_terminology.html" title="Fan fiction terminology">Fan fiction terminology</a> if a good source can be found. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 09:18, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Allow me to flush out my argument by responding to the article's criticisms:
<ol>
<li>"It violates <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>/is non-notable" - see the Google search above; the term gets over 80,000 non-WP or WP-mirror hits. Now granted, many of those hits do not meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, but it is proof that the term has widespread usage (even if within a somewhat specialized community).</li>
<li>"It is a dicdef" - it is not just a dicdef as it provides actual examples (including 2 nonfictional) and other content. Only the first line is a definition--what about the rest of the article?</li>
<li>"It violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>" - given the very clear and simple definition, it doesn't take <i>any</i> research to note that the <i>incestual</i> sexual scene between the Sorrel <i>twins</i> in Cruel Intentions 2 qualifies under that definition. The examples don't have to mention the source by name. If a politician says that Germany is going to invade the country south of it, east of Switzerland, north of Italy, and west of Hungary, he/she doesn't have to name Austria for us to understand what he's referring to and to include the comment in German-Austrian relations.</li>
<li>"It's a fanfic/fanart term" - this is essentially the same criticism as the first. Yes, it is a fanfic term that has relatively wide usage. Being fanfic is no reason for deletion.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>A final comment</b> regarding the article's potential for expansion. I expect there would be a significant amount of notable research on this subject within the general literature on incest (twincest being a subcategory of incest). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:17, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><i><a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_molestation.html" title="Child molestation">Child molestation</a></i> is "disgusting and illegal" but it's an encyclopedic topic. I cannot help but think that you are voting simply out of a negative emotional reaction to the topic. In an AfD discussion, we should consider whether the article merits to be in this encyclopedia, rather than whether or not it's a pleasant topic to ponder/read about. You claim its non-notable, yet the term gets over 80,000 Google hits (this still excludes all print sources that aren't available online). You claim it's poorly referenced, and I agree with that (in part)--so put an unreferenced tag on the article. Finally, you say it's OR--how so? What part of it is original research (there is no new, unique synthesis of material--it's simply a compilation of a few examples)? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 22:51, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you enjoy twincest that's your business. This is an encyclopedia, not a forum for sexual fantasies. There's one single reference. Most of the examples are ambiguous and/or works of fiction. You don't need to attack me just for adding a contribution that you disagree with. --<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommyOliver_4b95.html" title="User:TommyOliver">TommyOliver</a> 23:35, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Firstly, I do not, as you put it, "enjoy twincest". To say that I do is equal to saying that those who created the "child molestation" article are child molesters and contributors to the "Holocaust" article favor genocide. Secondly, this IS an encyclopedia and it should include terms that have wide usage, despite how unpleasant (either for one person or for many) the subject matter they concern. There's a single reference <i>in the article</i>, but there are &gt;80,000 ghits. I'm sure at least a few of these can be used as references. I note, again: if the problem is references, add an "unreferenced" tag. Thirdly, there is nothing in my comment that is an attack. "Voting out of a negative emotional reaction" is inappropriate for AfD, but certainly nothing insulting. I can't imagine anyone ever saying: "Yo mama so [insert some term], her vote on a Wikipedia AfD was based on an emotional reaction." Finally, I believe my statement was a reasonable (though I realize not possibly incorrect) induction given the text of your vote: "Original research, poorly referenced, and not at all notable. <i>Plus it's disgusting and illegal</i> (emphasis added). I merely asked you to clarify your reasons for claiming that the articles is OR and NN.

It may also be appropriate to merge the article into the main <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html" title="Incest">Incest</a> page.

If you mean that the article's current <i>title</i> is inappropriate for the subject matter, then I agree, but that is hardly a reason to delete when it can be solved through a simple page move (I simply haven't done so yet as I don't know if it's appropriate to do a page move during an AfD). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:15, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>But even if moved, does Incest between twins in fiction really have a chance of ever becoming a good article, as opposed to being a good section somewhere? —<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">xyzzy</a><sub><a href="../../../x/y/z/User_talk%7EXyzzy_n_2d1b.html" title="User talk:Xyzzy n">n</a></sub> 18:33, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The article could have the more general title Incest among twins (a number of the "popular culture" examples listed are non-fictional). I initially supported merging it to <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html" title="Incest">Incest</a> but decided against doing so after comparing the two articles. Incest is usually a form of (non-consensusal) abuse (and the article explicitly treats it as such), whereas incest among twins essentially amounts to a genre of eroticism, pornography, and/or sexploitation. I think the article could be a good, if relatively short (not stub-length though), article if someone were to make the effort to expand it (I say someone instead of me because, as my edit history can prove, my editing interests lie in other subjects). In any case, I think this article can stand on its own as a stub, and if anyone wants to make it a section elsewhere, I have no objections (my objection is to the content being deleted).

<li><b>Keep</b> - the sources clearly demonstrate notability for the phenomenon, and its import especially in fiction, as well as material for its expansion - but it absolutely must be <b>rename</b>d. <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest_between_twins.html" title="Incest between twins">Incest between twins</a> seems a sensible compromise. At a push, it might be <b>merge</b>d to the <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html" title="Incest">incest</a> article, but there seems to me to be enough for a separate article. --<a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpenToppedBus_1b69.html" title="User:OpenToppedBus">OpenToppedBus</a> - <a href="../../../o/p/e/User_talk%7EOpenToppedBus_4569.html" title="User talk:OpenToppedBus">Talk to the driver</a> 19:06, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Move</b> to <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest_between_twins.html" title="Incest between twins">incest between twins</a> or something like that and tag for a merge to <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html" title="Incest">incest</a>. —<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">xyzzy</a><sub><a href="../../../x/y/z/User_talk%7EXyzzy_n_2d1b.html" title="User talk:Xyzzy n">n</a></sub> 20:18, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> renaming is certainly a good idea (since the current, well-written and properly sourced article is about the cultural concept rather than the neologistic fan-fiction term). It looks great now. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 08:20, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
