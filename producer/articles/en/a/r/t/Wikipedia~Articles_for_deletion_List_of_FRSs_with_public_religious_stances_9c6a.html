<p>This list does not simply list Fellows of the Royal Society. It does not simply list, say, atheists. It does not simply list Christian apologists. It tries to synthesise information about people who fit into one category with what if anything they have said about religious matters, then does not simply list people who are both FRSs and willing to state their religious beliefs in public but also subcategorises them according to belief - all apparently to demonstrate some point (see the discussion on the talk page). This looks like someone's pet research project designed to push a point that they want to establish (apparently that most FRSs who have spoken up about religion have been favourable to it). Such an exercise is POV-pushing and inherently involves original research. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 10:58, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, for reasons explained by the nominator, and as discussed on the article's talk page. In brief, it's a matter of inescapable POV arising from the bias that is inherent in the methodology of such a list.

I have no idea whether there will be more Atheists, Agnostics or Christians on this list - the intention is simply to present the information factually and without POV comment. When the people listed have their own articles which attribute religious positions in the articles (based on reliabile sources) additional refs seem superfluous, but can be provided if necessary.

<dd><b>Comment</b> So far (24 March) the stated reasons for deletion below appear to be (a) that is it <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> "to demonstrate some point" or (b) that it is "pointless". The fact that the nominator and several other Editors opt for (a) demonstrates that it is not pointless. And if it is OR then <i>so is every other structured list</i> - such as eg <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_HIV-positive_people_232c.html" title="List of HIV-positive people"><b>this</b></a> <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Dartmouth_College_alumni_c27d.html" title="List of Dartmouth College alumni"><b>this</b></a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Ohio_county_name_etymologies_5777.html" title="List of Ohio county name etymologies"><b>this</b></a> which are all <a href="../../../f/l/_/WP%7EFL_362d.html" title="WP:FL"><b>Featured Lists</b></a>. <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">NBeale</a> 08:47, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I have no problem with a list of Jewish fellows unless it was then further grouped so instead of being alphabetical it was further sorted by what religion they were. For instance <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Kroto_daa3.html" title="Harold Kroto">Harold_Kroto</a> is simply listed under <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_Fellows_of_the_Royal_Society_2700.html#K" title="List of Jewish Fellows of the Royal Society">K</a> whereas you would have him under "Atheist". It is this further separation that is when the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> kicks in. The list also includes dead people; on this list we're talking about you have repeatedly said that dead people are not eligible for entry for some weird reason. <a href="../../../t/t/i/User%7ETtiotsw_54d6.html" title="User:Ttiotsw">Ttiotsw</a> 07:56, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> NBeale misses the point completely. The lists he shows are facts and inclusion is unequivocal - either they are or they aren't. For this list there is subjectivity (the font from which OR spills) as the term "public religious stances" could be interpreted many ways - could just attending church regularly be taken as a "public religious stance"? <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Sophia</b></font></a> 09:13, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Tks Sophia. If <b>that's</b> the problem let's clarify (rename if necessary) that the "stance" is that recorded in their WP Article (based on reliable sources)- hence no OR here. <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">NBeale</a> 10:03, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> NBeale also fails to point out that the lists he uses as examples i.e. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_HIV-positive_people_232c.html" title="List of HIV-positive people">List of HIV-positive people</a> fails to include HIV-negative people, and that the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Dartmouth_College_alumni_c27d.html" title="List of Dartmouth College alumni">List of Dartmouth College alumni</a> fails to include other College alumni and that the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Ohio_county_name_etymologies_5777.html" title="List of Ohio county name etymologies">List of Ohio county name etymologies</a> doesn't include other counties. I'm all for a list of religious stances but atheism isn't a religious stance. To be religious it has to have a belief in and worship of a supernatural entity (or entities and they need not be a "god" in the theist sense e.g. Buddhists). Dawkins (the target of this article) as far as I know is approaching this scientifically and it's misleading to call this stance a "religious stance". These stances are comparing apples and oranges. <a href="../../../t/t/i/User%7ETtiotsw_54d6.html" title="User:Ttiotsw">Ttiotsw</a> 10:01, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This list is pointless and misleading. The fact that the only justification anyone has given for the list is to "dispel popular misconceptions" betrays the initial author's agenda.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As others have noted, the list will never reflect what "top scientists" believe since it can only include the tiny minority who have chosen to publicly discuss their religious beliefs. It's better to have no list at all than a hopelessly misleading list.</dd>
<dd>There's plenty of good survey data out there about what scientists think of religion and other supernatural beliefs. Better to present these data than to conduct our own sloppy, inaccurate survey. Sideshow Bob Roberts 13:37, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> FRS has nothing to do with personal stances on any topic other than their own field of science. Most biologists would naturally be atheists.

<li><b>Keep</b> I seem to be almost alone, but--I would have said delete if it were FRSs by religion. But FRSs do tsomer of them take specifically religious public stances, and it is not OR to find out, because they will only belong here if obvious. It is further relevant, because most of the make specific use of the status as FRS when expressing religious views, or when others use the as examples: these are cases where both the status and the religion is clearly discernible. I personally do not care how tit will balance out -- I think that the majority wont think it worthwhile or appropriate to talk about their religion, so its not a poll. Obviously the categories will get more refined as the numbers increase. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 07:56, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> as this list can be automatically generated through categories.

It is thus a <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">synthesis</a> of information.

<dd><b>Reply</b> Nbeale, the list is called "List of FRSs with public religious stances", not "List of FRSs with <i>current</i> public religious stances", and the only reference to it being for "current" FRSs in a footnote. That lack of confusion about the list's scope doesn't enhance its credibility.<br />
Your defence here is based on claiming a purpose for the list other than what this stated in the article, which again undermines credibility.<br />
In any case a list such as this will have constant changing content, as new FRSs are appointed and old ones die, as well as the changes in religious stance you have just instanced. So the list you describe here is journalistic rather than encyclopedic: it does not consist of durable knowledge. What is the encyclopedic logic for judging that the religious stance of someone is notable when they are alive but becomes non-notable when they die?

<li><b>Keep</b> Many of these people claim their status as FRS to give weight to their views on religious belief. The point of an institution such as the Royal Society is that its fellows speak for both themselves and the Academy to which they belong.

<dd>Homosexuality, as an alternate example, is not illegal in the UK any more (unlike a few years ago whereby Christians would support chemically altering sexuality of homosexuals) whereas it could be argued that a certain public support or stance on religion is still illegal. The still-extant UK Blasphemy laws only protect Christians and could (albeit unlikely) be used to imprison or cause hardship to those who highlight some of the more ludicrous nonsense promoted by Christians. To make a fair comparison you need to identify some human characteristic in which only 1 group is protected. Within religion, obviously women are discriminated against so that's a good candidate. The Catholic church actively rejects the equality of women with men, as does the Church of England and pretty much any other Christian organisation which fits under the papal thumb. I'm not, but wow a women atheist is screwed all ways by Christianity.</dd>
<dd>In the end my concerns are that we need not consider atheism or humanism to be a religion and thus not a religious belief but there does seem a drive towards equating the two for this list. Theism is about belief in a particular supernatural entity whereas atheism usually precludes this. It would be like having a list of astronomers with a stance of "aliens" and though implication that some support <a href="../../../s/e/t/SETI_0570.html" title="SETI">SETI</a> equate this with a belief (or not) in <a href="../../../u/f/o/UFO_9768.html" title="UFO">UFOs</a>. One side is an outright belief in "Area 51" nonsense and the other is a more scientific approach based on probabilities. With normal people this isn't an issue but FRS it is; the Christian FRS effectively believe in the existence of a supernatural being but cannot present any proof of this (or these) entities.

<dd><i>Comment</i> - isn't it precisely because it's a controversial subject that its methods must be above reproach? Part of the problem, as I see it, is that the list is doomed to failure because of insurmountable bias in the sources of information. You cannot get at the information you need for most of the people who might be included (whether or not they are alive!), and the likelihood of having the information is likely to be influenced by the stance of the person, producing seriously skewed data. <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 14:39, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The goal of the list does not appear to identify the scope of each persons religious or areligious belief. That information should be left for the individual to self-identify (ex Rees self-identifies) in a public capacity. If other names need to be added to columns, let this happen. The journalism "bias" suggested above is naturally favored against religious theism than say humanism. Over time, a useful list of scientific peoples who have SELF-IDENTIFIED religious or areligious views will be available with accompanying sources. The point is clear--there are a large number of theists who are scientists. This information may have nuances that are difficult to quantify but it does not necessitate deletion. Beginning the list by posting various Royal Society fellows is a decent place to start. This could be extended to anyone wanting to do the research from other academic scientific bodies who have self-identified.

Because if a WP article were the best source for such a factoid, that article would clearly be original research. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 03:16, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think this is the reason for the creation of this list. Or, rather, not so much to create a list for percentage purposes, but more to say "hey - look at all these non-atheist [sic] scientists!". Classic <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argument_from_authority.html" title="Argument from authority">argument from authority</a> stuff. As such, both <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">POV</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a>.

<dd><b>Comments</b> (a) the inferences that people may draw from properly refed facts are not a reason for declaring the article <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">POV</a>. (b) A simple List of Christian FRSs must be OK because there is already a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_Fellows_of_the_Royal_Society_2700.html" title="List of Jewish Fellows of the Royal Society">List of Jewish FRSs</a> so if this article is deleted all that happens is that the handful of public atheists get removed - is that what you really want? (c) Obviously this list says nothing about the % of FRSs who <i>are</i> Christian/Atheist whatever - no doubt many FRSs not on this list have private views on the subject. (d) This list is no more OR than any other list that has not already been published elsewhere, consequently if this is list is OR then so are almost all the other WikiPedia lists. <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">NBeale</a> 14:49, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>While I don't personally think the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_Fellows_of_the_Royal_Society_2700.html" title="List of Jewish Fellows of the Royal Society">List of Jewish FRSs</a> was a very good idea for a list, it has survived a rather weakly argued <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Jewish_Fellows_of_the_Royal_Society_44db.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Jewish Fellows of the Royal Society">AfD</a>. I guess if you had started this as a simple list of Christian FRSs, at least my objections would no longer apply. And I think most people wouldn't mind, except if you somehow manage to include a <i>very subtle</i> attack on a certain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_FRSs_with_public_religious_stances&amp;oldid=116908945" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_FRSs_with_public_religious_stances&amp;oldid=116908945" rel="nofollow">"militant atheist"</a>&#160;:P Funny how we have to go through AfDs before these things become compliant. If I may refer to some of you aptly named friends, why don't you <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_think-it-through_ec03.html" title="Special:Contributions/think-it-through">think-it-through</a> before you create a page, instead of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_thinking-it-through_a34f.html" title="Special:Contributions/thinking-it-through">thinking-it-through</a> during the AfD?&#160;;) --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 19:18, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, per nom. Main reasons to delete are POV concerns and the lack of a sufficient reason for such a list to exist -- that is, there is nothing inherently encyclopaedic about such a list. The fact of public assertion of a religious stance is certainly encyclopaedic and that information should be included in each individual's article. I also think some category or list identifying religious position <i>could</i> be encyclopaedic, though I'd have to think about any specific case; it's just that restricting this to FRSs is too specific. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 17:19, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
