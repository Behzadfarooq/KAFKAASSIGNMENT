<p>It's funny how shortly after I say "Might as well make a list of songs about love" in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_songs_which_refer_to_Jesus_4a47.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of songs which refer to Jesus">this AfD</a>, this article crops up in my sights.

<li>Indiscriminate collection of information. You can't convince me that the topic "songs about sex" has a very specific focus. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 08:10, 19 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The title alone shows the focus, "songs about sex". It's self-explanatory. Lists fall under nothing in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information</a>. Not all lists are indiscriminate sources of information. <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELISTS_2571.html" title="WP:LISTS">WP:LISTS</a>, a guideline for wikipedia, governs the use of lists and justifies their existance.

<ul>
<li>The guideline page you cite contains references to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> which this page cannot meet; many lists have been deleted under the criteria I previously cited as well. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 08:24, 19 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well I see your point, but what do you expect for sources? "The New York Times has determined that the song <i>Bad Touch</i> is about sex. Groundbreaking." For all of the <i>List of songs about _____ articles</i>, you're not going to find sources that say "This song is about _____". What should be done about things that are so obvious they're not written anywhere? --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Olsen_0313.html" title="User:Daniel Olsen">Daniel Olsen</a> 08:33, 19 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's amazing what people write about, sometimes. Before asserting that there are "things that are so obvious they're not written anywhere", <i>do the research</i>. You might find that there are copious sources on the subject, which you can use to entirely refute the argument that this is unverifiable. Please <i>do research and attempt to find sources</i>, rather than trying to argue that we should make exceptions to our sourcing policies. You should be working from sources in the first place, anyway. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:29, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Here's a hint: There are 8 pages of sleeve notes that you could cite, for starters, which you will find when you <i>do the research</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:47, 19 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Which might be relevant for articles about the songs or the albums they're on. It doesn't begin to justify this list's existence. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 20:03, 19 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The sleeve notes that I'm alluding to are on the subject of a collection that is specifically entitled "songs about sex". I've exhorted those who want the article kept to do the research. I exhort those who want the article deleted to do the research, also. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:16, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>Focus of this list is too broad to be of any meaning, IMHO. Over half of the songs in the top 40 in every western country for the last 20 years would have been about sex in some way? It would almost make more sense to have a list of "Songs not about sex"...<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETompee_9903.html" title="User:Tompee">Tompee</a> 08:35, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>No, you couldn't. Really, you couldn't. Probably the only thing there are more songs about than sex is love. And arguably they're not that different. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 08:48, 19 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How can you claim that? Many songs contain both, especially rap which can contain all three. The List of songs about money is just as broad. I don't particularly care for this list or any other list of songs about something, but if your going to have them you might as well have the most popular ones. <a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOutside_Center_195d.html" title="User:Outside Center">Outside Center</a> 08:54, 19 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_about_money.html" title="List of songs about money">List of songs about money</a> is maintainable given that it is focused on songs specifically about money, and doesn't just mention every rap song where the rapper happens to mention his bank account. Personally, however, I'm against any list of songs on Wikipedia without a focused verifiable subject; I just don't have the werewithal to nominate them all. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 20:05, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Agreed that its completely unmanageable. And the majority of songs in popular culture today reference sex - imo, this is just a random collection of information that doesn't serve any real purpose.

<li><b>Delete</b> sex is a human desire and thousands of songs have been written, or could be interpreted to be, pertaining to sex. Unmanagable and unverifiable. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> 22:55, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, as all songs are basically about sex, even <i>"<a href="../../../s/u/p/Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.html" title="Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious">Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</a>"</i>. Well-known fact. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 05:55, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../t/u/l/User%7ETuluvas2_e965.html" title="User:Tuluvas2">Tuluvas2</a> 16:40, 23 August 2006 (UTC) I am saying delete because this is such a subjective topic in a way. First of all different cultures would probably consider different things to consist of "sex". Would everyone world wide accept oral sex as being sex? (Obviously not just look at the JAMA from when Clinton was president). Also some songs may indirectly refer to sex but they do not directly refer to sex. Someone can talk about sex indirectly in a song and never mention the word sex or anything related to sex. What subjective stand-point do we base the meaning of the songs from? Do we include songs that we perceive as being related to sex that others will not perceive as being related to sex? From the perceptions of some people songs which talk about things not related to sex may be subliminally refering to sex, and to other people songs which subliminally refer to sex with out mentioning it may not appear to be about sex. Wikipedia should be for objective information and NPOV and I see that this list is going to automatically be at least partially point of view. (Someones point of veiw may be that the candy shop is actually a candy shop, even though my point of veiw is that the song is obviously refering to sex). But does my point of veiw automatically over rule someone elses perception? I guess we could ask the artist who makes the song what the song was actually about? Or we could make a list of songs that have the potential to be perceived as about sex? It is just a mess really, and what I have just said may not make any sense, but I vote for delete.
<ul>
<li>So the list "Songs about Drugs" is ok, but a similar list of "songs" is not? Drugs are just as taboo, illicit, and controversial as sex, but the "Songs about Drugs" list isn't being considered for deletion. Also, as far as I can tell, the two lists have the same format. So I ask- why the double standard?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/u/l/User%7ETuluvas2_e965.html" title="User:Tuluvas2">Tuluvas2</a> 14:19, 24 August 2006 (UTC) I agree with the above poster that we should hold the standard to all lists similar to this one. The topic of the list had no reason in my desicion to vote for deletion. Are there any standards on how the Wikipedia community has dealt with lists such as this one? I don't want to go against the standards with my vote and if someone could give me a link to an article/rule about lists that could be interpreted to say this list should stay I would quickly change my vote based on the new evidence. However if nobody can, I will keep my vote delete for this list and advocate that we delete all similar lists. We must be equal and fair and if one list is removed for a reason all other lists that meet that reason should be removed. But like I mentioned before, if someone gives a link to a standard/rule about lists such as these on wikipedia that can be interpreted to say this list should stay, then I will change my vote to keep and advocate that we keep all other lists like this.</li>
