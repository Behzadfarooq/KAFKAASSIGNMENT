<li><b>Delete</b>. The term certainly has currency, and may soon be applied in entirely new ways due to current events. [wry grin] However, I think anything beyond a dictdef is necessarily going to verge on the POV and libelous, as I cannot imagine adding anything except examples and descriptions of alleged media whoring beyond the definition itself.

<li>Definitely <b>Keep</b> This list is far more easy to use than any category. It allows to have some clear formatting which unfortunately a category doesn't have.

By the way, I thought edits on Wikipedia should try to be constructive, rather than destructive: in doubt, and if many people find such a list useful, please leave it to them, even if it creates some sort of redundancy. <a href="../../../p/h/g/User%7EPHG_fa08.html" title="User:PHG">PHG</a> 12:06, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

That makes this a bad-faith nomination. It seems that we should remove bad-faith nominations, rather than vote on them. If we are going to vote, however, we should vote on the merits and not vote to "Keep" something simply because it has been submitted to VfD in bad faith to make a point. The arguments that were used to justify the deletion of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Index_of_topics_in_alternative_medicine.html" title="Index of topics in alternative medicine">Index of topics in alternative medicine</a> do indeed justify the deletion of this article. As was already argued, there is no need for a manually-maintained list of topics in a subject area. That is what categories are for.

<li>I do not think that this article should be deleted, namely because it seems to be a fascinating part of history. I, too, did a google search, one for Truelove Eyre, and a number of websites came up. All members should google search for Truelove Eyre before they either vote to delete, lest wikipedia should be deprived of a very interesting historical entity. And, if google hits for the Eyre Empire are rare, that is probably because the entire thing went on within one family. I've been doing my homework, and there IS an Eyrecourt in Ireland. Go to yahoo.com, and search it. Then try google, and britannica. Tourists go there now. Add to that, there is a large inland body called, "Lake Eyre," in Australia. Deleting this article would be silly, and deprive students and history buffs of a topic that is not covered very often.</li>
<li>i dont know how to vote on this thing, but i agree w/the last person. That articles cool, its helping me with my paper. you should leave it up.

<li>The comments would naturally use the same IP address, as they're coming from the same computer. I posted a comment here some time ago, as has my sister. It seems utterly ridiculous to me to delete this article, especially when there is such an abundance of outside reference for it. Go to google and look up Jehu Eyre. You have to search around a bit, but it's there. How does one vote not to delete? Also, look up, "Eyre Coat of Arms."

<li>68.18.24.191, if "there is such an abundance of outside reference for it," why didn't you cite them in the article instead of having everybody else search for it? <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> 20:47, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>The answer for that is simple: I did not write the article. However, I still stand by what I said; I'm not a history person in the sense that I don't enjoy it (though I do not quite a bit about it because of some wonderful teachers), yet this piqued my interest. My sister and I both have to report on a historical family (she's doing the Hapsburgs), and these people just seemed like a very fascinating bunch. Plus, there are about five different people who routinely use this computer, which means that when I have to do research, I need it FAST. Wikipedia has become my academic crutch, especially in terms of history. I've always liked it because it features articles on things that aren't always widely known. If I, a high school student, can find information on google to back this stuff up, then surely wikipedia can recognize said article's validity. Trust me, google, yahoo, it's there. Just do what I did and you can see these sources for yourself. I'll ask my friend about all of this...he is a real whiz with history.

<p>Keep: some of the websites behind it seem fairly genuine. And one of the blogs, imperialpress.blogspot.com, does offer a history section that positively identifies the link between William the Conqueror and Truelove Eyre through Edmund II. Go to the archives section, November of 2004, and read the article, "House of Eyre Came From House of Wessex." A number of other families established similar domains: the Angevins (not widely known), the Plantagenets (not widely known), the Hapbsburgs (not widely known among Americans), etc. Also, the Coat of Arms is real, that's on yahoo.

<p>Keep and Tweak: as an (enthusiatic) student of medieval studies, I have come across similar articles in stories over the years. Most of what this article says is accurate. However, I would recommend something; while most historians confirm that Truelove Eyre did exist, some of his ACTIONS are a bit murky, said to have originated in legend. (There is a similar story that says Truelove knew King Richard the Lionheart, a sheer impossibility due to the fact that they lived in separate centuries). The author should clarify that while Truelove is widely acknowledged to have founded the Eyre Dynasty, the WAY in which he did it is still disputed. Also, some source citations wouldn't be a bad idea; you can find the stuff, but it's inconvenient to search. Other than that, keep it. It would be a shame to get rid of an article that deals with one of the very few things able to last through the Medieval, Renaissance, Enlightenment, Industrial, and Modern Ages. 168.184.90.11 (<a href="../../../1/6/8/User_talk%7E168.184.90.11.html" title="User talk:168.184.90.11">talk</a> · <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_168.184.90.11_1928.html" title="Special:Contributions/168.184.90.11">contributions</a>)</p>

<p>I stand by what I said yesterday, and what the two people there have said completely proves my point. The whole Truelove Eyre thing must be rooted in some fact, otherwise the family crest (which we've all established existed) wouldn't bear the leg symbol. I went to imperialpress and found it quite helpful. The fact that there even IS controversy at the site that Hyperzonk cited shows that there is some sort of historical basis for Truelove Eyre. I agree with the other ones. Aside from Truelove, we now for a fact that this family exists (especially as many of the links listed on THIS PAGE take readers to sites detailing Eyre descendants now living in the US). The article is a website about a rich and influential family called "Eyre." We now know that that family is a factual part of history. So, not counting the Truelove Eyre thing (which should be modified to reflect his mythical status), the article should stay. 68.18.24.191 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.18.24.191.html" title="User talk:68.18.24.191">talk</a> · <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.18.24.191_7191.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.18.24.191">contributions</a>)</p>

<p><b>Enthusiatic Keep and Edit</b> This is a good article dealing with historical fact and should not be trashed, but I annoyed by several things. First of all, the author mentions "Leroy Heller's descendants," yet fails to reference some of the most important among them. To begin with, Leroy's son, Stanley Heller, the chairman of a Philadelphia bank and presumably the rightful heir to a resurrected Eyre Empire (should that unlikely day ever come about), is entirely skipped over. This leads me to believe that the author had a less than full knowledge of the subject matter. Stanley Heller is a significant descendant and should be listed. Secondly, another of Leroy's granddaughters holds a high level position for CDC and another works for a Democratic senator. Why haven't these things been included? Anyone with enough knowledge about this, please edit the article, or I will. I say, ANYONE WITH ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE, because it's not a widely known subject except in some royalist and medieval historical circles.

Secondly, another of Leroy's granddaughters holds a high level position for CDC and another works for a Democratic senator. Why haven't these things been included? Anyone with enough knowledge about this, please edit the article, or I will. I say, ANYONE WITH ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE, because it's not a widely known subject except in some royalist and medieval historical circles. So, if you don't know what you're talking about, don't try to fix this because you'll just make it worse. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHistory21_c579.html" title="User:History21">History21</a> (<a href="../../../h/i/s/User_talk%7EHistory21_199e.html" title="User talk:History21">talk</a> · <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_History21_4a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/History21">contributions</a>)</p>
<p>CZAR TO MAKE TRIP TO THE CAPITOL; FEBRUARY 16, 2005(OLD CALENDAR) The Imperial Compound is confirming today that Czar Arthur is planning on making a visit to Washington, D.C. this summer, where he will be given a VIP tour of the Capitol and will meet with several senators in the Senate Dining Room for luncheon. The czar's second cousin, Princess Alicia (a granddaughter of Senior Dowager Czar Leroy and a niece of Dowager Czarina Marie), who has overseen a Senate office for the last twelve years, will be host to her royal relation. Proponents of the Eyre Empire see it as an enormous step in the right direction. It will be Czar Arthur's first official trip since being crowned head of the resurrected financial dynasty in December. It will also serve as the first meeting between an Eyre monarch and a government representative since the spring of 1929, a milestone that many say is representative of the family's rejuvenation. Dowager Grand Duchess Augusta, mother to Grand Duchess Anna and Czarevna Mildred, was thrilled to hear the news. "This is the best thing that could have possibly happened," she said. It has also confirmed many in their thoughts that the empire is rising once more. “It’s like everything is happening at once,” said Grand Duchess Anna, referring to other recent events within the family (see articles below). The Imperial Compound has promised to keep the Imperial Press updated on these events.</p>

<p>No, that is my blog. I, for one, do not appreciate insinuations that I am A. trying to spam. or, B., writing under false pretenses. Not once have I tried to log in under two different names. In fact, I haven't provided any. And the above passage "I am a wiki user," was contributed by someone other than myself at a different area of this site who had the kindness to let me copy and paste. The moronic insistence at this sight (with the exception of some people, whom, I can assure you, are not myself in disguise) to deny historical fact because the majority of the history came from a murky time just makes me laugh to myself at the hypocrisy of the "contributors," who, in this case, have become, "detractors." Grow up and learn to properly use a computer. Also, a dictionary wouldn't help; you misspelled, "You're." <i>comment by anonymous user 68.18.28.36</i></p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Psychology jargon/term of art. The <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triangular_theory_of_love.html" title="Triangular theory of love">triangular theory of love</a> isn't so notable that we need multiple articles to cover its special terminology. "Triangular theory of love"+"Robert Sternberg" has only 364 Google hits. "Consummate love"+"triangular" gets 406 hits. If this article were longer, I'd say redirect it in order to maintain the history, but since it is two sentences, it should just be deleted, and someone can expand <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triangular_theory_of_love.html" title="Triangular theory of love">Triangular theory of love</a>. Anyway, aspects of the theory are handled better in context, rather than having to click around all over the place to piece it together from multiple stubby little articles. Why the insistence on breaking so many topics into multiple stubby articles?

<p>I think the author was trying to make a user page, correct me if I'm wrong, and that's he's not making an article instead. -- <a href="../../../r/i/f/User%7ERiffsyphon1024_ff13.html" title="User:Riffsyphon1024">Riffsyphon1024</a> 11:21, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Please do not attempt mistake this for a user page, rather, think of it as a person's foray into creating the abstract meaning for a new word.
<ul>
<li>The author does not wish to infringe on any rules enforced by the wikipedia organisation, however, and will not discourage article-removal for consistency's sake.<br /></li>
<li>Please note: the author also dislikes having to refer to himself in nameless third person. It is purely for anonymity.<br />

<li>Then it only gives me more reason to submit this for deletion. Wikipedia's articles are for notable people only. If you wish you keep this page, I suggest you become a Wikipedian, and place this on your user page, which cannot face deletion. -- <a href="../../../r/i/f/User%7ERiffsyphon1024_ff13.html" title="User:Riffsyphon1024">Riffsyphon1024</a> 11:34, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)<br />

<li>I have to admit, from its inception I thought I didn't have a <i>great</i> chance; however there is the possibility that I will become notable from being one of the who's who on Wikipedia dot com. If that isn't notoreity on the Internet, then I have to beg the question: what is? (intended as rhetoric). I'm also a bit frazzled over the seemingly inconsistent formatting that certain tags seem to induce, such as line breaks and unordered list tags (your statements merely format themselves, while I have to be finicky). -- <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETennerage_10ef.html" title="User:Tennerage">tennerage</a> 10:09PM, 27 Feb 2005 (CST)
<ul>
<li>The easiest thing for you to do is go into edit for this "article", copy everything, start your user page, edit it, and paste everything there. The photos will move just as well. Then I can do whatever with this remnant. I then assume at that point that you will be a contributor to this site in general knowledge, and not trying to make yourself a notable one. For me, my user page states I am here, and states my various edits and creations, but I am nothing special; I just do what I like to do. Also note that even if you became notable somehow, you wouldn't be able to write your own article, because it would natually be filled with POV. Now if you don't mind it's nearly 6 am, and I must rest. Others will come to express their opinions soon. -- <a href="../../../r/i/f/User%7ERiffsyphon1024_ff13.html" title="User:Riffsyphon1024">Riffsyphon1024</a> 11:51, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Second choice merge redir. Mostly agree with what User:BM says, except that leaving redirs at all these one-offs reduces chances of re-creation of these articles.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b>, perhaps POV is a bad word choice on my part. I think what I mean to say is that in its current form the article presents a rather one sided view of music from 2000 onwards. It mentions little of rap / hiphop, which IMO is far more dominant now than trance/techno, but the article seems to state otherwise. Similarly, it treats localalised music trends as global - "There was a notable return to raw garage rock'n'roll with groups such as The Strokes, The White Stripes and The Kings of Leon"...except that in many other countries, these bands have not been heard of at all. Ditto for "the charts are full of". If it is kept as an article, then it needs to be worked on the regional aspects. I agree that a catagory would be better, although on the other hand it would still overlap a lot with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bands.html" title="List of bands">List of bands</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick04_a2be.html" title="User:Nick04">Nick04</a> 15:42, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Folks can always add names. I'm not into the rap/hiphop scene so I can't do so myself, and it could be argued that electronica, noise, and other forms of music are even more dominant than rap and hiphop (without getting all the headlines), so there's probably plenty of expansion to be done here. That's sort of why a category might make more sense than trying to just make a straight list, since some bands (say, Rolling Stones as a good example) would need to be listed multiple times. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 19:52, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> ... the decade may not be over, but there are slews of new artists coming out in the decade. I don't see why we would have to wait for the decade to be over at all. It's not like we are predicting what artists existed in 2009, and the article is not made to say what artists were significant within the decade (that would be a personal opinion anyway, and would sure to be controversial). The article is made to say what artists emerged within the decade, and that information is pretty clear and easy to obtain. HOWEVER, this article probably needs clean-up. There are certain flaws with this article... it does ignore the other genres aside from rock and pop at the moment. The intro paragraph at the beginning should be altered or deleted, because that is where it is trying to predict things. It would be good to get this article out somehow to garner a bit more attention... probably included as a "See also" link within various artists of this decade (especially of the genres outside of rock/pop). But of course, we should keep in mind that this article states "groups" and not individual artists per se (so it may be suggested to change the "groups" to "artists" to make it more broad as well?). An "incomplete list" stub thingy (or something similar and more appropriate) should probably be added as well. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowolf_ffd9.html" title="User:Shadowolf">Shadowolf</a> 06:05, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If this is to be a list of <i>all</i> (or even <i>all notable</i>) music groups for the decade, then it should still be deleted, as a decade is a very arbitrary distinction when grouping bands. Rather, they should be grouped by genre (as they are), or possibly country. If it's about <i>influences</i>, then it's a predictory article, as you cannot verify that something has been an influence until some time has passed. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 08:27, Mar 1, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, then I guess it can be renamed to rock/pop groups of 2000 or something along those lines then, if we're taking on a genre distinction. That'd mean the other decades would have to go through such change as well. But influence is of course not the emphasis here at all, but rather what groups have come out and reached a level of significant fame within the decade, I believe. I don't find it too arbitrary at all. If an artist has a label, and are a fairly large topic of discussion among fans, they should be listed. You could say the same thing about bands of other decades - anyone could debate about the importance of any band even to this day ... but the main fact remains as to what decade they broke through to garner some attention. Even a one-hit wonder has some significance. If I were to say "this band was quite majorly popular only within a three year period", I think that's quite enough to keep them in. Of course, some bands might be complicated to group specifically...especially those of that come out within the late 90's but broke through in the 2000s. For those, there might be some debate as to where they should belong (or maybe they could go under both decades). Or we could set some rules to this... either to list the artists based on when they were formed, or by when their first album was released, or so on. But I find no real individual judgements in listing a band that emerged from a certain decade... the fact is that they existed within those times. If we were to wait until 2010... we would still be listing these very artists here as to have emerged within this decade, because they simply just did. It's not like the list is comprised of local bands that are still trying to find a label or anything, after all. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowolf_ffd9.html" title="User:Shadowolf">Shadowolf</a> 09:53, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the list of the band at least, bearing in mind that some drastic expansion is needed, to cover all genres.

<ul>
<li>But the "xxxx's in music" are events and releases for the most part. People like to refer to bands as from a certain decade (ie, "they're an 80's band"), and this keeps it organized. Making a list of bands emerging within a very specific year WOULD be controversial, because the founding of a band, first album, and breakthrough album/song are all ... point of view-ish, and can really be unnecessary information if say, a band had 5 albums but their 4th one was the one that garnered national attention away from the local scene. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowolf_ffd9.html" title="User:Shadowolf">Shadowolf</a> 00:04, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think we should delete it though, mostly because there are the previous decades. But I do think, as you mention, that we should clean up these articles to be more based on certain conditions. This is probably my proposal to this article: <b>(1)</b> I think basing these articles (meaning every decade that is included) on the release of an artists first album or so would be good. Doing it based on when they are formed isn't a good idea IMHO, 'cause there are years ahead after formation where they were unknown and without a record deal, obviously leaving them quite trivial and unimportant for those years. And doing it based on influence and importance would be PoV-ish (others might disagree that the Distillers and Zwan are significant and not "underachievers") <b>(2)</b> Delete first paragraph, and replace it with a note on what conditions the groups in the list shall be based on (being by release of their first album or whatever) <b>(3)</b> Move some of the artists to where they belong (like Modest Mouse), and do so for the others as well (that are in other decades, because there are a couple I noticed suffer the same problem of being in the "wrong" decade. (Still, there are some artists that are hard to categorize, since they come in the late decade...since for example, White Stripes released their first album in 1999... I personally feel it's fine to keep them in the 2000's, although we should mention this criteria in the note as well if we do this). I don't believe it is necessary to keep artists from another decade that are still doing well now (like U2, Cure, etc), within here. People refer to them as a band by the decade they started in, and it would keep the list to a minimal as well. <b>(4-?)</b> The only thing I'm not sure of is if we should keep it as rock/pop/metal/etc specifically (and thus, rename the article titles). Or if we should have other genres like rap and techno in here as well. We could definately divide them up into their respectful genres. <b>(5-?)</b> Also, unsure, since you mention Madonna and Kylie Minogue - should we rename this to "music <i>artists</i>" so as to include solo artists? Especially among rap and R&amp;B, there are A LOT of solo artists (at least among the mainstream), which I think might be a reason for the lack of such artists included. /// Anyway, if this article stays, I think we should set such guidelines to this article. If we are to keep the articles of the other decades, this one will most certainly be revived in the future anyway (and will probably cause the same controversies it does now), so I think it would be good to set everything straight now instead.

Whatever content there was in this page is now gone, and has apparently been merged there, so isn't it time to delete this page now?--<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 18:29, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The page has block compressed revisions, so it's undeletable, but I've tagged it as pending. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 18:31, Feb 27, 2005 (UTC)

<li>There does seem to be some confusion here, of several sorts. Firstly there has never been a page at "A Heinlein Trio". Secondly, <a href="../../../a/_/h/A_Heinlein_Trio_afb5.html" title="A Heinlein Trio">A Heinlein Trio</a>, the page under discussion both here and on <a href="../../../a/_/h/Talk%7EA_Heinlein_Trio_06f7.html" title="Talk:A Heinlein Trio">Talk:A Heinlein Trio</a>, has significant history, and can't be simply deleted if the text has been copied elsewhere. That's why <i>merge and delete</i> is <b>not</b> a valid vote. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 20:14, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How on earth is merge and delete not a valid vote? Merge the current content, delete the page... this is... fairly sensible... Yes. The history gets lost. Hence merge and delete being a different vote from merge and redirect. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 20:18, Feb 27, 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>(Sigh) Yes, that's another puzzling thing. The decision seems to have been <i>merge and redirect</i> anyway, so how does deletion even arise? But see <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Commenting_on_a_listing_for_deletion" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Commenting on a listing for deletion</a> and a new page I've created at <a href="../../../m/e/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EMerge_and_delete_fd80.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Merge and delete">Wikipedia talk:Merge and delete</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 23:59, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: <b>Merge and delete</b> is not an allowable vote in almost all circumstances because it violates the attribution requirement of GFDL.

The redirect at <a href="../../../a/_/h/A_Heinlein_Trio_afb5.html" title="A Heinlein Trio">A Heinlein Trio</a> (which I restored, in accordance with the previous VfD vote) is not a suitable candidate for VfD, it should go to <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_deletion_955c.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion">Wikipedia:redirects for deletion</a>.

<p><b>Reason I recommended this article for VFD:</b> This article is an unnecessary disambiguation. First off, the University of Miami is not known as "Miami U", it is known as <i>UM</i>, <i>UofM</i> or <i>Miami</i> informally. Only Miami University is known informally as <i>Miami U</i>. Secondly, both the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Miami_4499.html" title="University of Miami">University of Miami</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami_University_faf2.html" title="Miami University">Miami University</a> articles have headers at the top of the page directing readers to the other article. This disambiguation page is inaccurate and unnecessary. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 21:42, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, if <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami_University_faf2.html" title="Miami University">Miami University</a> is known by this name, then just <b>redirect</b> this to there.

<li>Because I recommended it. Do we need redirects for nicknames? I doubt people would look for nicknames if they are looking for information on either institution.
