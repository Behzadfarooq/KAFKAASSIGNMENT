<dd>To be honest I don't care one way or the other on this particular game, the point about the almost universal lack of sources for drinking games due to their nature is a problem that needs a general discussion.

<li><b>Comment</b> But surely all drinking games are in the category of 'Here is something that someone just made up' as I have already stated, by there very nature they are made up by drunken people in pubs. You have to consider the value of the whole drinking game article. If you are going to attempt to document or describe a phenomena such as Pub sports you kind of have to accept that they are just made up by people and played. Now that seems to contravene <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> because it fits closely to the description but the sense of that article is more like 'Don't just include stuff that you have just made up to get it on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>'. My guess is this game was made up and people played it long before Wikipedia or even the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_wide_web.html" title="World wide web">world wide web</a> existed and thus is a justifiable. --Montpelier42 19:59, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete this particular one</b> and keep any that are of actual notability -- and most of the ones that are, will have become so from their adaptation to other environs. I regret the characterization as being necessarily played or invented by the inebriated. Some of these very games will be played better by the relatively sober. This particular game seems invented for the purpose of justifying a pub crawl. Some others probably are, and some are for the purpose of encouraging drinking in one place, and some for more general purposes.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:20, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> DGG's point is a ridiculous argument. Drinking games are not made notable because you can also play them whilst sober! This discussion is really get a faint moral whiff about it. May I remind you all that it is the job of an encyclopedia to describe phenomena not judge them.--Montpelier42 08:26, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, Montpelier 42 makes the only valid point. Remove all drinking games or accept that they are all developed and spread and modified and improved constantly by people in pubs. And the very purpose of them is to get drunk. I've played this game more or less exactly how it's described in the article and a great laugh it was too! And why does DGG think that a pub crawl needs justifying anyway? It is a pub crawl and should definitely be linked to the Pub Crawl page.Sandbed7 21:31, 4 April 2007 (UTC)sandbed7
