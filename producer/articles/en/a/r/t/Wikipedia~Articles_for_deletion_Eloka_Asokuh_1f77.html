<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b>, note - this underlines how tricky a multiple listing can be. Unless subjects are identical (which does not describe a group of footballers from different clubs and countries) the results tend to be hard to read. This should not prejudice subsequent debates where single players from this nomination are relisted individually. For that reason I'll decline to place this result on the talk pages of all but the main nominee. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 17:42, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Wikiproject on football states, write articles on all notable players in each country. These players are deemed notable. Living in Ireland and fervently following the football season I know personally that these players are actual players and certainly meet the notability requirments. Again, people who nominate such articles are, for me the scourge of this site, possibly more so than Trolls. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyannus_bbc6.html" title="User:Ryannus">Ryannus</a> 19:27, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Overlooking the personal attack, I should probably expand on my reasons for nomination. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> regards as notable "Sportspeople who have played in a fully professional league". As far as I am aware, the top division of the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_of_Ireland_2fb5.html" title="Football League of Ireland">Football League of Ireland</a> is not fully professional. Some of the bigger teams are professional, but the league as a whole is not fully professional. The notability of the <i>clubs</i> is not in question; this AfD is concerned solely with players. Media coverage regarding some of these players is mentioned above. If <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources were <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cited</a> within these articles to establish notability beyond doubt, then I would be happy to withdraw some or all of these nominations.</dd>
<dd>With regards to some points made by others above:
<ul>
<li>Finn Harps have played in the UEFA Cup, but in the 1970s. None of these players have played in European competition as far as I have been able to ascertain.</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/e/r/Fergal_Harkin_5629.html" title="Fergal Harkin">Fergal Harkin</a> did not play make any appearances for the Leicester first team.</li>
<li>Comparisons to <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaelic_football.html" title="Gaelic football">Gaelic football</a> are irrelevant, the best Irish <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football (soccer)</a> players play professionally. Besides, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> makes specific provision for mainly amateur sports. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldelpaso_61eb.html" title="User:Oldelpaso">Oldelpaso</a> 18:46, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep:</b> Wikipedia's test for notability states:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played ... at the highest level in mainly amateur sports or other competitive activities that are themselves considered notable..."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Although the team of most of these players currently rests in the First Division, all of these players have been, or are, members of a team at the highest level of football in the Republic of Ireland - that is, the Premier Division of the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Ireland_c3e4.html" title="League of Ireland">League of Ireland</a> (bar <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Gorman_d6bb.html" title="Anthony Gorman">Anthony Gorman</a>, who played for <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linfield_FC_9737.html" title="Linfield FC">Linfield FC</a> (Northern Irish football's biggest club) and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Crossan_ee7e.html" title="Matthew Crossan">Matthew Crossan</a> as far as I'm aware). The activities are notable without a doubt. The players feature both on national Irish television and local radio regularly.</p>
<p>Furthermore:<br />
<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Mukendi_634b.html" title="Marc Mukendi">Marc Mukendi</a>, who is on loan at <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finn_Harps_e342.html" title="Finn Harps">Finn Harps</a>, is the member of <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derry_City_F.C._783c.html" title="Derry City F.C.">Derry City F.C.</a>, a professional side in the Premier Division, and has representented Ireland at under-age level.

<p>It is hard to fathom how <a href="../../../e/l/o/Eloka_Asokuh_942a.html" title="Eloka Asokuh">Eloka Asokuh</a>'s winning of the under-17 World Cup with Nigeria may be deemed non-notable.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fergal_Harkin_5629.html" title="Fergal Harkin">Fergal Harkin</a> may have represented <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemian_FC_b5ce.html" title="Bohemian FC">Bohemian FC</a> in European competition, and possibly <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Mohan_ab06.html" title="Tom Mohan">Tom Mohan</a> a few seasons ago when he was with Derry City.

<li><b>Keep all</b> Finn Harps is a semi-professional club which only recently played in the top level of Irish football. Removing references like this will help give the impression that all Irish football is played in England. Fergal Harkin is an active member of the first team squad of Bohemian FC, and one of the foremost wingers in Ireland. Proposing his article for deletion in particular reveals an alarming level of ignorance of the game, and in my view this should inform any decision. To be honest, I don't understand the motivation of the proposal to delete. Bohsnews 14:03, 18 December 2006 (UTC)Bohsnews</li>
