<p>Company with Eur30m turnover, wholly owned subsidiaries in several European countries, produces CRM software and is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. I undeleted this a few days ago after what I regarded as an inadequate AfD: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_SuperOffice_1092.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/SuperOffice">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/SuperOffice</a>. Apparently the feeling was that it didn't have enough google hits! Since there is some concern about my unusual action in undeleting I've decided to relist.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well of course I think it should be a <b>keep</b>.

<li>I vote <b>Keep</b> because it seems notable compared to other articles we have. Note however that this company does not meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> which says a ranking such as Forbes 500 would qualify but just being publicly traded would not; and I couldn't find any media coverage. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_20.html" title="January 20">01-20</a>&#160;04:10<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></i></span>

<li><b>Comment</b> The Forbes 500 is an annual listing of the top 500 AMERICAN companies produced by Forbes Magazine. I have no idea if this particular company is American or not, but why are we basing notability on an American list in the first place? Your average Venezualan company (it seems to me) are likely to fail simply because they dont appear on this list? Or am I reading this all wrong? <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 09:20, 20 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I said "<b>such as</b> Forbes 500". I did my research; I know it is a Norwegian company and I know Forbes is American.

<li>Read the press release. Those words you are reading in quotes are from Microsoft's CRM manager, not SuperOffice. Microsoft is an active partner in the deal.

<li>Sorry, Tony, you're incorrect here.

<li>Avriette, I've cited a press release in which Microsoft's own CRM manager actively promoted SuperOffice. It may be generally true that this is a passive relationship, but in this case there is activity on both sides. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 05:05, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>FTSE is London; this company is on Oslo. No way a company with market cap &lt; 100 million USD is on a stock index. (The #100 company on FTSE 100, <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yell_Group_866e.html" title="Yell Group">Yell Group</a>, has market cap of 7 billion USD.) The WP:CORP criteria are VERY high, I doubt half the companies that currently have Wikipedia articles meet it. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_20.html" title="January 20">01-20</a>&#160;11:54<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></i></span>
<ul>
<li>Actually, the WP:CORP criteria are quite low. <i>Any</i> kind of independent published works will do, as long as they are more than simple directory listings or incidental mentions. Items sourced from the company itself, such as its press releases or things published by the company on its own web site, don't count, however. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:37, 20 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>... so <a href="http://www.nteraction-crm.com/technical%20resources/FAQ.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.nteraction-crm.com/technical%20resources/FAQ.htm" rel="nofollow">this SuperOffice FAQ</a> written by a reseller counts, albeit that it is about the product, not the company. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:21, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I suggest that if our guidelines exclude a company listed on the Norwegian Stock Exchange with an appreciable known turnover, they're probably rather too restrictive. I agree that there's little in the way of independent literature about this company, but that is not to say that it is negligible. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:45, 20 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Only editors who haven't actually read our guidelines in the first place would think that our guidelines contain any such exclusions. Editors who <i>have</i> read our guidelines will have read footnotes #4 and #6 to them, conversely. Editors who approach Wikipedia from the direction of "Wikipedia should include individual articles for all companies with turnover X/that are traded on Y" will find <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellowikis.html" title="Yellowikis">Yellowikis</a> or some other directory of companies more in line with their goals. I strongly recommend instead the approach of actually performing research to find non-trivial independently sourced published works, of the sort that <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> has below. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:52, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The irony of that baseless argument is that this company <i>satisfies</i> the "oversimplified notability guidelines", as pointed out below by editors who actually took the tack of addressing the subject of the article and performing some research to see whether it satisfied the guidelines, rather than the tack of attacking the guidelines themselves and simply assuming that the company would fail to satisfy them without apparently putting any effort at all into checking that. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:52, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. As mentioned on deletion review a company with only 180 employees someone would have to present some serious evidence that it is an influential company beyond being listed on an exchange. (apparently it's a lot easier to go public in Norway, I don't think 30 million in revenue would get you very far on a larger exchange.) My back of the envelope calculation is with only 500 million people in the world workforce there would be 2.7 million potential companies this size. That is certainly not feasible nor a good use of our time currently to have articles on companies that size. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 22:18, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Look I don't have an ax to grind here, it wouldn't be the end of the world if we kept this (or deleted it). Your innapropriate repeated undeletion out of process is besides the point of whether this should be kept.

<li>See <a href="../../../s/a/p/SAP_AG_9f43.html" title="SAP AG">SAP AG</a>; it's an absolutely huge software house that specialises in workplace software integration.

<li>It's amusing to see some editors criticising the "oversimplified notability guidelines" when this company actually <i>satisfies</i> the primary <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> criterion. It's saddening to see that some editors think that locating independent secondary sources and adding them to articles is something that they only need to do in extreme cases, to satisfy "policy sticklers". The coverage presented by <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> appears to be non-trivial and not sourced from the company itself. Although it is not really in-depth coverage, such as can be found for <a href="../../../h/e/w/Hewlett-Packard_9234.html" title="Hewlett-Packard">Hewlett-Packard</a>, with the additional support of the aforementioned FAQ this company appears to satisfy the primary WP:CORP criterion. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:52, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
