<p>It is a POV fork if I ever saw one. The whole purpose is try to distinguish anarcho-capitalism as something other than a legitimate form of anarchism. Even the title implies that anarcho-capitalism is not a type of anarchism. There is already a <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticisms_of_anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Criticisms of anarcho-capitalism">Criticisms of anarcho-capitalism</a> article, so why the need for another POV fork?

<dd>The degree to which this is untrue, or rather insufficient, is the problem this article was (painstakingly, I might add) written to address. There are two arguments against accepting anarcho-capitalism as anarchistic, which are similar to why one might not call <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Zimbabwe_69f9.html" title="Politics of Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a> a democracy despite the claims of the <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zanu_PF_5b54.html" title="Zanu PF">Zanu PF</a>. Firstly, the "an-cap is an oxymoron" argument states that because capitalism (and in particular an-cap) supports the authority of ownership absolutely what would be achieved under an-cap wouldn't be a lack of a state but a series of private states, thereby a non-anarchy. The other argument is to point out that anarchism is more than a concept but a historical practice and a body of theory, one being entirely, incontrovertably anti-capitalist. This article sets out to address this, and shouldn't be deleted but made the cornerstone of the WP approach to an-cap-as-anarchism. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Intentions_d6f9.html" title="User:Good Intentions"><b>G</b><small>ood</small><b>I</b><small>ntentions</small></a><sup><a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGood_Intentions_ebc9.html" title="User talk:Good Intentions">talk</a></sup> 06:07, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> If the article is supposed be about whether anarcho-capitalism's claim that it's a form of anarchism is a false claim, then why isn't the article called "Arguments over whether anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism"? As it stands now, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_and_anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism">Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism</a> can be about anything, and that's probably what explains how incoherent the article is. There is no hope for the article. Delete it and move some of the criticisms to the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticisms_of_anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Criticisms of anarcho-capitalism">Criticisms of anarcho-capitalism</a> article. What is the point? To show that anarcho-capitalism is not like other forms of anarchism so that it will be concluded that it is not a form of anarchism? Since when does a form of anarchism have to be like other forms of anarchism? This article has a fundamental POV problem that cannot be fixed.

<dd>"If the article is supposed be about whether anarcho-capitalism's claim that it's a form of anarchism is a false claim". It isn't this - it is a discussion on that claim but especially on the relationship between the an-cap movement and the (universally socialistic) anarchism movement that predates and rejects an-cap. It is concerned only with an-cap-as-anarchism, and is not a discussion of the criticisms of an-cap at all. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Intentions_d6f9.html" title="User:Good Intentions"><b>G</b><small>ood</small><b>I</b><small>ntentions</small></a><sup><a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGood_Intentions_ebc9.html" title="User talk:Good Intentions">talk</a></sup> 06:07, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>"Since when does a form of anarchism have to be like other forms of anarchism?" When the point under discussion makes the two mutually exclusive, like the support for capitalism in this case.

For it to be a POV fork would require an Anarcho-capitalism as anarchism and Anarcho-capitalism as non-anarchism page or equivalents, instead both are discussed on this single, informative page. I'm sure every who has commented on this has had a lot of exposure to this type of argument, and having an article on that argument is quite necessary, and especially not a POV fork! --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Intentions_d6f9.html" title="User:Good Intentions"><b>G</b><small>ood</small><b>I</b><small>ntentions</small></a><sup><a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGood_Intentions_ebc9.html" title="User talk:Good Intentions">talk</a></sup> 06:07, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> An article dealing with discussion of one particular problem is fine when that problem is widely discussed in literature.

<li><b>Comment</b> It looks like a useless article to me and I don't really care whether it's deleted or not, but at the very least the title should be changed to something like "Anti-capitalist anarchism and anarcho-capitalism" or "Social anarchism and anarcho-capitalism." The title as it stands now seems to indiciate that Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism are two different things which, in my opinion, they're not. So it's a POV title.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 18:31, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>.

A merge with <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_and_capitalism.html" title="Anarchism and capitalism">Anarchism and capitalism</a> would also be a mistake, since this is a dispute between anarchism and the <i>political philosophy</i> of anarcho-capitalism, not just with the concept of <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> itself.

<li><b>Comment</b> There is no such dispute between anarcho-capitalism and other forms of anarchism in academia. It's simply some editors on Wikipedia debating over it and that's why there shouldn't be an article. You too seem to be assuming that anarcho-capitalism something other than anarchism in your wording that "this is a dispute between anarchism and the political philosophy of anarcho-capitalism." Anarchism is an umbrella term than includes various kinds of anarchism. A debate between anarchism and anarcho-capitalism makes no sense at all and is inherently POV because the POV being pushed is that they're two distinct philosophies. <a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDTC_5378.html" title="User:DTC">DTC</a> 16:18, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Blatantly untrue. Real scholarship on anarchism is rare, most cited works are simply broad works on philosophy and politics that mention without any real analysis what people say. Proper scholarship on anarchism is by anarchists - Chomsky, Peter Marshall, Paul Avrich, Howard Zinn, etc. Proper scholarship on "anarcho"-capitalism is virtually non-existent, aside from its own proponents. It's been nearly 100 years (1910) since one of the most respected works of reference, The Encyclopaedia Britannica, requested that Kropotkin write the section on anarchism because they recognised that the hostility against its ideas blighted virtually all other sources. This remains true, those who truly analyse and document anarchist ideas are anarchists themselves, thus the dispute between anarchism proper and "anarcho"-capitalism is central to the primary academic discussion of anarchism. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 16:31, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Although I can see why some say "just put the contents into CRITICISM of..." I disagree with the POV proclaimers -- because a LOT of the content is not pro- or anti- but instead is just comparing to / contrasting with individualist anarchism (many people equate the two -- see esp. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_and_anarcho-capitalism#Anarcho-capitalism_as_a_form_of_individualist_anarchism" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_and_anarcho-capitalism#Anarcho-capitalism_as_a_form_of_individualist_anarchism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_and_anarcho-capitalism#Anarcho-capitalism_as_a_form_of_individualist_anarchism</a> ) so perhaps THIS article could have any alleged POV content removed/edited, and the rest stay as-is and linked to from the "criticism" article?199.214.27.205 21:51, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This looks like a bad faith nomination to me. If the nomination instead was based on that it gives undue weight to ancap then it would perhaps be another issue. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a> 12:49, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
