<li><b>Keep</b> King is well known in strength training and circles (trains numerous Olympic athletes) and has numerous interviews online.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Google is only returning promotion or self-promotion sites, and clearly a lot of advertisement. Does the status of an <i>highly advertised athlete on the web</i> meets the criterion for notability? None of the big claims about him (apart from the fact that he has a fair web presence by virtue of the advertisement and promotionals) could be verified as fact so far. I have posted a lot of requests to get help expansion of the article. But, so far nothing came up, and there is no reason to believe that something will come up. Delete, then? <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAditya_Kabir_e8b8.html" title="User:Aditya Kabir">Aditya Kabir</a> 04:22, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, Google gives a very rough idea about notability. If someone is certainly notable, then 3rd party sources should be available. Since there isn't probably any systemic bias, Google should at least provide 3rd party sources besides self promotional ones. By the way, please do not vote multiple times.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. I have asked quite a few participants on the bodybuilding projects to substantiate the claims on article, as well as the project talk page. All I got back was assurance that something will come up. Nothing did. There is no reason to believe that anything but more promotional websites will be all that supports the subject. Not verifiable, hardly notable, and remains very much <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fancruft.html" title="Fancruft">fancruft</a>. I tried saving it, and failed.

<li><b>Keep</b> A <b>very quick</b> Google search shows the subject is the author of 3 books in his field and is respected in the field of bodybuilding. He may not be an 'important' athlete by some standards, but he is notable by <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">Wiki standards</a>. I am adding some links. Kind regards, --<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreatwalk_4ed3.html" title="User:Greatwalk">Greatwalk</a> 01:02, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How so? The <b>Wiki standard</b> tells us that the notability criterion shared by many is - <i>A topic is notable if it has been the subject of at least one substantial or multiple non-trivial published works that are reliable and independent of the subject</i> (<a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>). And, that independent sources may not include <i>Self-promotion, autobiography, and product placement are not the routes to having an encyclopaedia article. The published works should be someone else writing about the subject</i> (amazon.com as vendor fairly misses to be an independent source). Besides, the specific notability guideline for biographies tells us that for a general bio the subject should have <i>a credible independent biography</i>, for athletes the subject may be <i>competitors who have played in a fully professional league or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport, or competitors who have played or competed at the highest level in amateur sports</i> (this was claimed of the subject by never verified), and for writers/journalists the subject may be <i>regarded as an important figure or is widely cited by their peers or successors</i> (<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>).

<dd>Sorry about hiding unnecessary information (I didn't delete them, though), but how does the information on where he lives and if he is married adds to his notability? And while you take a postion for keep, please, refrain from removing tags that ask for citation (also, please, refrain from putting back the same weblink twice). Remember, most books are independently published, but are not independently cited. A citation from the vendor of the book makes neither the book nor the author notable. <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAditya_Kabir_e8b8.html" title="User:Aditya Kabir">Aditya Kabir</a> 14:37, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, since I was the only user debating for a delete, I think it was directed against me and my understanding. I am hurt. For one - I never claimed to know anything about the subject. But, that doesn't mean that I don't understand wikipedia notability standards, and I don't understand promotional sites. Unfortunately, I work in an advertising agency (affiliated with <a href="../../../j/w/t/JWT_1d1f.html" title="JWT">JWT</a>) and there is a possibility that while you may know everything about the subject, I may be more knowledgeable about promotional work (though not necessarily so). As long the wikipedia standards of establishing notability is followed I have no problems with the subject. This is not a personal vendetta against a person unknown to me (apart from the fact that he is well advertised). I haver already quoted all the guidelines that stand against the article, and none of the people who know much better than I do have been able to provide anything that meets those criterion (apart from more promotional stuff, including those of a vendor of the book written by the subject). May be I haven't noticed that wikipedia is a democracy now, and AfDs have turned into voting boxes. Sorry, again for all the trouble.
