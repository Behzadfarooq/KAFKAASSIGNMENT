<dd>(Admin hat on) <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">Speedy deletion</a> is only used in clear and uncontroversial cases where it is patently obvious to all that an article is unsuitable for Wikipedia. It can be seen from this AFD discussion that not all contributors believe this to be the case. On more general terms, in any controversial issue, or cases that have drawn a great deal of attention, it is best to allow the discussion to proceed as normal, rather than ending it peremptorily. This avoids any potential claims of abuse, or covering up a situation. If this is closed early, I will block the offender until one minute past the crack of doom. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a> 11:40, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To be perfectly clear, since I feel your remarks were addressed to me, I had no plans to close this discussion. From my understanding of policy, closing of Afds is only done by admins, unless it is non-controversial and patently obvious what the outcome will be. Even then, I always think admins should be the one to do it. I was merely saying that I think this is patently non-notable to anybody who doesn't drink large amounts of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_control.html" title="Mind control">Wiki Kool-Aid</a>. It's also clear (to me, anyway) that this article was not written in good faith. So I was surprised it was not tagged Speedy. But by all means, let the <a href="../../../h/o/i/Hoi_polloi.html" title="Hoi polloi">entire community</a> make the decision. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 12:02, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Within the discussion I have noted an interesting variation, instead of having a Bio about Essjay we could rename the article as proposed above and redirect Essjay to it. That way we don't give the impression that we are hiding something and at the same time take the opinion of those into consideration that simply consider the incident notable, not the person that caused it.

From the edit summary: ‘don't try to delete articles that illustrate vulnerabilities in Wikipedia or people's willingness to commit fraud or mispresentation’. As far as I can tell, it is absolutely, completely, totally irrelevant for any page in main space whether it illustrates these things. Analysis of Wikipedia procedures belongs in user: or wikipedia:, analysis of the human nature at large belongs in psychology journals.

<dd>I agree that it was an early closure. In fact, I think the whole AfD was premature; it's a breaking story, it seems like at the very least a waste of time to delete and merge when we don't even know how far-reaching or persistent the topic will eventually be. In particular I think the ruling of salting for a year is unnecessary and misguided. This isn't Brian Peppers, it is a very legitimate, mainstream news story. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 07:42, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, but as observed, right before your closure two users changes their opinions, and that was with only a few minutes of knowledge about the NYT article.

<li>In this case, a merge is tantamount to a delete, since the Essjay article's text would cease to exist at the article <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essjay.html" title="Essjay">Essjay</a>. It would be merged into one of several other articles. So, purely from a perspective of deciding whether or not to keep the text of the article or turn it into a protected redirect, merge can be associated with "delete". –&#160;<a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELantoka_28a7.html" title="User:Lantoka"><font face="CAC Krazy Legs Bold" color="#0000FF">Lantoka</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../l/a/n/User_talk%7ELantoka_f8aa.html" title="User talk:Lantoka">talk</a>)</small> 09:46, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am concerned about the manner in which policy is being ignored on this AfD. Our policies should be taken more seriously than some wikiphilosophy essays, especially in times of controversy. I also just took a look at IAR for the first time in eight months, and found that IAR has become a policy. I'm surprised people haven't exploited that more often. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">er</a></b> 01:22, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I was leaning towards this being a "point" when I raised the question earlier; the creation of this article was unnecessarily disruptive to the objective of writing an encyclopedia. It could have been adequately covered on Wikinews until it was clear that the subject was notable, and the resulting wikipedia article would have been a better article for the delay.

<dd>while it stayed internal to wikipedia, there were a few people who asked for Essjays explanation and it would have remained an internal discussion (out of project). However, once the media go hold of the story, it became a relivant entry to the encyclopedia. The fact he had false information on his user page is of little importance. The fact he used it to back up his edits is of great importance and the fact he used it in an interview is of huge importance.</dd>

<p>Essjay's edits are a sideshow. The wider worry is he was sent to a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist by Wikipedia management for an interview, represented his MUD CV to her as genuine and was later hired as an employee of Wikipedia's for-profit spinoff. The lid blew off, so to speak, when an acknowledged (and by most accounts, abrasive and baiting) enemy of Jimbo tipped off the New Yorker that the CV was a fraud. Knowing Brandt was responsible, Wales initially blew it off as more trivial meatspace trolling but this was indeed a botch, which Wales later admitted. Most of us feel bad for Essjay but he got sucked into Wikipedia's MUD side and truth be told, Wikipedia's leadership sent him out into the wild with nothing but lavish praise when all Essjay had to offer the meatspace world was his MUD avatar CV, a dodgy thing even at Wikipedia and outright fraud in the real world. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwen_Gale_1eec.html" title="User:Gwen Gale">Gwen Gale</a> 13:41, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't care what Essjay does or doesn't do as long as it does not reflect on the project. What everybody seems to ignore is that there are many people who actually pay for this being done (no matter if you call it donation or rear-end-of-a-truck) and they now must wonder what the hell we are doing with their money and what kind of characters escaped from the Loony-Toones are going about spending it. This is the second major scandal ... if there is another one I wonder who is going to pay for the servers this runs on (if we get to the third one). <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> 15:14, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am a relative newcomer to Wikipedia editing, so am not as clued up on all the policy as perhaps some others are. However, during the AfD discussion for the 'Essjay saga' article, I saw a few people propose that we should not have this article as it contravenes <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a>. From reading WP:SELF however, its clear that it is a guideline on style, rather than substance. That is, it is concerned with the way an article is written rather than the contents of the article. I don't think we could delete an article because it breaches WP:SELF, or rather, if an article did breach WP:SELF would it not just be a case of re-writing the article to remove any self-referential lanuguage? WP:SELF itself states that "Wikipedia can, of course, write about Wikipedia"...."in a neutral tone, without specifically implying that the article in question is being read on — or is a part of — Wikipedia". It appears to me therefore, that WP:SELF would not be grounds for deletion of the article, and could only really be evoked to alter the style in which the article is written. Any other thoughts on this? Malbolge 14:53, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, so long as the article is supported only by qualified and verifiable non WP sources, there is no self-reference. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwen_Gale_1eec.html" title="User:Gwen Gale">Gwen Gale</a> 14:55, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a> is often thrown around by editors who like to spout WP:ALPHABET without actually reading the policy/guideline. <span style="font-family:Papyrus; letter-spacing:-1.2px;font-weight:normal; background:#F0F8FF;white-space:nowrap;cursor:help;">—<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">M</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 15:19, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</span>

<dl>
<dd>Yes. However, it is so important to patrol the article and make sure the body of the text is supported only by references to external, verifiable sources. For example, even a quote of Jimbo, although readily available on his talk page or in its history, is acceptable only if it has been published elsewhere (for example, by a news outlet, no blogs or personal web sites) and then referenced from there back into the article. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwen_Gale_1eec.html" title="User:Gwen Gale">Gwen Gale</a> 19:01, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>LBy "published elsewhere" I assume that you mean "referenced definitively from elsewhere", right? Direct links to primary sources are good, provided that the primary sources have been analyzed by secondary sources to the extent that they are notable. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracenotes_686d.html" title="User:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">Grace</font><font color="#000">notes</font></a><sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGracenotes_98ea.html" title="User talk:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">T</font></a></sup> § 22:32, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Going back to the original point, I agree. There is a tendency on behalf of editors to inflate the importance of events related to Wikipedia. However, there is a counter-tendency to do the exact opposite, often citing <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a> as reason to avoid mentioning people who are notable <i>because</i> of Wikipedia. If we are to be an encyclopaedia, we need to judge these people <i>objectively</i>, as if they are unrelated to us. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 22:38, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The existing policy works: If it's not notable, there won't anything to cite from independent, verifiable sources. If it is notable, there is no need to reference WP content. The only worries are caused by editors who don't read the policies (or worse, cite the acronyms only to intimidate and game the system with no heed to what the policies truly say). <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwen_Gale_1eec.html" title="User:Gwen Gale">Gwen Gale</a> 22:43, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Up until 24 hours ago it was a very NPOV article that discussed the facts of the event rather than Essjay as a person. Unfortunately, with over 50 edits in 20 minutes it became too much to manage and I (and I'm sure others) gave up trying to restore the page to NPOV. I'm hoping that it will calm down and can be restored so that it doesn't focus on the person and gets back its NPOV. Unfortunately, It seems too many people are wanting to edit that article at the moment. I would hope the article stays once things calm down a bit as I've spent many hours trying to make it a worthwhile entry.

<dd>I don't follow. Making it nice and neutral would include showing the other side of the story - all of the good things Essjay has done - or at least that is what I think. But that would probably being a blatant <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a> violation... or maybe not, as I might not understand correctly. Focusing on the event rather than the person seems like an improvement, but it seems to me to be a problem that none of the secondary sources talk much about Essjay's positive contributions. In any case, I appreciate your efforts, I am just rather pessimistic on the whole issue. — <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armed Blowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>) 00:15, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My stupid brain misses the fine distinction. *not sarcastic.

<dd>Nobody said they were so far apart and nobody said that the article has to mention Essjay in as far the context does not require it. We should be very careful that this does not end in Essjay bashing, witch hunt or burning heretics on the stake. There is a fine line that we should not pass. What we cannot do is to go on to the next point on the agenda pretending nothing has happened and trying to delete an article because WE DON'T LIKE IT. And surely we cannot adhere to the first reaction of <i>the whole chain of command</i> (fine irony) that nothing has happened and everything is fine as it is <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> 00:37, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Saving Essjay some emotional pain doesn't seem like a bad reason to delete the article to me. Essjay did do a lot for the encyclopaedia, so it might not be a bad idea to return the favour a little. I completely agree that Essjay-bashing is not-good... but if we are going to have it, we may as well say good things about Essjay too. — <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armed Blowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>) 00:47, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I personally have nothing against that, but then we would have to go back to a biographical article called Essjay and I hate to see the reaction to that. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> 00:49, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The current title "Essjay controversy", does imply that there are at least two sides to the issue, doesn't it? (If it doesn't, that would probably make it a <a href="../../../f/o/r/WP%7EFORK_4e79.html" title="WP:FORK">POV Fork</a>, but I don't think that's the case.) So "the good things about Essjay" would be one side of the controversy, wouldn't it? Of course, the secondary source's lack of interest in Essjay would probably mean some blatant <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a> violations would need to be committed to get the positive things in there. On the other hand, self-published sources are allowed in articles about themselves, so if we interpret the Essjay controversy as being an article about Wikipedia, we could cite ourselves, right? Okay, I'm stretching it, but if we are going to cite bad sources, we may as well be blatant about it. — <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armed Blowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>) 00:58, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
