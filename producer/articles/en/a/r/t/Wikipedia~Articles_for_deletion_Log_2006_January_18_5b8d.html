<dd>This is not the type of article you speedily delete. The fact is, the snobbery of many Bucharestians is a well-known thing. It is an inter-cultural phenomenon to be documented, but presented in NPOV with sources. Alexander 007 17:56, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Also, the idiocy of George W. Bush is a "well-known thing". I don't think an article named George W.

<dd>The title can be changed: "Perceived Bucharest snobbery". Think of something, <i>Candide</i>. The George W. Bush analogy is imprecise, as that involves an <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individual.html" title="Individual">individual</a>. Straw-man. Alexander 007 18:05, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I still think the analogy is improper, because we know who each individual U.S. president was; but here, it is a faceless, nameless mass---aside from some specific examples which may be brought forward. Alexander 007 18:16, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>At the very least, this should be covered somewhere in Wikipedia, once the sources are brought forward, if not in this specific article.

<dd>I'm a bit curious about that myself. When you say "all upcoming movies", does that include movies for which there is no available information about cast, director, writers, plot, or anything else that an encyclopedia entry about a movie would normally include?

<p>huh, I did not think I have to make a vfd for a simple redirect, sometimes WP is way too bureaucratic&#160;:-) anyway, the reasons I wanted this to be deleted are these: 1) the name <i>vÃ¡r</i> simply means <i>castle</i> in Hungarian; the current redirect (leading to only 1 castle) is inaccurate, there should be at least a disamb page or a "List of castles in Hungary" page, but there are hundreds of castles and castle ruins in Hungary, and right now I don't see any chance that the majority of them will have articles soon (there are articles about 3, I think); 2) it's not likely anyone will search for a Hungarian term in an English wikipedia; as far as I know English names are preferred.</p>

<p>Hoax, as far as I can tell; Deliceto is a real place, but Delicetese gets less than 10 Google hits, and some of the definitions seem absurd. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatamorphism_4920.html" title="User:Catamorphism">Catamorphism</a> 01:31, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I tried a number of different ways to find out anything about it through Google, with no luck. Only Google hits are references to this article, word-for-word, and one use on a foreign language page which I'm pretty sure is a misspelling of "delicatese". As a former Toronto resident it isn't familiar at all. - <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDharmabum420_04df.html" title="User:Dharmabum420">Dharmabum420</a> 01:42, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do not delete</b>: As the primary author of this article, I can definitively state that Dr. Wile is quite notable inside the Christian homeschooling community. His textbooks are used by many families as their means of science instruction, and easily reaches an audience greater than 5,000 people (as per Wikipedia's "notoriety" policy). If his significance as an author is related to the number of textbooks he has published, there are currently ten; including three Advanced Placement courses. And lastly, I can assure you that this article is not autobiographical.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../l/a/a/User%7ELAATi88_40f1.html" title="User:LAATi88">LAATi88</a> 18:09, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What's wrong with posting articles about your own projects when all of the information is relevant? The rules of wikipedia state that creating a page about yourself and your projects are unorthodox, but that it is allowed when the information is relevant.

<li><b>Delete</b>, real but non-notable product. There are literally millions of software "products", most of which have been discussed only in press releases and catalogs.

I'll change my vote to "Keep" if evidence of "yes" answers is provided. (Article doesn't even claim any notability, let alone demonstrate it.) Shareware almost never meets WP's inclusion criteria.

<li>As I was a part of that, thanks. Although while working on it I started wondering if maybe this should just be a subsection of <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_diaspora.html" title="Irish diaspora">Irish diaspora</a>. I added a bit about unique historical properties of Catholicism in Ireland itself to differentiate from that some, and there are other differences. So I guess not as "Irish Catholic" is in an odd sense an ethnicity as much as a religious term. I remember some Irish-American movie where the Dad smacked his kid for saying something about Catholicism and the kid said "But Dad you're an atheist" and in response the Dad said "Just because I stopped believing in God, doesn't mean I stopped being an Irish Catholic" or some such.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li>Retracted vote after consideration of Matthead's comment below. Theoretically the various language Wikipedias are supposed to be one thing in a choice of languages, not sources of substantially different content. If the "pl" and "de" wikipedias have documented a real controversy that extends beyond a couple of nutcases, and legitimate references can show its importance outside purely local talk and WP and mirrors, then the "en" version should have at least a bit of encyclopedic overview. I agree with nominator that such "controversies" are not generally WP material. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 02:50, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This issue seems to have a centuries-old history and it's very unlikely that Wikipedia can finally solve it in a way that makes everybody happy - or is everybody happy yet? Trying to ignore the problem by deleting the separate nationality article moves the battle back into the main article or its talk were it is even uglier. There's a separate article in Polish Wikipedia as well as in the German. The best solution is to make and keep the Copernicus article itself nice, neutral and calm, and to sort out the nationality article rather than erase it. This seems to be unacceptable for at least two persons, though - my attempt to put some structure to it was tagged <i>utterly pointless</i> and rewarded by this deletion tag. There are already examples in history where attempts for deletion were considered "the Final solution" ... --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthead_5c8c.html" title="User:Matthead">Matthead</a> 01:40, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I note Matthead is German, and the article is basically about whether Copernicus was German or Polish. Wikipedia, an encyclopedia, does not exist to pronounce what is correct and what is not. I don't think what nationality Copernicus is or was is something absolutely fundemental to why he is notable as a person, therefore there should not be a separate article on the subject.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. The final tally was 42 delete, 18 keep, 11 merge. I discounted 8 votes (7K/1D) for being either from newbies or not having real reasons (e.g., "it exists" -- my big toe exists but it doesn't deserve an article). Even if I had kept them, we'd have 43â25, or 63% delete. Also note that most merge votes were "merge or delete." This really should be a merge IMHO, which should satisfy the inclusionist bloc who don't want to see the content deleted. Really, we're talking 44Kb for a list of people? The vote stacking also really disturbs me. I noticed that a number of the people in the inclusionist bloc all voted on the same AfD discussions, all right in a row, which strongly implies they were here only because of their wikiphilosophy (still, I didn't discount their votes). <span style="font-family:Verdana;"><b><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color: #33C;">howch</span></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0F0"><i>e</i></span></a><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color:#33C">ng</span></a></b> <small>{<a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">chat</a>}</small></span> 18:32, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's relevant to <i>his vote</i>, which had a rational about the notability of the school but suggested renaming it, which strongly suggests he thought he was voting on whether there should be any article about it at all. The other lists aren't relevant because if we take out the deadwood (i.e., the red links and the links that are going to go red and the people only marginally connected to the mill), there's hardly anything left. Plenty of schools have a lot of notable graduates. The mill you're wasting your time at?

<p>"...Several weeks ago, JCSM (Jesus Christ Saves Ministries) noticed this trend and created a new ministry called Wiki4Christ. It's an organization that exists to make sure Christians have a united and represented voice on Wikipedia. As you may imagine, unbelievers also edit there and they actively try to silence Christian input and revert our contributions; especially Christian biographies! This is where we need you, now.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the entries below were nominated for deletion. This means there will be a vote on whether or not to keep them. Please come and let your voice be heard! This endeavor will only take 10-15 minutes and it will be something you can do with your online time that will further the kingdom of God. Wouldn't you like to vote to keep Christian entries on Wikipedia?..."</p>
<p>He goes on to give links to all of his articles that are noted for deletion.

<dd><b>abstain</b> I don't know enough about this here yet so I'm abstaining for now. But it seems to me that alot of these articles here, the bio's I mean, pass into the notable stage and are verifiable. I'm not a christian by a long shot and I have issues with fundamentalism in a big way but that doesn't mean these folks don't deserve to be here. The criteria for me here is, "is this article useful as a way to initiate research" and clearly it is. If I was interested in, say, the history of baptist thinking or wanted to make a wash list of baptist notable, I could use this as a start. A PERFECT WIKI ARTICLE in my opion.</dd>

<li><b>Question Comment</b> - How many people are here because Gastrich emailed all the inclusionists on the vain hope that you automatically vote to keep articles? An argument for delete can be made that should be acceptable to inclusionists - put the valuable intellectual content where it belongs, in the LBU article, and no content is lost. I know that there are several such inclusionists here, although since Gastrich used email instead of talk pages, there's no Wiki trail of proof like there is for his wikichrist crowd. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarvestdancer_474b.html" title="User:Harvestdancer">Harvestdancer</a> 15:55, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I already did. Unlike <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html" title="Harvard">Harvard</a>, LBU is not as significant an institution of higher learning. Some schools warrant their own page of notable alumni simply because of the size of such a list. This page, on the other hand, can easily be included in the LBU article without any loss of content and therefore, by mergist principles, does not warrant a separate page.

Its an american institution, which is why it listed on the english wikipedia. On the Swedish wikipedia, alot of small schools have their own entries. None complains. So no, thats not a good reason. There are no other articles with these names, so there's no name conflict. There's no nothing, except silly notions about the standard of education on the school.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I was brought here, like many others by Wiggins2, or as he wants to be called, "Wiggie". I think we shouldn't be so quick to shoot him down, as I, &amp; probably many others, are grateful for his post to draw our attention to this subject. I wouldn't mind if the other "side" did the same. But we cannot ignore the fact that this is defintely going to open wikipedia into two halves; Those who want to keep. Those who don't. I.E. Christians, &amp; others. However, this should not be about religion. I would be ashamed of the christians on here if they only voted to keep the articles because they were christian orientated. This should strictly be business as usual, even though it does seem strange an editor would nominate so many christian articles. Maybe a hidden agenda? If an article's crap, then it should be deleted. Being an inclusionist, I will probably keep the most mundane article. However, the list of notable people list is like many others, &amp; should not be here. To do so would be obvious bias. I ask everyone to not be drawn in with a strict "You're wrong, I'm right" situation, but be open &amp; find a way to keep peaceful.... <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 04:06, 22 January 2006 (UTC).

<li><b>Rebuttal</b>: Everything above was posted to skew the voting and make people turn against me and bias their viewpoint of the nomination and the entry. It's a pretty sick tactic. It shows they care little about the actual strength of the entry; which should be the only thing considered. Since the "warnings" have been posted, some people have even said that they've voted <i>only</i> because of the alleged misconduct. Consequently, they and the people who are engaging in this witchhunt should be ashamed of themselves. They've done irreparable damage to their integrity and to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 01:02, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. If he's writen stuff then he should at least have a little slice of wikipedia? I mean, Wikipedia is huge, everyone can have a share can't they? Everyone thinks that because he isn't in the news, that he shouldn't be included in wikipedia, the so called "sum of all human knowledge". But how do we know he isn't influencial? He effects hundreds with his words..... <b>Further Note</b>: I was brought here, like many others by Wiggins2, or as he wants to be called, "Wiggie". I think we shouldn't be so quick to shoot him down, as I, &amp; probably many others, are grateful for his post to draw our attention to this subject. I wouldn't mind if the other "side" did the same. But we cannot ignore the fact that this is defintely going to open wikipedia into two halves; Those who want to keep. Those who don't. I.E. Christians, &amp; others. However, this should not be about religion. I would be ashamed of the christians on here if they only voted to keep the articles because they were christian orientated. This should strictly be business as usual, even though it does seem strange an editor would nominate so many christian articles. Maybe a hidden agenda? If an article's crap, then it should be deleted. Being an inclusionist, I will probably keep the most mundane article. However, the list of notable people list is like many others, &amp; should not be here. To do so would be obvious bias. I ask everyone to not be drawn in with a strict "You're wrong, I'm right" situation, but be open &amp; find a way to keep peaceful.... <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 04:27, 22 January 2006 (UTC).

<li><b>Rebuttal</b>: Everything above was posted to skew the voting and make people turn against me and bias their viewpoint of the nomination and the entry. It's a pretty sick tactic. It shows they care little about the actual strength of the entry; which should be the only thing considered. Since the "warnings" have been posted, some people have even said that they've voted <i>only</i> because of the alleged misconduct. Consequently, they and the people who are engaging in this witchhunt should be ashamed of themselves. They've done irreparable damage to their integrity and to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 01:01, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Very untrue. The comments posted above were to question the strength of your argument, as per <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> it is prohibited to use a sockpuppet to create a illusion of a broader support for your side of the argument. Your "campaigning" comes from you and your sockpuppet, and you even admitted that you use sockpuppetry to aid yourself in AfD. <a href="../../../s/y/c/User%7ESycthos_ff74.html" title="User:Sycthos">Sycthos</a><a href="../../../s/y/c/User_talk%7ESycthos_0fbd.html" title="User talk:Sycthos"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 05:46, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>This is a complete lie. I never admitted using sockpuppets to "aid myself in AfD"; nor have I <b>ever</b> done this, even when I <i>did</i> use sockpuppets in my first days in Wikipedia!</li>
<li>If you look at the history, an admin checked IPs and confirmed that I never did this to sway a vote and I still never have done this.</li>
<li>You need to get your facts straight and show that you care for the folks at Wikipedia. This atrocious lie/accusation at the top of many pages is inexcusable and I'd like an apology; and I think the good people that you may have influenced with this lie should receive an apology as well. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 04:41, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I acknowledge your attempts to evangelize Wikipedia, but your argument will not stand without a statement disputing against it. First of all, if your statements remain true, then why is <a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiggins2_f047.html" title="User:Wiggins2">Wiggins2</a> blocked 24 hours for "external campaigning group spamming talk pages to pack Wikipedia debates"? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Daddy_576d.html" title="User:Big Daddy">User:Big Daddy</a> is another one of your main sockpuppets. If you look at its <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Big_Daddy_045d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Big Daddy">contribution history</a>, there is no doubt that you have violated <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> for using sockpuppets to create an "illusion for a broader support" for your position.</li>
<li>I do not appreciate your constant and veiled use of <a href="../../../e/u/p/Euphemism.html" title="Euphemism">euphemisms</a> and words/phrases with a slightly more negative connotation when used against others. <i>This is a complete lie</i> is not correct, as you have, in fact, used sockpuppetry for AfDs. Also, I, in fact, do care for the folks on Wikipedia. If I didn't care, I would not even mind editing any mistakes I catch in articles, reverting and simple vandalism I see, or voicing my opinion in Wikipedia debates.

<dd>Point. However, at least <i>some</i> of his books are with (albeit Christian) publishing houses (such as Harvest House, New Leaf). And he has written and/or edited with LaHaye who is a major figure in the dispensational fundamentalist movement. Ice may not be as notable as a Falwell but doesn't seem--to me at least--to be obscure either. I'd say he's "notable enough."

<dd>With all due respect, two things. First, since the alleged vote stacking, there haven't been any votes to keep; just to delete. My alleged vote stacking simply asked four or five people to vote (not one way or the other). So, you being strongly influenced by that doesn't make any sense. Furthermore, voting one way out of spite isn't in Wikipedia's best interests, so I'm sure that'll be noted by many as well. Honorable Wikipedians will examine the entry and decide one way or the other. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 18:46, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Mr. Gastrich</b>, allow me to say for myself, I am an Afd regular and I often vote to delete, not because I am a deletionist but because those doing the nominating usually have good reason. That said, I also do due diligence. I am very proud of having "saved" several articles, including a Russian folk song <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Vo_sadu_li,_v_ogorode" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Vo_sadu_li,_v_ogorode" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> and a truly tacky but notable drinking game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Beer_Mile" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Beer_Mile" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>. I also chastise those whom I suspect of bad-faith nominations. I do not consider these bad-faith noms. It appears to me that you, as you cannot rewrite the article for LBU since it is protected, have decided to take another tack and make a list of people who went to LBU and write articles about them. While it is understandable that you would want to try to gain for your alma mater as much credibility as can be gleaned, filling the pages of WP with articles about people whose main claim to fame is that they got their diploma from the same place as you is vanity. You have compounded vanity with attempts at vote-stacking, and now with personal attacks<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FThomas_Ice&amp;diff=35645089&amp;oldid=35644864" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FThomas_Ice&amp;diff=35645089&amp;oldid=35644864" rel="nofollow">[28]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Guettarda&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35775394" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Guettarda&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35775394" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> and accusations of "spite voting" which is nonsense in my case, and I believe in the case of every editor voting here.

<p>"...Several weeks ago, JCSM (Jesus Christ Saves Ministries) noticed this trend and created a new ministry called Wiki4Christ. It's an organization that exists to make sure Christians have a united and represented voice on Wikipedia. As you may imagine, unbelievers also edit there and they actively try to silence Christian input and revert our contributions; especially Christian biographies! This is where we need you, now.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the entries below were nominated for deletion. This means there will be a vote on whether or not to keep them. Please come and let your voice be heard! This endeavor will only take 10-15 minutes and it will be something you can do with your online time that will further the kingdom of God. Wouldn't you like to vote to keep Christian entries on Wikipedia?..."</p>

<dd>Tim LaHaye (ain't no flippin' "s" on the end of his name) is also a bad writer, a bad logician, a twisted thinker and a sower of discord.

<li><b>Keep</b>. None of the above seems to challenge that he's an author sufficiently widely read to justify inclusion. Disagreeing with what he wrote, however strongly, isn't a reason for deletion. If someone cares to provide evidence that the many listed publications are all vanity press, I will reconsider.

<dd>Hello,</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I noticed that you were listed as a Christian Wikipedian. I am, too. I wanted to let you know that in the last 24 hours, someone has nominated 12 Christian biography entries for deletion. Not only does this seem like bad faith and an affront to a lot of hard work, but I'd like you to come and vote on the entries. These nominations seem peculiar because some people are even presidents of universities and well known authors.</dd>

<dd>I think his point was that Amazon.com hits do not mean anything, with the implication that Vizcarra's link is useless. But that is putting the world on its head. Amazon is an extremely useful tool when checking out someone's publications. They list all titles they can deliver - new, used, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Print_on_demand.html" title="Print on demand">Print on demand</a> - anything. Thomas Ice has 42 hits on Amazon where he is listed as author, co-author, editor, or subject (yes - there are books by others ABOUT and AGAINST Thomas Ice's views). From there it is easy to check the publishers. One mouseclick away from the list linked by Vizcarra one can see the real publisher. What is easier, saying "Lulu" or clicking on a link? Vizcarra gave full information. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/ref=br_ss_hs/104-2713563-3911113?platform=gurupa&amp;url=index%3Dstripbooks%3Arelevance-above&amp;field-keywords=%22Thomas+Ice%22" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/ref=br_ss_hs/104-2713563-3911113?platform=gurupa&amp;url=index%3Dstripbooks%3Arelevance-above&amp;field-keywords=%22Thomas+Ice%22" rel="nofollow">Click here and check it out</a>.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. If he's writen stuff, (&amp; a lot of it!), then he should at least have a little slice of wikipedia? I mean, Wikipedia is huge, everyone can have a share can't they? Everyone thinks that because he isn't in the news, that he shouldn't be included in wikipedia, the so called "sum of all human knowledge". But how do we know he isn't influencial? He effects hundreds with his words..... <b>Further Note</b>: I was brought here, like many others by Wiggins2, or as he wants to be called, "Wiggie". I think we shouldn't be so quick to shoot him down, as I, &amp; probably many others, are grateful for his post to draw our attention to this subject. I wouldn't mind if the other "side" did the same. But we cannot ignore the fact that this is defintely going to open wikipedia into two halves; Those who want to keep. Those who don't. I.E. Christians, &amp; others. However, this should not be about religion. I would be ashamed of the christians on here if they only voted to keep the articles because they were christian orientated. This should strictly be business as usual, even though it does seem strange an editor would nominate so many christian articles. Maybe a hidden agenda? If an article's crap, then it should be deleted. Being an inclusionist, I will probably keep the most mundane article. However, the list of notable people list is like many others, &amp; should not be here. To do so would be obvious bias. I ask everyone to not be drawn in with a strict "You're wrong, I'm right" situation, but be open &amp; find a way to keep peaceful.... <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 04:29, 22 January 2006 (UTC).

<li>Rob, the only "namecalling" was the tongue-in-cheek use of a phrase used in an earlier vote in the same AfD. Editors who spend much time on AfD get used to a few people making such accusations and the rest of us joking about them. The other 88 of my 91 words were a request for what WP policy requires for inclusion of any topic, rather than "Keep, school" being sufficient for a nearly empty article. Sorry if that proportion struck you as "the entire extent of (my) thought process". <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 02:36, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"School Inclusionist Cabal" can of course be <i>interpreted</i> as a violation of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. Tongue-in-cheek, sarcastic, and other facetious comments are often misinterpreted in this medium, and its easy to accidentally misconstrue words as personal attacks. However, <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a> has thus far not been admonished for his usage of this term over quite a number of AfD nominations. I believe that discounting an entire argument because of a brief tongue-in-cheek comment, with <i>much</i> precedent - therefore obvious as to its intent, is unfair. Since Barno has apologized for the fact that the comment offended you, I think it's fair to give his comment the weight it deserves, whatever the vote. -<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a> 04:35, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as this appears to meet the criteria established by <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>, although it could use some expansion. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECan%27t_sleep%2C_clown_will_eat_me_7058.html" title="User:Can't sleep, clown will eat me">Can't sleep, clown will eat me</a> 04:23, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>. Some work on references may be needed though. Also, can somebody familiar with this tell, if this school is related to the one of the same name/place with a graduating class in 1888? <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~srgp/souvenir/1919ww1h.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rootsweb.com/~srgp/souvenir/1919ww1h.htm" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~srgp/articles/horschro.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rootsweb.com/~srgp/articles/horschro.htm" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>. Perhaps one school was built, torn down, and entirely new largely unrelated one built later. Or maybe it was a a continuation of the same institution, but a different building (as is often the case with some schools, for which we discuss all buildings in one article). Since this is speculation on my part (aka unverified) I obviously didn't mention it in the article. As for merge suggestions, I suggest, that since the district has exactly one high school, and we merge to districts (if possible), any merger be done to *this* article. That is if any elem substubs are made, they be merged/redirected here, rather then merging/redirecting this elsewhere. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 05:06, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> into school district or town if article is both below three sentances and lacks any sort of illustration, boxed info-template or picture when AFD is closed. This school, like all others, is an important public institution and should be written about somewhere, even if it cannot sustain an article on it's own. Presently people do create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, I feel it is always preferable and takes much less energy to merge the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district of local education authority of other school system, while taking care not to delete the information contained in the article. If the article is merged, the current location should be replaced by a redirect, and the edit history maintained for future use.

<p>It is an internet radio station (sorry don't know what NN means) however it is part of the fur fandom something rarely understood or with alot of misunderstanding surrounding it. Has over 250 official listeners and a team of more than 15 people working on it including myself. It is played during Fur Cons and has it's own line of merchendise... surely this makes it notable (and considering people keep asking me about it having a wiki for it is considerably easier than having to tell people over and over). It is currently incomplete however and people are planning to come and add to it over the next few days. If you give us a chance to complete it before you delete every new article it might prove to be of some use.

<li><b>Keep</b>, per the persuasive commentary of <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaysuschris_b0af.html" title="User:Jaysuschris">Jaysus Chris</a>. If the original author or the editors of a piece bothered to make the case for notability as he has done, rather than whine about deletions, complain about imaginary "vandalism," and recruit or post "keep" votes that say nothing more than "very notable" or "clearly notable," there would probably be fewer of these AfDs. Two more things: You get 11,000,000 hits if you don't know how to use a search engine. The fact is that, even if you properly search for "Grant Jeffrey" and include the quotes, you get just over 45,000 and, by the third page, you're running into lots of other people with the name, or identified as "Grant, Jeffrey." If you just type "Grant Jeffrey" in the search field without the quotes, you get every page that Google can find with either word or both words. One would think that one whom considers himself a web host and web page designer would know that. Second, there is no reason to disparage the editor on the subject of "good faith" simply because he has nominated several of Gastrich's articles for deletion. Jeffrey's reputation as "very notable" seems to occur only within a small segment of Christendom. By and large, the majority of Christians are either unaware of him or pay him no mind. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 05:41, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I noticed that you were listed as a Christian Wikipedian. I am, too. I wanted to let you know that in the last 24 hours, someone has nominated 12 Christian biography entries for deletion. Not only does this seem like bad faith and an affront to a lot of hard work, but I'd like you to come and vote on the entries. These nominations seem peculiar because some people are even presidents of universities and well known authors.</dd>

<dd>Meatpuppetry would be the user having all his friends register and then vote. ENLIGHTENING other wikipedian users about this problem is in no way meatpuppetry. The one who raised personal issues here was Cyde, accusing the author of using multies and cheating. That's bad, and it needs a counterreaction. There is nothing dishonest about that mail, not in one place does the author of the letter tell a lie or similar. He doesn't even tell, he doesn't even ENCOURAGE people to vote "Keep". Not meatpuppetry in any way, if you are going to continue accusing him of meatpuppetry you need to present a convincing argument for it. Otherwise it will only be a continuation of the lies and slander you people are already throwing the author. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItake_90f6.html" title="User:Itake">Itake</a> 01:31, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Abstain with preference to merge</b>. The article is very small &amp; the article's subject is very unnotable. Although I would probably choose fixing rather than deletion, I have no real concern if it's delted or kept. I have no opinion. Therefore, I abstain. <b>Further Note</b>: I was brought here, like many others by Wiggins2, or as he wants to be called, "Wiggie". I think we shouldn't be so quick to shoot him down, as I, &amp; probably many others, are grateful for his post to draw our attention to this subject. I wouldn't mind if the other "side" did the same. But we cannot ignore the fact that this is defintely going to open wikipedia into two halves; Those who want to keep. Those who don't. I.E. Christians, &amp; others. However, this should not be about religion. I would be ashamed of the christians on here if they only voted to keep the articles because they were christian orientated. This should strictly be business as usual, even though it does seem strange an editor would nominate so many christian articles. Maybe a hidden agenda? If an article's crap, then it should be deleted. Being an inclusionist, I will probably keep the most mundane article. However, the list of notable people list is like many others, &amp; should not be here. To do so would be obvious bias. I ask everyone to not be drawn in with a strict "You're wrong, I'm right" situation, but be open &amp; find a way to keep peaceful.... <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 04:11, 22 January 2006 (UTC).

<dd>The only reason so many Christian articles were nominated in a big batch like this is because they were all created by the same user in a short period of time, and on non-notable people (or at least not notable enough to need their own article, I do think that some should certainly be highlighted in the main article of the institution they are connected to). This seems to be done with the intention of promoting an institution that the user is affiliated with, and not because the subjects of the articles are actual notable enough to warrant a dedicated article. The fact that they are Christian is coincidence. I would get the same reaction if I suddenly decided to create a batch of articles for all the instructors who taught at the photography school I went to (granted, some of them are quite notable, but many are not notable enough to warrant a dedicated article). <a href="../../../b/c/a/User%7EBcatt_84c6.html" title="User:Bcatt">bcatt</a> 04:36, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ugh...maybe I should take a break from my usual wikianderings and do a bunch of articles on my school and it's faculty and alumni just so many of those will also be voted for deletion, just so I can show that these deletions aren't religiously biased. The most ridiculous part is that the ones screaming religious bias are the ones creating religiously biased articles...it is no more wrong to want to delete an article because it is religious, than it is to want to create an unnecessary article for promotionally religious purposes - they are almost the same thing. Wikipedia is not the place to debate or try to prove which is the "one true religion", it is a place to describe all the different types of religion from a completely NPOV. <a href="../../../b/c/a/User%7EBcatt_84c6.html" title="User:Bcatt">bcatt</a> 05:36, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Rebuttal</b>: Everything above was posted to skew the voting and make people turn against me and bias their viewpoint of the nomination and the entry. It's a pretty sick tactic. It shows they care little about the actual strength of the entry; which should be the only thing considered. Since the "warnings" have been posted, some people have even said that they've voted <i>only</i> because of the alleged misconduct.

<dd>You're right...I was a tad hasty in writing the comment and left off some stuff. Assuming that the information in the article is correct, I think that it's possible that Weaver is trying to turn LBU into a more reputable institution. His policies probably had a hand in student growth. Mind you, personally, I still think it's a diploma mill, but less because they sell diplomas and more because they don't really <i>educate</i> anyone. If he had as much to do with the rewriting of the minimum educational standards for Ohio Christian schools, that might qualify, along with his presiding over a pretty significant growth of the Gospel Music Network. All of those things together might be reasonably notable, <i>if true</i>. It's just occurred to me, however, that if someone wrote those kinds of things about someone Gastrich didn't like, he'd demand a "citation." We've seen that enough times. If Gastrich doesn't like or doesn't agree with the comments or information, he demands citations, yet posts most of his claims about his personal heroes without providing much in the way of proof. There are no citations for any of the claims about Weaver. I'm convinced. Dump it. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 02:14, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it is kept for that reason it should be merged with LBU. Afterall other than LBU's link at the bottom there are no sources. As for the place where he got 3 out of 4 of his non-LBU related degrees (Baptist Christian University is LBU), do a search for that school, "Eastern Baptist Institute." That will tell you something about this person. As for the Korean awards, ect. there are no sources. The claims about his church are uncited. Outside of the figures <i>LBU gives</i> we don't know how many people this guy is notable to. More importantly if LBU barely escaped its own deletion, why should its "President" who has 5 unaccredited degrees, unknown books/readers and uncited awards get his own. Yes, it is important to have some facts about the "President," but if this article is only to be a selling point for LBU/LBU related, relevant facts should be merged the rest <b>deleted.</b> ---Filler <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/0/7/User%7E207.200.116.5.html" title="User:207.200.116.5">207.200.116.5</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/7/User_talk%7E207.200.116.5.html" title="User talk:207.200.116.5">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.200.116.5_8379.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.200.116.5">contribs</a>) 06:52, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</small>

<dd>Hello,</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I noticed that you were listed as a Christian Wikipedian. I am, too. I wanted to let you know that in the last 24 hours, someone has nominated 12 Christian biography entries for deletion. Not only does this seem like bad faith and an affront to a lot of hard work, but I'd like you to come and vote on the entries. These nominations seem peculiar because some people are even presidents of universities and well known authors.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I was brought here, like many others by Wiggins2, or as he wants to be called, "Wiggie". I think we shouldn't be so quick to shoot him down, as I, &amp; probably many others, are grateful for his post to draw our attention to this subject. I wouldn't mind if the other "side" did the same. But we cannot ignore the fact that this is defintely going to open wikipedia into two halves; Those who want to keep. Those who don't. I.E. Christians, &amp; others. However, this should not be about religion. I would be ashamed of the christians on here if they only voted to keep the articles because they were christian orientated. This should strictly be business as usual, even though it does seem strange an editor would nominate so many christian articles. Maybe a hidden agenda? If an article's crap, then it should be deleted. Being an inclusionist, I will probably keep the most mundane article. However, the list of notable people list is like many others, &amp; should not be here. To do so would be obvious bias. I ask everyone to not be drawn in with a strict "You're wrong, I'm right" situation, but be open &amp; find a way to keep peaceful.... <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 04:02, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Do you have any evidence that the university where he is president is a diploma mill? I saw pictures of their campus and students. There are degree requirements unlike diploma mills. By the way, you said <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Randall_5d07.html" title="Mike Randall">Mike Randall</a> was the president of a diploma mill and he's actually the president of a <b>regionally accredited university</b>. Therefore, your claims need evidence because you've been wrong once, today. Not every university that you haven't heard or every university that is Christian is a diploma mill. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 22:04, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Possibly; I'm not sure exaclty how Canada handles accreditation. There's also a "Faith Way Baptist College" in Michigan, and that's the one I thought the article was talking about. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 14:38, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, I've done a little digging. FWBCC has a website, but it's just an empty front page with a group photo of the '05/'06 student body.<a href="http://www.college.faithway.org/college.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.college.faithway.org/college.shtml" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> There are 78 people in the photo (some of which may be teachers rather than students), which would make this a very small school. According to <a href="http://www.college.faithway.org/historical.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.college.faithway.org/historical.shtml" rel="nofollow">this page</a>, which can be accessed through an open directory on that page, the college was founded in 1983 and is "an inseparable part of FaithWay Baptist Church in Ajax, Ontario". Their undergrad application is <a href="http://www.college.faithway.org/pdf/undergrad_application.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.college.faithway.org/pdf/undergrad_application.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> (PDF), and their grad application is <a href="http://www.college.faithway.org/pdf/grad_application.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.college.faithway.org/pdf/grad_application.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> (also PDF). For the undergrad app, it doesn't look like they require a diploma or GED. As for credentials, <a href="http://www.cicic.ca/postsec/institutions/details.en.php?ID=161" class="external text" title="http://www.cicic.ca/postsec/institutions/details.en.php?ID=161" rel="nofollow">this page</a> on the site of the "Canadian Information Centre for International Credentials" states that they are a "Private Non-Profit Institution Recognized under a Private Act" (specifically, the "FaithWay Baptist College of Canada Act, 1992"). The definition for this is on the right-hand side of the page, and it implies that they are not accredited in the way we have been using the term, which would require categorization as either a "Recognized Institution" or a "Postsecondary Institution Authorized to Offer Specific Credentials". Basically, from what I can tell, they're the religious equivalent of a vocational academy, run within within Greg Baker's church. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 15:12, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Said the man who has been soliciting keep votes - but of course, it's not "ballot stuffing" is it? For the record, Brokenfrog, I <i>have</i> read the article and find his claims tenuous. This is a private for-profit technical training school of unknown enrollment numbers, the university of which he is supposedly a board member appears not to exist, his Ed.

<li>This isn't a university. It doesn't even claim to be one. ACMT accreditation details: <i>Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges of Technology, Occupational Education (NDCS) - Private nondegree-granting institutions that are predominately organized to educate students for trade, occupational, or technical careers</i> - in other words, it's an occupational training school which trains NMR techs (something whihc is done on the job over here). These are two-year non-degree courses, and there is no indication of numbers. It is fair to be sceptical of an instution whose principal claims an Ed. D which turns out to come from an <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana_Baptist_University_19ac.html" title="Louisiana Baptist University">unaccredited university</a> - and which is, in any case, reportedly honorary.

You accuse those of us that think these are poor sources of POV and yet you seem blind to the fact that many of the claims in the article are not easily verifiable according to wikipedia research standards.

<dd>No, but it does strenghten the POV claim because I don't see you crawling all over those articles. While the articles related to this school all got up for deletion a few moments after they were created.

<dd>I'm not saying the article is lying. I am saying it is written from a POV perspective and is as yet, not verifiable. Plus he seems relatively unnotable from a religious perspective. These are viable reason to delete. You may disagree, thats fine, and thats why we have AfD. Also it is true i was not crawling all over the artcile, who was? Is that a reason i cannot vote in AfD? I was however involved in the discussion on the LBU page that spawned all these unnotable alumni pages. At the LBU talk page there is a circular argument being presented that justifies the inclusion of people as notable alumni based on the fact they have a page in wikipedia. Yet that page was created by the very person making the argument. This is bad faith editing and these article deserve to be judged by the community. Personally i find them remarkably unnotable. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 19:29, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: If you look at my contribution history, you'll see that when the verifiability of a fact is questioned, I take steps to verify it. If it's verifiable (as with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_BEML_1797.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/BEML">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/BEML</a>, to cite one example), I add the citations and confirm it. If it's not (as with this article), I note that fact as well. You seem to be remarkably quick to assume bad faith on the part of people who disagree with you. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 19:46, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Then NPOV tag it Daycd. And if you want to continue this discussion, come up with a good reason for deletion. "Unnotable" is not a valid argument when we are talking about a guy who has recevied awards from the major of seoul.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: It's a valid argument if the awards in question do not meet the encyclopedia's standards for verifiability.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The pictures might or might not help. I've got a request for translation of the captions up on the RFT page, and I dropped a note on the talk page of <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonghokim_09ea.html" title="User:Yonghokim">User:Yonghokim</a>, who voted in this AFD and self-identifies as a native speaker of Korean. If the caption lists which award is being given, that'd be a starting point toward finding a citable print source. If they say something like "receiving award from mayor" and we can identify the mayor from an outside photo, I'd probably also count that as partial confirmation. As they are right now, they're just pictures of a guy handing a folder to another guy.

<dd>I noticed that you were listed as a Christian Wikipedian. I am, too. I wanted to let you know that in the last 24 hours, someone has nominated 12 Christian biography entries for deletion. Not only does this seem like bad faith and an affront to a lot of hard work, but I'd like you to come and vote on the entries. These nominations seem peculiar because some people are even presidents of universities and well known authors.</dd>

<li><b>Weak Delete with prefernce to merge</b>. I feel bad for turning my back on my inclusionist ways, but this article is un notable &amp; small. Ahh well.... <b>Further Note</b>: I was brought here, like many others by Wiggins2, or as he wants to be called, "Wiggie". I think we shouldn't be so quick to shoot him down, as I, &amp; probably many others, are grateful for his post to draw our attention to this subject. I wouldn't mind if the other "side" did the same. But we cannot ignore the fact that this is defintely going to open wikipedia into two halves; Those who want to keep. Those who don't. I.E. Christians, &amp; others. However, this should not be about religion. I would be ashamed of the christians on here if they only voted to keep the articles because they were christian orientated. This should strictly be business as usual, even though it does seem strange an editor would nominate so many christian articles. Maybe a hidden agenda? If an article's crap, then it should be deleted. Being an inclusionist, I will probably keep the most mundane article. However, the list of notable people list is like many others, &amp; should not be here. To do so would be obvious bias. I ask everyone to not be drawn in with a strict "You're wrong, I'm right" situation, but be open &amp; find a way to keep peaceful.... <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 04:19, 22 January 2006 (UTC).

Do you see how far fetched this is? It may be true but i am not going to accept that on face value. Do you always accept undocumented evidence this easily in other articles you edit?

<dd>The diplomamill thingy, again, is not verified. This article is not about the LBU, not about a diplomamill and not about my religion. That you continously refer to the LBU as a diplomamill shows your obvious POV bias and that you cannot present a credible evidence for the deletion of THIS article. Instead you have to rely on ongoing disputes in other articles. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItake_90f6.html" title="User:Itake">Itake</a> (<a href="../../../i/t/a/User_talk%7EItake_20b7.html" title="User talk:Itake">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Itake_60a1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Itake">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>I have made my case for this article to be deleted. You get frustrated by diploma mills being discussed but obviously that is part of a valid case against this entry. He has no quality qualifications and the author has resorted to assertions about alledged studies in notable universities that are not verfiable. Take all that out and there is not much left. This is not about knee jerk POV, it is about having quality articles about relevent people. Its just that your threshold is lower than mine.

<dd>Hello,</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I noticed that you were listed as a Christian Wikipedian. I am, too. I wanted to let you know that in the last 24 hours, someone has nominated 12 Christian biography entries for deletion. Not only does this seem like bad faith and an affront to a lot of hard work, but I'd like you to come and vote on the entries. These nominations seem peculiar because some people are even presidents of universities and well known authors.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If he's writen stuff then he should at least have a little slice of wikipedia? I mean, Wikipedia is huge, everyone can have a share can't they? Everyone thinks that because he isn't in the news, that he shouldn't be included in wikipedia, the so called "sum of all human knowledge". But how do we know he isn't influencial? He effects hundreds with his words..... <b>Further Note</b>: I was brought here, like many others by Wiggins2, or as he wants to be called, "Wiggie". I think we shouldn't be so quick to shoot him down, as I, &amp; probably many others, are grateful for his post to draw our attention to this subject. I wouldn't mind if the other "side" did the same. But we cannot ignore the fact that this is defintely going to open wikipedia into two halves; Those who want to keep. Those who don't. I.E. Christians, &amp; others. However, this should not be about religion. I would be ashamed of the christians on here if they only voted to keep the articles because they were christian orientated. This should strictly be business as usual, even though it does seem strange an editor would nominate so many christian articles. Maybe a hidden agenda? If an article's crap, then it should be deleted. Being an inclusionist, I will probably keep the most mundane article. However, the list of notable people list is like many others, &amp; should not be here. To do so would be obvious bias. I ask everyone to not be drawn in with a strict "You're wrong, I'm right" situation, but be open &amp; find a way to keep peaceful.... <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 04:22, 22 January 2006 (UTC).

<li>The hypocrisy is amazing. In one sentence you frame this debate as being between "Christians &amp; others" and then in the very next sentence you say, "this should not be about religion". It's <b>not</b> about religion! It's about maintaining the quality of the encyclopedia! We have <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> for a reason. By framing this as a debate between Christians and others "seemingly" attacking Christians by (*gasp*) voting to delete articles of non-notable Christian figures, you are doing a disservice to the AfD process. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font style="background: #000000" face="Impact" color="#00A5FF">Cyde Weys</font></a> 23:09, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>For F$#% sake!!!!!!! Have you actually read what I've written before spouting off that big mouth like everyone else whose's replied to my comments!!!???? NO!!! What I'm saying is is that everyone's taking it as a "Christian VS Other" debate! But it's not! What I'm saying is that if people keep on making it about religion, it will create a drift between the two parties, even if it is about religion.

<li>There's no reason to doubt good faith if the complete information is not in the article and a deletion nomination is made based on what <i>is</i> there, as well as the record of the article writer for posting a number of articles about people of questionable notability. If there is information available that makes the person notable according to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, perhaps passing on laziness (or an attempt to inflate contribution numbers by posting many small, largely substanceless articles instead of a few, good, informative articles) might better serve the purpose of Wikipedia.

<li>I can see your point, but I think that deleting articles that are not up to snuff should be some level of priority, if not the first. I would add that it's not up to the reader to do the research to see if the party or institution is notable--something in the article should indicate that, even if it's a short article that the writer intends to come back to, later. For example, I intend to start adding articles on some writers of history and some scientists that I think should get some coverage, but if I were to do that and only add as a "stub," I think I'd make it a point to get the notability in there--something other than "is a professor and author." Neither of those things is good enough and it would serve me right if someone came along an deleted it because it contained insufficient information. We all have time issues and we can all understand that one might want to start an article and add to it, later. That's cool. Get whatever makes that person or institution notable in there, first. Then, if you have to come back to it later (maybe even much later), it'll probably still be there, even if still a "stub." Sorry...I have no sympathy for lazy writers. I'm a tad "old school" that way. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 07:40, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's true that the reader shouldn't have to hunt for notability. But when, through the magic of Wikipedia, we become the editors, we have an obligation to make sure we're not deleting useful information. I guess that's what this process is all about, but I think the default position should be "let's see if this is appropriate" versus "AFD anything I'm not familiar with that doesn't make a bold claim for notability". My opinion. - <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaysuschris_b0af.html" title="User:Jaysuschris">Jaysus Chris</a> 08:00, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, there's a difference, too--a fine one, I'll grant--between what some might view as "notable" (Wiki's standards are a tad over-encompassing, after all) and what is "useful." These kinds of articles are not generally useful. They read like bios from corporate literature, and too often don't qualify as encyclopedic. However, I certainly think that your opinion is well-considered and valid, even if I'm not convinced that anyone is really taking the latter "default position." - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 12:09, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Some think that deleting articles risks losing valuable information, just because that valuable information or proof of notability isn't there yet. It doesn't. The article can be recreated with those things without being speedily deleted, and articles have been recreated in this way. See <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godcasting.html" title="Godcasting">Godcasting</a> - it was initially (rightly) deleted, then eventually recreated with the necessary information it lacked the first time, reAfDed and kept. Admittedly there was a lot of unnecessary drama on the way and I could probably pick a better example, but then it was a Christian-related subject, so so much for the evil atheistic cabal. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 11:44, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: My concern wasn't what happens if and when he becomes notable in his own right, I think that's easy. The problem is with a <i>merge and redirect</i>. Even if as <i>current</i> president he deserves a mention on the article on the college, he probably won't merit one as a <i>past</i> president (unlike Neal Weaver for example who it seems likely will).

<dd>I noticed that you were listed as a Christian Wikipedian. I am, too. I wanted to let you know that in the last 24 hours, someone has nominated 12 Christian biography entries for deletion. Not only does this seem like bad faith and an affront to a lot of hard work, but I'd like you to come and vote on the entries. These nominations seem peculiar because some people are even presidents of universities and well known authors.</dd>

<dd>Thats insinuating bullshit. There is nothing wrong with alerting users to the fact that a bunch of delete-wannabies are attacking articles and demanding they get deleted without having any good reasons at all for the delete except the POV rantings of a guy that for some reason got to be an admin. Where do you get the facts to backup the claim that User Jason Gastrich used multiple accounts to further his articles? Now this is going out hand. When you people turn to personal attacks and blatant lies and slandering, it gets personal. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItake_90f6.html" title="User:Itake">Itake</a> 01:13, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, you'll get used to it. Opposing any opinion of Gastrich is "bad faith," "harrassment," "persecution of Christians" and, anyway, you do it because you're an atheist who "hates Jesus."

<dd>I never called you scum. If I did though, it would be only a fraction of the negative things you commonly say to Christians. As you know very well, I've never cursed you, but I've summarized the things you've said, with cited quotations, for your Wikipedia entry;(see <a href="../../../m/a/r/Talk%7EMark_K._Bilbo_b61b.html#Controversy" title="Talk:Mark K. Bilbo">Talk:Mark K. Bilbo#Controversy</a>) only to have a couple of your friends delete them. For those who wish to see the truth about Mark Bilbo, I've compiled 11 or 12 links to his statements on Usenet where he swears at Christians, calls them names, and mocks Jesus and God. So, as I was saying, I don't judge you and I don't call <b>you</b> names. However, you frequently open your mouth and do reputable atheists a disservice by the things that come out of it. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 05:28, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, I'm not saying the figure is a lie. I'm saying that sending a free magazine to 32,000 people who are automatically signed up when they enter college is not the same as 32,000 people actually going to a newsagent and buying it. Advertising is an extremely painful market and everyone involved has finely-tuned bullshit detectors. When a free newspaper tells an advertiser they have 32,000 readers, they will automatically think in terms of how many people actually read it and don't just dump it straight in the bin.

<li><b>Abstain with preference to merge</b>. Little known, but would be great if merged. <b>Further Note</b>: I was brought here, like many others by Wiggins2, or as he wants to be called, "Wiggie". I think we shouldn't be so quick to shoot him down, as I, &amp; probably many others, are grateful for his post to draw our attention to this subject. I wouldn't mind if the other "side" did the same. But we cannot ignore the fact that this is defintely going to open wikipedia into two halves; Those who want to keep. Those who don't. I.E. Christians, &amp; others. However, this should not be about religion. I would be ashamed of the christians on here if they only voted to keep the articles because they were christian orientated. This should strictly be business as usual, even though it does seem strange an editor would nominate so many christian articles. Maybe a hidden agenda? If an article's crap, then it should be deleted. Being an inclusionist, I will probably keep the most mundane article. However, the list of notable people list is like many others, &amp; should not be here. To do so would be obvious bias. I ask everyone to not be drawn in with a strict "You're wrong, I'm right" situation, but be open &amp; find a way to keep peaceful.... <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 04:23, 22 January 2006 (UTC).

<p>Here's a real kick in the pants: I just read through my downloaded PDF version of Fantasy Imperium, and right there on page 11 of the .pdf (page 1 of the Introduction) is the quote, "<i><b>Fantasy Imperium</b></i> is a Historical Fantasy Role Playing Game set in Medieval Europe."</p>
<p>Since the term "Interactive Storytelling Game" does not appear in the text of the game itself (though it is on the website), I nominate this article for <b>deletion</b>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Bearded_One_153c.html" title="User:The Bearded One">The Bearded One</a> 06:49, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interactive_storytelling.html" title="Interactive storytelling">Interactive storytelling</a> is a big field which gets 450,000 google hits. Its a far broader category than just RPG's. Sometimes its used as an educational tool such as <a href="http://www.arcadiacasting.co.uk/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.arcadiacasting.co.uk/index.html" rel="nofollow">STORYSMITH</a>. I found many other exampels of the term. I think there is a sufficently broad disctinction between <i>Interactive storytelling</i>, <i>storytelling games</i> and <i>interactive strorytelling games</i>. I've done a bit aof a trim down of the article and added a few more examples. --<a href="../../../p/f/a/User%7EPfafrich_c43f.html" title="User:Pfafrich">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../p/f/a/User_talk%7EPfafrich_40ba.html" title="User talk:Pfafrich">talk</a>) 21:51, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The article on <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interactive_storytelling.html" title="Interactive storytelling">Interactive storytelling</a> which Pfafrich linked to is listed as a computer game stub. I am unfamiliar with any of the other examples which were added, but one of my concerns is that the current article on <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interactive_Storytelling_Game_1b06.html" title="Interactive Storytelling Game">Interactive Storytelling Games</a> utterly fails to distinguish itself from <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role-playing_game.html" title="Role-playing game">Role-playing games</a>.

<li><b>Comment.</b> First of all, please <b>vote only once.</b> Also, as for the "some articles," they're interesting. First of all, they're almost all from countries with whom the US is at odds with. Second, one is a a letter to the editor and the others are all just publishing Imperator's press releases. I'm sure newspapers in these countries (Cuba, Iran, Panama) don't usually receive press releases from US presidential candidates. It's more a curiousity than anything else. I guess the question is, are we including articles for all of the literally thousands (yes, thousands) of declared US presidential candidates? <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 08:01, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This kid has a site that is humorous. Who cares if hes advertising. Its funnier to watch things disgrace themselves than have others make it easy on him.</p>
<p>Somehow 5 of us found it and thought it was worthy to be posted upon. Wikipedia isnt the american encyclopedia. Thats what makes it what it is.</p>
<p>To be honest I know Alex and I searched his site in Yahoo. 9th hit was this post. He wont beat my bud's idea, but damn, at least let it try. I hope it fails miserably, not because some people want it to, but because it gets no hits.</p>
<p>So if youw ant this kids site to fail at least let it fail by itself. I bet he is getting more google rank by you people posting against it.</p>

<p>An ample illustration of why writing articles about current events goes wrong. This amounts to a minor <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skirmish.html" title="Skirmish">skirmish</a> in the war on science that religious fundamentalists are waging, and is now <a href="../../../f/i/z/Fizz.html" title="Fizz">fizzling</a> out.</p>
<p>It is being <a href="../../../o/u/t/Out-of-court_settlement.html" title="Out-of-court settlement">settled out of court</a>. Basically, a schoolboard decided that they could show creationist videos to their schoolkids, consisting of some <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_earth_creationist.html" title="Young earth creationist">young earth creationist</a> videos and some <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_design_creationist.html" title="Intelligent design creationist">intelligent design creationist</a> videos under the banner of "<a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>" to get round the whole <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwards_v._Aguillard_603f.html" title="Edwards v. Aguillard">Edwards v. Aguillard</a> thing. <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americans_United_3a6e.html" title="Americans United">Americans United</a> noticed and sued, and now the schoolboard have settled out of court (the course is being stopped).</p>
<p>Since it did not go to court, it does not become any <a href="../../../c/a/s/Case_law.html" title="Case law">case law</a>, and is no more notable than all the other anti-science endeavours such as legislation that is being pushed by those with certain interests.

<p>The most remarkable thing, actually, has been the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discovery_Institute_e957.html" title="Discovery Institute">Discovery Institute</a>'s flip-flopping from crying "<a href="../../../c/e/n/Censorship.html" title="Censorship">censorship</a>!" to "we don't think you should be mixing our brand of creationism with another brand because we pretend harder that ours is science" and now, after it has been settled, they've flopped back to crying "<a href="../../../c/e/n/Censorship.html" title="Censorship">censorship</a>!".</p>

<p>Poorly constructed article littered with POV problems. Essentially repeats the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_music.html" title="Metal music">Metal music</a> article that was voted KEEP in recent AFD. All the metal genres have explanations on them, and most of the genre articles contain a much larger, comphrensive list of bands. Those that dont have lists so large, their is actually articles constructed to list bands of that type of music. Another problem on this note is that many of the bands listed here have no musical connection to the genres they have been placed in, as can be seen by reading the genres articles, and the articles of the bands themself. Finally, most of the supposed genres listed do not exist, and consist of a small group of bands with no musical connection, as all the genres and terms used are listed on the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_music.html" title="Metal music">Metal music</a> article with a explanation of their meaning and use. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 16:03, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Delete. Non-notable link spam, the only links on google are free web directories they've submitted themselves to, not ranked on alexa, found spamming other articles such as <a href="../../../u/s/-/Template%7EUS-airport_ef1c.html" title="Template:US-airport">Template:US-airport</a> <a href="../../../g/h/e/User%7EGhewgill_c616.html" title="User:Ghewgill">Ghewgill</a> 16:18, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Understood - our only notability (in our minds at least) comes from the fact that we are a large directory - the only free source anywhere to find where air charter planes live in the world. If this does not make us notable, then we can agree - rsvpair does not warrant a page in wikipedia -- yet. If alexa is the judging criteria then we lose. But we don't want to be labelled as spammers for placing our informative links next to other's informative links - we have unique content we wish to share and would like to know how to do this in a fashion consistent with the wikipedia aviation specific content. We had hoped this would be the first tentative steps in a long relationship where we share our data freely with the wikipedia community - building stubs for the missing airports in the directory, we are having meetings tonight to start bulking up the aircraft type pages so there is more information about what each plane is best suited for,etc. How should we proceed? <a href="../../../a/i/r/User%7EAirwebster_cf36.html" title="User:Airwebster">Airwebster</a> 17:44, 18 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Since you operate the directory, your motives may be somewhat suspect, and therefore a gentle approach rather than a bold approach, at least when adding links to it or matter concerning it, is probably in order. When you add such a link or material, and it's removed, talk about the changes instead on the talk page of the article or template, rather than reverting the revert. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 21:43, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Aggressive linking, reverting, and template modification despite many warnings followed by an impassioned repentence just as it becomes clear they will be deleted is borderline sociopathic and shows a complete lack of respect for Wikipedians and their community. Their only goal is to do whatever necessary to keep their links. A change in tactics after being exposed only further highlights this. Non-notability and similarity to made-for-AdSense previously established. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucent_7a0a.html" title="User:Lucent">Lucent</a> 20:43, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm sorry but I don't think this is an accurate read at all. I see little communication with either user directing them or redirecting them; I think this is probably a useful web directory to link to for some articles and arguing on the basis of someone's supposed "sociopathy" is probably unhelpful. Instead, let's inform new users to discuss disputed changes on the affected talk pages (presumably <a href="../../../u/s/-/Template_talk%7EUS-airport_c2d2.html" title="Template talk:US-airport">Template talk:US-airport</a> and <a href="../../../a/i/r/Talk%7EAir_charter_3494.html" title="Talk:Air charter">Talk:Air charter</a>. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 21:40, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's either going to be kept or merged, nobody's trying to delete. So I don't see that this is a good candidate for Afd, personally.

<li>You don't close votes early to avoid an unwanted outcome. There were 16 votes for keeping or merging and none for deletion.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Just last night I saw a gift pack of Hilton perfume that included a little beanie-type version of tinkerbell as a bonus item. Exposure in (presumably) many thousands of stores worldwide, in conjunction with appearing on a top-rated network TV series for several years now, equals notability, even if one happens to be a dog.

<ul>
<li>No, I didn't google it. I'm sure there are a gazillion hits, and I'm sure they're all sites about tamagotchi. My point is that <i>she</i> isn't notable on her own. <i>She</i> hasn't done anything else of note. The article has been one sentence long since it was created in August, and that one sentence worth of information is already in the tamagotchi article. I guess a redirect makes sense, though I doubt anyone is going to search for Aki Maita before searching for tamagotchi. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 17:20, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>There are 500 breeds of dogs. Any of them can be mixed and anyone can name the mixes anything they want. (E.g., see <a href="http://www.achclub.com/modules.php?name=Breeders" class="external text" title="http://www.achclub.com/modules.php?name=Breeders" rel="nofollow">American hybrid "registry"</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/o/Poodle_hybrid.html" title="Poodle hybrid">Poodle hybrid</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_hybrids_and_crossbreeds.html#Casual_crossbreeds" title="Dog hybrids and crossbreeds">Dog hybrids and crossbreeds#Casual crossbreeds</a>.) I realize that WP is not paper, but mostly what can be said about <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixed-breed_dog.html" title="Mixed-breed dog">mixed-breed dogs</a> is that they might have some characteristics of either parent, or not (if you also look at <a href="../../../m/a/l/Maltipoo.html" title="Maltipoo">Maltipoo</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schnoodle.html" title="Schnoodle">Schnoodle</a> you'll see what I mean). We've discussed this within the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Dog_breeds_df79.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Dog breeds">dog breed project</a> before and feel that all these do is create multiple mixed-breed-dog articles. We're leaving in <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cockapoo.html" title="Cockapoo">Cockapoo</a> because it's been around long enough to be the only mixed-breed name to make it into the dictionary, and <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labradoodle.html" title="Labradoodle">Labradoodles</a> are so common as to be found in just about every puppies-for-sale list everywhere, with <a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldendoodle.html" title="Goldendoodle">Goldendoodles</a> getting pretty close, but I'm hesitant to open the floodgates for articles about everyone's mixed-breed dog with an invented name.

These sheer numbers doesn't mean anything, because they aren't reliable sources. Tons of ads for puppies? A couple amateurish "breed clubs" web sites.. dogbreedinfo.com. At most the reliable information provided on these designer dogs comes from casual mentions in magazine articles about the current trend with designer dogs - these articles focus on Go to amazon and search for maltipoo.

<dd>The problem is, you cannot define what a "fooApoo" is. Other than "it will have aspects of a foo, and a poodle, but you really cannot predict which set of aspects". Yes, the ads are out there, but it's all marketing hype. They simply aren't breeds, and if you wanted to have an NPOV article about them, it wouldn't be a "dog breed" format article as these dogs hybrids cannot really be described in any meaningful way - The article would be an article about the marketing success of selling hybrid dogs. More breeds than these have been added, the result of those were all adding redirects to the apropriate hybrids page.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Unfortunately the celebrities that have these mixed breed dogs are doing a disservice to purebred dogs. It's a shame that you can take two different breeds of dogs, breed them and sell them for a disgusting amount of money. What they should be doing if they want a mixed breed dog, or even a purebred dog for that matter, is to go to the pound. That would help stop BYBer's and puppy millers from making a buck off of this "newest fad."

<dd>Actually I don't care a whit about whether dogs are purebred or not. Most of my smart, talented, beautiful dogs have been mixed breeds. But I'm not trying to create articles on Wikipedia about Semidachshunds, Craussies, Labrasheps, or Golden Shepherds. I must admit, though, having started this thing months ago and having promoted it, too (not doing articles on random mixed breeds), I think I am starting to be swayed by the preponderance of Internet occurrences. I'm just still not entirely convinced that one can legitimately say anything other than "it might...or might not...be like its parent breeds." And I'm not quite sure where one draws the line on "worth having an article for"--100 internet occurrences? 1000? <i>Mumbling off into the night...</i> <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf_e89c.html" title="User:Elf">Elf</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/f/User_talk%7EElf_54a3.html" title="User talk:Elf">Talk</a> 05:05, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, the article can easily have accurate information by describing what most poodle crosses inherit from each parent, and where there can be variations.

<p>The fact that Marvin Thompson was at Cheltenham is not mentioned in the argument to delete these players. It is a fact that they are not all "seasoned pros who have stepped down a few divisions in the twilights of their careers". Corbett is 21, Marvin Thompson 19, Tom Webb 21 (and was at Luton Town when younger), Chris Thompson is 23. These are all players who are improving and who will play at higher levels. There is also a discussion to be had as to what image of Wikipedia this systematic elitism (Gloucester after Dorchester) gives out to the millions of fans of semi-professional football around the world. They don't all get paid millions by Arsenal, but in their county they are household names, get mentioned on radio and television, have newspaper articles devoted to them, and matter to people. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> was meant as a guide to ensure sensible contributions; if it is to be used as a stick to beat any football team outside of the 92 "Great and Good", then perhaps it has been perverted from its original purposes and should be updated to more accurately reflect the fluidity of the pyramid structure.

<li><b>Comment</b> I wouldn't say that's entirely true. They may be household names in some football-loving households in Gloucester, but I'm from Gloucestershire (Cheltenham) and I've never heard of them.

<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. It is possible that one of these players is destined for greater things and becomes a full-time professional, but until they have achieved that they should not be included. They don't earn millions at Arsenal, but they're not even earning thousands at Stockport (the bottom club in the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_b7d8.html" title="Football League">Football League</a> at this point in time) right now. In fact, they are currently playing for a side over 50 places beneath Stockport, that attracts a crowd of only a few hundred (which makes your claim they're "household names" rather dubious).<br />
<br />
Your worry about deleting Stockport players should they be relegated is not an option. They have played dozens if not hundrerds of matches as professionals, and that achievement cannot be undone. The Gloucester players, on the other hand, have done next to nothing at the professional level of the game. You might call that "elitism", but Wikipedia demands that they be notable in their field. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 08:38, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You have chosen to carefully twist what I actually said: I claimed that they were "<b>county</b> household names" due to media reporting.<br />
<br />
I have no worries about Stockport players being deleted should they be unfortunate to be deleted, but this <i>would</i> mean the end of their supporters (or anyone else) being able to create entries for new Stockport players in the future without the prospect of contibutors such as yourself deleting them. The only players that they would be allowed to work on would be older players moving through the pyramid. This would apply to any club that was relegated to the Conference.<br />
<br />
Any players listed for <a href="../../../f/2E/c/F.C._United_of_Manchester_00a7.html" title="F.C. United of Manchester">F.C. United of Manchester</a> or <a href="../../../a/f/c/AFC_Wimbledon_302f.html" title="AFC Wimbledon">AFC Wimbledon</a> would also be due for deletion by you unless they had played a number of games (specified by yourself) for the top 92 clubs.<br />
<br />
You also chose to ignore other points such as players being put on trial twice.<br />
<br />
Adie Harris was one of the players you listed for deletion, but he has played for <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberystwyth_Town_F.C._c7b3.html" title="Aberystwyth Town F.C.">Aberystwyth Town</a>. Are you going to claim that a national league is not notable?</li>

<dd>I don't think they even qualify as household names in their own county - Gloucestershire has a population of 820,000, the city of Gloucester 110,000, and yet only three or four hundred actually turn up to watch them play every week. I haven't the resources to do ask every person in Gloucestershire but those numbers give me reason to believe that not many local people are going to have heard of them as you make out.</dd>
<dd>I will push for deletion any player who has not had significant experience playing as a professional in the Football League (and I don't count the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Wales_c17e.html" title="League of Wales">League of Wales</a>, as most of its members are semi-pro and were formerly in the English non-league system), regardless of what club they currently play for - AFCW, FCUM, Stockport, Gloucester, whatever. To let players whose experience is mostly semi-professional into Wikipedia would make a mockery of the notability guideline and mean literally tens of thousands of stubby biographies of footballers few people have heard of can be added. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 21:30, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think it "makes a mockery" of anything. There are effectively no space restrictions in Wikipedia and the guidelines for people in other fields don't set the bar all that high. For example, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html#People_still_alive" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)#People still alive</a> states that authors who've sold more than 5,000 books and musicians who've sold more than 5,000 albums "may be included in Wikipedia". I don't know what that translates to with regard to footballers, but a musician who's only sold 5,000 albums doesn't strike me as being any more notable than a good Conference player.</dd>

<dd>I'm not in favour of creating a load of short stubs though. If people want to look at one Gloucester City player then there's a good chance that they'll want to look up some others, so I'd recommend starting off with a single page for all of them, as with <a href="../../../f/c/u/FCUM_be2f.html" title="FCUM">FCUM</a>, and then splitting them out using <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">summary style</a> when/if there's too much info to fit it sensibly onto one page. If I get enough information about one of FCUM's more notable players (not really likely in the near future) I'll do this, and strongly oppose any attempts to delete it.</dd>

<dd>Well, if in the book world, you need to have around 5,000 people hand over money to read your work in order to be notable, then the parallel in the footballing world would be having around 5,000 people hand over money to watch you play (the average <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_Two_10d2.html" title="Football League Two">Football League Two</a> attendance is about this, maybe a little less <a href="http://www.sportnetwork.net/main/s26/st73004.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sportnetwork.net/main/s26/st73004.htm" rel="nofollow">[91]</a>). Gloucester's average gate is 337 - less than a tenth of this - that's not just a little bit off but falling far short of it.</dd>
<dd>If you want to put information about the current squad in the current <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloucester_City_A.F.C._8bec.html" title="Gloucester City A.F.C.">Gloucester City A.F.C.</a> page then fine, it's probably a good place for it and I'm not going to delete it from there.

<p>This is a single verse in the bible. Wikipedia does not need individual articles on every verse in the bible. We should have articles on interesting or controversial ones, but this isn't an interesting one. The verse simply says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Abraham became the father of Isaac.</dd>
<dd>Isaac became the father of Jacob.</dd>
<dd>Jacob became the father of Judah</dd>
<dd>and his brothers.</dd>
</dl>
<p>..This article says nothing more than this verse and the verses near it in the bible do. It was VFD'd by -Ril- before, but kept. I feel that part of this is because it was put in a lump vfd with a ton of other verse articles. That type of listing does not tend to produce good results. So, basically, I'd like to delete this because it's not interesting or important enough for an encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhroziac_d326.html" title="User:Phroziac">Phroziac</a> <sub>.</sub> <small>o</small> Âº <sup>O (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhroziac_3a1f.html" title="User talk:Phroziac">â¥â¥â¥â¥ chocolate!</a>)</sup> 19:01, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. A single verse of the Bible is usually not notable, although it is important. It also makes less sense when it stands alone than when it appears in context. Each verse will have to be explained in light of the preceding verse and the following verse; therefore, it makes sense to write articles about notable Bible passages and Bible topics rather than individual verses. Wikipedia may be able to contain a lot, but every verse of the Bible and then--to maintain NPOV--every verse of the Koran, the Vedas, the Upanishads, the plays of Shakespeare, the sayings of Confucius, etc?

<p>This is listcruft whose subject doesn't even match the title; it purports to be a list of greatest players, but the article says it's <i>notable</i> players, which aren't the same thing. The latter is already redundant with the <a href="../../../j/e/o/Category%7EJeopardy%21_9de7.html" title="Category:Jeopardy!">Category: Jeopardy!</a> anyway. An earlier version had more information, but most of it, being inaccurate, was removed. What's left is useless. since "greatest" is somewhat subjective (by money won? Most wins? Do we account for the doubling of the values? What about those players who were kicked off after 5 games, unlike Ken?) I don't think it can be salvaged. The most important statistics are already at the Jeopardy article. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 19:14, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I don't have a problem so much the title, as that this list is of little consequence.

<li>This would have mild utility as a list, if it was sorted by something, such as duration on the show, or total winnings; and mentioned very breifly what's verifiably signficant about them (first to last past five days, largest single day winner, etc..). This would let people see in a glance what they can't from a category, in picking which article is of interest. As it stands, a category does a better job.

<li>I didn't see it either, and so I'm adding it to this AFD. It's the same thing, and just as pointless. Also incorrect. "including those who have won more than five consecutive times since that previous limit was repealed." It's not including all the 5+ winners, and not all included are 5+ winners, so it's also incorrect.

<li>Agree that policy needs to be cleared up. I guess the problem of automatically speedy deleting any spam article is when the subject of the article is fine, but the way it is written isn't (AfD give a change for the article to be re-written).

<li>I am shocked that you want to delete this page. Ditherals is not widely used by the mainstream media, but is much more commonly used in regular speach and very common in political blogs <i>especially in this election season</i>. If someone is reading a blog, and comes accross Ditherals, they should be able to go to Wikipedia to look it up. Why delete it? I strongly object to the deletion request. There is no "common usage" criteria in Wikipedia's deletion protocol.
<ul>
<li>There most certainly <i>is</i> a "common usage" criterion in Wikipedia's deletion protocol; to merit an article, things on here have to be (a) verifiable, (b) notable, (c) encyclopedic, <i>and</i> (d) neutral and unbiased. This is none of the above. Consider it <b>speedied</b>. And before you make the accusation I <i>know</i> you're just itching to make, I am <i>not</i> a <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Canada_1b0c.html" title="Liberal Party of Canada">Liberal Party of Canada</a> member, supporter or voter. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 05:32, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I protest and repeat that there is no common usage criterion in Wikipedia's deletion protocol. A word does not have to be in common usage to be (a) verifiable, (b) notable, (c) encyclopedic. There hare thousands of Wikipedia entries in <i>uncommon usage</i> that are all verifiable, notable and encyclopedic. The definition was not written in a baised manner. You have deleted the page without 'Wikipedia community consensus' and in violation of Wikipedia's deletion protocol which requires community consensus. Please revive the page to aviod going throught the deletion review process. <i>Readers of Canadian Poltics blogs are coming accross the word Ditherals every day.</i> Lastly, you accuse me of "itching to make the accusation that you are a member of the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Canada_1b0c.html" title="Liberal Party of Canada">Liberal Party of Canada</a>" without justification and I request that you retract that statement. -Palmerston <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmerston_5643.html" title="User:Palmerston">Palmerston</a> (<a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmerston_34e3.html" title="User talk:Palmerston">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Palmerston_1b6d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Palmerston">contribs</a>) 11:43, 11 January 2006 (UTC-5)</small></li>

<li>I thought the speedy delete was improper, and said so at <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">Deletion reveiw</a>. But a google search finds only 15 unique results, all of which seem to be blogs or forums of soem sort. I would like some evidence of notability. "Widespread use" is a good way to show notability, albiet not the only way. Has this been mentioned in print journalism, for example? can we have a cite or two?

<p>non-notable list of two barely connected names, unverifiable and uncyclopedic. At the very best move to wikibooks humor section, but since there has been no interest in writing this article since it's creation, probably better to just delete it. Author of article had a few months to respond to charges that the article be made encyclopedic somehow.

<dd>I renamed it to help it, actually. It's a list of prank call names, not a list of fictional people known for their names. Arguably, all characters are known for their show, not name. Secondly, the two names listed don't appear to be characters at all, but just prank call names used in some capacity. Don't assume bad faith, I didn't title it "two prank call names" after all. Nobody has expanded this in any way in the four months since its' creation. If by being longer it becomes encyclopedic, how is it going to get longer in the first place? <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 23:10, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>My feeling is that the bulk of the article really is not appropriate for an encyclopedia article, at least in its current state.

<li><b>Transwikified</b>. I am the main author of this article and I admit that I did not choose a good name. I suggest to transwikify it as a wikibook immediately. The title would be different though, perhaps "Geometric Algebra Applied to Physics. An Approach from the Algebra of Physical Space". The range is too wide to fit in a single article because the applications range from Classical Mechanics to Quantum Mechanics. In this way I could write the contents of the links in the context of the algebra with the same notation. --User:Cabrer7, January 19 2006</li>

The issue of non legitimate pretenders might deserve a paragraph the history of Portuguese monarchy, not more than that. The status of Mr. Poidimani, which nobody knows, is only defended by a sole anon editor (probably the pretender himself or someone very close)-- <a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 22:09, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article has a big importance about the Portuguese succession. In this article are described also the pretension of other two pretenders and their affermations. About the Pact of Paris, also if this really existed, now there is no documental proof of this Pact and also Mr. Duarte Pio of Braganza in his last book affirms this. If these my affermations are false please Mr BBird to inform me and other Portoguese People where is possible to see this important document. This document is foundamental for the Crown Rights of Duarte Pio and he based his rights on this Pact that none have seen. <a href="../../../m/2E/d/User%7EM.deSousa_068d.html" title="User:M.deSousa">M.deSousa</a> 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. M.deSousa's attempts to turn Wikipedia into a promotional site for their campaign to push the alleged pretender status of someone largely unheard of even in Portugal is getting tedious at this stage. They seem to jump from article to article pushing that agenda. We don't need yet another article going over the same goddamned thing again. Articles on this topic seem to be breeding like rabbits. Frankly, most of us are fed up of dealing with this crap. If M.deSousa wants to promote the royal claims of someone, open up a blog and stop trying to use WP to push the claim. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÃIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 23:25, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The basic issue is that the only pretender with any following is Dom Duarte. Technically, there is reason to question his claim under the legal order of succession of the 19th century Portuguese monarchical constitution, but nobody in fact does so. The only actual challenge comes from this Poidimani character, and it is rather difficult to see where he comes by any claim at all, his claim being that he is the adopted heir of a bastard daughter of the second-to-last king of Portugal. All this article does is give false legitimacy to this fellow's nonsense. Beyond that, the article is mistitled for an article on general issues of Portuguese monarchism, since it is not the "Duchy" (Dukedom?) of Braganza that anybody cares about. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 07:29, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>article was listed for cleanup/merge with a similar article.

<dd>Just a quick note: the orginal articles, both tagged for clean-up and merge served as a mere basis to begin writing (both articles were rather small and were inadequately referenced). Most of the current article (<a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_railroad_strike_of_1877.html" title="Great railroad strike of 1877">Great railroad strike of 1877</a>) was based on new research, hence the numerous footnotes and new sections. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 11:24, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>An intelligent person with an introductory knowledge of differential calculus can see that Aaron has, in an awkward way, postulated that "relevant" means means the same as "varying with respect to some variable". It makes enough sense that it has a clear meaning, in contrast to things that make so little sense that you can't be sure they are false ideas. This deserves deletion as Original research and as a Non-notable idea, so worthless that its falsehood has needed no discussion until it was dumped here.<br />

<li>It is not the spirit of patent nonsense at all. The <a href="../../../p/a/t/Wikipedia%7EPatent_nonsense_6c73.html" title="Wikipedia:Patent nonsense">patent nonsense</a> criterion is specifically targetted at articles that are irredemably incomprehensible. It is <i>not</i> targetted at articles that are unverifiable or original research, since it takes more than 1 editor to make that decision.

<li>I don't think it qualifies as <i>original</i> research because I don't think it's research at all. Either way, I'm not insisting that we get rid of it ASAP, just voting that it can be deleted sooner rather than later.

<ul>
<li>The emphasis in the original-research prohibition is on <i>original</i> rather than research, so quibbling over the definition of research is missing the point. We do established knowledge, and original research or original speculation is just a step toward creating established knowledge. (And BTW, this article is an attempt at math and philosophy, two areas where research doesn't mean experimentation, but a very high proportion of sitting there trying to refine a feeling into a well-defined idea, and then sitting there working out what the consequences of that idea are.)<br />
