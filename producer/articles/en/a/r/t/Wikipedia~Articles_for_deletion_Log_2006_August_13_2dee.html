<li><b>Keep</b>. My opinion is that if you simply don't like the description and it reads like an advertisement, just change it. I have no problem with this article and quite frankly I find it useful as this company provides a service that should be mentioned in Wikipedia. The point of Wikipedia is to spur innovation, knowledge, ideas, creative thinking and education. Why do you people always feel the need to censor and shut down the creative process simply because you disagree with the words or phrasing of the article? I see no difference between this article and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comcast.html" title="Comcast">Comcast</a> or <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Warner_b84a.html" title="Time Warner">Time Warner</a> or ANY other legitimate business that has a listing on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. - As a journalist for multiple trade-presses in the telecommunications industry I can attest that VDC is in an interesting position currently. Broadcasting on the internet, the company is trying to obtain mainstream television programming that is seen on current cable systems but is apparently being held back because of certain copyright, FCC, and internet broadcast restrictions imposed upon them by the larger broadcasters and cable operators (which some see as an illegal act). As many in the cable broadcast industry are currently doing, I'd keep a close eye on this company because many of the actions carried out by this company can impose how the government and the FCC regulates cable television on the internet in the future, since IPTV is now basically unregulated. Just as the last commenter stated, change the article to read more neutral but I believe that this company is true to what they claim and aren't going to disappear anytime soon. --68.23.37.235 18:04, 5 August 2006 (UTC)<small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: 68.23.37.235 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.23.37.235_b1a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.23.37.235">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Would you mind to check the gallery on his homepage, he is well known in Thailand under the fighter name of Thopadak. You can see his photo on 16 covers of Thailands Muay Thai magazine alone (see gallery). You can find nearly 100 articles in newspapers that are scanned and in the gallery showing his photo, interviews, etc unfortunately if you can not read Thai you can not understand the articles, but you can see the photos in the newspapers.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>He did fight K-1 only once so far (the loss against Kalakoda in K-1 was controversial, check the video and you see why), but he is a KOMA champion of 2005, photo on his homepage proving this (champion belt worn on photo) but in Japan for example someone who fought K-1 is a celebrity as it is, since there are not that many people who have fought K-1 events overall.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by G00dgirl (<a href="../../../g/0/0/User_talk%7EG00dgirl_d7e2.html" title="User talk:G00dgirl">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_G00dgirl_ee0d.html" title="Special:Contributions/G00dgirl">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Thai pages would not contain his name in transliteration but most likely in Thai language. You can find his name written in most of the newspaper articles that were scanned if you know what to look for, the name in Thai letters is spelled as follows: ต.ปฏัก. He has not been fighting under that fighters name since he fought in Bangkok. In Thailand fighters adopt the name of the gym they train at. He has been fighting as Sinbi Taewoong for Taewoong gym in Korea in the past few years, for example when he won the KOMA championship in 2005 and several other fights in Korea, but I have no idea about Korean language to know the name in Korean letters. He is going to fight K-1 again this year after going to hold seminars in South Africa.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by G00dgirl (<a href="../../../g/0/0/User_talk%7EG00dgirl_d7e2.html" title="User talk:G00dgirl">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_G00dgirl_ee0d.html" title="Special:Contributions/G00dgirl">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>Fine for me. But still cite that he's a champion in References section. I saw his video on k-1fans that was so low quality handycam-made one (thus unofficial) that you can't even recognize which one is him. But as it stands right now the page will survive the nomination. Don't forget to vote here also, because as a creator of the page you aren't restricted to do so (I don't knwo if you aware of this. And sign your posts with ~~~~ four tildes, instead of the <i>unsigned</i> formula. But keep expanding the article towards notablity in place of the over-detailed biography. Are you a childhood friend of Sinbi? You know how much he weighted at the age of 9 and claim that you made the photo of him...But still remain objective.

<dd>Still I must say that notability and creditability of the artcile is questionable as "ต.ปฏัก" drop 5 hits on Google from which one is an XLS Excel document and the pages would need proper translation. The article doesn't have (and as I see can't have) references stated there. For example how can you justify the statement that he was 25 kg at the age of 9? Is it possible in any way to cite this?

Someone who did not win the event does not get to pose with the champions belt on. The fighting record is so extensive, that even Sinbi himself did not keep accurate count of all the fights in his life, I did not want to put inaccurate figures into the box.

<dd>Ok, then books maybe? ISBN whatever. We need other sources than his own home page. Until then it has to be removed...And K-1 is heavily backed up with whatever info you want. It is highly popular in Germany and also has media coverage in the US. If he's a notable fighter (apart from that one loss) there must be some reference. If not nobody cares about him, that's because he is so non-notable. There are a bunch of people in boxing for example that can be hired to be beaten up.

<li><b>Neutral</b> for the information, his Thai name ต.ปฏัก ส.จุลเสน. His first name, ต.ปฏัก, is the homophone of the 15th Thai alphabet, (ฏ.ปฏัก).

<li><b>Weak keep</b> It's a close call, but I'm going for keep. Here's his homepage: <a href="http://sinbi-taewoong.com/" class="external free" title="http://sinbi-taewoong.com/" rel="nofollow">http://sinbi-taewoong.com/</a>. Apparently he has been in a couple of thai articles and on some frontpages. He's also a thaiboxer, does anyone know if he has done any fighting at the Rajadamnern stadium or the Lumphini stadium? He's noted on the K-1 site so I guess he qualifes the policy <i>"Sportspeople/athletes who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports, including college sports in the United States. Articles about first team squad members who have not made a first team appearance may also be appropriate, but only if the individual is at a club of sufficient stature that most members of its squad are worthy of articles."</i>. I give it a weak keep as long there's some clean-up. Btw, Lajbi, he said on his web-page that he took his first fight at the age of nine. It's quite common in thailand to fight at an early age. I'm not logged in, but I'm the user NoNo. --84.217.155.207 17:42, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The entry itself shows how un-noteworthy it is. It reads like a MySpace page more than a noteable person. Eliza's achieved some cool stuff, but just because she was on a reality show (and not even the runner-up) doesn't make her study abroad and sorority activities, nor her father's achievements, meritorious of inclusion into an encylopedia. It definitely doesn't meet the criteria in the Bio for entertainment or television personalities:
<ul>
<li>Multiple features in popular culture publications such as Vogue, GQ, Elle, FHM or national newspapers</li>

<b>I've started a discussion section on the Deletion Policy page regarding reality television contestants</b>. My main point is this: the ABC.com homepage does a perfectly fine job of sorting out who is a contestant, and their background. Jimmy Wales stated we should focus on quality, not quantity. What is it that these entries give to the internet that is not already covered by their homepages for the game shows?</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Although I am not logged in at the moment, I also nominate this article for deltetion on the grounds that the sites google search numbers are not very accurate. The search engine will bring up all releveant searches for "Hogwarts Live," but in te book series, the students studying to become wizards live at the hogwarts castle. So "Hogwarts Live" doesnt necceraly bring up a huge amount of site rankings because its a popular site, but a popular collection of words.

<li>I just happened to notice that this article was put up for deletion. I’m a former member of Hogwarts Live and first recall reading about it in a <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver_Post_2118.html" title="Denver Post">Denver Post</a> article concerning the Harry Potter phenomenon and the rise of online roleplaying games dedicated to the subject. The article was not very well researched, but I do believe if one could find it that it would prove this site’s notability, correct? This article was published about a week or two previous to the release of the last book in the series.
<ul>
<li>Does anyone know where that article is? I just took a look at the sites Alexa rating and compared it to other notable sites, and it seems to be way up there in terms of traffic and number of reviews (<a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=hogwartslive.com&amp;url=hogwartslive.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=hogwartslive.com&amp;url=hogwartslive.com" rel="nofollow">29,607</a> - this beats out <a href="../../../h/p/a/HPANA_2f5a.html" title="HPANA">HPANA</a> in terms of reach). I've seen it mentioned on another Wikis as well as Harry Potter sites, I'd definitely say it's notable considering it's probably one of the top 5 most frequented non-official Harry Potter-related sites on the net. According to one of their <a href="http://www.hogwartslive.com/motd.php" class="external text" title="http://www.hogwartslive.com/motd.php" rel="nofollow">MoTDs</a> they received 22,558,769 pageviews for the month of June, and 1,332,402 pageviews for the day of July 11, 2006, which is far more the reported traffic for many other sites that have Wikipedia articles. As far as text-based RPGs go it is also the most visited/popular RPG according to the "Top &gt; Kids and Teens &gt; Games &gt; Online &gt; Roleplaying &gt; Harry Potter" category on Alexa/Amazon <a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse/general/?&amp;Mode=general&amp;CategoryID=1235449&amp;Start=1&amp;SortBy=Popularity&amp;R=True" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse/general/?&amp;Mode=general&amp;CategoryID=1235449&amp;Start=1&amp;SortBy=Popularity&amp;R=True" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. --Theluse 15:29, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As a staff member of Hogwarts Live, I can verify that the site is incredibly active, it is my responsibility to run maintenance on the site, including removing users who haven't signed in in a long time, and I run my deletion script hourly with over 6000 active users remaining (6336 at the posting of this comment) which you'll note is a larger number then either of the usercounts listed on the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legend_of_the_Green_Dragon_8bbb.html" title="Legend of the Green Dragon">Legend of the Green Dragon</a> listing on Wikipedia. One look at our <a href="http://stats.hogwartslive.com" class="external text" title="http://stats.hogwartslive.com" rel="nofollow">stats page</a> shows that we are consistantly receiving over 1 million pageviews each and every day. We were indeed featured in a Denver Post article in the summer of 2005 about the rise in popularity of Harry Potter RPGs, and among sites running the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legend_of_the_Green_Dragon_8bbb.html" title="Legend of the Green Dragon">LoGD</a> code, we have one of the highest online counts at any given point in time. I urge you not to delete this page, while it really should be updated (I'd be glad to help), it does not deserve to be removed. The site deserves the notability that it has received and will continue to receive. --<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPortalcap_419e.html" title="User:Portalcap">Portalcap</a> 04:23, 6 August 2006 (UTC) (known on HogwartsLive as Edmund)

<p><b>Keep</b> Seems to be notable, especially if it's been mentioned in a newspaper and a television program. All it really needs is sources. The Denver Post and the IPTV program could be referenced, even if they're inaccurate (if this is the case, something like "The Denver Post<a href="http://link" class="external autonumber" title="http://link" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> says that..." would work). The Alexa links could be used as references too, when citing claims about the game's popularity.

<p><b>Delete</b> I believe this article should be deleted for several reasons. First, the wikipedia article for "Hogwarts Live" fails to mention its prior violation of the creative commons license(the license for the source code it uses). This article seems to have several other biases which conflicts with wikipedia's philosophy on neutrality. It is little more than an advertisement for the site, rather than an accurate wikipedia entry on the subject. A properly formatted article would include information regaurding licencing issues and problems with source code redistribution within the open source community. The article is mearly a "we like this website" entry. I also agree with the above posters comments on the number of pages referencing "Hogwarts Live" on a search engine would be highly inaccurate due to the fact that in the book series students LIVE at the HOGWARTS castle. Lastly, have to disagree with one of the above posters: The sites online count can not be entirely accurate either because the auto-logout time is 10,000 seconds, which is a very long time. A user can appear on the online list for almost 3 hours after they stop playing. The "online count" that the software uses makes the assumption that a user "logs off" when they have finished a session. Unless a user is accessing the site though a school, library, or some other public computer system, there is no need for a user to "log off" officially. This means that if a player is "playing" for five minutes, he/she will still appear to be playing to the rest of the world via the online count for an addtional two hours and forty-five minutes. Should the Hogwartslive people wish to use active players as a justificaton for inclusion on wikipedia, they should be willing to use a counting system that reports such player activity accurately. --Andrew 9:22am August 9th, 2006. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.121.176.182 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.121.176.182_e207.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.121.176.182">contribs</a>) 13:23, 9 August 2006.</small></p>
<ul>
<li>Sounds like an entirely reasonable way of counting users to me; being a browser-based game, there's no real way of telling if someone is still online. Oh, and the Google search was for the word "Hogwarts" immediately followed by the word "Live", which doesn't come up in contexts not related to this game as much as you might expect. - <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakomk_1f87.html" title="User:Makomk">makomk</a> 16:12, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> In response to Andrew's message above, I would like to point out that HogwartsLive never violated the Creative Common's License, our modified version of the source code has been available throughout our development of the project, we also actively submit new modules to the LoGD community, a couple of my own becoming popular (if you want proof of that, do a Google Search for my name, Nicholas Moline, you will find hundreds of listings that correspond with the module list on hundreds of LoGD installations). As for the online player count, I very commonly purge the entire online list, knocking every user out of the game, and within 10 minutes the online list is back to between 100 and 400 online users. I do not wish this comment to be the insight of a flame war in this thread, however your previous statement was defamatory, which I assume you knew, because you did not actually sign your post, you just put a name and a date there. <a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPortalcap_419e.html" title="User:Portalcap">Portalcap</a> 17:43, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

I am familiar with the community's opinions on <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">Wikipedia:Fancruft</a> as well as Wikipedia <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">policy and guidelines</a>. I have been asking other Wikipedians on their opinions concerning whether this article should be deleted and have received mix responses. I know personally that I have found articles that in many respects are less notable than this one, such as <a href="../../../i/s/f/ISFDB_0c2f.html" title="ISFDB">ISFDB</a>, Archspace, or <a href="../../../h/p/a/HPANA_2f5a.html" title="HPANA">HPANA</a>, useful, educational, and even interesting. Notability seems to be based on one’s own subjective interpretation of whether or not a source is reliable. I would like to examine this page <a href="http://stats.hogwartslive.com/cgi-bin/awstats.pl?month=07&amp;year=2006&amp;output=refererpages&amp;config=hogwartslive.com&amp;framename=mainright" class="external autonumber" title="http://stats.hogwartslive.com/cgi-bin/awstats.pl?month=07&amp;year=2006&amp;output=refererpages&amp;config=hogwartslive.com&amp;framename=mainright" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, which shows not only that the Hogwarts Live article is read by a great deal of people, but that many websites directly related to the topics of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> or <a href="../../../r/o/l/Roleplaying.html" title="Roleplaying">Roleplaying</a> are referring users to Hogwarts Live. As you can see for the month of July, 1369 users were referred to HL via its Wikipedia entry. The term "sciencecruft" has sometimes been used as a sarcastic opposition to deleting obsolete topics due to certain biases concerning their pertinence. There is no official policy on fancruft, and I would not consider it a legitimate reason to delete an article. Wikipedia aims to incorporate elements of "specialized encyclopedias" among other things. I do believe this article could be rewritten to be more succinct, clearer, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. To quote policy: "some editors may object if you remove material without giving people a chance to provide references. If you want to request a source for an unsourced statement, a good idea is to move it to the talk page." Also, I feel that the fact that this site receives a considerably large number of pageviews (over <b>1 million</b> a day) in comparison to many other websites that have Wikipedia articles, is testament to its notability. Alexa lists HL in a similar traffic range<a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=hogwartslive.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=hogwartslive.com" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> as sites such as <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=pepsi.com&amp;url=pepsi.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=pepsi.com&amp;url=pepsi.com" rel="nofollow">Pepsi.com</a>, <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=freeadvice.com&amp;url=freeadvice.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=freeadvice.com&amp;url=freeadvice.com" rel="nofollow">FreeAdvice.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=mpogd.com&amp;url=mpogd.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=mpogd.com&amp;url=mpogd.com" rel="nofollow">MPOGD</a>, all of which are popular in their respective industries. Just to get this out of the way I would like to state that I disagree with the recent proposed deletions of Space - Glory Through Conquest, <a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_Online_0aa9.html" title="Pirates of the Caribbean Online">Pirates of the Caribbean Online</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Final_Fantasy_characters_82bd.html" title="List of Final Fantasy characters">List of Final Fantasy characters</a> (including many others), and will proceed to further voice my opinions on this matter on their appropriate deletion discussion pages. However, if I am indeed mistaken and none of these articles are worthy of Wikipedia entries, I’ll be more than happy to copy the contents of these articles over to a Wiki I started as a sort of supplement to Wikipedia, which does not allow as much freedom for fans to create detailed articles on the minutiae of certain <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fandom.html" title="Fandom">fandom</a> due to the fact that the average reader will not find them pertinent or in many cases "notable". This is just my perspective on this matter, not a vote to keep or delete this article, as I said my opinion is obviously biased, and is more of a assertion of what I believe are the merits of these articles that are often described as fancruft. Thanks for hearing me out.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAriadoss_a3f2.html" title="User:Ariadoss">Ariad</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">o</font></a><a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAriadoss_a3f2.html" title="User:Ariadoss">ss</a> 18:07, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is very self-referential to Wikipedia and is not suitable for the main article space. Most information from here cites either meta or other Wikis, neither of which is generally an appropriate source of information. I would suggest moving it to the WP namespace, but this content is already there.

<li>Okay, I've cleaned the article up. It's now three articles (sorry), but three good small articles. <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Venturini_45e2.html" title="Bob Venturini">Bob Venturini</a>, <i><a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob%27s_Big_Adventures_fb89.html" title="Bob's Big Adventures">Bob's Big Adventures</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../a/n/_/An_Hour_with_Bob_fa52.html" title="An Hour with Bob">An Hour with Bob</a></i>. Now, if I can find sources for these articles, I can't see them harming anyone, sitting off to the side.

<li><b>Comment</b>- That search is not entirely valid, because it doesn't count hits that spell the title differently, like "Space: Glory Through Conquest." A more flexible search turns up <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Space+%22Glory+Through+Conquest%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Space+%22Glory+Through+Conquest%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">over 9,000</a> hits. That may still be an undercount, because the article says the game is "commonly referred to simply as <i>Space</i>." Another search (which probably is an overcount) which tries to capture references to the company and the game <i>without</i> the "Conquest Through Glory" phrase, gets <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=space+%22coldfire+studios%22+OR+coldfirestudios+-%22Glory+Through+Conquest%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=space+%22coldfire+studios%22+OR+coldfirestudios+-%22Glory+Through+Conquest%22" rel="nofollow">55,000</a> hits. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice">Groggy Dice</a> 22:33, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak oppose</b> - OK, that search with 55,000 hits was apparently mostly coming from Coldfire's own site; taking them out leaves less than 1,400 hits. On the other hand, taking the site out of the search that got 9,000 hits actually increases the count to 12,000! Obviously, Google's way of counting has some quirks. Nevertheless, I'm going to oppose. The article has been around over two years before someone questioned its notability. "Major" events or fads that were "all the rage" can suddently become obscure, so I'm reluctant to take current judgment over that of editors at the time. (Just recently, I had to de-PROD <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fucked_Company_d598.html" title="Fucked Company">Fucked Company</a>, which then got put up for AfD!) Alexa rankings are a moving target, sites that once had a day of "glory" can fall, making it appear as if they were never notable. This makes me hesitate before throwing out all the work that has been done on the article. At the very least, I'd like to see some of the content <b>merged</b> with the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coldfire_Studios_22ea.html" title="Coldfire Studios">Coldfire Studios</a> article if it's deleted. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice">Groggy Dice</a> 17:10, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Worthwhile article</b>- This is my first comment, dunno if I'm supposed to do it this way, but whatever. Space was at one time a very popular online game with thousands of unique players. While it has since lost some players, it still has a dedicated core of 2 or 3 hundred players, along with a steady flow of new players. I don't see how this article is hurting anyone by remaining on here. The article was only meant as a way for people unfamiliar with the game be able to find some quick knowledge about the game before they dive in--User:Splat! - dedicated Space player for 5+ years 02:33, 11 August 2006 (Entered by User:72.230.7.122)</li>
<li><b>STRONG OPPOSE:</b> If Wikipedia is not a game directory, then I guess the multiple categories of games should be marked for deletion, as well. There are 50+ games listed in the category "Massively Multi-Player Online Games," and that is only one category. Additionally, this COMMUNITY of people is close. The Space: Glory Through Conquest folks have surpassed the national, ethnic, and religious boundaries to form a wonderful subculture. The "Game" is a living socio-cultural artifact, and has brought people from all over the world closer in bonds of friendship (and sometimes enmity, but it is a parody of war, afterall), and thus remains an important facet of hundreds of people's daily lives. Those who are members of this special Community find it disheartening at times to be separated from it. The players are passionate about the game, each other, and their community. Newcomers are welcomed heartily, and friendly people are willing to help them transition easily into the Space culture. -User:Mistress of Mayhem, Game Admninistrator and Community member/player for almost 4 years. 06:30, 11 August 2006 (UTC) (entered by 71.193.227.97 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.193.227.97_8db5.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.193.227.97">contribs</a>))</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Article claims it to have won two awards, which is one of the conditions for passing WP:SOFTWARE. I would advise players, however, to review the notability guidelines, as simply being a great game, while great, doesn't mean it belongs in an encyclopedia. In this case, I think it does pass the line though, if the article is cleaned to conform to article guidelines (namely being an article rather than a guide)-<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">‽‽‽</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">⁂</a> 06:33, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Why delete a valid article?</b>- Especially when so many other games are listed here as well. Space is a great social experiment as well as an online game and deserves credit for that as much as anything else. We are not a gun catalogue and yet I see countless articles detailing the finer points of many weapons. We are not an aviation handbook and yet I see many articles on aviation. We are not a tv guide and yet I see many articles on tv shows some even with future air dates. What we are is an online encyclopedia listing many, many interesting articles and to a gamer an article about a game can be very interesting. Or does Akradecki have an issue with gamers reading articles about things they are interested in? I bet he has no problem with articles that he is interested in being posted on here. The simple fact is, if you have no interest in the article you do not have to read it. Leave that to those of us who are interested, and leave the article here for those of us who are interested in it. Why alienate the gaming community by removing our articles? Is what we have to say not as valid as what you have to say? --User:Gypsy2976 Space player for 5 years and gamer for many more. 06:44, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Awards are mentioned on <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> though, wich seem more relevant (it is played entierly over the web after all, not distributed as a software package). Though I guess that depends on on wether or not you consider a "game of the month" award from Multiplayer Online Games Directory to be a "well known independent award" or not. Note that while the game is currently "past it's prime" it was fairly big 3-4 years ago (as far as browser based games go), here is a snapshot of the forums back in 2001<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010802064924/forums.darkent.com/space/phpforums/" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20010802064924/forums.darkent.com/space/phpforums/" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> snowing a great deal of activity even then, note that the forums have been wiped clean 4-5 times so you need to use the web archive to find most of it now. Just saying that with huge commercial graphical MMPOG's taking over these days, current trafic rating should be taken with a grain of salt when judging the notability of a browser based game that's been around for a good 5 years. IMHO anyway, though my bias should be obvious from a look at the article's history (in hindsight I do agree that is is probably wirtten a bit too much like a game guide though), my recomendation would be to <b>keep</b> it. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 11:44, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Can anyone please explain why articles concerning on-line games are considered unsuitable for Wikipedia? If we can understand that, then the case for deletion would make more sense. Is it a case of "using Wikipedia for commercial purposes"? If so, would that same principle not be applicable to a number of other articles related to commmercially available products (e.g. comic books)?
<p>Just curious.</p>
<p>[Edit] Ah. I didn't see the links about "notability" prior to this. May I ask what constitues a "non-trival" publication, aside from the listed mention of newspapers/ads/etc.?

<li>A non-trivial published work is a work that is more than a simple directory listing ("Game name: X Description: Y Author: Z"). A printed game guide written by a third party would be non-trivial, for example, as would a magazine feature article that discussed the development and marketing of the game.

<li>Noted. Thank you. May I verify that a third-party novel (non-reviewed, but in print, and selling) constitutes a "non-trivial source," or is it required that the publication be about the game as a whole, as opposed to simply characters <i>within</i> the game? <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/tdzk.61186767" class="external text" title="http://www.cafepress.com/tdzk.61186767" rel="nofollow">Tales from Taenaria novel</a>
<p>That said, the notability criteria mentioned the winning of a third party award, which is mentioned in the "Acheivements" section of the article in question. This strikes me as sufficiently valid, but that's merely a personal opinion. {Stan Johnson)<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.32.231.224 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.32.231.224_143f.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.32.231.224">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: With respect, that comment seems a mere matter of semantics. Who is it, in Wikipedia, that determines what constitutes "notable"? The listed criteria states "The website or content has won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or organisation.[6] " Where is the line of "well-known," and who determines that? Until such guidelines can be satisfactorily established, it appears to me that the article in question meets Wikipedia's requirements for basic "notability."

<li>And I'm still waiting for an answer about novels by independent authors. Per the following comment, "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.[7]" I can see it going either way, based on interpretation. Still, the distributor (CafePress) is most decidedly independent of TDZK, and seems fairly "well-known."(Stan Johnson)

<li>The first is a study of a group of game players within (and outside of) the game, and only tangentially mentions the game itself. It <i>might</i> be a useful source for an article on symbolic cconvergence, but it isn't a useful source for an article on TDZK, since it tells us nothing about the history, development, or structure of TDZK. The second isn't actually the study of the game by Virtual Society itself, but a document saying no more than that TDZK is something that "will be studied".

<li><b>Keep</b>; Peephole, you clam that winning a "game of the month award" is not notable? I would be interested to see yourself having the ability to create a game that can win such a competition. Staff and developers work hard for this game, and consequently the realise of TDZK Nomad is upcoming. This promises to bring with it a lot of unique developments, opportunities, and press. Novels such as “Tales from Taenaeria“ would not exist if the lore and physics had not been set down in the game. Such sites that list such games should also not be considered “trivial”, such sites are essential to the distribution of information about games that are not developed by large software companies, without such sites it would be near impossible for single, or small groups of developers to distribute software, and advertise their product. For such games to even get even a mention in such articles as <a href="http://mt.sh.se/~hernwall/text/Hernwall_cyborg.pdf" class="external free" title="http://mt.sh.se/~hernwall/text/Hernwall_cyborg.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://mt.sh.se/~hernwall/text/Hernwall_cyborg.pdf</a> and <a href="http://unseen-u.org/~denubis/tdzk/TagonsToughsCaseStudy.pdf" class="external free" title="http://unseen-u.org/~denubis/tdzk/TagonsToughsCaseStudy.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://unseen-u.org/~denubis/tdzk/TagonsToughsCaseStudy.pdf</a> is a hard feat to achieve, there are many thousands of games out there which will never be included in this kind of study, this must consequently mean this game has some fetchers which make it unique. --Maya tekla 11:10, 4 August 2006 (UTC) <small><b>Note:</b> No edits outside this AfD</small>

<li>When scientists announced that the Human Genome Project "will be" studying the human genetic code, that didn't make it any less notable or important as when they announced that it was complete.

<li>Wrong. An encyclopaedia article on the human genetic code cannot be written until after studies of it have been performed and published, just as an encyclopaedia article on a game cannot be written until after the study on that game (which no-one has so far offered a citation for, and which thus possibly was never actually done at all) has been performed and published. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:48, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>- I'll answer your question. The only people who can actually physically delete something are administrators. No one else has a delete button to click. That said, this page is here so that non-admins can debate the merits of the page, rather than have some guy just up and delete it (unless it meets the criteria for speey deletion, like spam or a vanity article). The admin reads the debate, and decides whether it is deleted, kept, or kept due to no consensus, which means that it can be re-proposed for deletion sooner. I'm not an admin, but look up- there's not a single "delete" written here. A lot of talking without votes, which is unusual, but I'm not exactly seing a consensus to delete. It will most likely be kept.

<li><b>Commment</b> repost doesn't work for previously speeded articles. They need to go to AfD since reposting is basically a challenge to the speedy.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I don't think thats correct. That only applies if the article isn't still speedyable under other speedy criteria. <i>This clause does not apply if the only prior deletions were speedy or proposed deletions, although in this case, the previous speedy criterion, or other speedy deletion criteria, may apply; when no criterion applies, the recreated page may not be speedied, but may be submitted to Articles for deletion or the appropriate XfD process.</i> So if it was A7'ed before and nothing has been done to correct that A7 it can still be A7'ed, I believe. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 19:56, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Apparently self-published (or by a publisher with no other authors, anyway), which makes his author credentials doubtful. However, he seems to get a lot of attention around the web from a lot of different people.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> He certainly has made a widely recognized contribution to his particular field: he founded what might be the most radical diet in the western world. His books (whoever publishes them) are clearly being reviewed by independent groups and people. Even [<a href="http://www.pangaia.cc/raw.html|Pangaia" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pangaia.cc/raw.html|Pangaia" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>], a permaculture resort in hawaii, lives entirely on his Primal Diet. I know that's not listed as a criterion for notability but it should count for something. The number of pages returned in a simple google search of him, as well as the nature of those hits (many being interviews and book reviews) suggests that he is not too "obscure" for wikipedia. Whether he is a "nutter" or not really doesn't affect notability. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Applewhite|Marshall" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Applewhite|Marshall" rel="nofollow">Applewhite</a>] has a page. He's a "nutter". Aajonus Vonderplanitz, or his supporters, are not invading wikipedia to try to gain exposure. His article should remain because it's easy to imagine a scenario in which someone would hear of him and then look him up on wikipedia to learn more about him.

<p>Hi My name is Persi and I would just like to ask if you have been following the discussion regarding the deletion of the article on RockWay Press. I have provided several very valid sources and it would mean a lot to potential authors who surf for information on this publisher to be able to read this article. If you have visited the sites that link from the article, you would see a lot of discussion from people like me who have been burned by this publisher and by scam publishers in general. I realize Wikipedia isnt a consumer protection site -per se - but it does have the visibility needed to help people learn more about this company in particular and about scam publishers in general. Preditors and Editors is the most reputable site in the publishing world regarding rating publishers. This weekend, they gave Rockway their red "Not Recommended" rating. However if you surf the name Rockway on Google, you will find that there is no connection from P and E to Rockway listed -- even if you surf hundreds and hundreds of listings. However, Wikipedia is the first listing on page two. There are thousands of people out there writing every day -- thinking they have what it takes to be the next Dan Brown. The publishing world is tough to break into - and when a company like Rockway offers what seems to be an easy entry, many people go for it - only to be burned big time. When a person writes, that work is their intellectual property. It is akin to giving birth to actually write a book. And it is unfortunate that people like Rockway can so easily take away not only your dreams but your intellectual property as well. Google Rockway, please. Note how high up on the listing the Wikipedia page is. Think about innocent victims all over the world who just might see that listing and read it before they send any money or sign anything. Realize that the article here also offers these people the ability to link to sites like Preditors and Editors where more information to help them is available. Not too long ago, I was a neophyte like that -- I had NO idea what Preditors and Editors even was. I came within a breath of signing away a very good book I put my life into to Rockway. Since then, I have joined with others who work within the industry to bring these scams to light. Please let us have the chance to reach more people through Wikipedia. Your positive comments would be much appreciated. This is not a personal matter -- if you read the Absolute Write site, you will see that only today a new victim posted. There are more and more every day. Thanks for listening. Persi --Persiphone hellecat1 05:27, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Absolutely NOT true == written by someone who defends authors and helps to keep them from fallig into scams. People deserve to be notified when some scam exits. Not a single word is supposition. You can go to the sites mentioned in the article and read for yourself that this publisher is mentioned in reputable Writers Beware Sites. You can also go to their very own site and see that the 2004 winners of their contest are still awaiting thier prizes. There is not one single word of supposition in here. I am a reputable free lance author myself and I do not write supposition. Persi</p>

<li><b>Comment.</b> Although I know nothing about book publishing, I do know a little about music publishing. "Artistic" contests any description send a shiver through me, but then again, there are bona fide song contests, so I assume the same in book publishing. The owner of this business has had books published by reputable publishers. The citations in the article are from forums, so I would discount them for Wikipedia purposes, as the likelihood is that they are disgruntled authors (and like the music biz, I bet there's millions of them!). The claimed fact that the owner is a coffee bar waitress doesn't hold water - using that as a criteria would make people in the film industry redundant! Missed deadlines are not enough to <b>prove</b> a scam, otherwise I shall be listing my rail company. As for the quotes from the Rockway site, they could be changed tomorrow. Having said all that, I have every sympathy with the creator of this page - I have my own website to expose the more dubious practices at the shallow end of the music business, so I know how difficult it is the pin facts on the matter. For this article to hold water I'd like to see a legal judgment cited. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichhoncho_144b.html" title="User:Richhoncho">Richhoncho</a> 02:42, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
I absolutely will source it now. If you did look at the company's site, you would notice that there are NO books published among the winners of the 2004 and 2005 contests. There are literally thousands of would-be authors world-wide trying anything just to get published and they turn towards these contests and small publishers as a way to get into the book business. I will cite now.</p>
<p><br />
I believe the article is properly sourced now and represents an invaluable tool to potential authors as an example of the type of publishers to avoid.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Perhaps the right thing to do would be to turn this article into a more general article entitled something like "Writing Contests", which would point out that many publishers run such things and that while they can encourage starting writers, they are frequently scams and rarely lead to real publication. And then RockWay Press and such could be redirected there. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 01:17, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>You are absolutely right, Richhoncho - she has had books published - by someone else - doesnt it seem odd that a publisher uses someone else to publish her own books while she is unable to publish anyone else's?? When you win a contest in 2004, one would think that by the eighth month of 2006 you would have recieved your prize. This is a serious problem for authors who no longer own the rights to their own works and cannot even try and get them published elsewhere - just because they sent 25 dollars to Rockway and entered a contest. The forums I linked show comments from authors. Preditors and Editors is not a forum. It is a well known site where authors go to verify agents, publishers and contests. They have spoken out against Rockway and advised authors not to use them. In the publishing business, that holds a lot of weight. True, lateness for deadlines isnt necessarily a sign of a scam, however late by over two years certainly isnt a good sign is it?</p>

<li><b>Further comment.</b> As I say, I have every sympathy, if I was an author I wouldn't touch this company with a ten-foot. It's not I don't appreciate your concern for authors, It's just that I am convinced that WP is not the place to do it in this instance. Preditors and Editors only say "might" which leaves us with the possibility of <s>slander</s> libel, &lt;of course&gt;. Are you saying that Rockway retains copyright on <b>all</b> submissions?

<p>Yes, If you read their rules for contest submissions, ALL entries must be accompanied by a signed contract, making ALL entries - whether they win or not ... technically their property Oddly enough, this article has been on WP for quite a while. It was taken down when one of my kids decided to use my account to get into that thing that happened on TV the other day. Before that, there was never so much as a word of comment on the page.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I didn't see where they claimed copyright, what I did read was <i>"The copyright will be registered in the author's name, and all subsidiary rights (i.e., book club, foreign rights, film, stage, etc.) remain with the author."</i> Totally bizarre, in my opinion, but not the same as you say.</li>

Thank you ... If you go to the "submissions package requirements section of the contest guidelines at <a href="http://rockwaypress.com/annual_writing_contests.htm#contents" class="external free" title="http://rockwaypress.com/annual_writing_contests.htm#contents" rel="nofollow">http://rockwaypress.com/annual_writing_contests.htm#contents</a>, you will see that ALL entries must be submitted with a signed and notarized contract - making even losing entries their property. Extremely bizarre -- totally unprofessional. That means that they can simply declare no entry "worthy" of first place and yet retain legal custody of all entries. This is one of the issues currently being discussed widely among the publishing industry and one of the reasons people are being warned about this company and this contest in particular. There are way too many innocent victims of these contests. Sure, 25 to 35 dollars isnt a lot when its one entry,but consider hundreds of entries - from as far away as Au., and it adds up. Also consider that people outside of America have very little chance of fighting this legally. It's hard enough for legal action from one state to another and nearly impossible for a would - be author in Au. to fight this. This is why I am publishing in as many locations as I possibly can so that it gets seen and read. Wikipedia is a logical choice. It has high visibility. Incidently no where did Preditors and Editors use the word "night" . Their entry for Rockway under publishers reads "Not recommended. A publisher. Site features good information about publishing business that writers should know. Despite their good information, P&amp;E is hearing of complaints regarding this publisher in its dealings with authors." That is pretty clear. And their entry under Contests reads "RockWay Press 2005 International Writing Competitions: Charges fee. See the web site for full details. While this publisher has earned a Truly Useful Site Award from P&amp;E, P&amp;E does not endorse their competition." I think that pretty well indicates that Preditors and Editors, a well known and reputable site has done their homework and made a responsible decision to post the negative listing. They, too have to consider liability and they have heard from RockWay authors and decided to go all the way to list RockWay as "Not Recommended." The owner of that site is well known in the Publishing Industry. His name and phone number are listed. Certainly if he was unsure about this decision, he would have said something less specific. I think that certainly explains why a Wikipedia listing is justified. Thanks for your interest and your dialogue ... it is certainly helping me in my fight against this company. Only two months ago, RockWay was still recommended by P and E -- I have fought hard to get very frightened RockWay authors who have been threatened if they spoke out to to step forward and write to P and E with their experiences, earning Rockway first the "Despite their good information, P&amp;E is hearing of complaints regarding this publisher in its dealings with authors" part of the listing and finally this week the "Not recommended was added." I am proud of my efforts. Incidently, my knowledge of this scam first came about when I very nearly signed a RockWay contract myself. A book written by me was accepted by them and I was thrilled until I read their contract and retracted my book before she got her claws into it. I thank my Creator for that every single day. Others are not as fortunate as me. But I hope some will learn about the publishing business from this and about RockWay specifically. Thank you.

<p>FYI - New information has been added to the page at Absolute Write == another author who is being harassed by Rockway has surfaced and has posted her story there. I think it should be very clear what kind of company this is and how important it is to protect would-be authors from them. Please help spare others from this kind of abuse.

<p>I have read the policies and I know that after five days, there is a decision based on a consensus of opinion. And I cant help but wondering about your interest either. Your profile states you are new and yet you've been lurking here 6 months and yet you feel you have the right to determine what is unencyclopedic. Are the listings for Random House, Harper Collins, Doubleday and Little Brown also unencyclopedic? They're publishers too. You use the term "We" -- is that a royal "We" or are you Wikipedia? Do you have any knowledge of the publishing industry to make a decision about this article? Authors are funny people. We do the research, put our heart and soul into what we write and along comes someone who offers no credentials for his opinion but has the right to get an article deleted just because he says so. I find that a little bizarre and I would say that I am not the obsessive one here. I have simply done as the rules for deletion say and done my best to justify this article in an effort to make you understand and form a more educated opinion. It seems you are the only one who seems to have a problem with this article and I just want to know why it offends you. I have offered more than enough evidence and clearly justified everything the article says. I have also asked is not Wikipedia not a place for people to come for information, and is this information not as important as the number of elephants in the world. I have also said this article existed before for a very long time with absolutely no issues until it had to be re-instated. That's apparently when you discovered it and decided to tag it for deletion based on absolutely nothing. I deal with authors every day who are harmed by Rockway and others like them. You dont. Yet you seem to believe that somehow it is only your opinion that matters. Why is that? I am not trying to get into an arguement here, I simply want to know why the deletion of this article is such an important issue to you and on what grounds you have the right to say so. So far you have said nothing except that you viewed it as an "attack". I have justified the facts with sources proving it isnt an attack but merely information published to assist authors in making responsible decisions regarding publishers- one in particular. This was an experiiment. I have many other publishers I had intended to write articles about and link - each with a similar story. Wikipedia is high notice -- it gets attention. When you google a topic, the Wikipedia listing is right there at the top. Wouldnt it seem to you that would be a good thing for authors to be able to see? After all, words are our bread and butter. I simply want this listing to stay. I worked hard on it and did my homework, as I always do when I write, and someone simply comes along and for no reason at all says, I think it shouldnt be there, and I want to know why such an opinion as yours matters and holds more weight than the work of an author publishing a well researched article. If that is obsession in your eyes, so be it. In my eyes, someone who randomly selects an article and decides it should be deleted with no information to back up their opinion is the obsessive one. This page is here for the purpose of explanation and discussion and that is just what I am doing. Unfortunately, I know no other authors who are registered Wikipedia people to come here and express their opinions. They read Wikipedia only and the information regarding deletion clearly states if they register now, "new" people's opionions don't count. Where do you stand on that? Your profile states you are new. --Persiphone hellecat1 22:50, 7 August 2006 (UTC)--Persiphone hellecat1 22:50, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I am trying very hard to understand your comments. I have added an article for Preditors and Editors, and I have cross referenced them. However I do not understand the part about WP:LIVING. I read the information and I'm not sure at all I understand it. I am not aware of doing anything that put it in that section. If you would kindly advise me how to proceed it would be most helpful. I would be interested in adding other articles regarding the publishing industry and just want to make sure I'm doing it right. I appreciate your reading my comments and taking them into consideration, but I require additional assistance. I am also not sure I understand the difference between sourcing the allegations and not the analysis. Please explain and I wil do what I can to correct it.

<p>I removed the founder's name from the article. Further information can easily be obtained by going to the link to her site, correct? So perhaps her name isnt needed here.

<li><b>Comment.</b> As the substantial editor of the last edit I have read the comments above and will add my <b>delete</b> in for good measure. However, it does strike me that those that merely considering it an attack page have slightly missed the point - an attack page should be deleted if not verified, in this case I have verified from primary and secondary sources. If disparagement is a reason for deletion here then every listing at WP that is here merely because the subject is a murderer, accused terrorist. pedophile etc should go too, for the exactly the same reasons. RockWay, in itself is certainly not notable, but there is a large industry selling "talent contests" who are no more than scams, and because those that pay their money haven't lost the house, it doesn't ever become "public news." - which was the reason for my getting involved here. however, there are valued, legitimate talent contests too, so an article Writing Contests are bad just wouldn't work.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> This kind of thing almost makes me wish we still had subpages.

Merging with the main Basilisk article would be doing it a disservice IMHO, as this kind of things have a way of growing our of controll and take over the article.

<p>possible vanity, I did get two google hits in the first few pages that were relevant...but they were on the 2nd page or lower. The link to the award doesn't show any award that I can see, and I'm not sure that an award from that site is sufficient criteria for notability.

<dd>There's nothing "invalid" about it. It's just that articles on online things need to be on subjects which live up to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. In the case of this article, has the animation <i>been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself</i>? Not that anyone can see. Has it <i>won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or organisation</i>? Again, not that anyone can see (one comment above deals with the nature of the award the animation is credited with, and it's neither well-known nor independent). Is it <i>distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators</i>? Well, the site seems to be independent of the creators, but it's not well-known. Therefore, it isn't sufficiently notable to qualify for inclusion. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 06:46, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The awards side of things doesn't impress me in the slightest, as neither of them are "well known and independent". They're probably independent, but they're far from well-known. Fourth place by some standards applied to animations uploaded or reviewed (hard to tell from the link) that day isn't a well-known or independent award. Neither is being the "link of the day" at another site. As regards the well-known and indepedent site, I'll leave that to someone more versed in internet lore. The comparison to <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numa_Numa_aede.html" title="Numa Numa">Numa Numa</a> is not as impressive as you may think, either, as it would easily qualify via other sections of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> - the fact that it exists at Newgrounds isn't going to count against it. It also doesn't work in "all senses" with the standards we're citing, as it hasn't been the subject of publications independent of the site itself. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 23:37, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Explain?
<ul>
<li>Explain what, exactly? The remarks about the awards? Firstly, I'd contend that an animation which wins "Fourth Place for today" has hardly won a significant award. The same goes for something which wins "Link of the Day". Think about it - is a local "Battle of the Bands" trophy the same value as a Grammy? I should hope not. The remarks about the publications? One of the standards of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is that the animation would need to be <i>the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself</i>. I see no proof that it has been that, so it fails that part of the test and therefore your claim that "in all senses, it works with the standard" is false. The comments about <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numa_Numa_aede.html" title="Numa Numa">Numa Numa</a>? Without getting into too much detail right now since we're talking about this animation rather than anything else, Numa Numa is <i>substantially</i> more well known than this animation is. At no point is this AfD saying that "all internet phenomena must be deleted from Wikipedia" or anything like that. What it's saying is that there are standards, "Illusions of Immortality" doesn't live up to those standards, so it should be deleted. It's nothing personal. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 23:57, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Public Enemy's "director of enemy relations" (i.e. director of press/public relations) is quoted as describing Welsing and Fuller as the two most controversial race theorists in America today, responsible for "some of the strongest and most relevant writing done on racism, raciality, oppression and other race issues." (If you have access to a news database you can pull up the whole article. Otherwise you'll have to pay a few bucks to the WaPo to see it online) This connection, plus the limited but verifiable level of attention given to Fuller by Afro-American radicals is sufficient enough for encyclopedic notability, in my deletionist opinion. Both the Fuller and Welsing articles need updating to note this link to Public Enemy, and also a general cleanup. The Fear of a Black Planet album article should also note the links. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a>

<li>Change that to <b>Keep/Merge</b>. Mac Media Center seems to have been established as the name for software for the Mac that emulates <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_Media_Center_3754.html" title="Windows Media Center">Windows Media Center</a>. The fact that <a href="../../../i/t/h/ITheater_84db.html" title="ITheater">iTheater</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/n/CenterStage_7cb3.html" title="CenterStage">CenterStage</a> both call themselves "mac media center" suggest it is a new generic term for that class of software. I would suggest the page can be merged into <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_center.html" title="Media center">Media center</a>, but that's a merge discussion outside of AFD. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 18:33, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes CenterStage and iTheater use the term, does that change the fact that it is a neologism? Don't we have <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">a policy against creating pages about neologisms</a>? <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 18:39, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The policy is <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO"><i>Avoid</i> Neologisms</a>. How else are you going to explain a new class of software without using a neologism? <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 18:41, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>By using something that isn't a neologism, like <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_center.html" title="Media center">media center</a>. Note that <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_Media_Center_3754.html" title="Windows Media Center">Windows Media Center</a> is just a redirect. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 18:43, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then you have something that can be moved or merged, not AFD'd. Besides, the neologism rule is usually used against articles that are about neologisms themselves, see <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 18:46, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You do realise the article is just composed of four sentences and two of them are not even really about "Mac Media Centers". And "Mac Media Center" is a neologism, if you can find a secondary source (while WP:NEO says we need) I'd be very surprised. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 18:59, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Further <b>comment</b> In response to 164.8.4.123's question on my talk page, one of the admins monitor AfD will take care of closing and relist as necessary. We can start talking about <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> now. The applicable guideline, <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>, hasn't been approved by the community yet, but it would require some third-party coverage of the organization, which is pretty similar to our existing <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability policy</a>. That being said, we have a leader from the organization participating in this AfD. If there is any third-party or press coverage, I'm sure they are aware of it and can point it out to us. But until that happens, I'd have to still say delete.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I checked the notability on Google. The association publishes European Election Law News and this publication gives over 15.000 hits on Google. Moreover, it is cited by emminent political scientists on their webpages - Arend Lijphart (an undisputed authority on elections and former president of APSA) and Matthew Søberg Shugart of University of California are just two of them.The Association has been recognized in official documents by the governments of Azerbaijan (<a href="http://www.cec.gov.az/en/5millimajlisre2006/international%20observers.doc" class="external free" title="http://www.cec.gov.az/en/5millimajlisre2006/international%20observers.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.cec.gov.az/en/5millimajlisre2006/international%20observers.doc</a> ) and Slovenia (<a href="http://www.arrs.gov.si/sl/rezultati/06/inc/rezult-vabljena-1-rok-06.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.arrs.gov.si/sl/rezultati/06/inc/rezult-vabljena-1-rok-06.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.arrs.gov.si/sl/rezultati/06/inc/rezult-vabljena-1-rok-06.pdf</a> ). It has been mentioned in several media where the name has been translated into German, Croatian, Azeri, or Slovenian language - see for instance <a href="http://www.mladina.si/dnevnik/53379/" class="external free" title="http://www.mladina.si/dnevnik/53379/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mladina.si/dnevnik/53379/</a> ). 194.165.113.151 19:36, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's true, but the first publication just lists the organization. Though I couldn't find it in the second document, I expect it just lists it like the others.

I'm still not seeing it. Perhaps newspaper coverage? By the way, if this is the same person behind the dynamic IP, you should just vote once, as multiple votes aren't counted.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 19:43, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>hehe... no it's not the same person. but it was someone I told about the discussion and he checked the google and post a comment. i just read the deletion guidelines and it says that "the second deletion discussion is not necessary". i guess that means that once the article is deleted it cannot be relisted again? if that's so, then i suggest i delete it myself before it gets deleted by someone else; i will relist it in october when the association is about to publish a book with one of the major publishing houses. i'm sure there will be a lot of media coverages then. would that work for you? however, i still dont understand why an organization that is recognized by such people like Arend Lijphart and Michael Pinto Duschinsky should not be in Wikipedia. Suggest me to delete it and I will. Topjur01 20:34, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Just let it sit. An admin will get to it and delete it. Feel free to leave me a message at my talk page when that book gets published.

<p>What does the article mean when it states "Furanolactone is a lactone that uses the furan ring structure." Since once the two-position has the double bond to the carbon atom and the single bond to oxygen atom, you can only make a single bond, and not a double bond, as the statement implies (a lactone would need the C=O double bond, whcich would be impossible as specified before). Other arangements may be possible (with only one double bond, etc.), but this article gives a misleading discription (I originally wanted to add a chem structure, but then ran into this problem). Very little context, room for expansion. Only google hits I found where mirrors and refrences to a "diterpenoid furanolactone columbin" which appears to be unrelated.

<li><b>Comment</b>. OK, this has gotten me curious, so I've done a bit of research. The article says that furanolactone is the same as furan-2-one. Furan-2-one is a real compound with the structure at the right. However, Chemical Abstracts (the authorative chemical database) does not include furanolactone as a synonym for furan-2-one. The term "furanolactone" does turn up in the chemical literature, but only to describe a broad class of natural chemical compounds that contain both a <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furan.html" title="Furan">furan</a> ring and a separate <a href="../../../l/a/c/Lactone.html" title="Lactone">lactone</a> ring, which are completely distinct from furan-2-one. This is probably what <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">User:WilyD</a>'s Google hits are turning up too. An example is the hallucinogen <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvinorin_A_fd75.html" title="Salvinorin A">salvinorin A</a>. So there are two separate things here which the <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furanolactone.html" title="Furanolactone">furanolactone</a> article seems to conflate. --<a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdgar181_7e9b.html" title="User:Edgar181">Ed</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/g/User_talk%7EEdgar181_fd91.html" title="User talk:Edgar181">Edgar181</a>) 17:30, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The way the game is set up, you kind of have to create an account to find out yourself what it is about. It is frustrating that there is a lack of independent sources with information on the game; this is one reason I've been working on this article. Some of the information in the article is the kind of thing I would have liked to have known before signing up, to help me decide whether it was worth my while. Maybe you should try playing the game, and see for yourself if it is notable. Meanwhile, here's some <a href="http://donberg.blogspot.com/2005/08/why-gokrida.html" class="external text" title="http://donberg.blogspot.com/2005/08/why-gokrida.html" rel="nofollow">food for thought</a>.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I wasn't suggesting you consider the blog a source. Just that you rather thoroughly read the GNHF site and the links in the blog for some insight, as it's probably the most useful information you're likely to get outside of participating in GoKrida. And I think it's intriguing that what is essentially a browser-based fantasy sim was considered worthy of funding by the NHF; that must have been some interesting sales pitch. <a href="../../../b/7/t/User%7EB7T_0f2e.html" title="User:B7T">B7T</a> 19:07, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> There is a link there now to the National Heritage Foundation's donation page for GoKrida. I'm not sure if that counts as a reliable outside source as to notability, however I do question the basic idea of Wikipedia being only for things that are notable enough to have garnered mainstream attention. What differentiates Wikipedia from Brittanica is precisely that it is an encyclopedia of many things that are not "notable" to the mainstream press, but nonetheless may hold some interest for a niche audience. As an early example of a web browser game being recognized as an official educational or national heritage resource, that may confer upon it some degree of notability. 68.146.221.26 21:40, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>How should I know? That's why it needs sources. If it has developed a player culture, that suggests some significant number, though. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 18:48, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b>So you're just guessing it has a significant number of players?
<ul>
<li>Not exactly. I'm relying on indirect evidnece. If I said cars were commonplace in Elbonian society, that would be a strong indication that they are an industrialized society. It's quite impossible to tell how industrialized based on that. Basically, the information in the article couldn't be true without a few thousand players.

<ul>
<li>Maybe I should had done a little more research before relying on NHF for a notable source. In the previous AfD discuss user <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> brought a good point about GoKrida's ties to the NHF. I looked it up on their website and this is all you can <a href="http://nhfdonations.newc.com/default.cfm?Action=DonationsDetail&amp;foundationID=9668" class="external text" title="http://nhfdonations.newc.com/default.cfm?Action=DonationsDetail&amp;foundationID=9668" rel="nofollow">find</a>. I decided to see what the NHF was about. I found this:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>One of our main objectives is to popularize the use of Foundations. We want to make foundations accessible to everyone, regardless of income level. A Foundation at NHF is inexpensive to start (only $385 application fee) and inexpensive to operate. NHF does all the “administrivia” for you, including receiving all donations, writing checks and making disbursements from your foundation, sending charitable receipts for donations to your foundation, all accounting, state and federal compliance and reporting.</p>
</blockquote>

<dd>So in other words these people sell non-profit tax-exempt foundations for $385.

<li><b>Comment</b>: (Sorry, a bit of a rant follows.) This AfD has been relisted twice now, and it seems very few people are willing to discuss it. The previous AfD concluded the article was a keeper, and those who have participated in this one generally seem to think this article might be worth including; can't we leave it alone for now? Is it necessary to actually have a consensus? <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Nexus_War_c3c7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Nexus War">Nexus War</a> was recently retained with no consensus, although granted that was a more spirited discussion.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Because of the uniqueness of the game, I think it may be worth keeping, it's very different from other games in its particular category (if there is actually one). --<a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAriadoss_a3f2.html" title="User:Ariadoss">Ariad</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">o</font></a><a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAriadoss_a3f2.html" title="User:Ariadoss">ss</a> 19:20, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comments</b>: Arguably there is a uniqueness to this game that can be seen objectively. Unfortunately, it's hard to demonstrate this without becoming a participant in GoKrida. And yes, one could also argue that participants have a vested interest in the game and would necessarily think of its uniqueness as a positive thing; but there are many who try it out and give up <i>because</i> it is so unique, and they can't quite "get" it; this could explain a regular player base that still seems small, even though GoKrida has actually been around for several years. And one would think that several years' worth of existence should have given GoKrida some sort of notability by now, yet I still can't find anything to cite from noteworthy independent sources, although I am continuing a search for such things to improve the article. <a href="../../../b/7/t/User%7EB7T_0f2e.html" title="User:B7T">B7T</a> 22:30, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>2 cents</b> I think to have this information is valuable but it could be explained more extensively so it is not an advertisement. When I did a google search for this and found it on wikipedia I went right to it. With the extensive lubrication problems with post menopausal women and the high level of premature ejaculation in men it is good to find these products. Granted you could find them without this listing but if they could expand on the science of their product and why it is safer to use their product it would make it more helpful for people who are concerned. ie. why latex safe, glycerine and yeast infection, lidocaine and potential problems, etc... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 63.144.35.172 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.144.35.172_cdec.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.144.35.172">contribs</a>) 2006-08-05 12:50:08 (UTC)</small>

<li>Yeah, right. For example, "Ireland Unfree" appears to be written by Brian Warfield (of the Wolfe Tones), see <a href="http://www.theballadeers.com/WT_D14_spirit_nation.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theballadeers.com/WT_D14_spirit_nation.htm" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.padraigmor.com/irelandunfree.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.padraigmor.com/irelandunfree.htm" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>. The Wolfe Tones only formed in 1963 <a href="http://www.regorecords.com/wolfetones.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.regorecords.com/wolfetones.html" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>, but maybe historical signifigance starts earlier these days. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Stephen_33a8.html" title="User:Mr Stephen">Mr Stephen</a> 20:26, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><i>Wild-type</i> simply refers to the most common strain of an organism in existence, free from artificially induced mutations. It is nonsense to say that wild-type is the antithesis of antiviral resistance, since the latter is a phenomenon and the former a classification. While the article does contain some correct information, I feel that this request would better be served by redirecting to either <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiviral_drug.html" title="Antiviral drug">antiviral drug</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiretroviral_drug.html" title="Antiretroviral drug">antiretroviral drug</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't know much about the topic, but believe that the suggested redirects are not a good idea. In general, X should only redirect to Y if X is covered by the topics dealt with in article Y. That is not the case here. It may be better to remove the incorrect information and leave a stub to be expanded by knowledgeable editors. There are plenty of Google hits on this as a search term. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 10:18, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If the article is currently incorrect but a notable topic then it should just be rewritten. A redirect would be fine too (with the correct content covered in the redirect targets, as Lambiam says). Since there is no reason to hide the current content of the page, neither of these require an AFD&#160;:). If you wish to rewrite or redirect, just reply on this page that you wish to withdraw the AFD, and an admin will close it. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_26.html" title="July 26">07-26</a> 11:26Z</small></i></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The reason that "wild-type virus" will pull up hits on Google is that wild-type is an adjectival phrase used to describe any organism that has not been tinkered with by scientists or is not otherwise mutated. Having an article for "wild-type virus" is analogous to having an article for "red car" or "fast airplane." If you don't approve of my redirect suggestion, I will expand the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild-type.html" title="Wild-type">wild-type</a> stub and redirect to that. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngiotensinogen_8660.html" title="User:Angiotensinogen">Angio</a> 17:41, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Almost a half of the hits also reference HIV or AIDS therapy, so something is going on there. You also get more hits for "<a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Red_Corvette_b4cb.html" title="Little Red Corvette">Little Red Corvette</a>" than you would expect from the juxtaposition of "little red" and "Corvette". --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 07:53, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's because "<a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Red_Corvette_b4cb.html" title="Little Red Corvette">Little Red Corvette</a>" happened to be used by Prince for an album title. I think the analogy is somewhat ill-considered, because the phrase "<a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild-type_virus.html" title="Wild-type virus">wild-type virus</a>" carries no denotative or connotative meaning beyond the sum of the meanings of its two parts. In my own opinion, which I believe to be substantially qualified by experience beyond the layman's, this is a useless and misleading article. Those who want to know what "<a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild-type_virus.html" title="Wild-type virus">wild-type virus</a>" means should, upon finding there to be no article by that name, break the phrase into its two logical components. They will be much better served by doing so. Please redirect <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild-type_virus.html" title="Wild-type virus">wild-type virus</a> to wild-type. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngiotensinogen_8660.html" title="User:Angiotensinogen">Angio</a> 18:15, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Run of the mill pervert. There are many, unfortunately. This one was newsworthy in the UK at the time of his most recent crime, and during his trial and conviction. But his subsequent notability is not proved: the rare appearance of a common-or-garden perv seldom leads to lasting notability or future fame.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Although I certainly may look foolish as a minority of one, I must respectfully disagree with my fellow editors above and retain my "Delete" opinion. First of all, I do not believe that the single reference to Franchise Magazine, a non-notable publication itself, satisfies the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> requirement that <i>"Articles should rely on credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy."</i> Second, since the subject's only claim to notability is the founding of <a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffee_Republic_7ef1.html" title="Coffee Republic">Coffee Republic</a>, itself a non-notable company, I still do not believe the article passes the requirements of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I realize that this is all probably moot at this point, but I just wanted to clarify my position.

<li>As the main contributor to this article, I must say that deleting this article is a decree that no Magic deck is significant enough to receive it's own page. From a scholarly point of view, there is IMO no deck that is more influential than Ravager Affinity in the game's history. The deck dominated tournaments in multiple formats, was at the forefront of the community for years, and caused unprecendented actions by the game's creators. I have tried my best to make this article encyclopedic. It has wiki code, the text I wrote is as clear as I can make it, and it cites references. It has no decklist, mulligan rules, game scenarios, play tips, sideboarding strategy, or metagame concerns. For contrast, <a href="http://www.starcitygames.com/php/news/article/8001.html" class="external text" title="http://www.starcitygames.com/php/news/article/8001.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> is an evolvutionary history of Ravager Affinity which is encyclopedic in nature and <a href="http://www.starcitygames.com/php/news/article/11614.html" class="external text" title="http://www.starcitygames.com/php/news/article/11614.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> is an example of a "strategy guide", what we in the community normally call <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primer.html" title="Primer">primers</a>, deck clinics, or in this case a tournament report, which are not encyclopedic. As a compromise, specific decks could be defined on their own list page or on their specific <a href="../../../t/h/e/Magic%7E_The_Gathering_deck_types_7acb.html" title="Magic: The Gathering deck types">their archetype page</a>. I have developed a decklist template but I have refrained from using it since it appears that Magic decklists are not encyclopedic but rigorous strategy detailing <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_Knights_Defense_c313.html" title="Two Knights Defense">Two Knights Defense</a> is. I could nominate <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latvian_Gambit_3b26.html" title="Latvian Gambit">Latvian Gambit</a> for AFD for the same reasons here but it would probably be shot down, that and my stance on AFD is extremely lax for an Internet-based encyclopedia. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorrYtt_0f05.html" title="User:NorrYtt">NorrYtt</a> 17:13, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>"<i>I must say that deleting this article is a decree that no Magic deck is significant enough to receive it's own page."</i> Yes, this sounds about right. Please don't try to make comparisons between MTG and chess in terms of notability and significance. Magic has been around for 13 years and chess for more than a thousand (in its current form, about 500). Chess is played and/or recognized by many more people (by orders of magnitude) in many more countries than Magic. I won't even get into tournament attendance and prize payout figures. You bring up the example of the <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_Knights_Defense_c313.html" title="Two Knights Defense">Two Knights Defense</a>, which has existed for more than four hundred years and studied by every chess player above the beginner level for centuries; do you honestly think it's worth comparing its importance and notability to a Magic deck that did not exist three years ago? And please know that I say this as someone who has enjoyed Magic immensely for more than a decade, and who hasn't touched a chess piece in almost as long. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 17:36, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Was prodded by me, but deprodded, so I'm bringing it here. The argument for inclusion on the talk page is that BZPower, a <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionicle.html" title="Bionicle">Bionicle</a> fansite with over 30,000 users, is included, so this site, with 135 users, should also be included. The site itself is hosted by freewebs, a sure sign of non-notability. Incidently, the main Ty article isn't very good - the effort put into this article should be directed there. <a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas">Nydas</a> 09:29, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> First of all, I reverted the redirect back to the article, including the AfD tag. Not just should the article be deleted, but it should not be a redirect. The site is not nearly popular enough for it to have any presence on WP. It completely fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. In addition, it should not be a redirect, as that 1) implies that the site is somehow significant, and 2) implies that anyone would search that term (which is highly doubtful). -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 00:00, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Against Deletion</b> True, TYR may be small in its present state, however it is growing at an incredible pace and we are also the only TY site to have recent information on the upcoming TY games (plus information on the recently cancelled TY: Gunyip! ), plus some very detailed articles for the two recent TY games (TY1's page is being revamped). Krome Studios, the developers of TY, also visit the site regularly and post exclusive information about the games in development. TYR is also the biggest active TY The Tasmanian Tiger fansite/community on the web right now, and getting bigger every day. By this time next year we fully expect to have over 1,000 members. TYR is becoming extremely popular in small corners of the net, and it can only spread from there. TYR's still on FreeWebs, yes, you have us there. However, we intend to buy a server within a year and move the contents of the site there, thus taking the site off of FreeWebs and making TYR a "true" independent site.ToyoWolf 06:25, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Please see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, specifically <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7Enot_aa34.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:not">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. You (and I mean the general "you", not "you", ToyoWolf, in particular) cannot attempt to assert notability by saying "This could be popular one day," or "She could get famous if...," or, in your case, "We fully expect to have over 1,000 members" and "We intend to buy a server within a year." Also, please look at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> for criteria for inclusion in Wikipedia concerning web sites. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 21:39, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Against Deletion</b> It just needs time to grow. Just read what Toyo said. But what I'd like to ask is why you even care? It's a small article, I don't think it should take up very much disk space. Does every byte count or is rule enforcement at top priority here? Oh, and Kotzu, one of the mods there, has something to say about this.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Oh my God that is one arrogant and stupid person. The only reason he wants to delete it is because he thinks his Halo and holy Grand Theft Autos are so much better and that you're a n00b for liking Ty(He blatantly leads me to believe that).</p>
<p>Here's a thought, Kicking222. Maybe some people aren't old enough to enjoy your blood and gore splattered games that you also lead me to believe you play. Ty is the perfect game for kids 6-11. Or maybe some people actually appreciate the effort, innovation, and fun in a Ty the Tasmanian Tiger title(me). Maybe if you stopped listening to your dieties such as IGN and actually approached games with an open mind, we wouldn't have this problem.</p>
<p>The only reason he's against it is because he doesn't like Ty. Plain, and simple. Because I'm pretty sure that if it was the biggest Halo forum on the net, or the biggest Half-Life forum on the net we were talking about, he wouldn't have a problem with it. He said this site was insignificant, and that no one would search for Ty the Tasmanian Tiger. Bullshit. The members of the freaking DEVELOPMENT team go here. Do you hear me, kicking222? THE MEMBERS OF KROME STUDIOS POST HERE, GIVING THE SITE A HIGHER SIGNIFICANCE THAN MOST FAN FORUMS. Jeez." A direct quote of his post. - Superkid11, mod of TYR.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm simply going to respond in order of what you stated. 1) I couldn't care less about the "disk space"- I doubt Wikipedia could hold an <i>infinite</i> number of articles, but it could certainly hold <i>a lot</i>. The concern is notability; in building an encyclopedia, we (meaning you, me, and everyone on WP) must have some standards. If every web site had its own Wikipedia article, then, obviously, WP would be larger than the entirety of the rest of the Web. 2) I'm not sure how <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP's rules on not making personal attacks</a> applies to quoting other people, but I still don't appreciate it. I'm not attacking you for your views, and I should not be attacked for mine; our views are equally valid. For the record, I do adore <i>Halo</i> and <i>GTA</i>; I also love the <i>Ratchet &amp; Clank</i> games, the <i>Tony Hawk</i> games, the <i>NBA Street</i> games, the <i>Dance Dance Revolution</i> games, and games in pretty much every genre (besides RPGs and strategy games). I have absolutely nothing against the <i>Ty</i> series's games; as I have never played them, I cannot judge their quality. However, you can be sure that if a <i>GTA</i> fansite's article was up for deletion, I would argue for its deletion unless it could be proven that the site was particularly significant. 3) In addition, <i>size</i> of a web forum matters, and I'm sure the largest <i>Halo</i> or <i>Half-Life</i> forum is many dozens (if not hundreds) times larger than this <i>Ty</i> forum. I understand that staff members on the <i>Ty</i> team posts on your forums, but I know of (for example) more than a few <i>GTA</i> fansites that have direct correspondence with Rockstar (in fact, the pamphlet/booklet/whatever you want to call it for all of the PS2 <i>GTA</i> games have "Thank yous" for half a dozen or so sites), and none of them have articles. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 21:39, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Look, I'm a mod on the site and I seriously think the site doesn't need a page. If it becomes big enough, we might get one. But for now, there's realy no point.... Kotzu really shouldn't have said all that stuff, and SK shouldn't have posted it here. -- <a href="../../../p/o/k/User%7EPokemega32_1222.html" title="User:Pokemega32">Pokemega32</a> 02:47, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Dont Delete</b> - For those of you who believe this article is in good use thank you and for those who think it should be changed and deleted please wait. I made this article and no I am not trying to make Germany look good or I am not saying the Ranking based on teams winning the most is wrong, all I am saying is to just take note of these rankings and compare and contrast them with the others. I am an American and I have been on the US side. Even my cousins are Italian. Besides that, I will still be editing this for the next couple of days so give me some time and I hope to keep everybody satisfied to the best of my ability. Though I will not change this ranking system. Maybe I could bring out the great records of other teams into the article to create more of an equality. I believe there is no need to delete this and if you want it merged then I will accept your suggestion. Thank You for your opinions. Kr2kewl No Time, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Unnecessary duplication of material already available elsewhere. Also 'medals' is a strange term. Medals? It's not the Olympics, there's no podium, gold, silver and bronze. There's a trophy, which one team wins, and then there are second place, third place and fourth places determined. Sure, individuals are given medals (including individuals in the 4th place team), but its not common to speak of teams winning medals at the world cup. The most successful team is the one that's won the most trophies.

<li><b>Moderate Change NO NEED FOR DELETION</b> - True, but i believe this author has a point. Maybe the page should be merged. Medals are given out for first, second, and third. I mean Brazil has won the most and yet their success was not too great this world cup. I suggest changing the ranking to most successfully consistent teams. And yes with this title, the Germans definitely appear to be very stable and consistent with their results apart from all nations to compete in the world cup. Gunit555 20:22, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Makes a point No Deletion -</b> This person makes us understand the great teams and if anyone has any objections, there is no need for a deletion especially when you could go to the other fifa page and see the rankings based on titles. So everybody relax there is no need of great criticism. These rankings do make sense and believe it or not the top three teams happen to still be Brazil, Germany, and Italy, except with standings of consistency like the critic above me said.

<li><b>Comment</b>. One reason I removed the PROD is that I know that many Coptic immigrants are upset that there is generally little attention paid in this country to the plight of Egypt's Copts. Since PROD is for "uncontroversial" deletions, and I could picture a Coptic axe-grinder objecting, that solidified my sense that I should de-PROD. However, I'm finding that actually Wikipedia appears to say very little about persecution of Egyptian Copts. For instance, the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_in_Egypt_40eb.html" title="Religion in Egypt">Religion in Egypt</a> entry has a section on the persecution of Baha'is about as large as the "main" content, but not of Copts, despite the many times greater size of the latter community. We have an article on <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_rights_in_Egypt_94c2.html" title="Gay rights in Egypt">gay rights in Egypt</a>, but as far as I can tell, none on discrimination against Coptic Christians. I'm sure a Copt advocate will find his way to Wikipedia eventually, but right now there's a systemic bias issue. Perhaps, if you consider this incident (which I'm sure wasn't the largest riot even in Alexandria's history) too "trivial" to sustain its own entry, a <b>merge</b> or <b>rescope</b> would be more in order. Anyway, I'll listen for the time being and hold off on casting a vote. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice">Groggy Dice</a> 05:26, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, that's not a dangerous precedent. Its how Wikipedia works. Please read the central <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> guideline that helps us decide which articles should be included in the encyclopedia. You should also read our core policy on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> that requires all information added to articles be verifiable. Finally, you should know that this is a discussion, not a vote. Even if you get a lot of your friends to "vote" keep here it doesn't matter unless you can back up the opinions from Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Please read <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> for more details. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 02:30, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As far as the top 500, this makes the entry at cduniverse.com more than a simple price listing (it is also denoting popularity) which means that it is a non-trivial published work.

<dd>Which of those sites is the one that that says that, as you put it, "this movie series is a very important and notable series in the annals of contemporary pornography?"

Not even any <b>user ratings.</b> You ask us to believe these movies are important, yet apparently no imdb user has bothered to rate it. There is only a single external review, in DVD Talk, and <a href="http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/read.php?ID=14872" class="external text" title="http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/read.php?ID=14872" rel="nofollow">the review</a> says nothing about its being of any importance in the annals of contemporary pornography. It says basically that it is an "oral only film" and that people who enjoy such films will likely enjoy this one. It notes that the film isn't very grainy, and that the lighting could have used a little work but "it's not really bad." How does this add up to an important porn film? It hasn't even been reviewed seriously. For some of the films in this series, imdb lists <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0352920/" class="external text" title="http://imdb.com/title/tt0352920/" rel="nofollow">no reviews at all</a>.</dd>

<li>That makes no sense. If it is only a "plot summary" (where is the plot summary here, by the way? Does describing the focal sexual act of the films qualify as a plot summary?), then the solution is not to delete it but to add other things besides a plot summary. In fact this article already includes other things. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:58, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, for pornography, describing the focal sexual act often (and in this case) is a plot summary. If there are parts missing, then it is even less than a plot summary. There is no sourced analysis; the only line that qualifies as achievements is lacking citation. So as I see it, without a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">source</a> verifying something to the effect of the work's achievements, impact or historical significance within the article, it fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. As mentioned above, the onus of providing sources lies on the editor who adds content; not on the editor who questions the content added.

<li><b>Comment</b> From what I could find in trying to clean up the article, the emphasis of this series is definitely the act itself, and may qualify as a sub-sub-genre of the "oral" sub-genre (assuming such exists, I'm a bit out of my element, here). That being the case, what else (generally) should be in an article along those lines? (By the way, if you're going to stop switching sides, I'll stop cleaning up articles that I don't particularly care about.&#160;;-P So there.)<font color="#FF6600">—</font><a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChidom_6af4.html" title="User:Chidom"><font color="#FF6600"><b>Chidom</b></font></a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChidom_7139.html" title="User talk:Chidom"><font color="#660000"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></font></a>&#160; 00:16, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Whole different comment</b> I'm not seeing evidence that many of the editors have revisited the article and reviewed their recommendation since the article was cleaned up. Is this something that should be given some attention? Or do we generally just let the process well enough alone and hope that people who made a recommendation put this AfD article on their watchlist and are aware of the changes? In any case, it might be nice to have them add "reaffirm recommendation after changes" to their original comments.

<li><b>Delete in this form and if verifiability is not fully achieved after this discussion ends</b> totally non-notable and non verifiable. The so called advocate from high court who has supported this seems to have no knowledge on wiki norms and seems to be a sock puppet. Also the remark on political interference is a general sickness of all malayalees. Whenever something happens which we do not like in kerala, we blame it on politics and the "hidden political hand". So these arguments are very stupid. Wiki cannot be controlled by such sick thoughts. Also the argument on "malicious intentions to defame" is silly as the magazine as such has no repute in the first place! Here all wikians have a right to defend what we feel and this does not paramount to any malicious intentions to defame and is outside the purview of any court.Since the editor of this magazine himself put this article here there is no case of "malicious intention to defame" as nothing objectionable has been published against him or the magazine here on wiki. I doubt this Sreekumar is an advocate. If he was he would not have made such foolish threats. Let him make such observations in the court. This is cyber space not a court! If he is so passionate on what he reads let him provide verifiable proof on the claims that it has 50000 circulation and such. This magazine does not have any state or national repute. It is just one of those yellow journalism magazines. Wiki is no place for such magazines. There are thousands of such magazines in Kerala. If all the editors of such magazines start to adverise their own names and their magazines on wiki we all would have to hang our faces in shame. Request to the advocate to come up with more solid material on web for supporting his claims. I will surely rethink my opinion if this article is well supported by the end of this discussion, instead of silly hollow claims. If you are an advocate prove it by doing some research and work on collecting evidence. See how the artcle on <a href="../../../p/r/a/Pradip_Somasundaran_cf58.html" title="Pradip Somasundaran">Pradip Somasundaran</a> was retained after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Pradip_Somasundaran" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Pradip_Somasundaran" rel="nofollow">discussion</a> gave way to the much needed evidence.Take this for encouragement. <a href="../../../g/l/u/User%7EGluewhale_a099.html" title="User:Gluewhale">GlueWhale</a> 02:08, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>'Don't delete'.....because the cartoon lovers accepted the magazine as their pulse to gag the society. Chiricheppu stands as a good social worker to keep every malayalam readers in smile.

<li><b>Comment</b>: From the above comment, one would think that those recommending deletion are trying to get rid of the cartoon itself instead of the article. At any rate, unfortunately, without any sort of verifiability as to the claims in the article, it cannot stand. I suggest spending more trying looking for sources indicating any sort of notability, rather than trying to sway us with anecdotal generalizations as to how great the cartoon itself is. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 14:53, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks a lot for that - the magazine does exist, which is a big step forward. That site also has a section for <i>publishers claimed circulation</i> but Chiricheppu doesn't seem to make any claims for itself. All the above <b>established</b> Indian editors seem agreed that it is non-notable so, unless some reliable sources can demonstrate notability, I'll leave the AfD nomination stand.

<p><b>Comment</b>- Dlyons, that it has been listed as a magazine is not the issue. Any indian magazine has to be registered with "Registrar of Newspapers" for official recognition and legality for publication in India. There are thousands of such magazines. So this finding is not big game. Even I have seen and read the magazine and have liked it! "Crime magazine" a yellow magazine is more notable than "Chiricheppu". So will we all support an article by its Propreitor tomorrow on Wiki? Wiki is not a place for self publicity and praise. It's also not a place for free publicity. There are norms here. We all should entertian articles only on wiki norms. There is no place for sympathy or it being good for health or society. Wiki works only on facts not on personal emotions.

<p><b>Delete</b> Very non-notable. I actually went and checked a few small book stalls in <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernakulam.html" title="Ernakulam">Ernakulam</a> over the weekend to see what it looks like but couldn't find any. These sort of magazines usually sell mostly in bus and railway stations where the travellers pick them up for reading during the journey. I can tell you that as of 1.30 pm last Sunday, the book shop in the Ernakulam busstand had <i>Hasyakairali</i> and three editions <i><a href="../../../b/o/b/Boban_and_Molly_e760.html" title="Boban and Molly">Bobanum Moliyum</a></i> among comedy magazines, but it had no <i>Chiricheppu</i>&#160;! If it does not sell in the main bus stand in the largest city in Kerala I am surprised that it sells any, let alone 50000, copies. There is also a possibility that it had sold out everywhere, but that is a little far-fetched. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETintin1107_b710.html" title="User:Tintin1107">Tintin</a> (<a href="../../../t/i/n/User_talk%7ETintin1107_ddb3.html" title="User talk:Tintin1107">talk</a>) 04:00, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Do not delete.</b> it is crystal-clear that someone who have vested interest who are trying to attack and defame this cartoon magazine.all the people who have good reading habits know this magazine.balrama comes under the category of childrens magazine. not under the category of cartoon magazine.someone who commented here that chiricheppu is a yellow magazine.what a stupid comment.most of the commented person are introduced themselves as people from other countries such as ireland ,australia.someone are forcing them to comment on this people. how the people from other countries can judge a magazine in malayalam.we -the kerala people is familiar with this magazine.chiricheppu is the unique political cartoon monthly in malayalam language.someone thinks that defamation is not a crime in cyber space.calling a cartoon magazine "yellow magazine" is highly defamatory.the cyber crimes in the country were booked under the Indian Penal Code,(sec499and500) rather than the Information Technology Act. computers were used to commit acts of crimes such as defamation is punishable both under indian cyber law and indian penal code.any person has the right to edit wikipedia.but no one has the right to spread defamation against a reputed magazine.the aim of wikipedia is great.one who is doing research on the history of cartooning it is really worthy to read the article published about Chiricheppu in wikipedia.how many political cartoon magazines are now available in malayalam...? please tell me friends...!Only Chiricheppu.that is why we the readers of chiricheppu is against deletion.any type of imputations published will hurt thousands of readers of chiricheppu.recent defamation case on cyber space is also cited hereunder:Fighting cyber crimes</li>

<p>Conviction in a cyber case in Pathanamthitta recently has increased the confidence of the public to file more such cases, writes Anand Haridas(The Hindu news paper reports)</p>
<p>After a couple of arrests of foreign nationals on charges of spreading defamatory matters, more people are coming forward to file complaints, say city police officials.another case: TRIVANDRUM - The Kerala police have made a mark in dealing with cyber crimes with the arrest of a 45-year-old former pastor and his son in a case related to the alleged defamating the chief of the Indian Pentecostal Church T.S. Abraham by using the new technology. The former pastor, T.S. Balakrishnan Nair alias T.S. Balan, who was associated with the Sharon Pentecostal Church, was arrested from his residence at Perumbavoor by the Pathanamthitta Police for spreading defamatory matters about Mr Abraham and his family members, including his daughter, through cyberspace.recently both the accused were punished for an imprisonment of 7years.</p>

<p><b>Don't Delete</b>From the interest only particular users of wi-kipeadia for the deletion of the article its evident they have personal interest in deletion.i have been to ernakulam and from the railway station i bought chiricheppu.if my dear frnd tintin din't get it from there that means <b>all the copies were sold out</b> .guys why you want to delete this genuine article.</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> That any fool can edit wikipedia is just a wish. The wikipedian admins are experieced people who constantly monitor it's content and they have all rights to decide on what is right, and what is wrong. It cannot be decided by some ignorant guys who pose themselves as IAS officers sometimes, and as Advocates some other times. It's a shame to the official community that those who are holding high positions do not even know how to write good english! So stop playing games here. Even if you put hundreds of comments here under different names, you will be still be caught red handed by the poor quality of your english! Please spend this valuable time in trying to improve your writing skills, and finding proof for it's notability instead of foolish legal threats. These threats will not hold as it's not in your right to put any stupid article here. Wiki has norms and will work only on norms not emotions. Regarding defamation, it's you who put this article here in the first place and now you are threatining those who oppose it's inclusion! Opposition does not amount to defamation. No one has said that your magazine does not exist or is not a cartoon magazine. There are thousands of such magazines in the "petti peedikas" all across Kerala which are bought by the layman, just to kill time. These do not contribute to any new knowledge of the reader. If you want real quality, read and see R.K Laxman's works. Where is he, and where is S.Jithesh of Chiricheppu! In Kerala there are only a few cartoon magazines. "Hasyakairali" is a better cartoon magazine than Chiricheppu. In the begenning Chiricheppu started off with much fanfare using inputs from the literary world. But now the state of this magazine is really alarming with most of Jithesh's cartoons not up to the mark. So the claim of 50,000 copies is not true. Support your claims, instead of resorting to lame threats and sock puppetry. I am from Kerala and so your allegation that all those who oppose this article live abroad is totally baseless. <a href="../../../g/l/u/User%7EGluewhale_a099.html" title="User:Gluewhale">GlueWhale</a> 07:46, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>There is a magazine called Chiricheppu, published every month in Kerala</li>
<li>There is a person called Jithesh who draws cartoons in that magazine</li>
<li>One of the independent editors of Wikipedia (not a single purpose account) has read for a long time that he has noticed that <i>In the begenning Chiricheppu started off with much fanfare using inputs from the literary world</i> and <i>now the state of this magazine is really alarming with most of Jithesh's cartoons not up to the mark</i></li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>That settles the notability issue at least to me. As far as I know there are no fixed criteria (like circulation of 1 lakh - readership of 50 lakh etc) for including an article about a magazine in Wikipedia. Hence, we have to follow the dictum of <b>If in doubt, keep</b> and hence <u>I am changing my vote to <b>Strong Keep</b></u> Also it is very clear that this magazine is non-notable in Uganda, Canada and Sikkim. What is the logic behind deleting an article about a malayalam magazine telling that it is not notable among Mr.Singh, Mr.Adolf and Mr.Hamaguchi. We should only see whether it is notable among Thomas, Varghese and Nair, it does not matter whether the standard was "once good" and "now bad" Notability does not differentiate between notable yesterday and notable today. Please note that I have not seen or read the magazine (I don't know Malayalam) but I am giving my opinion based on the opinion given by one user from Kerala <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorbruno_d35f.html" title="User:Doctorbruno">Doctor Bruno</a> 10:36, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Comment</b> Dr. Bruno, you are trying to slam my mouth down with wild imaginative meanings that you cooked up from my words. I have never said that I used to read this magazine regularly. Do not force words into my throat. Have you read this magazine? No. Then do not decide for others on whether this is notable or not. There are thousand of such magazines in Kerala, that I may have seen or read once in a while. This does not mean that all of them are notable. I have seen lot of "yellow magazines" on railway platforms and bus stands. Just because I have seen them, know the names and know about them does not make them notable. Most of them may be trash. Are you saying that we ought to host articles on every comic book, children magazine, cartoon magazine and trash from Kerala just because they exist? This is not what Wiki is for. So let malayalees in kerala decide on what is notable and what is not in their state. One who has not even seen it cannot decide on our behalf my friend. Let them come up with solid proof. Let some leading news paper comment on the "fighting for justice" aspect. Has this magazine received any awards? Has the cartoonist of this magazine received one? Well none of the protagonists(prtagonist) above are giving any proof except blindly stating that "do not delete". Lets decide this issue based on the out come of solid proof. Not just because it just exists. Mere existance is not a stamp of notability. Am not personally against this magazine or the cartoonist. Let's just follow Wiki norms. Personal opinions do not count. We have a job to do. If they come up with relevant information including citations keep it or else not. That's all. By the way the usage "vested interests" has now become stale. Every fool in Kerala who is not happy with his own state of affairs blames it on "vested interests". That's the root cause of all stagnation in Kerala. It's a lame and lazy excuse for your own shortcomings. We do not try to find what's wrong with ourselves. We blame it on others! <a href="../../../g/l/u/User%7EGluewhale_a099.html" title="User:Gluewhale">GlueWhale</a> 11:58, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey Cool down..... I am also not personally for this magazine. Just giving my view. I have clearly said that I have not read or seen this magazine. Please don't misunderstand me. And I fully support your view that <b>let malayalees in kerala decide on what is notable and what is not in their state</b> If you can see this is what I meant when I had alread said <i>only see whether it is notable among Thomas, Varghese and Nair</i>. This is a policy (notability decided by persons from that field only) which I would like to be on Wikipedia. But I am a little amused and curious when this advice (<i>Then do not decide for others on whether this is notable or not</i>) is said ONLY at me and not for others who might have never visited Kerala but has voted for deleting this article for the past few days. So if I am voting for delete, I can be any where, but if I am voting for keep, I should be a malayalee in kerala....

<li><b>Comment</b>hai! here is the evidential fact which you asked for, to quench your doubt about 'chiricheppu'..see the famous article named "jeevitham enne enthu padippichu" of SAMAKALINA MALAYALAM (Weekly owned by INDIAN EXPRESS) published on 15 october 2005 and I think it is suffice to appease your dubious attitude against CHIRICHEPPU and I strongly suggest you to restrain from the delibrate enimical attitude against the Chiricheppu.

<p><b>DONT DELETE</b>---CHIRICHEPPU- The humourous leading monthly in Malayalam plays a wonderful role in the history of malayalam journalism. It has developed a unique style of constructive criticism on social, political and cultural issues with brave,bold and brivity.This magazine is available in almost all leading libraries,press clubs, educational institutions and book stalls.With my long experience as an editor and cartoonist in leading news papers and journals, I strongly recommend the name of CHIRICHEPPU should not be deleated.

<p><b>Comment</b> Dr. bruno, your plea for evidence seem to be falling on deaf ears. The same person seems to be commenting under different names as is clear from the bad english usage. See the "Editor in Chief" of "The Analytical English magazine of India" who gave his valuable time to comment here, and see the standard of English he uses here! I would definitely fire such Editors, if I were the owner of the magazine! I think it's due time to take a decision. We are not going to get any evidence and nor are we going to have genuine users giving their opinions.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> To Clappingsimon. Hype, where is the hype?, Clearly you nominated this article for deletion because you are biased. But now that you did this, we have to deal the situation. I can't see any hype on the article, it presents actual information based on the internet and no speculations, they are facts. Add the Rotten Tomatoes info to the article and nothing will change and it would be fine. List of "extensive" awards? There's the bias with BBM. Well, then, the U93 article says that the info will feature the awards and nominations that the film probably will receive. For your information the BBM artcle is titled "Brokeback Mountain Critical Reception" and has some quotes from critics after the Crash victory, if you are biased towards BBM then please don't manifest yourself thru Wikipedia, it is a shame!. <b>Merge</b> both articles to the main articles, its the only way to be fair.

<li><b>Comment</b> "Please state your sources for this bit of non-hype So far, no film in 2006 had surpassed the critical acclaim of United 93." A little statistics 101. Average is the sum of all terms divided by the number of terms. United 93... 90% at RT, 90% at Metacritic, 95% at BFCA = (90+90+95)/300 = <b>91.7%</b>. If we do that with the other 13 movies over U93 in Rotten Tomatoes. <i>Kexexelu Mountain Patrol</i>: RT 98%, Metacritic 77%, No BFCA, Average:<b>87.5%</b>.// <i>The War Tapes</i>: RT 97%, Metacritic 76%, No BFCA, Average: <b>86.5%</b>. // <i>Iron Island</i>: RT 96%, Metacritic 74%, No BFCA, Average: <b>85%</b> // <i>Wordplay</i>: RT 95%, Metacritic 73%, No BFCA, Average: <b>84%</b> // <i>Little Miss Sunshine</i>: RT 93%, Metacritic 78%, BFCA 94%, Average: <b>88.3%</b> // <i>Dave Chappelle's Block Party</i>: RT 93%, Metacritic 84%, BFCA 76%, Average: <b>84.3%</b> // <i>Fateless</i>: RT 93%, Metacritic 87%, No BFCA, Average: <b>90%</b> // <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i>: RT 92%, Metacritic 74%, No BFCA, Average: <b>83%</b> // <i>Darwins Nightmare</i>: RT 92%, Metacritic 84%, No BFCA, Average: <b>88%</b> // <i>Neil Young - Heart of Gold</i>: RT 91%, Metacritic 85%, No BFCA, Average: <b>88%</b> // <i>The Death of Mr. Lazarescu</i>: RT 91%, Metacritic 84%, No BFCA, Average <b>87.5%</b> // <i>Devil's Miner</i>: RT 91%, Metacritic 81%, No BFCA, Average: <b>86%</b> // and finally <i>Shakespeare Behind Bars</i>: RT 91%, Metacritic 74%, Average <b>82.5%</b>. Well, to end the small discussion of the last two users, well I used Math, because math is accurate, and indeed United 93 is the film with the highest score of the year and Its true that no film had surpassed its critical acclaim, so can you argue mathematical results??. Well Mr. Clappingsimon how can all this information be added as a source? Because your statement after all is refuted by the statistics that I wrote on this comment. Plus, other films like The Godfather, Schindlers List that had won more awards than Brokeback Mountain don't have a separate article... Well, why according to you we had to make an exeption with Brokeback Mountain Awards? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.50.1.121 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.50.1.121_f099.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.50.1.121">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>You really need an intensive class of basic statistics... Actually saying that a simple average of three numbers is wrong, take your calculator and verify "Your maths is completely wrong" Give me a break! Geez! Some people!
<ul>
<li>Your maths is completely wrong because you are not taking into account the numbers of cases in each %. It's an easy mistake to make.

</li>
<li>Eliminate the BFCA scores, and take the arithmetic mean to each movie (two cases) and still United 93 gets the higher score. And if we take in consideration the number of reviews per movie per website, United 93 has a lot more reviews than all the other films. In proportion it still the highest. There is no way you can refute the argument, Try to find a way to do so and I will accept it. I will not waste my time arguing about insignificant things. Merge it or delete, I simply dont care, to avoid saying another expression!
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>You just need to multiply each % by the number of reviews of U93 on that website, then divide by the total reviews of U93 on all websites. It's really that simple.

<li>Sorry if I'm being a little rude, Im apologizing because you seem to be polite. Sorry Again. I'm doing it just like you are saying so, if I multiply each % by the number of reviews of U93 in Rotten Tomatoes, then divide by the total reviews of U93 on all websites and I do the same with Metacritic, i'll get two results, How I can incorporate them? " (RT% x #reviews) + (M% x #reviews) divided by the total of reviews?

<li>Strong if not Speedy <b>Keep</b>. Well-established word in Australia especially in Sydney. Concept which is well-established and is a well-known concept related to geography and class issues in Sydney.It is in the Macquarie Dictionary which defines it as
<dl>
<dd>1. a person, generally from an outer suburb of a city or town and from a lower socio-economic background. Compare barry2, bogan (def. 1), boonie, Charlene, Charmaine, feral1 (def. 9); Especially Qld bevan (def. 2); Chiefly Qld bev-chick; WA bog3; ACT booner; Tasmania chigger2.</dd>
<dd>--adjective 2. of or relating to a westie or to westies generally: a westie shirt. Also, Westie. [from west(ern), referring to the western suburbs of Sydney, + -IE]</dd>
<dd>Usage (language): From Sydney this word has spread throughout the country, despite the fact that the people so designated do not necessarily reside in the western part of an area. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 22:00, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> for the reasons outlined by BL. Widely used term and social phenomenon in both Australia and New Zealand. A lot of the article is verifiable. That which isn't should be edited and cleaned up, true, but I've never yet seen an article that should be deleted simply because it needs cleaning up. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 05:57, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The issue is that neither of these articles have any complimentary comments in them. Both Westies and Easties only contain derogatory remarks. This is a NPOV issue.
<p>The problem is that in the future with more common usage the Easties article will be resurrected even if it is deleted now. There are other terms such as Northies that are coming into more common use.</p>
<p>We need to delete both of these articles now to put an end to this. As long as Westies exists it gives reason for other articles such as Easties and Northies to exist.--<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiCats_43d6.html" title="User:WikiCats">WikiCats</a> 06:30, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Once we have verifiable evidence of usage of these other terms from reliable sources as we do with westies then we can write articles on them. We have enough verifiable information from reliable sources to write an article on the usage of westies. We don't on those other terms. We have articles on derogatory terms relating to race and gender amongst other issues so that isn't a reason for deletion. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 07:26, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Cleanup</b>. It is ridiculous to compare this with Eastie, as "westie" is widely used, even outside Sydney, as shown by its inclusion in the Macquarie Dictionary. This article has unverifiable info, etc, but it could easily be trimmed so that it does not. Eastie couldn't.

<li>The article was changed because I argued that it be kept because it could be better than it is. I don't feel this argument would have any integrity if I did not do what I could to improve the article. As Uncle G points out, this is normal practice. It is possibly true that as a result the argument may appear more convincing, but I think keeping the article in an inferior version in the hope that people will want to delete it is more likely to circumvent debate. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 16:32, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

I made the point above "The over-riding issue for the article is the fact that for several months it has had POV and Original research tags." The same day the tags were removed.</p>
<p>Removing tags is a serious matter. To do it without consensus during a major debate is against the guidelines.</p>
<p>Further to that the guidelines say "It may also be interpreted as an attempt to "hide" the old content from scrutiny by the community." --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiCats_43d6.html" title="User:WikiCats">WikiCats</a> 10:39, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
The irony of what is going on here is hilarious. Obviously it was the Eastie type people who started this social vilification when they started calling people from the Greater West of Sydney “Westies” and writing all these invented definitions. But the whole thing backfired on them when the West started using the term “Easties” and the Eastie article was written.</p>
<p>Now that social vilification has been turned back on them they can’t take what they dish out. Unfortunately their obsession with social vilification is so great they are unable to take a decision to put an end to it now. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiCats_43d6.html" title="User:WikiCats">WikiCats</a> 12:04, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please do not misquote the guidelines - they say that turning the article into a redirect may be interpreted as an attempt to hide the old content. They also explicitly encourage addressing issues such as POV and OR tags during the debate. You have completed missed my points as well. My point is that a Wikipedia article should be able to describe the "social vilification" and whatever else is associated with the term without participating in the social vilification. Removing the POV and OR material (and hence the tags) is the way to make the article do this better. We should not confuse using the term in a perjorative way with having an article about the term and portray this discussion as a battle between easties and westies. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 18:14, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Indeed, if you can address the points raised during the discussion by improving the article, you are encouraged to edit a nominated article</i>. And as to my feelings on the Westies vs Easties topic, I've never heard the word Easties (it's not used here in New Zealand), so it's completely irrelevant as regards my views on this article. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 00:52, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
The point that has been over looked is that an Afd does not prevent debate. I challenged the major changes.</p>
<p>Some of the changes were very curious. For example the See also section was completely deleted along with the link to Easties. Very strange indeed or was it an attempt to circumvent the Afds.</p>
<p>When I mentioned "The over-riding issue for the article is the fact that for several months it has had POV and Original research tags." the tags were immediately removed and more non neutral prose was added.</p>
<p>Huge tracts were deleted.</p>
<p>The history shows that for several months I have been combing the the article, removing unreferenced material and rewriting in neutral prose.</p>
<p>Suddenly persons who have shown no interest in the article or its problems start massive rewrites in the middle of an Afd.</p>
<p>I have challenged the contributions and they are under discussion here.<a href="../../../w/e/s/Talk%7EWesties_%28people%29_a967.html#Major_removals" title="Talk:Westies (people)">Talk:Westies_(people)#Major_removals</a> --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiCats_43d6.html" title="User:WikiCats">WikiCats</a> 11:34, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Obviously AfD does not prevent debate. Challenging the changes because there is an AfD going on does avoid debate. If you have indeed been removing all the non-neutral prose unreferenced material, then the NPOV and OR tags should not have been there anyway. The over-riding issue is not that the tags have been present for months, but that there has been POV and OR material present for several months. If this material is removed, then the tags should also be removed. I can't see any non-neutral prose that has been added, and you haven't mentioned any. As has been said several times already, it is quite normal for an article to have massive rewrites during an AfD, if the reasons given for deletion are that the article is of poor quality. This is what should happen when the state of the article is drawn to people's attention. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 13:13, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All well and good but the fact remains any contribution can be removed by any editor at any time, as I did. Then any disagreement goes to debate.

<dd>That's rather convoluted logic. NPOV means we have to have a balanced viewpoint in articles and in the encyclopedia as a whole - this means reflecting various sides of a debate even if one side is much larger than the other. No one is saying the ACJC is "as notable" as the CJC or B'nai Brith but they are notable because they represent a dissenting voice. Recognising that is not promoting their point of view, it's simply being NPOV as an encyclopedia. Similarly, if the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim_Canadian_Congress_6da1.html" title="Muslim Canadian Congress">Muslim Canadian Congress</a> had the same general viewpoint as the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Islamic_Congress_e1b1.html" title="Canadian Islamic Congress">Canadian Islamic Congress</a> there size alone (about 100, same as the ACJC) might not make them notable enough for an entry but as they represent a dissident liberal voice in the Islamic community (against Sharia law, for separation of church and state, for same sex marriage) their notability is established. We shouldn't be pretending that the Jewish community in Canada or internationally is monolithic and speaks with only one voice, that is not only POV and one-sided but it discredits the Jewish community and we shouldn't be doing that.<a href="../../../e/x/-/User%7EEx-Homey_391b.html" title="User:Ex-Homey">Ex-Homey</a> 21:58, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> -- the ACJC is just one example of a significant development -- the growth of organisations willing to speak out as Jews against Israeli policy.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I think you're reading too much into the "Inclusionists" article.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Any insults on my part come from me alone and have nothing to do with whether or not I believe the inclusionist creed. As for that creed, my point is that if an article has already been created, is accurate and truthful and doesn't harm or liable anyone, why not let it stay? <b>Note</b>: When I went to the Wikipedia (my primary general information source) after seeing the BoingBoing post and entered "Interweb medley" into the search dialog, not only was no article returned, <b>the standard Wikipedia plea for the user to CREATE an article if it doesn't exist was displayed.</b> I chose to follow that invitation to create the article.

This isn't even yet an internet phenomenon, and any notability that it currently has is "instant" notability by borrowing from existing notable internet phenomena. That Cory Doctorow liked it doesn't make it any more notable. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 03:40, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> No more obtrusive than articles on albums from obscure artists. The criteria cited above for article deletion, e.g. number of google hits, should not necessarily be taken into account as the song is new. The main reason for my vote: the article combines through linking many other quality articles. If the article in question is eventually removed, the original author should add info on the "Interweb medley" to the respective song articles. <a href="../../../r/f/e/User%7ERFenno_052a.html" title="User:RFenno">RFenno</a> 05:08, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am getting 12000+ Google hits for <b>interweb medley</b> and 14000+ hits for <b>"interweb medley"</b>. Are you sure that you spelled it correctly when you searched? I know nothing about songwriting and recording but I doubt this creation was only a day start to finish - and since it utilized some sort of recording technology, I doubt it took place at a school. The "day" test is specious anyway, particularly with art or pop-culture or news events. Arbitrarily declaring the worth of something based on an uninformed third party's guess at how long it took is a yardstick for nothing. Some of the greatest artistic achievements in the world took less than a day... Some of the most narcissistic and lame took months or years. You get the point. I hope that nobody is still under the impression that I am the song's creator or have any connection with the song.

<li><b>No Delete</b> - Firstly this is not a commercial software its open source. This entry was not posted by the developer. The software is indeed a very remarkable software as we don't have one like this on the Windows platform. The entry is also not incomplete and details about the software and no one else. The article is not politically motivated and not an advertisement either. If even after all this we decide that this software article is not fit enough I will not try to repost. Please also review LightTray so that we can clear it off too as it is on similar lines. Yed 05:07, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> - Thanks Karnesky for pointing out <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> it is more eligible than WS:CORP here. As for using WP as a platform for the blog if it does not add to the detail then its worthy of being removed from WP. I would just like to reiterate that the aim is not to make WP a platform for advertising and neither am I trying to make it one. Please, if the entries are in no way useful then it must be removed from WP. But the issue here is about a software not developed by me; nor am I trying to advertise to anyone. The author of the software is more than happy "not to have an entry in WP" [<a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3857979|" class="external text" title="http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3857979|" rel="nofollow">in his own words</a>]. If somone would like to put WP:SOFTWARE to be used so strictly then we can actually find many many more of them which should have been filtered out too. Though this is not a an excuse but it definitely needs to be looked a little more thoroughly here. For a start why don't we try and see how many such similar open source tools are available or mentioned anywhere else in WP. Yed 8:59 14 August (UTC)</li>

I will not maintain this page myself with updates to FreeMeter, or be accountable for its accuracy, as i have enough to do already.

<p>New article does not cite sources. Request for Speedy A7 was denied but further research does not produce any evidence that this person exists. The first few pages of a google search do not throw her up. Nor does a search on the name of the claimed album. There is no IMDb entry under her name and all of the links lead nowhere except for one that is parked. In short if this isn't a hoax this person is clearly not notable. I did warn the author to come up with soem sources, but haviong slept on this last night I'm of the mind that this should be listed as it stands. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpartaz_f576.html" title="User:Spartaz">Spartaz</a> 07:45, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Second AfD I guess. Horribly unsourced, the only reason it exists is to catalogue insults (many of which I agree with). Any one of these lines could be completely made up, and some of them probably are.

<li><b>Delete —</b> Agree with nom. Also completely unencyclopedic, and some seem to be borderline slander, <b>especially</b> without sources.

<li><b>Delete —</b> To me, the entries on the page fall too neatly into two camps: 1) Familiar media nicknames (ie Teflon President, Tricky Dick) which should and probably are mentioned in the subjects' articles anyway, and 2) non-notable, often hateful attempts at defamation or humor. — <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlcuin_9f7f.html" title="User:Alcuin">Alcuin</a> 16:48, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Is google really the basis for cross-reference of notability? I should have taken note, but I am pretty certain that I've seen articles on people of less publicized repute (eg. National contest finalists, etc, etc, etc). Moreover, category cross-reference may play a factor in noteworthiness in this case. One of my original aims was to populate more cross-reference material. My submission on <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talent_Quest_e4b1.html" title="Talent Quest">Talent Quest</a> was intended and designed to document detail much like the entry for <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Idol_ef58.html" title="American Idol">American Idol</a>. That entry and its cross-reference categories leads to several biographical articles. Where is the distinction made in this case? What I can tell is that this article is based on a cross-reference infrastructure that does not yet exist. I really didn't see this point made in the "no vanity articles" guidelines. Is there a crisper policy guideline on "noteworthy" individuals? It would be useful before submitting further biographical articles. For instance, an individual who is an actor, and has been in several works... qualifies as "noteworthy" enough for article submission? The guidelines are gray, and I would like to better understand them.

<li>Google is a tool, of course, and nothing more. One of the reasons I included my google results is so that other contributors can check my work. If others find information that I missed (especially through other resources of which I may be unaware), then by all means that information should be posted here. As a rule of thumb, though, if a person contributing to pop culture in any way is not well-represented in google, then chances are very few people have heard of that person. — <a href="../../../n/m/c/User%7ENMChico24_74ee.html" title="User:NMChico24"><font color="#3D59AB"><b>NM</b></font></a><a href="../../../n/m/c/User_talk%7ENMChico24_41e0.html" title="User talk:NMChico24"><font color="#3D59AB"><b>Chico</b></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NMChico24_752e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NMChico24"><font color="#3D59AB"><b>24</b></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_New_Mexico.svg_6b3a.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_New_Mexico.svg/25px-Flag_of_New_Mexico.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_New_Mexico.svg_6b3a.html" /></a> 00:31, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

I believe this is his made up name for it, but it is an actual phenomenon. <s>I'd suggest a merge with the Mario Kart article.</s> Copy it, paste it somewhere as a minor note.

<p>This page contains several unverifiable, inflamatory and potentially libelous statements.

<li><b>Undecided</b>. Despite the person claiming credit for my removal of the defamatory information, I believe that this article is now passable. However, this article doesn't have any true reason to persist. North Collections Organization is a little-known company which can be considered just as akin and on-level with Wikipedia as the local convenience store (ie, let's say a store called "Bob's Convenience Store."). In my opinion, it should remain, but it just as easily calls for deletion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 63.79.198.2 (<a href="../../../6/3/2E/User_talk%7E63.79.198.2.html" title="User talk:63.79.198.2">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.79.198.2_084e.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.79.198.2">contribs</a>) 11:13, 15 August 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This ought to be a speediable candidate since there is clear consensus that being a failed candidate is not itself grounds for notability.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Shangwen_Fang_bd2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shangwen Fang">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../s/h/a/Shangwen_Fang_36fe.html" title="Shangwen Fang">Shangwen Fang</a></span></h3>
<p>Reason First, It doesn't seem that Fang is willingly to be in public domain (according to his statement in zh-wiki) and neither did he himself being publicized voluntarily - he is not a public figure at all. Fang's personal information was being disclosed to public by media illegally, and those personal information have nothing to do with the cat abuse. (As for the definition of public figure, please refer to the case Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323,351(1974). )</p>
<p>Second, is there anybody interested in Fang's life except for the cat incident? (If you did, you should have put these information into this article.) Cat abusing is only a little part of Fang's whole life, and will anybody include his early life, his work, and his studies with detailed description as his biography in Wiki? Are those biography important enough to make Fang an article?</p>
<p>Third, the article was filled with subjective comment, and I don't think that Wiki is a place for outrageous cat lovers to humiliate their dislike person. This place is supposed to be neutral, it's not a personal blog.</p>
<p>For the above mentioned reasons, this article should be removed. Fanoffang 13 August 2006</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Moderate keep</b>. Notability is iffy but appears to be sufficiently established. Subject's desire is irrelevant. (I gave a stronger keep vote at the Chinese Wikipedia AFD discussion -- because notability is stronger as to the Chinese-speaking community -- but here, relevance is less.) Not being an attorney in Taiwan, I can't comment on Taiwanese law, but I am sure that no American court would consider the amount of information in the article currently to be any form of invasion of privacy, as all of it is in the public record. Whether he's a "public figure" as a matter of law is not relevant; when there is no disclosure of material that would trigger an invasion of privacy claim, it doesn't matter how non-public the individual is; no invasion of property claim can lie under the disclosure, in particular, of a <i>court record</i>. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 15:23, 13 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Opinion</b> I am sorry to discourage you that none information regard to this case was from the court, actually, this case will never be brought to the court unless Taiwanese law change. Surely there's nothing to do with any "court record". Since the information was being disclosed to the public illegally through media, according to The Fruit of Poisonous Tree Doctrine, others' disclosure will be regarded as illegal as well. You may have to update your knowledge about the whole incident -- Fanoffang 13 August 2006
<ul>
<li>Police record is covered under the same doctrine. Fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine does not apply -- the fruit of the poisonous doctrine applies when illegal <i>government</i> conduct, <i>in violation of the Fourth Amendment</i>, leads to the discovery of evidence. Even then, it only applies in a criminal case, not to an administrative or civil case. Perhaps you need to brush up on your American constitutional law before you start citing American cases and doctrines. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 15:54, 13 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am sorry to discourage you again that The Fruit of Poisonous Tree Doctrine is the practice of <a href="../../../d/u/e/Due_process_of_law.html" title="Due process of law">due process of law</a>. It applies not only to criminal cases but all legal actions.
<p>In this case, medias disclosed the information illegally, and the editor claimed that he was just quoting what he has seen through media - since the tree (disclosure of personal information by media) was being poisoned, the fruit (the disclosure of personal information by editor) is poisoned, too, and the fruit shall not be the excuse for reliving. This also means that no infringer could be relieved just by alleging that his information is from others. Try to study some more and I guarantee that will be helpful. -- Fanoffang 14 August 2006</p>

</li>
<li>Chu and Paris Hilton has court order to block distribution. Did Fang file for blocking of distributing his name? I also remind you that the article Shangwen Fang in Zh-wiki has been combined to the Neihu Cat Abuse incident due to the overlapping of content and not by the privacy concern or lack of importance. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbybuilder_ac4e.html" title="User:Bobbybuilder">Bobbybuilder</a> 02:58, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There are thousands of articles appear every day and how could we expect those few voluntary editors to know all kinds of regulations?
<p>I am sorry to discourage the upper stairs that both Qu and Hilton filed no order to block the distribution of the video. Illegality won't become legality whether the subject claims his right or not. Besides, the deletion process of the article Shangwen Fang in Zh-wiki rises because of the lack of importance, and this has been acknowledged by most voters. Article of Shangwen Fang no longer exists in ZH-wiki now and the article of "Incidence" is apparently not the biography of Fang. Therefore, I'm afraid that you are also the one needs to renew your knowledge toward the whole incident. Well, maybe not just the incident, but some common sense such as Qu and Hilton. -- Fanoffang 14 August 2006</p>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It's very misleading for you to say that the information has been removed from the Chinese Wikipedia.

<li><b>Userfy.</b> -- As its leader i know more about this clan than pretty much anyone else. If you have any questions about it, please direct them to me. I ran the same google search as you and came up with 40 seperate websites that we are either on or that are talking about us. Of these 40 websites, only about HALF are forums (which makes sense... considering our name comes up more in discussions rather than... picture blogs or file shares i guess... &lt;_&lt;). Also keep in mind that we go by many different names, as some sites have character limits of 9-10 characters which does not allow us to use the full name. In such cases, we use the name "Kupo Clan" (which if you'd like i could add as an "also known as" under Moogle Mafia...) If you actually go to any of the games that we are in (A partial list was provided on the wiki itself) You would see that we do have as many members as we boast. Currently in zelderex we have 150 members in our main branch and roughly 35 in our side branch. In Urban Rivals, we have either 105 or 106 members. In xtratic war, there was a recent reset which left most of us stranded... we previously had 59 members but have since evaporated down to 17. In kingdom of loathing, we at one time had 60 members but i have not played in a long time and at last count i believe we have roughly 30. In outwar, we had just under 70 members but the admins banned half the clan for unknown reasons (They arent too talkative over there) so we're down to 20ish members with my account as leader suspended... On our forums we have a little over 300 members, but our forums are relatively new, as im sure you saw in the google search of our name, the first link "Xmbhost" was our original forums, we had roughly 500 members signed, and then the host crashed on us and we had to relocate... we lost everything, including the majority of our member email lists, and unable to contact the lost members to tell them what happened we had to just start over again, slowly putting the pieces of our clan back together again. I apoligize for the history lesson and the long post... if its too long, please let me know. I will check back here sometime tomorrow to see whats new. (BTW this is my first wiki post ever, so ive really got no clue what i am doing... i hope this is how you sign it and talk...) Oh yeah, Quote: Can't find any pages not created by Moogle Mafia members themselves To date, we have made 3 pages for us, by us. Our first clan forums (xmbhost.com/MoogleMafia), our clan website (www.terraodyssey.com/~moogle) and our current clan forums (www.gamingcomm.com/mafia). Just fyi.

Well, i suppose that we probably dont fulfil your guidelines then... We've never had a real magazine (like one that is on the market) do a story on us so if you're looking for... credentials i guess... we are lacking. So do you just kill the whole article?

<li>No, forums are generally not considered reliable <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">secondary sources</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: If an article is deleted, it is removed from general display. I guess you could say it gets "archived" - at that point only admins and 'crats can retrieve the article, so yes down the road someone could request undeletion at <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">deletion review</a> if there becomes sufficient reason for the article to exist.</dd>
<dd>There's an alternative to having the article disappear, however - if you plan on remaining at Wikipedia and editing other articles (and we hope you do!), you can request that the article be "userfied" - whereas the entire article is moved or copied under your username, and someone looking at you <i>as an editor</i> can see the information. Every contributing editor has the right to a (reasonable) user page and subpages where they can talk a bit about themselves and their interests (again within reason), of which retention standard are a bit more lax (assuming you do remain here and contribute to other articles). If you are interested in this option, you can change your <s>vote</s> opinion above to "userfy" --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:05, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Userfy</b> to Kupofather, the self-declared leader of the clan, who after doing research and asking questions has determined that it probably doesn't have what Wikipedia considers reliable sources. Rather than deleting the page, userfy seems better as the information would still be online and accessible to all on that userpage. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETransUtopian_743a.html" title="User:TransUtopian">TransUtopian</a> 21:06, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>That sounds good to me. After really going through and looking at the other articles up for deletion and some of the ones that are fine, i can see the differences and this one really doesnt cut it yet. Maybe in the future (after i move to the real world and take over the southern half of america... i mean &lt;_&lt; You heard nothing&#160;;P) Perhaps I could officially create something for this. But for now, that seems to be the best option. Also wondering, is there a tutorial for the proper etiquette for talk discussions like this? I notice that you write yours underneath mine, (rather than as a new bullet) but i dont know how to do that. If theres a FAQ or something like that that addresses this id thank you very much for redirecting me there. Thank you again for clarifying and being patient with me even though im still a noob with this wikipedia stuff. Kupofather 21:56, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b>. While it's canon that there are actually more types of Discordianism than practicing Discordians, I think the essentially unpublished views of a one-man Episkoposary count as <b>Original Research</b> at the very least. They just deleted the standalone entry on Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia, and that group actually has a known presence outside its own pineal gland. It doesn't warrant an encyclopedia article. Also, if we start making pages for every saint and visionary recognized by every Discordian pope around, we're going to have to end up making en.disc.wikipedia.org just to handle the flow of traffic. --<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParcequilfaut_a7de.html" title="User:Parcequilfaut">Parcequilfaut</a> 07:06, 17 August 2006 (UTC) , Pope the Empress, Commander of the DoomBringer and Recommender of Deletion</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> It doesn't look like a hoax to me. I can find it with Mapquest and Google Earth. The school appears real. I haven't been able to verify the demographic assertion though, so will add a {{fact}} tag to that statement. The school demographics do support that Fairlawn has a large white population - it's just not sufficient to support the assertion in the article. However, it doesn't show up as a valid name in a USPS Zip code search nor does it show up as a valid place name using the US Census site search. I did find it in one gazeteer: <a href="http://www.fallingrain.com/world/US/12/Fairlawn.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fallingrain.com/world/US/12/Fairlawn.html" rel="nofollow">[75]</a>. I'd keep it for now to see if the article can be expanded with better sources and a better assertion of notability - but this is a close call for me... <a href="../../../b/t/b/User%7EBtball_6537.html" title="User:Btball">Brian</a> 15:13, 15 August 2006 (UTC)btball</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. There is a Fairlawn, Florida that is a <i>Populated Community Place</i> in Broward County<a href="http://dlis.dos.state.fl.us/fgils/cities.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://dlis.dos.state.fl.us/fgils/cities.html" rel="nofollow">[76]</a>, not in Miami-Dade County. It may be difficult to say much about that Fairlawn, as well. I see that the web link about the Fairlawn branch library states that the library's <i>clientele consists of newly arrived Hispanic immigrants and older residents who have lived in the West Miami, Fairlawn and Flagami areas for many years.</i> This is consistent with the claim that Fairlawn has a large White (non-Hispanic) population, but could never be used as a source for that statement. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Donald Albury</font></a><sup><font color="green">(<a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>)</font></sup></b> 16:39, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. If the neighborhood is verifiable, which it appears to be, I don't see how notability really plays into this.

<li>Thanks, here are my (the creator of the article) comments:
<p>The article has been created as a draft to replace (after polishing it a bit) the current article <a href="../../../i/n/t/Introduction_to_special_relativity.html" title="Introduction to special relativity">introduction to special relativity</a>.</p>
<p>Here are my objections against the current so called "introduction to special relativity". I have also expressed them in the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Introduction_to_special_relativity.html" title="Introduction to special relativity">introduction to special relativity</a> article discussion page.</p>
<ul>
<li>it is not a non-technical introduction, but it is linked from the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a> article as a non-technical introduction</li>
<li>it doesn't focus on the theory itself, but on the Minkowski space</li>
<li>it uses too much calculations inadequate to the simlicity of the principles</li>
<li>it goes into too much detail unnecessary for explanation of the fundamental ideas of the theory</li>
<li>it doesn't provide an overview of the most important outcomes - for people not interested in calculation of them</li>
<li>it uses special terminology (from the SR area) when not necessary in places where explaining other terms</li>
<li>as a result of all the above, it doesn't serve it's purpose, which I believe is to <b>provide a simple overview and explanation of the theory for newcomers with a basic knowledge of mathematics - who are not used to describe things by mathematical formulas</b>; people who will probably open the article are those, who do not understand the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a> but the current article puts them in the same (if not worse) position--Herr.Schultze 18:19, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This article is based on a very early version of the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a> article.</li>
<li>It contains many factual errors.</li>
<li>It is poorly organized and focused excessively on <a href="../../../e/3D/m/E%3Dmc%C2%B2.html" title="E=mc²">E=mc²</a>.</li>
<li>It fails to deal with the underlying postulates of special relativity</li>
<li>It fails to discuss many of the important result/predictions of special relativity, or does so only breifly and incoherently.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>While I do agree that <a href="../../../i/n/t/Introduction_to_special_relativity.html" title="Introduction to special relativity">Introduction to special relativity</a> is in need of a rewrite, this is an awful basis for it. I once again ask Herr.Schultze to discard this article as the useless piece of ancient (Wikipedia) history that it is, and start over from scratch. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 05:00, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. What's up with the "move" vote? The original author is quite capable of making a private copy if they wish, there is no point to suggesting a "move" (which I thus interpret as equivalent to "delete"). <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 04:11, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and improve. WP:WEB is not the appropriate criterion to invoke. The article describes an operating system. Moreover, seemingly one of few distros to exclusively use XFCE as their desktop environment, and possibly the foremost in terms of implementing features of OS X. The article does, however, need much more detail, especially on what elements were taken from each of the parent distros (Kanotix, Elive, Morphix, Debian). I also don't find it sounds like an advert, although I would suggest avoiding "boast", and quotes should be in quotation marks. We have an editor volunteering to work on this, so all seems good. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 14:53, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Wait</b>. Yale's a cappella community is rather unique; the first collegiate a cappella group in the U.S. (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Whiffenpoofs_fb72.html" title="The Whiffenpoofs">The Whiffenpoofs</a>) was founded there almost a century ago, and it has spawned around 15 other a cappella groups. As far as I know, no other college can boast (or complain) of such an array of vocalists. It should be noted as well that, clamoring for attention, just about all of these groups have rather unnotable "advertisements" up on Wikipedia briefing cyberspace on their accomplishments: Redhot &amp; Blue, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Baker%27s_Dozen_4158.html" title="The Baker's Dozen">The Baker's Dozen</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Spizzwinks%28_%29_812a.html" title="The Spizzwinks(?)">The Spizzwinks(?)</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shades.html" title="Shades">Shades</a>, Yale Alley Cats, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Duke%27s_Men_of_Yale_f4f0.html" title="The Duke's Men of Yale">The Duke's Men of Yale</a> etc. Put a message on my talk page if you want the full list. It seems rather unjust to delete this particular article and leave all of the other ones up. I certainly agree that the creators, editors, etc. of the article in question have flagrantly violated the NPOV policy and that the article should definitely be pared down and perhaps deleted in the end anyway, but if that is so, the other a cappella advertisements need to get some of the same scrutiny and attention. Perhaps a single page could be devoted to the Yale's a cappella history; the mob of singers over the years has generated a number of notable musicians, composers, actors, etc. (some of whom have actually come from the Society of Orpheus and Bacchus). And such a page might be of some interest; National Public Radio did a feature on Yale's a cappella scene within the last few years or so because of its unusual vibrancy. <a href="../../../m/g/u/User%7EMgummess_74b8.html" title="User:Mgummess">Mgummess</a> 06:28, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

It is widely mentioned in the press and in several books, as well as on permanent exhibition in several museums, such as <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smithsonian.html" title="Smithsonian">Smithsonian</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_and_Albert_Museum_06fd.html" title="Victoria and Albert Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a>, etc. The style is renowned and acclaimed in the same context as that of, e.g., <a href="../../../i/s/s/Issey_Miyake_bf2c.html" title="Issey Miyake">Issey Miyake</a> and <a href="../../../y/o/h/Yohji_Yamamoto_1af7.html" title="Yohji Yamamoto">Yohji Yamamoto</a>. There is a bibliography ready for posting too, I am starting this STUB like any stub gets started. I fail to see any basis for deletion at all. Given the substantiality, as, e.g., reflected in 60 000 Google entries as well as noumerous academic references to the style created, I perceive any call for deletion overzealous and farfetched! <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPantherarosa_c18e.html" title="User:Pantherarosa">Pantherarosa</a> 23:03, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>RETAIN</b>: This is an excellent article on an important and popular subject. The links were probably added because they are associated with images that document the text, showing examples of the parodies that the article discusses. Initially, as the article's "History" page shows, Arichnad attempted to delete this article without bothering to seek a consensus, in violation of Wikipedia's policy. (Ut was actually nominated for deletion only after it was restored, following the initial deletion.) As a compromise, I have deleted the links about which Arichnad expresses concern, retaining only the article's text. I believe that the article should be retained, as it is no longer a threat (if it ever was) and, again, it addresses an important and popular subject. <a href="../../../g/p/s/User%7EGpscholar_4e15.html" title="User:Gpscholar">Gpscholar</a> 21:14, 13 August 2006 (UTC) gpscholar

<li><b>Keep</b> - I like the idea, potentially very interesting. There are obvious completeness issues; does this article propose to include every work of fiction ever? But invoking the philosophy of eventualism, I can vote to keep this. I just did the "Friend test" (linking this article to a few of my friends to gauge their reaction), and they all said "wow" or "cool" or something, which tells me that this is an interesting premise for an article (and you can't argue with the Friend Test...) <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdcooper_7efd.html" title="User:Jdcooper">Jdcooper</a> 23:17, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete in its current form</b>. As was noted above, this is a fascinating idea and a <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBold_3536.html" title="WP:Bold">bold</a> concept. But it's too open-ended. Theoretically, any event from any work of fiction qualifies. Already the list is quite long and not very organized. But I'm always <a href="../../../o/s/t/WP%7EOSTRICH_1864.html" title="WP:OSTRICH">willing to reconsider</a>. I suggest the authors establish criteria for inclusion (perhaps only including alternative history: things that are contrary to what actually happened), group the events so it seems less random, and get back to us. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 23:50, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete,</b> invoking the philosophy of immediatism. Wikipedia must be more than "Possible-probable, my black hen/She lays eggs in the relative when/She doesn't lay eggs in the positive now/Because she's unable to postulate how." This is not a sound article because fictional events occurring at about the same time in different works of fiction are not really connected. Organizing these unrelated events by date is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, and is also intrinsically unencyclopedic; if it were encyclopedic, someone could and should have already written an article on the <i>topic</i> of Fictional historical events. The only practical use I can think of for such a list would be for a novelist who wanted to write a novel mixing other novels' fictional histories. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:33, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is a breakout of Timeline of fictional historical events, which was discussed at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Timeline_of_fictional_historical_events%2C_Timeline_of_fictional_future_events_5376.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Timeline of fictional historical events, Timeline of fictional future events">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Timeline of fictional historical events, Timeline of fictional future events</a>.

<ul>
<li>My opinion remains unchanged from the prior discussion, by the way. That this has finally expanded enough to warrant a breakout article; that the breakout has been done the wrong way, by time period rather than <i>by universe</i>; and that this mish-mash is the result demonstrate the very point that I made back in January 2005. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:28, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Keep But with changes- While the idea of a timeline of mythical creatures is a good one, this articles references seem to be made up mostly of television shows. I see maybe 25%books or liture references and the rest seem to be either comic books or shows. also it doesnt seem to capture all of them, being a person who has researched fictional or mythical creatures, it seems to me that you may not be able to get them all on one page and perhaps it should be divide by time(ie- fictional charetcters of big bang-whatever, dinousour fictional creatures, fictional creatures pre-homosapian, and so on in that forth so you may encompass all of them. With it's current state it may be better to delete and just start all over.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.85.122.230 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.85.122.230_7a4a.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.85.122.230">contribs</a>) 2006-08-15 00:12:13 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Because something is not done well is not grounds for deletion. But in this case, the entire approach strikes me as flawed. The content would be far better merged into individual articles pertinent to each fictional source, rather than presented as a hopelessly mixed up compendium as is done here. That way, the inherent bias (e.g. for overwhelmingly English language fictional sources) is rendered irrelevant and a logical and usable structure could be provided. By the same logic, [Timeline of fictional historical events]] should be parsed in the same way. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 16:33, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> this can never be more than a jumble of unrelated, conflicting, mostly trivial dates and events, many interwoven with real ones -- there are literally (pun intended) hundreds of fictional works placed during the US Civil War, just digging through those (like the momentous occasions of Scarlett O'Hara's birth, marriage, being sworn to, etc.) would take longer than the war lasted to read. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 03:17, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hey now, I'm just the translator.&#160;:-) Just trying to flesh things out a bit. Sport is not my field of expertise, so I leave it to others to tidy up the language.

<li><b>Keep —</b> I agree to keep based on the above - he is a notable figure in the natural health arena and whether you agree with his ideas or not - other people will want to know about him. I thought the idea of Wikipedia was to provide neutral information - not add/delete articles based upon whether you believe someone or something. If you don't agree with his theories then make sure the article is balanced - don't just delete it. Therefore, if you were that worried about his research being fact or not, surely you would just have to caveat your paragraph with 'It has been suggested that some of his theories are not scientifically sound, however, he states that....etc' - I can't help but feel that personal viewpoints and perspectives take precidence over the overall good that Wikipedia tries to provide sometimes. 61.88.251.46 9:12, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Note to BCorr -- Google is nice and all that (although I think this over-reliance on Google hits is utterly ridiculous), but hardly a factor when it comes to determining the disposition of an OR essay. That the topic exists is not doubted, but what is at issue here is its presentation on Wiki. The fact that the <s>article</s> essay was allegedly linked in AM is of little importance as well. That AM failed to see that it was an essay is their problem, not ours.
<ul>
<li>One other point: the fact of something being a neologism (refering to the anon who forgot to sign) is of little importance as well, as <i>all</i> words in every language in the world were neologism at one time. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 10:00, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>BTW, you need to narrow your search a bit: while the words truth and theory show up on the same page, they are not adjacent for a majority of the hits you noted. If we try "intitle:"truth+theory"" we get 48 hits, including four about a rock band named, you guessed it, <i>Truth Theory</i>. See my above point about over-reliance on Google hits. Unless you appropriately limit your search, and unless you are willing to go through them all to separate the wheat from the chaff, the numbers are often meaningless (as in the case of the 30K hits). <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 10:08, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Jon Awbrey makes some fair points below. Besides, this is Wikipedia. It must have somwhere close to 65,535 articles on Pokemon alone. What's the big brouhaha??

For example, <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth_theory.html#Elements_of_theory" title="Truth theory">Truth theory#Elements of theory</a> reveals an eccentric map of <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truthbearer.html" title="Truthbearer">truthbearers</a>, with an implicit bias towards Peirce's analyse of language and the whole unsupported by citations.

<dd>You have some good points. Still, I say the article just needs to be cut down a bit and better-referenced. But this is no reason for deletion.

Wiki can handle another one on truth. I was absoltely not accusing <i>you</i> of "vendetta". And "vendetta" was probbly the wrong word anyway. "Crusaders for a minimalist use of English", may be more appropriate. As someone else put it, "business style sheet pushers." Sentences should be no more complex than: "SEE SPOT RUN." The nominator seems to be part of this cabal.

<p>JA: Other reasons, as I think of them:</p>
<ol>
<li>JA: Editors familiar with the situation know perfectly well that the article <i><a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a></i> is large already (58 kb), and that it's likely to keep on growing with the inclusion of more and more subsections on individual philosophers. Thus it would not gracefully absorb the material here, a large portion of which was in fact massively deleted once before by a particular editor (and his probable meta-puppets) on the grounds that it was too "advanced", "technical", and so on. These were his/their words. He/they further objected to standard scholarly and I daresay <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFIABILITY_792c.html" title="WP:VERIFIABILITY">WP:VERIFIABILITY</a> practice of quoting original sources, especially if they were Classical or even just pre-20th century. This made it impossible to maintain a balanced and I daresay <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> account of the announced subject matter, namely <i><a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a></i>. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 03:45, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ol>
<li>This would seem to be an argument for a merge from <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a>
<ol>
<li>JA: I cannot see your reasoning there, as that would do nothing to alleviate the size problem. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 12:02, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>JA: A cursory scan of the first page of the Google report — as if we needed that Guess for leaven — shows that there are more kinds of Truth in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in the current Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a>.

<li>JA: As I have said, this article came into its current state as a salvage operation, populated at first by the orphans of dis-content that were being tossed out of the bathwater and into the streets in the neighborhood of the ostensible <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a>. Since nobody else has taken a <i>positive</i> interest in it, and since I have had many other pressing matters, it has not matured as quickly or as healthily as it otherwise might have done if any of us had given it a lttle more constructive time and thought. To be continued ... or not? ... that is the question, isn't it? <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 12:54, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>JA: A few words with regard to the Citations, References, Bibliography (or Further Reading), and their relationship to each other. I have had many occasions to explain my way of working to Banno, Kenosis, Lacatosias, and the other editors with whom I have actually collaborated on many articles over the past year, but since it does not seem to have been the most memorable of occasions for them, and again for the sake of those who were lucky enough to miss all that, I will try to gistify my methods more briefly here. I have followed pretty much the same practices since first being instructed in them by my junior high school teachers, when we first started writing sourced research papers, way back when. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 15:12, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>JA: Woodman! Spare that tree! (To be continued, Monday, maybe …) <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 15:14, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>JA: Monday, <i>already</i>? Anyway, I've explained all this to the usual suspects many times before, but I was taught that it's best to gather your notes and references together beforehand, and get all that picky stuff out of the way first. So I normally type in the references that I'm planning to use first, then I type in the primary source quotations and triple-check all that mindless verbatim fussiness before I start writing the transitions, as it takes two different cognitive sets altogether to do these two different tasks. So that is why the References section tends to look "bloated" at the start. I used to put the meantime uncited references in the Bib (or Further Reading), as it never hurts the reader to know about major works in the topic area, and then move them up to Refs as I cited them. But that got to be a pain as it made it hard to edit in sections, so more lately I have taken to combining the Refs and the Bib. The reason why the Refs stay so uncited for so long is — of course — because of all the fights that constantly break out over every little bit of text that one adds to the article, up to and including all the time that we waste on a process like the present litigation. And then, of course, by the time you can get your neck out of hot water long enough to do more work on the article, somebody has gone and been so <b>deleteriously bold</b> as to delete all the references that you busted your <a href="../../../a/r/s/Ars_Poetica_b7af.html" title="Ars Poetica">Ars</a> to look up. But some people just seem to prefer that exciting sort of hue and cry to the duller work of writing articles, so we are forced to let them have their fun, even though it's hardly fun for everyone. And so it goes — mostly nowhere. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 13:34, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>JA: On to the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> question. This is not original research. It is simply unfamiliar material to a few of the generally unfamiliar readers who have taken over the local lordship of anything they regard as the exclusive domain of the Wikipedia philosophy project. One tries to be polite, but people force you to the point of having to speak some harsh <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truths</a>. I wish they would just quit doing being so obstructive, and adopt an attitude that permits the learning of others, and maybe even their own. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 14:00, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep with massive rewrite/merge</b>-There should certainly be a page on Truth Theory, though it shouldn't be this one. My recommendation would be to take pretty much all of the <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html#Philosophy_of_truth" title="Truth">Philosophy of Truth</a> section of the <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a> page and put it here. The essay that currently resides here should be pretty much deleted, with just some basic info retained for the section on classical philosophers. The <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a> page is already too big as it is. I think, conceptually, the truth page should just include the basic info in <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html#Truth_in_specialized_contexts" title="Truth">section 3</a> plus a paragraph or two on the Philosophy of Truth (linked here, of course). Beyond that that, I think it would work better to retitle this page "Philosophy of Truth" with "truth theory" redirecting to it. Just a suggestion. <a href="../../../t/r/n/User%7ETrnj2000_c033.html" title="User:Trnj2000">Trnj2000</a> 22:59, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>JA: We seem to be wandering into issues that are certainly interesting to discuss but that may be more generic than the specific issue to be decided here, so I've added another subhead for that.

<p>JA: Hey! Don't knock La Buffarina! (She might knock you back.) But serially, folks, I would not call it a cabal or a vendetta — yet — but some of the plaintiffs of this action are known to have a distinctive POV that amounts to a <a href="../../../c/a/t/Categorical_imperative.html" title="Categorical imperative">categorical imperative</a> about how <i>all</i> WP articles should be written, with regard to their level and style, and I guess "Business Object Style Sheet" (BOSS) is a pretty good name for it. I have betimes made the observation that <a href="../../../p/%26/g/WP%7EP%26G_c3f3.html" title="WP:P&amp;G">WP:P&amp;G</a> does not dictate any so restricted a theory about such things as <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intended_reader.html" title="Intended reader">intended reader</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reader_model.html" title="Reader model">reader model</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/r/Target_audience.html" title="Target audience">target audience</a>, and so on. Of course we all strive to make information as widely comprehensible as humanly possible on both sides of the human equation, but it is simply not possible to deny the practical limits on the side of the reader and the writer alike. And there are many, many topic areas in WP where the writers do not feel obligated to omit from treatment what they cannot make immediately grokkable by the so-called "generally unfamiliar reader". <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 21:44, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>JA: The really amusing thing about this reader model issue to someone who knows the full range of my work on WP — for instance, yours truly — is that some of my earliest and most persistent efforts have been dedicated to that elusive butterfly of love's labors lost, the aim of "making technical articles more accessible". For instance, at the article on <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_theory.html" title="Information theory">information theory</a> and the complex of articles relating to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relational_algebra.html" title="Relational algebra">relational algebra</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relational_databases.html" title="Relational databases">relational databases</a>, and the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relational_model.html" title="Relational model">relational model</a>. If you do not see any evidence of my labors there, it is because the techno-purists on the scene at the time and making their entrances later were having none of that dilutionary mass appeal, not even in the introductions. A little more of my efforts do survive in the complex of articles concerned with <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propositional_calculus.html" title="Propositional calculus">propositional calculus</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth_tables.html" title="Truth tables">truth tables</a>. Still, I find that it is just as thankless a task making tech arts accessible as it is making pop arts like WP <i><a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a></i> more technically challenging than what was standard fare in the 1850's, if not in fact the 1250's, though under a host of other names, of course. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 00:46, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Most gaming groups are non-notable but this one seems to be. It has been written into the official lore behind at least two games, which are Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot. The Ultima Online references are posted above, but the Dark Age of Camelot reference can be found at <a href="http://www.camelotherald.com/article.php?id=121" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.camelotherald.com/article.php?id=121" rel="nofollow">[80]</a>, where Mythic Entertainment was so impressed with how they influenced the community they were added to Mythic Entertainment's official description of an in-game character race.Khasha'an 16:41, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This clan is an archetype. It is widely known among game designers and is a part of MMORPG history. For example, it is referenced on <a href="http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/" class="external text" title="http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/" rel="nofollow">Terra Nova</a>, a roundtable of many of the movers and shakers in game design in <a href="http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2003/10/the_absence_of_.html" class="external text" title="http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2003/10/the_absence_of_.html" rel="nofollow">this article/discussion</a> (third section from the bottom). Shadowclan is often referenced casually like this, as it is assumed that the other game designers will know the clan and its influence. Though, some reading their roundtable might not catch the reference, but that's what wikipedia is for, right? <a href="../../../y/u/u/User%7EYuut_f048.html" title="User:Yuut">Yuut</a> 04:51, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This clan has helped to shape online gaming communities and culture through revolutionary ideas on what comprises roleplay and how to do it. It is refrenced by game designers and even included in a gaming company's game lore. If you can put game lore into Wiki (which you can) this easily qualifies. Normally guilds are NN, but this one seems to be more than just a guild, more closely related to a loosly held organization or cultural entity. Zinian 16:23, 15th August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The gaming organization is reasonably sourced from outside publications. It is apparent that it has had a significant impact on the MMORPG gaming community, including the very games themselves. -<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShazbot85_d6a8.html" title="User:Shazbot85">Shazbot85</a> 23:06, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - Wikipedia gets a lot of people wanting to add articles for their guilds and clans, and probably 99.9% of them are completely non-notable. But Shadowclan <i>has</i> gotten a good amount of external press, and certainly <i>is</i> in that upper echelon of most well-known and significant clans - I'd heard of their activities in <i>Ultima Online</i>, and I've never played the game. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStormie_b829.html" title="User:Stormie">Stormie</a> 00:08, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> So sorry guys, I forgot the sources. I do have sources. Wired Magazine, is a good example. I'm trying to dig up the links, but I've been having a busy day and Wired's search engine isn't agreeing with me.. Joss Whedon has also commented on it on his own site, Whedonesque. Give me some extra time here and I'll get my sources together. A CBC Radio interview/segment with an exclusive scene from the show in audio format has been produced and is just waiting to air. Several Vancouver papers have also picked up the story, although how I'll find them is a mystery.

<li><b>Comment</b> A few things about your sources: The weblogs/podcast don't qualify as reliable sources (very few do), and the Wired article only gives a passing mention to the show (one paragraph in a two page article), so it can't be given much weight. They blogs also seem to have more of a focus towards Firefly than most neutral sources would, so this has to be taken into account. However, I'd still like to see the CBC Radio/Vancouver newspaper piece. Depending on their importance, it could help determine notability- from what I've read the show <i>might</i> become notable in the future, but from the current lack of independent, reliable, third-party sources that we have access to, it doesn't qualify at the moment. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 01:39, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think the person who write this article had thier heart in the right place. It's a good attempt on concatenating the various non-notable anime site articles that we have into one, "notable" article. Anime fansites are hardly ever notable. ANN makes it because it is part of a magazine and it had a famous run-in with the <a href="../../../r/c/m/RCMP_2336.html" title="RCMP">RCMP</a>, but there aren't too many other notables out there. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 01:41, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
