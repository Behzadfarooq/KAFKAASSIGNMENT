<p>Poshek-Gladbach is widely known in the world of New Music as found on the internet as well as Dr. Thaden is noted in the article on Ernst von Dohnanyi herein. It would be useful if persons who have at least a minimal background in music were passing judgment on Dr. Thaden. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Rpgbach (<a href="../../../r/p/g/User_talk%7ERpgbach_efd0.html" title="User talk:Rpgbach">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rpgbach_edaf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rpgbach">contribs</a>) 00:52, 4 February 2007.</small></p>

<p>Which recital/concert programs would you like? Would his 18 appearances with SLSO, 4 appearances with the LAPO, would his 11 appearances with the NYPO do? Or perhaps we should consider his recordings of the complete keyboard works of J.S. Bach and Couperin. Or would a list of his students since 1956 (including 2 Pulitzer Prize winning composers). Or would a list of journals in which his writings are published help? Again, it would be helpful if just one reviewer knew anything about the music world. I'm sorry, a degree in engineering does not qualify one to evaluate the notability of a musician. At the rate we are going, I'm surprised any musician has ever made it onto Wikipedia. And I'm rather perplexed by "I could not find any through the usual avenues." What are the usual avenues? Obviously, they are not music journal databases. Perhaps had Dr. Thaden pursued engineering instead of music he would qualify for Wikipedia. Fortunately for the music world, he did not do so. Perhaps we should re-evaluate Nadia Boulanger's article. She was only a music teacher.</p>

<p>Miss Jelly Roll, as I said, let's delete Madame Boulanger and every other teacher of music.... the sources have been provided, JOST will provide you with every citation to every article of Dr. Thaden. So what if he changed music in America. And certainly having recorded the complete works of JS Bach and Louis Couperin is not important... so let's delete Rubinstein and Horowitz. In fact, let's delete every musician and artist starting with JS Bach. In the mean time, let us inform the mainstream media that only nerds and engineers need apply to Wikipedia. God forbid should we permit an article of a teacher who has changed music in the world. Again, it would be nice if someone who know what the hell they are talking about would evaluate entries in Wikipedia. As of yet, no one with any qualifications has reviewed the Dr. Thaden article. What a sad day it is to find the Wikipedia is controlled by those who have no qualifications to determine what articles are or are not posted to it.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I have voted to save similar articles before, but I don't think this one is worth saving. Searching on Amazon and Alibris turns up no books by Prof. Thaden; Google Scholar has no listings for articles; searching on "Thaden Bach" and "Thaden Couperin" on Google comes up with no relevant hits, as far as I can see. I have a hard time believing he is more notable than the average long-time professor of music. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 02:40, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

God forbid if we might look to RCA Victor or CBS or Bell Telephone Hour or Groves Dictionary of Music and Musicians.... I think the appropriate approach for me is to advocating the deletion of all musicians because they are of obviously no importance.... a Google, Amazon, Alibris search is only as good as the searcher.... it's interesting that I find 11 references on Amazon.... again, it might be helpful if we had real musical authorities reviewing articles rather than self-appointed computer nerds... thus far, no one with any creditials has reviewed Dr. Thaden's article.... In the mean time, I believe this discussion would be of great interest to the NYT or to John von Rhein of the Chicago Tribune who have both reviewed the performances of Dr. Thaden. Still waiting for someone who knows the difference between and accented grace note and an unaccented grace note in Bach's WTC to respond. At this point, I have to say my first experience with Wikipedia confirms everything negative published about it including its anti-arts bias.</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> unless sources are provided. User Rpgbach needs to cool down a little (maybe read <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, I am not really up for having my engineering credentials come into this debate or being called a nerd repeatedly, if user Rpgbach would like I can create a new account and and write that I have a PhD in music from Stanford on my user page maybe then we can stop hearing about how no one knows anything about music. I have been nothing but friendly and civil with this user from the beginning. When he or she contested my first speedy by deleting the tag I nominated it for AFD and left a very friendly note on the user's talk page. I recommended then that Rpgbach take a look at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> and did so again at the top of this discussion. It is obvious that this user has not read this or any policy as he continues to call into question the credentials of those who oppose him and refuses to offer any sources not to mention threatening to expose the monster that is an AFD debate to the NYT (I would like to see a story on this debate in the NYT though). Not understanding policy is very common problem for new users and I try to give them the benefit of the doubt, but Rpgbach hostility is not acceptable, if this user where to relax a little they would find Wikipedia to be a friendly and very reasonable place. There may well be a place for this article on Wikipedia, but there is no place for threats and hostility. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<li><b>Comment</b> I should also mention that there is no such thing as "Western Kentucky State University" - WK State College became WK University, and searching their web site gives no hits for Thaden. And neither does the web site of the University of Missouri at Columbia (which is what I assume is meant in the article). I assume that Prof. Thaden did teach at these schools, but it appears he is not memorialized there by scholarships, chairs, etc. - the sort of thing a distinguished professor generally leaves behind. And since you are so enthusiastically calling us art ignoramuses, I suppose the assumption of good faith here is suspended somewhat and I can point out that the most obvious notability that Prof. Thaden has is as the teacher of <b>R</b>andall <b>P</b>oshek-<b>G</b>lad<b>bach</b>, who is "widely known in the world of New Music", according to Rpgbach. I understand that you may have a great deal of respect for your former teacher, Mr. Poshek-Gladbach, but we can't accept your word that he is worthy of an article, or your word on your own notability. Please give us references, ones that we can check. Mr. Thaden may have been a very well-known performer at one time, but it appears his fame has faded. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 04:13, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, non-notable plain and simple. Randall Poshek-Gladbach is not a prominent composer by any stretch of the imagination, and even if he were it would take more than that bare fact to confer notability on Thaden.

<li><b>Wait</b> an extra week or so for <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, <b>delete</b> if not provided by then. Wikipedia is run on the assumption that volunteer editors aren't experts in specific fields.

So instead of complaining that it's a sad day when a famous person is challenged by folks who don't know squat about the classical music world, the article's proponents should accept that yes, we ignoramuses and cultural dufuses (is that ignorami et dufi?) don't know squat, so please produce the sources needed to enable the article to be kept. If this individual is really this famous, they won't be difficult to find. On-line sources are preferable if available but not necessary.
