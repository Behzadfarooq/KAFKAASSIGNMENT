<li>Why is this not enough renown to pass your guideline?

Although Stephen meant the PM no harm, the story in it's essence is that somebody has clotheslined the leader of Australia with a weapon while his security staff have looked on. The kid has definitely been one of the most talked about people in Australia for the last few days. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrett_ca1d.html" title="User:Drett">Drett</a> 17:49, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> the whole thing is rather a bit too fresh to determine its importance. This may be his short-lived moment of fleeting fame, or it may lead to significant reviews and become a story mentioned anytime the Aussie PM is threatened. But only the future will tell us. In the meantime, let's look at other similar instances. <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Chretien_b76f.html" title="Jean Chretien">Jean Chretien</a> who is a former prime minister of Canada had André Dallaire break into the official residence. This incident had a large amount of press coverage (in Canada), but André Dallaire does not have his own article, nor is there an article on the incident. Instead, it's a brief mention in the article for <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Chretien_b76f.html" title="Jean Chretien">Jean Chretien</a>. I propose that unless the incident muchrooms, it will fade in importance and so should just be a mention in the article for <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Howard_1ea1.html" title="John Howard">John Howard</a>. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 18:00, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Maybe there should be an article on him. The renown for being involved in a newsworthy event certainly fits the guideline that the nominator supplied, why wouldn't it fit there too? <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 04:19, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It is concerned with a famous security incident concerning a nations PM. It is notable to me, and others, if only because there was absolutely no intention. It doesn't actually fail any of the official policies. It only failed the so called "notability" guidelines, which do not prescribe anything, they only guide, for what that is worth. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 04:13, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I don't think that this incident really deserves a mention, so there's certainly no need to have an article on the guy with the screwdriver.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> non-notable persona. This is a joke, right? Let me tell you, if you allow rubbish like this into Wikipedia then its reputation is going to be damaged.

<li>I don't think that any editor disagrees that the security scare should be mentioned in Wikipedia. I think that the question here is what the best way to do that is. Should Wikipedia provide a name check to Mr Battaglia, and discuss the incident in a biographical article on a person, where readers won't even know to find it in a couple of years' time? Or should Wikipedia expand the discussion of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_Australia_3aa3.html" title="Prime Minister of Australia">Prime Minister of Australia</a>'s protective detail in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Federal_Police_32ae.html" title="Australian Federal Police">Australian Federal Police</a>, currently a 1 sentence mention, to include documented security scares such as this one? The latter seems to be the better approach that will benefit readers in the long run, especially given that this article practically has a separate header for every sentence, strongly indicating that it has had to be padded in order to make it an article of any great length. So <b>condense and merge</b> to a section on the PM's protective detail in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Federal_Police_32ae.html" title="Australian Federal Police">Australian Federal Police</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:03, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
