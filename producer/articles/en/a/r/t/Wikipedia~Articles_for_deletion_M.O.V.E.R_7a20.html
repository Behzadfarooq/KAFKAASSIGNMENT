<li><b>Keep</b> As a former resident of Malmesbury, I have the unfortunate memories of knowing my father, who was (for a very short time) a member of the Mover organisation, and whenever I mention this to some of my closest friends who reside in Bath - they have no knowledge of this so called 'gang' - even though I do not believe that the Movers were bad people. Therefore, without knowing what my father did, being in as much of the dark as apparently the rest of England, I cannot pass judgement that this is a fake article - which apparently everyone else can do despite having NO knowledge about it. I know it was a prominent gang, and am pleased that it has finally gotten the recognition somewhere, and I hope that eventually the whole truth can be uncovered.

<dd>User:Tyres first post. You get the point exactly with the statement "which apparently everyone else can do despite having NO knowledge about it", wikipedia has a policy of verifiability (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>), the fact that no one has any knowledge of it is exactly the reason it has no place in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 12:51, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I resent that Jerome C Hasler and his M.O.V.E.R gang are being questioned. Earlier I read an article name Don Ray, which is clear evidence that he and his gang existed. Wikipedia should be ashamed that it questions things of this nature. People need to know what foul, awful, unwashed, discusting, discraceful, horrific, mentally disturbed, animals that were the M.O.V.E.R gang. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Don ray (<a href="../../../d/o/n/User_talk%7EDon_ray_647c.html" title="User talk:Don ray">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Don_ray_07ab.html" title="Special:Contributions/Don ray">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> I see, so basically when four people decide to have a discussion about why an article shouldn't be deleted - everyone instantly assumes that they are all liers/the same person. That's one hell of a trusting assumption. I guess that you clearly know me personally and all these other people that are posting their disagreement with the articles in question that are up for deletion. So what, I might be a new member! Let it go, I've still got just as much of a voice on this site as anyone, and I still have an opinion. It's unfair to assume that just because we disagree with you, we're lieing.

<li>Whether M.O.V.E.R. is deleted or kept, it follows that pages about people who are only notable in that they are M.O.V.E.R. members (such as Don Ray) should be subject to the same decision.

He appeared to carry a large a large bucket of ADES, i then jumped from my bed, grabbed my packed suitcase ( which mysteriously was already packed for me)and i ran into the night riding a buffalo.
