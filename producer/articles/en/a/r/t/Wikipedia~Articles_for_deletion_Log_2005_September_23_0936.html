<p>Went through a AfD already, having a no consensus result. The article hasn't improved any, and in my opinion, continues to be worthless. I also feel that the previous AfD was too muddled by people's preset perceptions about Pokémon articles, fearing that cutting off one head would make it grow back a thousand-fold. Coolkat's accusations of sockpuppetry didn't help the matter any. With that in mind, I threw this back into AfD so we could reach a consensus, hopefully without wrongful impressions or accusations of sockpuppetry. <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostrophe_4563.html" title="User:Apostrophe">Apostrophe</a> 23:54, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

There are many other references not mentioned by the author; just go take a look at <a href="http://www.serebii.net/anime/movies/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.serebii.net/anime/movies/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. This shows that the article has potential for expansion. <a href="../../../a/2E/k/User%7EA.K.R._4fbe.html" title="User:A.K.R.">A.K.R.</a> 09:07, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Another thing I wish to add: it seems like that Pokémon articles suffer from some sort of prejudice by many Wikipedians around here. Why is it that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a> gets such a large, thorough article, with so many accompanying articles (including one article for each episode), while the similar-sized, if not larger <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon.html" title="Pokémon">Pokémon</a> franchise gets a considerably smaller article with less accompanying articles to boot? Also, think about the stubs; why is it that sometimes, there are several, countless stubs taking a place of a deleted Pokémon article? I feel that such a phenomon occurs because some useful articles that require only a cleanup or rewrite gets deleted by overzealous Wikipedians who see Pokémon as something triva. Deleting them is as good as dispersing the information into several different stubs, only to be brought together again, and then to go through another deletion process and the cycle repeats until a culture of fear of deletion surrounding Pokémon articles is created (let me stress that the last bit is my own personal observation). Instead, Pokémon articles which are large enough to warrant their own article, while stubs that have the potential to become one, should be expanded if the subject scope is wide enough, or to be merged with other stubs to form one article if it is not. <a href="../../../a/2E/k/User%7EA.K.R._4fbe.html" title="User:A.K.R.">A.K.R.</a> 09:34, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>"...who see Pokémon as something triva." This is trivia. NN, OR trivia. Do you see that "cultural references in..." can't not be OR (unless perhaps people have started writing theses about it)? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 09:51, 27 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then, on the same scale, should <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a> be considered "triva" too? I'm also not sure what you are referring to as "triva" - is it Pokémon itself, or is it this article? <a href="../../../a/2E/k/User%7EA.K.R._4fbe.html" title="User:A.K.R.">A.K.R.</a> 10:33, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is a list of loosely associated topics, point #2 under "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information." Granted, it's factually debatable if this list fits that description, but if you absolutely need a policy cite, there you go.<br />
In reply to other comments, the idea of adding information to articles about movies, games, characters, places, etc. to increase their relevance to the real world, including links to pop culture or history, is a great one, and I would love to see (for example) <a href="../../../a/2E/k/User%7EA.K.R._4fbe.html" title="User:A.K.R.">A.K.R.</a> expand the heck out of the Pokémon movie articles; they need it, badly. I welcome any effort to lend greater context to Pokémon (or any other) articles.<br />
That said, <i>this particular list</i> is forever going to be unhelpful to those who want to learn how the Pokémon anime or movies are localized into English, because inherent to lists of trivia is a lack of description or overview. Most of what's here already should instead be an integrated part of the articles/list entries for the characters in question or movies in question, as examples reinforcing description of the subject. (For example, the fact that Ash turns down prune juice is in and of itself a useless fact, even with an explanation of the joke, but it would make a fine example to support a statement in <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_%28anime%29.html" title="Pokémon (anime)">Pokémon (anime)</a> along the lines of "Much of the humor in the English-language adaptation of the anime is the sort of mild, youth-oriented humor common to childrens' cartoons." (This is a crappy example, but you get my point.)<br />
This list is an example of <i>why</i> lists of trivia, either as standalone articles or as sections of larger articles, are unencyclopedic; they do not help the reader reach an encyclopedic understanding of the subject, but instead simply arm the reader with bits of data.<br />
If someone wants to rewrite <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_%28anime%29.html" title="Pokémon (anime)">Pokémon (anime)</a>, using examples from this list to explain how the Pokémon anime's English-language localization is Americanized, that would be absolutely fantastic. Barring that, this list is just a list of fannish factoids, un-linked-to, mostly obvious, largely contextless, and almost entirely valueless. The little information of value in this list belongs in (and, by and large, is already in) other articles. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 13:19, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. The degree of development of a subject can be assessed by the list of items which the practitioners admit are unsolved. Thus physics and mathematics have a large and growing list of unsolved problems. Assuming that <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governance.html" title="Governance">governance</a> is a proper concept or subject of study, like <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/n/Control_theory.html" title="Control theory">control theory</a>, then it should be possible to state a list of the objects of study for the subject. If some item of the list currently cannot be solved, as in physics, then a description of that item can be added to this article. It's like the description of an addiction; the first step toward recovery is to admit you have a problem. Even the concepts of physics were once controversial. People have been burned at the stake for stating a principle of physics. So too for this subject. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncheta_Wis_6134.html" title="User:Ancheta Wis">Ancheta Wis</a> 01:08, 23 September 2005 (UTC) This is not to say that the items in the list might not be POV. But that is an agenda for discussion of each item. Note that there has been theoretical progress in this subject. See <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nash_equilibrium.html" title="Nash equilibrium">Nash equilibrium</a> and <a href="../../../i/t/e/Iterated_prisoner%27s_dilemma.html" title="Iterated prisoner's dilemma">Iterated prisoner's dilemma</a> for <i>solved problems</i> in this subject.</li>

<dd><b>Comment, not a vote</b>. I'm not sure if these two solved problems are properly considered part of governance. I think the real concern is that "problems" are not adequately specifiable in this domain that would allow someone to decide if a problem is solved or not. In physics there is experimental data that is either accounted for by the theory or not (yes, yes, I know there are fuzzy boundaries to this problem). In this sense its clear when a problem is solved. But, what exactly is the problem of "war"? And what sorts of things would lead the relevant scientific community to consider the problem solved? If there aren't undisputed answers to these questions, there is some serious worry about POV. I think this is a serious concern here since we don't have a large number of scientists as contributors and so we could easily be the place for one or two scientists to POV push. --best, kevin <font color="#BBBBBB">·</font><font color="#666666">·</font>·<small><a href="../../../k/z/o/User%7EKzollman_a660.html" title="User:Kzollman">Kzollman</a> | <a href="../../../k/z/o/User_talk%7EKzollman_107b.html" title="User talk:Kzollman">Talk</a></small>·<font color="#666666">·</font><font color="#BBBBBB">·</font> 02:00, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>More than anything, they are solved problems in mathematics.

<dd>The fact that it's sometimes a useful model for human behovior doesn't answer the fundamental questions of when, where, and to whom it is most applicable. And certainly, for the behaviors modeled under this sort of game theory there are other competing explanations. The point I was trying to make is that the only sense in which Nash equilibria are a "solved problem" is that we have worked out the mathematics. The application of this branch of game theory to political science questions remains at issue. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 07:38, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I'd like to concentrate on the positive, but it takes misunderstanding the whole project to post an article like this and then <i>argue that it should be kept.</i> The beauty of the prose is irrelevant, and some of the people closing VfD's lately have been trying to make it binary. All "userfy" they are dealing with as "remove the tag and leave it alone." Thus, I'm no longer voting anything but keep or delete, with what could be done alternatively <i>after</i> that vote. As for band articles, I'm not the only editor on Wikipedia who was in a band that <i>does</i> have an entry in AMG and other places but not an article on Wikipedia. The fact is that Wikipedia is not Ultimatebandlist.com, not AMG, not "every cool band," and it is not an advertising medium nor a mechanism for legitimizing a subject. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 21:16, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, it is apart of the official name, no question. But, many articles don't have the *exact* official name as their article name. The exact name must always start the article, but it doesn't have to be the article title. A number of articles even have a message saying the article name is wrong for technical reasons.

<li>Disagree. <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> is dead. <b>Requesat In Pace</b>. The fact is, (and clearly demonstrated here and the rest of this week's nominations) that there is indeed no concensus. All of the previous attempts to reach it over the past 2 years have failed - utterly. Deletionists (not necessarily <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyJones_d8f9.html" title="User:AndyJones">AndyJones</a>), who have waged an ongoing, destructive, war of attrition against school articles would now like to re-open some sort of negotiations to re-wrangle through previously kicked-to-death-horse issues. I see this as nothing more than a last ditch attempt to stem the tide of two inevitabilities which are ruining their campaign: First, the exponential growth of the rate of creation of new school articles (virtually impossible to AfD them as fast as they are being created). Second, the near 97% rate of survival by school articles at the AfD process. Suggestions have emerged from deletionists that the AfD process is no good, and that a new concensus has to be reached. I submit that gradual and inevitable concensus is indeed being reached - school articles are being created at a never-before-seen rate, and they are surviving the AfD process at 95%+. What this means is that if there is not already a "concensus" (of a sort) that school articles will indeed be part of WP, then there soon will be. As the number of school articles grow and are improved over time, more and more editors will acknowledge their legitimacy, if only because there will be so many articles which will have been a part of WP for so long (by the time this is "over" it will literally be <b>years</b>). AfD is doing it's job (even though it is chronically being abused to launch terrorist strikes against school articles in the form of multi and mass-nominations) - editors are voting on articles, and the articles are surviving the process.</li>

<li>I am not being negative. When voters repeatedly tag their "delete" votes on school articles as "crap", "NN", etc. it is merely a statement of opinion that we will see more of the same, based upon frequent and long-standing occurance. I have already assumed good-faith, but certain editors clearly do not demonstrate good-faith with commentary of this nature, as well as multi and mass-nominations of schools to AfD. The comments I have made should be <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assumed to be in good faith</a>, since all they do is predict AfD voting patterns based on previous and extensive history.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 12:09, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

Right now the combination of the content, title, and category is ambiguous at best. Saying <i>"There's nothing wrong with this one as is"</i> makes as little sense as the article.

<li>I actually tried "Cherokee moon OR moons ceremony OR ceremonies" and other combinations on Google, and checked several web pages. There are several moon ceremonies at different times of the year, but I found no reference to the importance of 13, nor of its relationship to turtles, nor of turtles being sacred (note that the latter claim has been removed from the article).

<li>I note the following <i>Ceremonies played an important part in the life of the tribe. The Cherokee celebrated a series of seasonal ceremonies and festivities that corresponded to the food cycle of the tribe. March was the first of thirteen moons and the feast of the deer. April’s celebration focused on strawberries, and the next harvests were “little” corn, watermelon, peaches, mulberries, and then “great” corn. In the eighth moon, our October, the festival featured turkey, followed by ceremonies for bison, bear, ducks, chestnuts, and finally nuts that were used in bread. Most of the seasonal ceremonies declined in importance in the eighteenth century, except the one held in late summer that coincided with the ripening of the late crop of corn. The Green Corn Ceremony lasted several days and had significant cultural and social connotation.</i>, which may be about the same thing, from <a href="http://www.chattoogariver.org/Articles/2004Su/Indians.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.chattoogariver.org/Articles/2004Su/Indians.htm" rel="nofollow">Chattoogariver.org</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - yeah it might be easy to simply delete this article, but this article is but 2 hours old right now and while there isn't much context, I highly doubt that it is all made up.

<li>I strongly object to the claim that this was nominated too quickly. The majority of deleted articles are speedied or AfDd within a minute of their creation.

<li>My point was that just because I nominated the article soon after it was created doesn't make it an invalid or even a bad nomination.

<p>I would like to draw attention to some of Gadugi's edits of this AfD, which are now buried in the edit history (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FCherokee_Moons_Ceremonies&amp;diff=23808257&amp;oldid=23808031" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FCherokee_Moons_Ceremonies&amp;diff=23808257&amp;oldid=23808031" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FCherokee_Moons_Ceremonies&amp;diff=23809647&amp;oldid=23809581" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FCherokee_Moons_Ceremonies&amp;diff=23809647&amp;oldid=23809581" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FCherokee_Moons_Ceremonies&amp;diff=23809846&amp;oldid=23809767" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FCherokee_Moons_Ceremonies&amp;diff=23809846&amp;oldid=23809767" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FCherokee_Moons_Ceremonies&amp;diff=23814308&amp;oldid=23813957" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FCherokee_Moons_Ceremonies&amp;diff=23814308&amp;oldid=23813957" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>). I think they certainly qualify as <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>, especially the bits about me being an Irish steel worker (never been near a steel foundry in my life), and the bit about me being blocked for disruption. Considering that these posts were made here in response to my listing this article for AfD, I figured it was appropriate to mention this. I've left a message on his talk page here. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcap_a87c.html" title="User:Blackcap">Blackcap</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackcap_5870.html" title="User talk:Blackcap">talk</a> 08:25, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh my god, I just saw an ILM forming. You posted comments I was a hoax and marked a perfectly valid article for Afd in bad faith. You also bragged on your talk page about being an Irish (Steel) "Blue Collar" worker. Dont post content on Wiki if you dont want it copied and edited. I removed those comments I made because they were inappropriate. I see conduct like this on SCOX all the time but now I see it here. ILM Alert. Gadugi 08:29, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>O.K. I've had some sleep, and now can respond fully. First: I have never said that you are a hoax anywhere. If I may draw your attention to the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cherokee_Moons_Ceremonies_0c64.html#Cherokee_Moons_Ceremonies" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cherokee Moons Ceremonies">top of this page</a>, I say, "Probably a hoax." This was a guess based on the content of the article, how unverified it is, and the fact that it is appartently not notable enough to exist anywhere in the internet except for Wikipedia, and the internet is a big place. Second: You apparently do not understand WP policies, as evidenced by the edits mentioned above and your immediate assumption that this article was nominated in bad faith. Third: You continue to say that I violated some AfD regulation and that your article is "valid" (and is therefore, I can only presume, immune from AfD), but if you see <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a> you'll find that I haven't violated anything and that policy is on my side, at least in terms of nominating the article. I suggest that you relax, re-read this AfD, and read <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a>, and <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> and see that I haven't done anything wrong here. If, after doing that, you still feel that I have, then at least cite some WP policy that puts me in the wrong. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcap_a87c.html" title="User:Blackcap">Blackcap</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackcap_5870.html" title="User talk:Blackcap">talk</a> 16:38, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You called this article a Hoax and me. You probably should actually read the articles before voting Afd. You keep quoting Wiki policy, yet Google shows 31,000 hits on this topic, then you quote NPA policies, while it was you who attacked by posting an Afd to the article accusing the author of being a hoax and a fraud without ever having read it or inquiring. Why don't you just admit, "I was lazy and was attacking Jeff because I do not like him based on the stuff I saw on the internet, and I pounced the moment I saw him post this article and I was in the wrong, AfD withdrawn." Instead you keep justifying your actions when everything you claimed, all of your reasoning, your research (or lack thereof) all indicate you did not even attempt to verify information before voting, and you were in the wrong from the start.

<li>Wait, Do not delete, please provide some input on how I could modify this to benefit this site. He has historical and biography material for numerous noteable popular rock musicians and he has been working directly with these artists for over 20 years. What about the people that have been interviewed here. He has over 20 years of exclusive interviews with musicians ranging from the Allman Brothers, Weezer, Billy Idol, etc.? Rockstarpix.TV is the next generation of music video television and V-logging (this has been said by artists he has worked with like Billy Idol, Steve Stevens, Jethro Tull).

<li><b>Comment</b>. I edited the article. first problem was that it appears the text was largely from <a href="http://www.mikeportnoy.com/articles/pdf/036.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mikeportnoy.com/articles/pdf/036.pdf" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. Next problem was that the article was non-encyclopedic. Terms like "impressive" and "visual showcase" make good advertisment copy, but are not neutral terms and are not appropriate for an encylopedia. I also removed the link to Rockstarpix.TV. It may in your opinion be "the next generation of music video television and V-logging", but hopefully you can admit to being a bit biased as it is your site. Those claims cannot be independantly verified, unless you can cite some sources where someone reputable has made that claim in an article.</li>

<dd>I'm not sure this article will survive the AfD even with the changes because there is still the question of notability.

<li>What current policy? It's nearly useless to say "according to current policy" because there's so many of them; you need to explain how you feel particular policy <i>applies</i> to the current case. In this case, I think our policies on autobiography (we frown on them) and vanity (we frown on that too) apply, and as Barno points out, "Notability does not transfer through a camera to its user". It's true that this person has taken a <i>lot</i> of people over the years of some <i>very</i> famous people. But given that that is basically the definition of his profession, that <i>every</i> celebrity photographer is trying to get photos of celebrities, the question becomes: is <i>every</i> member of his profession automatically notable; or, is there evidence that he is notable <i>beyond</i> the standard for his profession? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:46, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>Hey Feldspar, what is up your ass buddy?</s> Michael Giambra is not a "celebrity photographer". He is a working journalist and producer. You should try to get your facts straight before you try to classify others. <s>Why don't you tell us what great acomplishments you have produced other than your snarky, anal comments here?</s> He does not "try" to get photographs of famous people. Michael Giambra is invited and encouraged to document them and treated as a friend and a peer by them. I try to remain humble here but I can back up everything I am stating here about Mr. Giambra with his photographic evidence and historical proof. What angers me is that someone with NO credibility (other than your affiliation to wikipedia) can try to berate and belittle his 20+ years of photography, journalism and video production work without ANY knowledge of the truth or facts. --<a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockstarpixtv_bafa.html" title="User:Rockstarpixtv">Rockstarpixtv</a> 02:11, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

I'd have no problem with this article being about the album, but to claim that there is a genre called "Love Metal" based on the music of one artist shows a lack of understanding as to what the term "genre" actually means. A genre is a collection or group of artists with a similar sound. By definition you can't have a collection or group of one artist.

<li>Expand? This is ridiculous. I could add a hundred bands to this article, but I won't, because it isn't a genre. A genre has to be defined by something they actually do that other genres don't. Death metal is notable for its use of screeching, nu metal is notable for its lack of solos and use of rap vocals, speed metal is notable for, er, speed, 'love metal' is notable for... what?

Also, one of the key features of µTorrent is the ability to run it off a thumb drive due to the program's tiny file size. -- tedddee 16:14, 23 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Neither of those links says anything about the program's popularity. In fact, if it has just been released, the burden of proof for inclusion should be high. As for key features, those don't matter either. The fact that a program is useful or clever does not make it notable. | Keithlaw 16:33, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>That's a valid argument. The flip side is that if the program doesn't catch on, there won't be a need to re-add it. And adding non-notable products for the purposes of spreading the word about them is something a lot of Wikipedians (myself included) would like to discourage.

<li>Clarification: Since you appear to be the original author, I'll try to clarify my delete vote comments. The "hooey" that I mentioned wasn't in reference to the article's subject matter (although that might be hooey too), it was referring, instead, to the writing; it's unclear, dense, recondite, incomplete and muddled to the point of being nearly indecipherable. Since nearly indentical versions of the same text appear elsewhere on the Internet, I assume the poor writing isn't yours. However, if you rework the text, improve its structure and clarity, fill in the holes, work on the punctuation, remove the B.S, and provide convincing evidence of notability for this "Internet dialectic," I'm certainly willing to reconsider my vote. — <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMaylett_1b3a.html" title="User:Maylett">C Maylett</a> 21:24, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> and <b>Cleanup</b>. Is it a load of crap? Probably... but it is a load of crap that has a fairly significant number of blogs, forums, and related chatter in existance. I can see the potential that someone might reference wikipedia to figure out what it is. I would however rename the article to OS 012 or at very least do a redirect from OS 012 if OS 0 1 2 is the correct format as the former gets infinitely more google hits than the latter. I'm also tagging this with a cleanup because the article is not well written and is probably too esoteric to be of any value in its current form.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:40, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>'Master Meme' is a term defined for an idea that can no longer be defeated or shown to be false in rational exchange, and continues to spread defeating, via rational exchange, all ideas in conflict with it. The word was 'coined' for the first time at the beginning formation of the dialectic, the only way to prove that it is not such an idea would be to disprove the idea in rational exchange. By definition, OS 012 being a master meme is true. The idea is not personal research, although personal research has gone into it, the idea formed as a natural dialectic on the internet, just as it states.

<li>C'mon dpbsmith, focus on the valid critiques so i can make this page meet your standards here. THis issue with a piece of coined terminology is a non starter for valid critique. A 'master meme', by definition, by how it is defined by the person who coined the word, is an idea that has become dominant and can no longer be defeated in rational exchange. Such a meme is defined as a master meme. 2 + 2=4 is also a 'master meme'. Since OS 012 cannot, or has not been defeated in a rational discussion, it is, by definition and thus tautologically true a master meme. I dont see what is so hard to understand about that. A term that is defined, and then stays within that definition is a tautological truth, a truth by definition. OS 012 is a meme that spreads through the i nternet word of mouth. Here is a link that shows the stats of number of uniques hits worldwide word of mouth to the site in the past 60 days. <a href="http://s2.phpbbforfree.com/forums/os012-about43.html" class="external free" title="http://s2.phpbbforfree.com/forums/os012-about43.html" rel="nofollow">http://s2.phpbbforfree.com/forums/os012-about43.html</a> It being a meme is self evident as it's viral capabilities are proven. I dont need a write up in Wired to verify that it is a meme on the rise, that is absurd, I just need server stats, which I think are irrelevant to post on wiki, as I am sure most would agree. Tumbleman
<ul>
<li>So by definition if the OS 0 1 2 article gets deleted from Wikipedia does that mean it's been defeated and is thus no longer a master meme or is this page considered an irrational exchange?--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:39, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's one thing to claim that it is a POV or personal research, there I could see an arguement, but nonsense? WTF? That is a CLAIM, and an unsupported one at that. Although this is not the proper forum for this, I would normally challenge you to back up such claims in debate. Why dont you pinpoint what is nonsense to you instead of flacking your opinion as if it is fact? What is this, an art gallery or a source for facts? I dont personally want to do the cleanup on Wiki as I may be too biased, and have put out the request for cleanup. In the meantime, some of you may want to argue this over at the proper forum. I dont mind a proper critique, but slandering something you dont understand as nonsense I wont tolerate. Tumbleman</li>
<li>Other sites that promote the global dialectic. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/salviacrusaders/os_012/" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/salviacrusaders/os_012/" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/salviacrusaders/os_012/</a> another one in England <a href="http://highcompassion.co.uk/" class="external free" title="http://highcompassion.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://highcompassion.co.uk/</a>, there is another one in a foriegn language I cant find the link to now....again, personal research sure, but by more than one person, dozens possibly hundreds contributed to this project. The truth values of the document are not personal research, they are self evident. 3rd value logic is not personal research, dialectic is not personal research. the dynamics of internet discussion is not personal research. It (OS 012) was not created by one person, but by many people, as it continues to be...so the claim that it is personal essay is false. There are more than one personal essays about OS 012 on the internet. Those people who created dont even know each other, and are not tied to a group either. Tumbleman</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. There needs to be a new word for a neologism that is not only of little linguistic worth and likely to be short-lived, but also incredibly annoying and pretentious, like 90% of the words containing or related to the word 'blog' or 'podcast'.

<li><b>Comment</b>, this term has often been employed to describe the invokation of ancient spiritual deities for specific elemental purposes. However I had no idea this was associated to podcasting. The term I refer to is something that many witchdoctors and "exorcists" or warlocks vocally perform as a manner of conducting ritual for communication with the gods. Also has been recognised as a similar term for the communication or converse with God between the angels and/or prophets.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, this VfD is nonsense, why should this be deleted when other galleries for artists or other recognised image media are kept? Nintendo and SEGA are notable companies as well as consoles, the imagery provided represents the progress that these companies have succeeded throughout the 20th Century with their video games. I find that this is of extreme importance to any archive or record relating to the history of video games and consoles. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 12:01, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

Because as far as I can see both seem to be related in regards of displaying images related to an artist or in this case a video-game console. In regards to the video game console which so happens to be SEGA and Nintendo - both are notable and I think it is relevant to have a record of images based on the evolution of graphics of the games that both consoles have notable produced throughout the years. Unless you can come up with a better argument then I will continue to consider this VfD <b>nonsense</b> - I hope that was made clear.

It is a gallery I agree, however a gallery of images that have been used throughout Wikipedia for articles related to the games, also they have been displayed under an encyclopedic context with added text and references to the individual articles of the games - just as other lists have been made, only in this case we are given information related to the evolution of the games in terms of their graphics and their respective screen shot.

<li>Since when does something have to be on Google to be a recognised concept!?!? As for you being unable to find anyone who knows of it, it is not very well known and it has been included on here so that people can learn something about it, which is why most topics are included in encyclopaedias. Surely all that is needed here is to quote the ACS&amp;H as the source and make clear that it is a statistical method used in specific circumstances such that its users are more concerned with it can do rather than what it is called.

<li>My vote is now simply <b>Keep</b> and expand. Since my original vote, Jack has added some information to the article about the fact that his source is "the quarterly journal of the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_Cricket_Statisticians_and_Historians_f1ee.html" title="Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians">Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians</a>". This goes some way towards reassuring me, and I think it's enough for me now to oppose the article's deletion. I also strongly disagree with the subject's being referred to as "cricketcruft" (see below); I think it's entirely suitable for Wikipedia. However, although we know Jack is a good and trustworthy editor, most readers will never have heard of him (or, indeed, any of us). Therefore I stand by the reasons for my original vote, which was made at a time when no source information at all was given, and I still think that a <i>specific</i> source is highly desirable and its addition to the article should be a high priority. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELoganberry_54ba.html" title="User talk:Loganberry">Talk</a>) 22:34, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's an entirely ridiculous statement.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and <i>update as necessary when further research has been done</i>, including identification of the precise issue(s) of <i>The Cricket Statistician</i> (ACS Journal) in which this concept has been discussed. I think you will find that the article(s) is/are many years old by now. As for its usage, I personally know TWO cricket statisticians who use it. I admit that one is <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackJack_1e91.html" title="User:BlackJack">BlackJack</a> but there is another chap who also uses the method. I think one of the difficulties with it, as Jack has said somewhere, is that it is a method without any definitely agreed title. I fully expect that if the source article in the ACS journal can be found, its title will not be the title of the method but something along the lines of "How to compare batsmen of different eras". As a result, those who have adopted and used the approach are left to give it their own title and, indeed, the two people I know call it differently: one says virtual scoring and the other says relative scoring. Equally, it could be called comparative scoring or real value scoring or whatever.</li>
<li>As with all articles on this site, this one is open to enhancement and improvement. I fail to understand how anyone can justify calling for its deletion just because the precise source is momentarily unavailable. Surely by including the article it is possible that someone may read it who can supply the journal date and number; who will then edit the article accordingly???

Frankly, I get sick and tired of people who "don't think something is a suitable topic". This is an encyclopaedia and its purpose as such is to be a work containing information about every department of human knowledge. I presume cricket statistics is a department of human knowledge and is worthy of being a sub-category of cricket to contain numerous articles about statistical methods and approaches? In that case, if some members of the ACS use a technique to compare batsmen in 1805 with batsmen in 2005, is that method not a legitimate subject for inclusion in the cricket stats category; or is it more important to exercise pedantry because someone has encountered something in an encyclopaedia that he has not heard of before and "cannot find on Google"? I despair. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackJack_1e91.html" title="User:BlackJack">Jack</a> 11:41, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Have you really still not understood? I <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackJack_a011.html" title="User talk:BlackJack">actually said</a> "I just don't think it's a suitable topic <i>without some sort of corroboration</i>". The dispute (well, apart from <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a>) is not against the subject itself, but against the lack of citations. Of course it's a suitable topic, <i>if, and only if</i>, you can cite a proper source. "I heard about it in a journal once, but you'll have to look up which one," is not a proper source. It is <i><a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">required</a></i> on Wikipedia that you write from sources, not from memory. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Turner_b872.html" title="User:Stephen Turner">Stephen Turner</a> 12:58, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You are splitting hairs. Okay, if the precise source was in a journal some years ago and cannot be readily identified, then the article is merely <b>incomplete</b> pending further research (i.e., to find the precise quarterly journal). Nearly every article on Wikipedia (and every stub) is incomplete; which is why people are invited to come on here and edit them. If I find the precise quarterly journal I will quote it; if someone else finds it, they can edit the article and quote it. The general source of the concept is the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_Cricket_Statisticians_and_Historians_f1ee.html" title="Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians">Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians</a> and the concept is used by members of that body, including myself.

<ul>
<li>I don't think Wikipedia is a waste of time. I think people who make pedantic, carping criticisms are a waste of time. Fortunately there aren't that many of them on here. May I suggest that as the article is <i>incomplete</i> it should be <b>recategorised as a stub</b>? By having it on here, there is a possibility that another user just might have the precise source (which I think will be an ACS journal from as long ago as 1980) and will edit the article to supply it? But he won't do that if the article is deleted, will he? What sort of short-sighted, illogical approach is it to delete a perfectly good article just because the precise source is momentarily unavailable? The article quotes the ACS as the general source so surely that is enough to be going with?

<li><b>Keep</b> I admit I've never heard about virtual scoring - but hey, isn't one of the things about an encyclopaedia that you do read about things you've never heard of before. Yes, the article is missing a few things - and references is an important thing that it is missing - but so are many other articles. It needs to be expanded, with comments on which statisticians use it, and comments on how relevant it is - but for this to happen the nascent article has to stay. Here we should give Jack the benefit of the doubt - Jack is a good contributor, and based on his very valuable work to WP to date, which I for one have found very informative and which supply information that has not previously been available on the internet, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 20:37, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - do we have an article on promotional materials, in general?

<dd>I would say this is fairly good precedent that at least some warez groups are encyclopedic.

<li><b>Keep</b> - unlike the category, it seems like this table provides pretty good concise summaries / short descriptions of the groups. Agree with Dragons flight above on the necessity of limiting the groups to sufficient notability, though that of course carries the caveat of flame wars, vandalism, etc. when someone decides that warez group X or Y is not notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Not to overtly criticize, but that's a rather unsophisticated comment. 95% of all released warez comes from a small number of well-established groups, with anywhere from 2 to 5 groups vying for the top position in a specific niche (i.e., PC games, DVD movies, etc.). Given the attention that piracy receives in this country and others, I would argue that such major contributors to piracy are indeed sufficiently notable.

<li><b>Bicycle keep</b>. As it clearly states atop this article, this is a list of warez groups for the parent article on <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warez.html" title="Warez">warez</a>. It was created because the list of names was becoming too long for the main article and it was appropriate to export it; I believe this is an acceptable reason for the creation of a list on Wikipedia. If non-notable or non-verifiable groups are added they can always be removed, but that is certainly not a valid reason for the deletion of the entire list. Secondly, this list serves to document notable groups which do not yet have articles rather than create a host of stubs.

<dd>RaD Man brings up a good point. This article, while being placed on VfD, has not had a chance to be improved. That really weakens this VfD, because one of the benefits of a VfD is that the article itself often gets improved during that time. If this article gets deleted (and it's pretty borderline right now), that makes it a strong case for a VfU. Perhaps this article should be unprotected and placed on VfD for another week.

<li><b>Keep</b> for several reasons: 1) moved to sub page since <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warez.html" title="Warez">Warez</a> was getting too large 2) stops the main warez article (which has been a repeatedly used resource/reference by major media organizations NY TIMES, BBC) itself from being vandalized constantly by joe schmoe the 12yr old warez kiddie to hype his latest l33t group. 3) Its really easy to verify existance of groups, but many are not noteworthy enough to get a stub article. This is a way to list smaller groups, as well as larger more verifiable groups with a brief 2-3 sentance description of them, and save the hassle of vfd's of small stubs because one person decided group X was non notable. Sadly a category (which I do find useful) would get cluttered up way too fast if we were to start including data on each group since there have been probably 15,000+ warez groups worldwide in the past 20 years. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">™</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b5/Radioactive.svg/18px-Radioactive.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" /></a> 00:17, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Agreeing with RiDG, the fact that cracked/pirated software/media makes up such a large margin in the computer market (a given, since anyone somewhat knowledgeable on a computer has heard of p2p, and the general makeup of those networks is for distributing such files) should account for it's place it notability. Second, agreeing with RaD Man and ALKIVAR, the need for a seperate list to be created should be obvious given that someone that doesn't know what the term warez means probably doesn't want to have to deal with a huge list of groups on the same page. Also, not to be critical, but it seems that most of those giving a reason for deletion simply find the subject offensive. A wiki not only allows editing by anyone from mister PhD to his 4 year old daughter, but it also promotes free-speech. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHello_World_f110.html" title="User:Hello World">Hello World!</a> 18:02, July 19, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Not at all. 23 of these nominations were a mass-nomination by the same editor attacking the Miami-Dade school district specifically.

There are more nominations in this past week against Asian school articles than in the preceeding four months. The recent spike in proportion of Asian schools being nominated for AfD is clearly an example of systemic bias, as is the nominator's comment concerning <b>pidgin</b> English. I am astonished that given that the nominator used the phrase "some random chinese primary school" , anyone would challenge my assertion that this is an example of systemic bias.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 16:53, 23 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The statement that it's a sudden spike actually argues <i>against</i> it being systemic bias, which would have been ongoing. Nominators of American school articles often ridicule their language as well, and use terms like "some random Iowa school". How is it that you view a whole bunch of Miami schools getting nominated as an individual vendetta, but a whole bunch of Asian schools getting nominated is "systemic bias"? —<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">talk</a>) 21:43, 23 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I may be wasting my time in trying to explain it, if you do not already see the bias. The spike in nominations of Asian schools is systemic bias, precisely because the attempts to delete American (and Canadian and British) schools have failed so miserably. Nominating Asian schools is an attempt to focus deletion attempts on schools which are <i>de facto</i> less well-known, less "notable" (whatever that really means) and less likely to be improved by a Wikipedia community made up largely of native-English speakers from the United States, Canada and the UK. Thusly, Asian schools being mulit-nominated for AfD is an example of systemic bias because (as this nominator has already stated) "the deletion of even one article is a victory". It is easier to delete a school article which is not from a native-English speaking part of the world because such a school is far less likely to be improved and brought up to standard when compared to those in English-speaking parts of the world. Hence, those voters who will approach the AfD with no stated view on the <b>inherent notability of schools</b>, will be more likely to see a poorly-written, poorly-edited school article when it is from Asia than from Florida, and are more likely to vote to delete it. The entire scenario is textbook systemic bias.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 22:19, 23 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If what you say was the nominator's intent, it has failed miserably, since as of now there are zero delete votes and many keep votes. Still, alleging <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a> is an attack on all of Wikipedia, and using the seeming <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigotry.html" title="Bigotry">bigotry</a> of one nominator as evidence of a weakness of the entire WP community is not fair. —<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">talk</a>) 22:27, 23 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know how much more clear I could be. Schools from parts of the world that do not speak English as a native language suffer a systemic bias because they will be less well known in a community that is made up of native-English speakers. You are correct, this bias exists in the WP community as whole - by definition. Schools in North America, the UK, Australia, etc. are going to be more numerous, more well-known, more "notable", be the subject of more edits (all of which are objectively true) than schools in areas where English is not the native language because the English-speaking WP community is made up of people largely from those places (and thusly will be better acquainted with schools in their own geographical regions than "some random school in China"). A multi-nomination of schools from Asia is an exploitation of this systemic bias in order to achieve the end of "getting even one school article deleted." I am well-pleased that this attempted exploitation of the systemic bias is failing in this case.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 22:38, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This page has 4 sentences. The first states that it concerns a primary school. The second and third name a principal and a "consultant principal;" for both, not even a first name is provided, just the Chinese surname. The concluding sentence mentions that Lingnan Primary School has an association with its old boys society (almost as if that is unusual—I suspect the author is trying to relate something else?). There is not even a passing, stray nod toward any kind of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a>. Not even an external link (even to the usual non-independent, poor sources). Not one reference. No mention even of those well-known bestowers of encyclopediability—telephone numbers. Every time you think you've seen the worst examples of complete indifference to the most basic requirements of Wikipedia articles, something turns the corner on AfD and proves you wrong. When people (on both sides of this issue) vote in a partisan manner (ie. to always "keep" schools or to always "delete" schools) they <b>damage</b> WP, because no attention is paid to the true arbiters of encyclopediability—the authority that is forged from having multiple, good quality, independent, subject-focused sources that will satisfy WP:V, WP:RS, WP:NOR, WP:NOT, WP:N. At its heart writing an encyclopedia article is simple: like any scholarly article, <i>you need to always source all your statements to good references</i>. That is and has always been the crucial requirement. If it is difficult or impossible to write a good article because there is simply a lack of sources to satisfy WP:V, that is an indication that the subject cannot be given encyclopedic treatment in a separate article of its own. Conversely, if there is an abundance of quality references, that article will deserve a place even if most people have never so much as heard about it. This article has remained in this utterly, completely, unverified state for 3 months. <b>Delete</b>.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">enceph</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#666699">alon</font></a> 12:40, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>You are, of course, quite mistaken, Kappa.
<ol>
<li><i>Wikipedia is an <b>encyclopedia</b></i>. That is the very first thing you read under Key Policies (<a href="../../../r/u/l/WP%7ERULES_e375.html" title="WP:RULES">WP:RULES</a>), the main page of the essential rules that govern this encyclopedia. It is the very first thing that you read in the fundamental five pillars (<a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">WP:5P</a>). The fundamental requirements of encyclopedia writing are enshrined in the basic, fundamental tenets of its <a href="../../../r/u/l/WP%7ERULES_e375.html" title="WP:RULES">policies</a>. WP:V, WP:NOR, WP:NPOV are each and all <i>fundamental</i> rules that we may not ignore as we please: they are there for a reason—if you want to write an encyclopedia, you <i><b>must</b></i> pay attention to sources and verifiability. On Wikipedia, WP:V, WP:RS, WP:NOR are especially important—in fact they are <i>crucial</i>; I would say they are the single most important set of tenets that we have to follow. Why? Because of the particular nature of our encyclopedia: its editors are anyone and everyone, and it is <i>open to editing</i> by anyone and everyone. We do not have professional editors and scholars writing our articles, we do not have submissions for peer-review, we do not have experts endorsing them. The <i>only safeguard we have</i> against a deluge of nonsense, falsehoods, misinterpretations, lies, hoaxes, and other undesirables is to reference what we write to independent, reputable sources (either primary or secondary).</li>
<li>If you wish to write an article about something you know about—your dog, say, or a little school across the street, by all means do so: as long as you can meet the above requirements. If your dog is the last of a special breed that was studied in a peer-reviewed <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_abe5.html" title="National Geographic">National Geographic</a> report, please, by all means write about him and reference the article. If <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholae_Bergensis_Cathedralis_e777.html" title="Scholae Bergensis Cathedralis">your school has an 852-year old history</a> and is the subject of several works, including at least one entry in an encyclopedia, please, by all means write about it and source your entry. If you work on an unusual <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Pseudowallerian_degeneration_8f1f.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Pseudowallerian degeneration">pathological process</a> that few WPns have even heard of, but which is well-studied by scientists, may I implore you—write about it and source it.</li>
<li>But if your dog, school or work lack such primary or secondary sources, <i>please</i>—pause. That is an indication that it is not suitable for an encyclopedic entry, at least for now. If independent verifiable information on your school is so hard to come by that it's not even possible to determine trivial information like the name of its principal, please—do the honorable thing and desist. If the only "source" you can find for writing your article is an external internet link to a <i>completely</i> non-independent source in a <i>foreign language</i>, whose information the overwhelming majority of English WP editors have absolutely no way of verifying, please—do the right thing: maintain a respect for WP's policies and vote to remove the page, even if this goes against your personal preference. WP does its best, indeed. Its best does not include breaking its own fundamental policies to include unverified material.</li>
<li>Haddersfield is a poor comparison to this apparent school. As someone who has spent a lot of time thinking about WP, its policies, and the seemingly intractable debates that surround some of its articles, it seems to me that poor understanding of fundamental policies underlie much of the disagreements. The difference between the two is two-fold.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<dl>
<dd>A. Every single claim in the Haddersfield page is verified. It has a link to an independent source, which, even if principally only a map, verifies what is being said in the article, and indeed adds likely dependable information not found in the article. Furthermore, the source is not written in Japanese, ancient Greek, or in some other way that will render it inaccessible to the overwhelming majority of editors and readers of English Wikipedia. It's written in the acceptable language: English.</dd>
<dd>B. Haddersfield is a <i>town</i> with a very old history. It was founded in a parish (St Mary's Parish) that was one of the very earliest Spanish settlements in Jamaica after Columbus' landing in 1494. In fact, St Mary's Port was the second town to be founded in Jamaica by the Spaniards. There was also an English presence in the area after 1655. It is virtually certain that such an historical place will have independent reliable primary or secondary works focused on it, written by local authors, historians, geographers and others. It is therefore not unreasonable to take the long (or <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:eventualism">eventualist</a>) view with respect to the page, as long as the current page contains fully sourced and verified statements.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>5. The article on this alleged school of course does not meet any such standards. <i>Every claim it makes is unverified</i>. There is no indication that there is any work extant on this school that can form the basis for an encyclopedic article. Furthemore, because the vast majority of schools are never the focus of historic or scholarly study, it is fair to require that some evidence of the existence of good sources be presented before one votes to keep.</dd>
<dd>6. I realize the difficulty with the group of articles that fall in the gray zone, Kappa. I've thought seriously about article-related policy on WP because I've wanted to find a fair approach that above all preserves the intergrity of the encyclopedia and its core policies; I think it's possible to have logically-consistent decision-making with respect to most articles. I've pointed out to you before that your approach is not logically consistent, and involves seriously compromising some of the most important WP policies—principles that lie not only at the heart of encyclopedia writing on WP, but are held sacrosanct by every scholarly enterprise worth the name. When WP:V, WP:NOR, WP:RS et al are thrown to the winds in order to support a partisan view (eg. keep schools at all cost), the encyclopedia suffers for it. You are prepared to accept into the encyclopedia things for which you can find little or no verification, simply to support keeping a page; they could well be utterly untrue. I can never, will never, do the same.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">enceph</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#666699">alon</font></a> 10:23, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good God, if you'd spent a quarter as much time researching and writing about the article under nomination for AfD, as you did writing this long-winded (and ultimately pointless) response, the article would meet all of your requirements.

<li>It didn't take me long to write the above, because I've thought about policy in this area for quite a while. I also keep a record of AfDs that I have participated in or which I find interesting, for reference.</li>
<li>If I'd spent that short time on this article I'd have achieved nothing. The online search I've performed seems to indicate that there are no independent, reputable sources focused on this school (in English) that would enable me to write an encyclopedic article on it. There is some possibility that such works exist in communist China, in a Chinese tongue, in some library or archive, but you will understand that I'm disinclined to pursue such avenues in particular for what is of vanishingly small import.</li>
<li>They are not my requirements. They are <a href="../../../r/u/l/WP%7ERULES_e375.html" title="WP:RULES">Wikipedia's requirements</a>. I happen to try and follow them.</li>
<li>If the post is pointless, that will be regrettable. But not for my having written it.

<ul>
<li>The idea that all articles require sources in English has no consensus and would be tremendously damaging if accepted. Websites of state-registered schools are a reasonably reliable source of information for details such as who the principal is. Also state-registered school have to be documented by that state, providing a potential independent source like those we can imagine are available for Haddersfield. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 16:03, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Kappa, you can't be serious. This is English Wikipedia. It aims to have articles on a broad range of topics—but not at the cost of that all important principle, verification. On this encyclopedia, verification lies in the hands of <i>you and me</i>—ordinary editors, not experts in Chinese. The lingua franca of English Wikipedia is, to state the patently obvious, English. If we cannot even read the documents which supposedly provide documentary evidence of this alleged school, how on earth are we to verify it?

<li>Sometimes I wonder if time is a good factor to consider when it comes to the ability of articles to grow in the long term. Saying this article will not grow because it has not for the past 3 months appears to nullify the probability of someone adding data tomorrow. In addition, I may also remind, that sometimes basic geography, economics, and realities of life do create stretched and compressed time scales when it comes to articles on different regions. How fast would you expect an article related to Africa to grow compared to one in North America? If we use time as a criterion, I suppose it will not be long before this site becomes another strong representation of the lopsided world it already is.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 13:50, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes, great example. When people started doing that, they were probably called insane too. Now, it's pretty much accepted that every little township in every little county must be kept, and there's been no harm, and much benefit. I can say in an article "Joe Bloe is from TownshipX", and when somebody clicks on TownshipX they go to an actual worthwhile article. It also "puts together" via backlinks people from the place. Similiar things would happen with schools. Often, in the "Personal life" section of a bio, their school might be mentioned, but there's nothing to link to. Lots of schools have famous alumni, but that info is usually not captured. Funny, if somebody is born in TownX and is there for only the day of their birth, we always mention it, but if they spend years at a school that had a big impact on them, we rarely mention it, even near the end of the article. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 20:14, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

Of course, people within 1 km of the school have priority in the notorious primary one enrollment where kiasu parents elbow their way in, but it serves the entire city-state. Your justification isn't enough, because I don't think we can merge it with the Singapore article - it's way too large already. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 20:53, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

By the way, verifiable, notable, and I can see where I can contribute on this, although I'm not a pupil there, it would be a case study of "average education" in Singapore.

<li>This is a bit rich, given <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>'s systemic bias in favour of railcruft and related irrelevant minutiae. Cluttering up Wikipedia with pointless articles that nobody will ever read, about non-notable trains - which are merely hunks of metal on wheels - and featuring such useful information as what colour the carriages of some defunct British rail company that nobody has ever heard of were painted in 1958, makes most school articles look like they're worthy of the Nobel Prize for Literature, by comparison. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 00:25, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Personally, I'd happily delete most schools but my reading of <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> is that the only <i>choose one of</i> (polite|sensible|useful) procedure is to recognise that we differ on this and hence consensus to delete will not be reached, implying that vfd's should not normally be started.

<dd>One of the noteworthy things about Alawi is the role volunteering for, and being employed by, two charities the USA has classified as tied to al Qaeda, appears to have played in his classification as an illegal combatant. I created an article about one of those charities, <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Wafa_eeda.html" title="Al Wafa">Al Wafa</a>. I mention Alawi on that page, and link to his article. There is something strange about this. Al Wafa's headquarters are in <b>Israel</b>.

<li>You ask "why not have a single article with links to the source documents, and let the readers follow the links themselves? Because it is not just a "straight lift". The documents are in portable document format. They are hard to read. Each .pdf consist of about a dozen different documents. The documents within the pdf are not all in the same order in all the detainees dossiers. But they look similar enough you have to actually scan them. So, you have to do a visual grep of something like a dozen pages.</li>
<li>In short it is a lot of work to find the allegations within the pdf. Go ahead. Look at the pdf yourself. Could you locate the allegation portion in less than two minutes?

<p>Page was initially created as a speedyable context-less map thing. Then a spammer came along and rescued it, with spam.

Note there are approximately as many members of the US Congress as there are detainees in GITMO. No one is suggesting that all the information about US Congressmen should be confined to a single article. Look at the article for <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_McCrery_5554.html" title="Jim McCrery">Jim McCrery</a> for instance -- it is hardly longer than the articles on GITMO detainees were when you proposed deleting this one.</dd>

<dd>Zoe seems to be saying that any articles about these detainees would be <b>"America bashing"</b> -- no matter how factual they are. I hope that they didn't really mean that comment the way it sounds. There is absolutely no way the wikipedia should shy away from factual articles, that avoid inflammatory language, just because some Americans find them embarrassing. I don't see anything inflammatory or biased in these articles, so far. And if there is something biased of inflammatory, thatI am overlooking, why shouldn't that prompt a discussion about how to improve the article, instead of the complete suppression Zoe seems to be suggesting?</dd>

<dd>I have created dozens of articles over the last year or so. Lots of them started out as stubs, no larger than these four. None have ever been tagged for deletion before. These four articles on Guantanamo detainees however, were tagged for deletion within a few hours of their creation. This gives the unfortunate appearance that, whatever justification is being offered for their deletion, a hidden reason is that reporting of events that reflects poorly on current US policies offends some American contributors, even if it is reported accurately, and without the use of inflammatory language.. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 12:54, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Without some reason to assert that this detainee is more important than the 519 others, there is no reason to prefer this one. If we just have one article listing the detainees this would account for the noteworthiness while also not leading to an unnecessary proliferation of articles.

<li>The United States has been very secretive about who the detainees are, how they came to be captured, what they are accused of, and how much of the evidence against them is classified, and thus unchallengable. Some of the documents make for fascinating reading. So, I think that makes the detainees where the records are public notable. A single article that had a section about each detainee would grow unmanageably long. As the details about the detainees leak out I think we will find that a significatn number of the detainees merit lengthy discussion. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 01:42, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>How are Guantanamo detainees more notable than any other person in the World? That's easy! There is a great controversy over how the Guantanamo detainees are being treated. Surely you have noticed? The Bush administration has described them as "the worst of the worst". The Bush administration has also been very circumspect about their details. The combatant status review documents that I came across, and on which this article, and a few others, are based will give interested readers a better chance to make up their own minds as to whether the detainees can fairly be described as the worst of the worst. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 06:38, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Just because "schoolcruft will be kept" is no reason to attempt to stop the madness. This is a school which is a carbon copy of thousands of others.

<li><b>Keep</b> Have you nothing better to do than finding articles people have spent their precious time writing and nominating them for deletion?! Wikipedia is not paper and it has more than enough resources for an article on every school in the country. Tredington school has served local communities for well over 100 years, and has even had a book written about it. It's also clearly stated that the article is a stub (so even a suggestion of 'rewrite' is hardly useful, that's the whole point of a stub is it not?). As for (my) reference to culture shock, if you don't like it delete the reference (which somebody has done). That comment has no bearing on the usefulness of an article on Tredington School. Actually I consider that to be useful information anyway, as somebody who went through that process - Tredington had under 60 pupils when I was there, and we left that closed little world for a school of over 1,000 - that's nearly triple the population of my entire village! <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Kennedy_feb5.html" title="User:Stephen Kennedy">kingboyk</a>
<ul>
<li>Don't worry, I'm sure the nominator will point out how few edits you have and cook up some condescension for you as well. If you're lucky, he might throw in the word "crap" since he hasn't used it in this AfD yet. That way, you'll know that he does have "something better" to do with his time. ie. count user contributions and think up non-clever condescending remarks.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 18:26, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm not making any such assertion, no. It's no more or less notable than any other random school. Wiki, however, <b>is not paper</b>, and AFAIC an institution which has touched the lives of hundreds of children over 100+ years (and which is still active today) deserves a page if someone is willing to write one - yep, any and every school. Why not?! It's not costing anybody anything, and if you don't like it don't read it (the stance I will be taking with pages on railway engines, I can assure you). There's clearly a 'political' motive to all this and it's not really about Tredington School, it's about how wide Wikipedia's coverage should be. My personal opinion is: as wide as possible. Others will disagree, no problem. I do think there's a danger of all this descending into an early 90s style Usenet flamewar however... --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 19:47, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm getting tired of the newbie chant "Wikipedia is not paper." True, but Wikipedia <i>is</i> server space, screen real estate, editor time, and search engine fodder. Just because it exists does not render it an automatic in. Schools are not automatically notable. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 01:44, 24 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Server space costs virtually nothing, especially for text articles. Schools attract more editors and thus create more editor time. Schools also provide search engine fodder, attracting more users, donors and editors to wikipedia, which is a good thing. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 00:24, 25 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Server space is not just about cost, it is also about accessibility. Every article takes up server space, and the more articles on server space, the longer they take to access. Next time you can't get onto Wiki, you may consider your foolishness in voting to keep everything with four walls and a roof. I question your contention that the mere existence of school articles on Wikipedia is going to encourage the participation of users and editors. Sounds like wishful thinking to me, and is most certainly unverifiable. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 02:17, 26 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, the mere extistence of an article about something interesting, obviously does attract readers and editors, through something known as a <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_engine.html" title="Search engine">search engine</a>. It, generally, only returns results for a search, if relevant content already exists. I, like many editors, have edited countless articles *only* because I found something on wikipedia in Google, based on wikipedia happening to have what I was looking for. Many people start as an anon, with just an interest in a specific article (maybe just doing a spelling correction at first), then they progressively turn into regular editors, even admins, and ultimately make lots of contributions in many areas. There's no finite/fixed amount of wiki editors. Editors create interesting content, and interesting content attracts new editors. On the other hand, blind deletion of content, without justification, quite clearly does discourage new editors, and causses existing editors to give up in frustration. The contribution of those editors extends beyond just schools. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 14:04, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It depends on what type of school you are talking about. If you are referring to a degree granting institution, there appears to be an overwhelmingly strong consensus in favor of including them. There also appears to be a mild or luke-warm consensus to keep high schools. There is no consensus to delete primary or middle schools and when there is no consensus on whether to keep or delete something this results in a keep. So to say that the consensus so far has been to keep schools is somewhat accurate depending on how you want to interpret its meaning. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 17:29, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's not true, gracefool. There has almost always been no consensus to keep schools, either primary/elementary or secondary/high. Very often, there is in fact a bare majority to delete, but no consensus to do so. With no consensus to keep, delete, merge, or do anything else, these articles generally exist in a kind of "legitimacy limbo"; they exist purely because it is the nature of a wiki to be relatively indiscriminating.

<p>I have played everquest for going on 5 years now, I don't know Umbo personally but i do know of him and his accomplishments. This gnome is highly respected in the everquest community and I am almost positive that the majority of the everquest community would agree with most everything said in that umbo page is true. Certainly you would agree that this mage who set the standard for many everquest strategies and being probably the most influential character on the biggest and first mmorpg created deserves some recognition. Also I am fairly sure Umbo himself didnt make that page. -Tokar Guild leader EQ Community forum admin.</p>

In that debate, the author and main proponent of the article states that the information in Wikipedia on LDP constitutes original research.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. I saw a link to the article in the deleted article (see above) and made a note to revisit it to see if it was the same OR, with the intention of nominating it, but I see that <a href="../../../m/o/i/User%7EMoink_dc9f.html" title="User:Moink">moink</a> has already done so. As someone familiar with the field, I would agree that it is OR, and that while the (real) concept of virtual networks exists (see <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtual_network.html" title="Virtual network">virtual network</a>), it has nothing to do with the LDP (for which there is no independent verification of existence). In the previous AfD I asked the author of the article to provide references, independent verification of the existence of the work, or even to more fully identify the researcher ("Lars Lillehovde", no Google hits) or his institution or affiliation, but he declined.

<li><b>Keep</b> As argued in the previous vote, Tony Samara's work isn't much publicized on the Internet so using the internet to verify his notability is a bit of a catch-22 situation. It is stated in the Wikipedia guidelines that if more than 1000 people are in touch with the subject it could qualify as notable. In the case of Tony Samara, his works extends to more than 5000 people around the world who don't necessarily use the internet or are even interested in this due to the detached nature of his work from modern society.</li>

<li>It is probably possible to qualify this list so as to make it technically maintainable. As with a possible list of People in Akron, Ohio who ate chicken salad for lunch between 1 PM and 2 PM on October 3, 2004, the other question is whether the qualifications needed to make the list maintainable also make it hopelessly obscure and of minimal use. I don't mean to be snide: I really think that to make the list maintainable, the qualifications would be so numerous, complex, and problematic, as to limit severely the value of even trying.

<p>This was tagged for speedy, but doesn't quite qualify.
