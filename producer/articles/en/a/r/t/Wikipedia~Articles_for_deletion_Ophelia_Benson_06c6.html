<li><b>Comment.</b> Gosh, thanks for all those well-thought-out, carefully checked commets. In the future, to improve the level of your contributions to Wikipedia, might I suggest you improve your practices in two areas. First, you should actually read the article you are commenting on, and take note of its contents. Second, you should consider the claims made in the article against the relevant notability criteria, even, as necessary, checking the references and external links provided for the article..<br />
<br />
<a href="../../../o/p/h/Ophelia_Benson_e901.html" title="Ophelia Benson">Ophelia Benson</a> is a well-known published author, not merely a blogger (although she is probably notable as a blogger, too). Her two books are listed by title in the article,even though none of you astute readers noticed that. (Apparently the identification of Benson as an "author" and the listing of the book titles in distinctive type was insufficient to tip off careful and well-informed Wikipedia editors like yourselves; perhaps one or two of you may have suggestions on how to improve such descriptions.) Her books meet the notability criteria, having been reviewed and discussed in major media. In fact, Benson is a native of the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_7642.html" title="UK">UK</a>, and both her books have been reviewed/discussed in the <a href="../../../t/l/s/TLS_099d.html" title="TLS">TLS</a>, which even <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> acknowledges as "one of the world's preeminent critical publications." (The second review appears in the October 20, 2006 issue, and is not yet directly cited online.)<br />
<br />
Benson's two books may be only available through such obscure retailers as Amazon.com <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-Truth-Matters-Ophelia-Benson/dp/0826476082/sr=1-1/qid=1162146949/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3446636-3738429?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Why-Truth-Matters-Ophelia-Benson/dp/0826476082/sr=1-1/qid=1162146949/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3446636-3738429?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dictionary-Fashionable-Nonsense-Guide-People/dp/0285637142/sr=1-2/qid=1162146949/ref=sr_1_2/002-3446636-3738429?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Dictionary-Fashionable-Nonsense-Guide-People/dp/0285637142/sr=1-2/qid=1162146949/ref=sr_1_2/002-3446636-3738429?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and Barnes &amp; Noble <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;EAN=9780826476081&amp;itm=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;EAN=9780826476081&amp;itm=1" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;EAN=9780285637146&amp;itm=2" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;EAN=9780285637146&amp;itm=2" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, and the relevant pages give samples of reviews and indicate the caliber of Benson's audience.<br />
<br />
Now I recognize that article deletion is a holy and privileged activity, and that deletion of articles about women whose claims to notability don't involve performances emphasizing, flaunting, or exposing their mammaries is a virtual sacrament which shouldn't be disrupted or contested, however ridiculous or inaccurate the basis, unless the circumstances are really really unusual. But while one of England's "leading cultural critics" is apparently not, by Wikipedia editor consensus, as notable as <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Chessie_Moore_3df5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chessie Moore">a moderately obese middle-aged woman who films herself having sex with dogs</a>, and the <a href="../../../t/l/s/TLS_099d.html" title="TLS">TLS</a> is apparently by the same consensus not a "major" publication with the stature and reputation of <i>Color Climax Anal Sex</i> or <i>Big Fuckin' Tits</i>, or even <i>Juggs</i>, I think she deserves to be included in Wikipedia.<br />
<br />
I now realize that the excessive literacy and cultural awareness I displayed in recognizing the name of a well-known figure in the British academic-philosophical-literary world is inconsitent with the qualities required of a good Wikipedian, and fully justifies the assumptions of bad faith you have all made. I now know that in-depth knowledge of any subjects outside of pornography, Pokemon, and professional sports can only damage the Wikipedian enterprise, and I will do my best in the future to follow your lead and to contribute only with regard to subjects about which I know nothing, or next to nothing.<br />
<br />
Now (dropping the ironic stance) I deserve a public apology from each of the posters whose sloth, carelessness, malice, or incompetence led them to make unfounded, uncivil, derogatory comments about me (and about the entirely blamess Ms Benson). And I deserve a display of abject, public, unqualified self-execration from the ArbCom member who charged to the head of the attack. I expect, of course, nothing but renewed incivility, personal attacks, and evasion of responsibility.--<a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivianDarkbloom_43b2.html" title="User:VivianDarkbloom">VivianDarkbloom</a> 20:32, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and improve</b> Obviously, being reviewed in TLS establishes notability. Now, Ms. Darkbloom, why don't you add this information to the article to clarify why the author is notable, perhaps with helpful links to the reviews?

<dd>I saw the same message on another's commenter's page and noted there that Vivian Darkbloom should tone down her rhetoric significantly and that the apparent imputation of sexism to the delete commenters was particularly unwarranted. I had forgotten that I wrote that on a userpage and not this page, else I would have included that comment as well here, which I now do. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 22:54, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You know, I'm just going to weigh in once more here, after having been called to this VfD by a gigantic bolus of angry ranting on my talk page. Scenario: Person A tries to get their way by throwing a nasty screaming tantrum. Person B responds like, "What the...? Jeez, cut that out!" Now, this is life, and having been involved in life for awhile, I've noticed something: Whenever the above scenario plays out, there's always a Person C who comes around a liitle while later, all like, "Dudes! <i>Everyone</i> needs to chill out here." To which I say, right now, that the advice is appreciated but misapplied. One person here needs guidance, and it's not hard to determine which person it is, in order to apply it. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 23:52, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Endorse listing. Even improved as it has been, the page is still shockingly vague about her. And censure VivianDarkbloom for personal attacks. There's nothing wrong with using an anon or single purpose account for listing an AFD, or even for commenting in one. (Remember, AFD <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenAveling_AFD_is_not_a_vote_9fa3.html" title="User:BenAveling/AFD is not a vote">is not a vote</a>.) Oh, and <b>Keep</b>.
