<p>Centereach boys track is best known for there 158 dual meet winning streak beginning in 1972, under the leadership of Coach Burkley and Schneider. The team went 27 seasons undefeated. This streak ended in 1998, in a dual meet against Bay Shore High School. Due to many coach changes and declining numbers, the team since Coach Burkley's resignation had not been fairing well. But in the 2006 track season under the leadership of Coach Jason Strom, William Gilmartin, and Vincent Rucci the track team had made noticable improvment. Athlete numbers increased, and so did the skill of the athletes. Unfortunately it had also been decide that season the Centereach Track team would be combined with Newfield track team to form a new Middle Country track Team. Many in the board of education believed it would save money, and put money in other parts of the schools budget. But under futher analysis by the Centereach Track coaches it was discovered the combination of the teams would save very little money. Also combining the track teams would also severly cut the amount of students willing to compete on the Middle country track team. In an effort to save the Centereach Track team from the combination, the coaches and athletes created shirts spreading the word of their soon to be fate. And also attended a Board of Education meeting to speak out about the situation. The decision to combine the teams or not is still pending, but it is very likely that the teams will be combined.</p>

<p>It was stated by Voltaire, one of France’s greatest writers and philosophers, that “If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent Him”(The Quotations). Religions played essential roles in any assemblage of people from the very beginning of life on this earth. For many people, religion is something that represents an individual’s faith and beliefs. However, in the ancient Islamic regulations, it is said that Islam is a way of living, with many teachings in all aspects of life. Islam originally is the religion that was sent to Prophet Mohammed (peace be upon him and his family) about 600 hundred years after Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him and his chaste mother). Islam regulations are based on Prophet Abraham’s (peace be upon him and his family) conventions. Muslims use the former peace expressions to show respect and gratitude to God’s prophets and messengers. Muslims believe that there is no God but Allah, and Mohammed is the last prophet which constructs the first pillar of Islam.</p>
<p>The Islam word in Arabic (إسلام) is derived from the word ‘salaam’, which means peace. It is required by all Muslims to greet each other by saying ‘Assalaam Alaikum’, which simply means: peace be with you. Islam’s perception of peace is unique. It is so, because Muslims pursue the peace and tranquility of worshiping Allah through the five daily prayers (towards Mecca) they practice; the peace that comes when somebody truly realizes the higher essence of these prayers. Therefore, having peace with oneself is easily attainable. And as a result of having peace with God and oneself, peace is spread between individuals in society and between nations.</p>
<p>Islam is a holy religion that was sent to people in the Middle East more than fourteen centuries ago to guide them from adoring idols to worshipping Allah, the Gracious the Merciful. Coming to systemize people’s lives, Islam’s guidelines clearly state Muslims’ duties and responsibilities toward God, themselves, and others. Thus, nothing was left undeclared for people to decide on by themselves. In fact, even bad-mouthing is forbidden, and is considered as a very big sin just like killing or torturing. <b>Hence, Islam is not what is mistakenly known to some people in the Western world these days as the violence and terrorism foundation, especially after the September eleventh attacks on the World Trade Center. Conversely, Islam is the religion of peace and forgiveness that strictly prohibits any kind of violation to others’ privacies rather than killing innocent people or ruining others’ lives. Even animals’ slaughtering in Islam has a unique purpose not merely for the sake of torturing or killing. However, people must not pass judgments on entire races, nations, or religions based on irresponsible individual acts. That is primarily because individuals’ acts never reflect societies’ beliefs. Hence, neither Americans can judge Muslims based on the individual acts on September 11th attacks, nor Muslims can judge Americans by some careless group of soldiers regarding the Iraqi prisoners’ abuse problems for example.</b> Recently, some of the issues misjudged and raised erroneously -for the lack of knowledge- against Islam are: the animal slaughtering, and the September 11th attacks.</p>
<p>Although Islam is the religion of mercy and compassion, and as most things in life, there must be some opponents, like Franklin Graham, who think that Islam is a religion that encourages violence. One sign of violence (the first issue) opponents find is that Muslims slaughter animals for food, which, they think, is a sign of killing passion in Islam. Those people think that slaughtering is a ruthless manner of torturing animals. They think that Muslims merely do it for the sake of torturing and killing. Therefore, these opponents think that the love of assassination is a genuine part of the Islamic culture.</p>
<p>However, a look into the guidelines of Islam is helpful at this stage to clarify the mystery people may have for the animal slaughtering rules in Islam. Muslims believe that Islam considers things as ‘<i>Haram</i>’, a way of forbidding something or making it illegal, because they harm us in a way or another. For example, drinking alcohol (an intoxicant) is <i>Haram</i> for many reasons. First, alcohol is proven scientifically to harm the stomach and make it gradually malfunction. Secondly, alcohol leads to the loss of brain cells and reduces the ability to think and speak, which is strongly unacceptable in Islam. It is unacceptable because when somebody loses his mind, it would let him commit sins and may lead him, while being drunk, to the thought of ‘Shirk’, the most severe and unforgivable sin which means associating partners with God, and that would obviously contradict the first pillar of Islam. On the other hand, Islam considers things as ‘<i>Halal</i>’, a way of permitting something or making it legal, if they were on contrary to <i>Haram</i> things; that is they do not do any damage to people. Therefore, legislating animals’ slaughtering is <i>Halal</i> because it has no side effects whether on people or animals, yet it is proven scientifically to be healthier than other ways. Besides, Islam is not the only religion that permits the use of animals for food as other religions do. (another article about animal slaughtering will be up soon)</p>
<p>The September 11th attacks (the second issue) made a very big impact against Islam in a dramatic way, in which it is the strongest criticism against Islam so far. In the United States, some people protested against Islam, relating it with terrorism and violence as a reaction of condemning the attacks. Such an impact was very clear in a survey sponsored by the Ethics &amp; Public Policy Center that was published in Fall, 2002. That survey “was based on a national sample of leaders of Evangelical organizations” (Survey). The survey results were released to the public on April 7, 2003.</p>
<p>In the survey 72% of people thought that Islam opposes democracy. Plus, 70% thought that Islam is a religion of violence. 66% believed that Islam is dedicated to world domination. Sadly, 45% of people consider the war against terrorism is basically a war between the west and Islam. Unfortunately, only 10% thought that Islam is a religion of peace. Finally, 77% of people were unfavorable as their overall view of Islam. Furthermore, in a speech shortly after the September 11th attacks, Franklin Graham claimed that “Islam has attacked us… The God of Islam is not the same God… Islam is a very evil and wicked religion” (qtd. in Muscati 249).</p>
<p>However, Wahab Gharfarzoy states in his article “Islamic faith preaches peace, not violence” that “As a Muslim child growing up in a strictly Muslim country… I was taught that Allah…[is] God of the Universe, not only of the Muslims” which all Muslims agree on. Graham’s statement is strange because it is emotional and based on a personal judgment rather than an analytical thinking and true studying of Islam. It is weird how people judge entire nations or religions based on sole racism. Isn't it weird that when a Christian or a Jew kills someone, religion is not mentioned, but when a Muslim does so, it is Islam that goes to trial! Isn't it weird that when someone sacrifices himself for others, he is noble and well respected, but when a Palestinian does so to save his children from being killed, his wife form being raped, or his house from being destroyed, he is considered as a terrorist solely because he is Muslim! These are just few questions that Mr. Graham or any doubtful person may want to look at when accusing Islam even before spending sometime studying the traditions and regulations of Islam.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Muslims all over the world tend to understand this kind of disagreement because they know and feel the pain that Americans went through on September 2001. However, Americans must understand a few things before condemning Islam. Islam has nothing to do with individuals who claim they are Muslims because these individuals do un-Islamic deeds by killing innocent people. Bin Laden for example, the one who planed the attacks, is proven to be non-Muslim because throughout the years, he practiced many non-Islamic habits. First, in Afghanistan, where he and his gangs live, there were farms that were used for planting cannabis and drugs which is strictly forbidden in Islam for the same reasons alcohol is forbidden. Secondly, Bin Laden and his gangs in the al-Qaeda organization have been involved in many terror attacks in many Islamic countries such as Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Thirdly, killing innocent people on purpose is <i>Haram</i> to the extent that it is equal in Islam to ‘<i>Shirk</i>’. Hence, killing innocent people is a proof that Bin Laden is ‘<i>Mushrik</i>’, the person who does Shirk, and therefore he is not Muslim. Plus, how can somebody pretend that he is Muslim, and kill Muslims in Saudi Arabia and Yemen? <b>And above all, why is Islam being blamed for non-Muslims’ deeds?</b> <b><br /></b></p>
<p>The day of the attacks on the World Trade Center, Muslims were shocked by the irresponsible acts by insane individuals. Those individuals who oppose the United States clearly created a misconception of the religion throughout the world. However, killing innocent people is totally rejected and Muslims feel sorry for those who lost their lives in that tragedy. Truly, Islam believes that people have the right to choose what believe and which faiths they practice and nobody can force them to choose his own believe and faith. In fact, even during Prophet Mohammad’s life and the ancient Islamic times, when Muslims were dominating and ruling almost all of the middle earth, Muslims were living with Christians, Jews, the ones who continued to worship idols, and all others in harmony, without any problems. It is important to consider that other religions’ origins are from the same God with basically the same principles, but different Prophets, languages, and set of rules suitable for that era. Therefore, Bin Laden can not force people to share his (non-Islamic) believes and faiths.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Nevertheless, resisting bad deeds is a natural trait that everybody should practice. Likewise, the attacks that happened on September 11, 2001, the current issues that have been raised in Iraq are unacceptable for all societies. Despite the fact of the Iraqi prisoners’ stories people have heard and the photos that were released to the public, the United States still has the gratitude on Iraqis by freeing them from the former criminal regime. The condemnations that were in the mass media by the American government are just a proof that these incidents were not meant or supposed to happen. Yet, the individuals who did these acts do not represent the U.S. values and reputation as a peaceful and manner-loving country. Consequently, Arabs must not oppose the U.S. as a nation but those individuals who did these faulty acts, which is an Islamic manner<b>; that is a group should not be judged by the mistakes of individuals and the many should not be affected by the few.</b></p>
<p>Accordingly, Islam is the religion of forgiveness and mercy as Allah presents this in Quran: “<b>God does not forbid you from showing kindness and dealing justly with those who have not fought you about religion and have not driven you out of your homes. God loves just dealers</b>” (Quran, 60:8). Prophet Mohammed also has many sayings that enforce peace and oppose violence, such as, “<b>…Do not betray, and do not be excessive…</b>” Moreover, the Prophet said: “<b>Whoever kills a person having a treaty with the Muslims shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise, though its fragrance is found for a span of forty years</b>” (Islam Guide). Part of the Islamic culture is realizing that diversity is an advantage -because it promotes humans lives- and then, living with others in a simple and a wise way. Hence, misjudging and opposing others is not a healthy way of life especially when it gets to the extent of assassination, which is extremely disagreeable. Based upon the former arguments Islam is proven to be a peace-loving religion and in many ways similar to other religions’ guidelines. <b>Islam has nothing to do with savagery but with peace and mercy.</b></p>

<p>Herbert Daniel Rice was born in rural kentucky from the semen of a african bull frog mixed with DNA from Thomas Jefferson. He spent his life whacking off alaskan wolves, and it was during this time that he perfected the ancient art of the rusty trumpet. After leaving his wolf family, he kept a wolf t-shirt in honor of the pack that raised him. After dabbling in gruul in translation, he settled down to a career in bio diesel engineering. He gave birth to a son, Evan Rice, and he is really a great guy</p>

<p>Alan Cork was a striker who signed for Wimbledon FC in 1978, a fresh-faced 18 year old, coming from Derby County FC, were he had not impressed. "Corky", as he became affectionately known, was a huge fan's favourite at Plough Lane, and became the club's leading goalscorer in the league, scoring 149 goals in 413 appearances. His prowess in the air was legendary, there are few players in the history of the game better with their heads. He had a song named after him, as all West Bankers will know, which related to his balding pate. Corky played an hour of the FA Cup Final win in 1988, and no one in the team deserved a medal that day more than him. He had been through all four divisions and helped the Dons into the top-flight of English football.</p>
<p>He left he club in 1992 to rejoin former Manager Dave "Harry" Bassett at Sheffield United, and famously didn't shave until his team's FA Cup run had ended in 1993, at the semi-final at Wembley, at the hands of bitter rivals Wednesday.</p>
<p>It has been said that Alan Cork was a great player, but what was great about him, was that he never cost a penny. Indeed, during Alan's 15+ years as a professional, no transfer fee was ever paid for him.</p>
<p>To think there was no page devoted to him, is a travesty, now hopefully put right. If any other former West Bankers wish to add to it, they are most welcome.</p>

<p>History of Harcum College</p>
<p>Edith Hatcher, daughter of prominent Virginia clergyman and educator Dr. William E. Hatcher, was a talented concert pianist. In 1913, Edith Hatcher married Octavius Marvin Harcum. After the birth of their first child, Edith wrote "the concert career did not offer a chance for family stability" so they chose a venture that would combine "my talents as an educator and artist and his business vision and ability." They opened the Harcum Post Graduate School on October 1, 1915, in Melville Hall, with three students and five pianos. Edith's goal was to "start a school where the individual talent of each girl would be treated as an integral part of her education." Though her expertise was in the fine arts, Edith was also committed to providing a strong academic program.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
In its early years, Harcum was a preparatory school, giving students the skills needed for college study. It quickly grew, soon adding junior college-level courses. Soon, the "lower school" program was eliminated, and the junior college program was in place. Mr. Harcum, or "Uncle Marvin" as the students called him, was the first President. When he tragically died in a car accident in 1920, Edith assumed the Presidency. She remained in that post for more than 30 years with the exception of one academic year, 1946-1947, when Dr. John Barber served as President.</p>
<p>In addition to Edith, one of the most important women in Harcum's history is Maud L. Marren. Marren was appointed Dean of the College in 1920 and was a central figure on campus until she retired 43 years later.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
The College grew steadily through the 1930s and 1940s with a student enrollment of 185 in 1948. However, Harcum was a proprietary institution and faced financial difficulties. In 1952, it could no longer run as a profitable enterprise; Edith declared bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The Junto Adult School was a non-profit educational corporation founded by Benjamin Franklin. It purchased the assets of Harcum for possible use as a residential college for adults but soon decided to continue Harcum's mission as a two-year college for women. Leadership was assumed by Mr. Philip Klein. In 1956, Pennsylvania granted Harcum permission to be the first junior college in the Commonwealth's history to confer the Associate of Arts and the Associate of Science degrees.</p>
<p>Tremendous building and expansion occurred in the 1960s under the direction of President Michael Duzy, with the addition of the Academic Center, Pennswood Hall, and Klein Hall. Five presidents have succeeded Dr. Duzy, yet the College's mission and purpose are essentially the same. In Mrs. Harcum's words, Harcum educates students in the arts and occupational skills, respecting each student as an "individual with personal needs, interests, aptitudes, and aspirations.</p>

<p>Who is Felix Klaemont?<br />
A self-taught guitar player / one man show from NW Washington (Bellingham). He started writing music the day after he got his first guitar, although it took some time for him to be able to sing the lyrics and play the guitar simultaneously. Currnetly, he is working on a Ph.d. with too little time to do enough with his music.<br />
<br />
What has he done?<br />
- 15 albums (working on No. 16)<br />
- A few hundred songs recorded at home<br />
- Lots of sore throats, broken strings, selfpity and small house concerts<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Where has he lived?<br />
1980-1998 - Bellingham, Washington<br />
1998-1999 - Provo, Utah<br />
1999-2001 - Romania and the Republic of Moldova<br />
2001-2003 - Provo, Utah<br />
Summer 2002 - Orange County, California<br />
Summer 2003 - Tempe, Arizona<br />
Winter/Spring/Summer 2004 - Tempe/Scottsdale, Arizona<br />
2004-present - Lincoln, Nebraska<br />
<br />
When did he do it?<br />
4 albums worth of songs were written between 1996-1999 and recorded in the summer of 1999. From 1999-2001 he didn't touch a guitar (long story). Then, starting in the Fall of 2001, he started writing and recorded a new album every few months. Starting in 2004, the # of songs being written and recorded decreased dramatically. Currently, many ideas are being schemed and thought about, but little is being done. Life just gets too busy.<br />
<br />
Why has he done it?<br />
- Boredom<br />
- A way to dramatize insignificant occurences in his life<br />
- A only slightly successful attempt to get chicks<br /></p>

<p>Formed in '97 by Jeremy Wrenn, it was initially a solo project supported by various drum machines. However, he had dreams of entertaining the masses located outside of the confines of his bedroom, so he drafted local music scene veterans Cory Osborne and John Rungger on bass and drums. But the heady mélange was not completed until guitarist Chris De Brizzio entered the fray.</p>
<p>Many bands today are an exercise in minimalism, stripping everything down to the bone and sinew. Airiel takes a different approach. Injecting their well-crafted songs with enough effects to level a small village, they stretch and expand the sonic boundaries of the genre until the listener is completely deluged by an aural wave of reverb, distortion and sweat. They are advancing the art of sheer sonic energy while utilizing the power of a good melody to provide a basis for the effects, never forgetting the innate human desire to shake one's ass. In short, it's loud, it's beautiful, and you can dance to it.</p>
<p>Through Clairecords (Sacramento), Airiel released a series of 4-song EP's titled Winks &amp; Kisses. The EP's were also sold as a limited edition box set, capturing the evolution of Airiel in its current form. Their cds are consistently some of the top sellers of the label, and they have already sold out of the Frosted EP. In June of 2005 Airiel released their newest EP. This self-titled EP further illustrates Airiel's ever-evolving sound and provides a glimpse at their promise with blistering waves of gorgeous guitars, kinetic drum beats and soaring vocal harmonies. The group has also been asked to contribute to several compilation cds, including the "Never Lose That Feeling" compilation by Club AC30(UK).</p>
<p>In addition to their recordings, Airiel has also gained a reputation for being a stellar live band. Utilizing video projection (courtesy of Arturo Valle of Panic Films) and amps that go up to eleven, they are able to win hearts and minds even in the most hostile of hipster-pomo environments. In addition to playing such local Chicago landmarks as the Double Door, Subterranean, and the Bottom Lounge, recently they have begun plying their trade farther afield, in such locales as Minneapolis, Milwaukee , Pittsburgh and Indianapolis . This summer, they embarked on their first tour of the East Coast, hitting New York City, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and points in between. Airiel has also opened for some high-profile acts, including The Dears and The Brian Jonestown Massacre.</p>
<p>2006 should prove to be a banner year for the band. Plans include the recording of a full-length album, and continued touring to destinations both near and far.</p>

<p>A large rapid-fire gun used by the character J.J in the game <i>Resident Evil 4</i>. If Leon is shot by this gun, he will take severe damage by it. If Leon gets too close to J.J he will swing the minigun at Leon, resulting in minor damage. The gun is large in size, and looks like an upgraded version of a standard minigun but even more deadly.</p>

<p>Shaun Gladwell, born in Sydney, Australia, 1972, is an accomplished artist who is not limited to one media. He is a sculptor, painter, and video artist. He is best known for his video works which often feature him skateboarding, as well as a range of street subculture such as break dancing. Shaun Gladwell grew up in Sydney’s western suburbs and started to experiment with video after his dreams to become a professional skateboarder were ruined by injury. Gladwell went to Sydney College of the Arts and then completed postgraduate research at the College of Fine Arts and is now one of Australia’s rising young artists. Gladwell said that his concept is based on “the isolated figure moving and struggling through the panoramas of nature, urban and real, in a possible engagement with the sublime.”</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-22_b389.html" title="Edit section: Vierordt's law">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Vierordt's law</span></h2>
<p>Vierordt (1868) was the first to record a law of time perception which relates perceived duration to actual duration over different interval magnitudes, and according to task complexity.</p>
<p>Vierordt's law is "a robust phenomenon in time estimation research that has been observed with different time estimation methods" Fortin. C and Rousseau. R. (1998). It states that, retrospectively, "short" intervals of time tend to be overestimated, and "long" intervals of time tend to be underestimated. The other major paradigm of time estimation methodology measures time prospectively.</p>
<p>The cut-off point between what is considered "short" and "long" - and therefore between overestimation and underestimation - is between 2 and 10 minutes depending on the task e.g. Yarmey.A.D. (2000). The percentage of underestimation grows as task duration increases.</p>
<p>The law is relatively unknown outside psychophysics and is not cited in the Transport Planning literature, which relies heavily on the Valuation of Time Savings <a href="http://www.its.leeds.ac.uk/projects/WBToolkit/Note10.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.its.leeds.ac.uk/projects/WBToolkit/Note10.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.its.leeds.ac.uk/projects/WBToolkit/Note10.htm</a>.</p>
<p>(Note to avoid controversy: Vierordt law is irrelevant to the economic appraisal of transport infrastructure on account of the Constant Unit Value of time (CUV) assumption, which states that the same unit value should be assigned to time changes irrespective of the size or sign of the change [see para 3.27 <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_econappr/documents/page/dft_econappr_610340-03.hcsp#TopOfPage" class="external free" title="http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_econappr/documents/page/dft_econappr_610340-03.hcsp#TopOfPage" rel="nofollow">http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_econappr/documents/page/dft_econappr_610340-03.hcsp#TopOfPage</a> ]. However, at least one group of researchers have pointed out the possible importance of asymmetric variation of VTTS distributions:</p>
<p>"For purposes of investment appraisal, it is acceptable to use "average" figures for VTTS, which could mean mode or median figures for the variations in VTTS in the population are asymmetric [...] in terms of individuals' actual willingness to pay and modify their behavior, it may be necessary to recognize that small time savings might not be valued the same as larger blocks of time" Zhang et al (2004).</p>
<p>There is, in other words, evidence (not yet understood or fully accepted) that "the unit value of time is lower for small travel-time savings and falls with the length of the trip" Zhang et al (2004). This is a well-known and sometime widely debated controversy in Transport Planning know as "the small travel time savings controversy". Interestingly 3 minutes used to be considered a "small" time saving. Now it is about 10. )</p>

<p>KAREN WYATT is the greatest teacher at Mtn. Brook Junior High School. She is so cool. She is not lame at all. She drinks a lot and sometimes even comes to school drunk! She zones out while she's teaching and doesn't notice anything going on around her. She has an opium den in the form of a black trunk at the back of her classroom. The students in her class are always so respectful. We eat food, drink, and even take pictures with flash while she's not looking! That's how oblivious she is. She wears strange, exotic clothes and her toes always hang off her shoes. She's got a big frig full of pot and beer in the front of her room. VIVE GEOMETRIE! I love Ms. Wyatt.</p>

<p>Gene D. Matlock seems to have discovered many <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">language</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">culture</a> similarities between many precolumbian civilizations and people from <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> to far <a href="../../../e/a/s/East.html" title="East">east</a> <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>. Also giving arguments that support the idea of extensive comercial relations between <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precolumbian.html" title="Precolumbian">precolumbian</a> <a href="../../../a/m/e/America.html" title="America">America</a> with the rest of the world, long before <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ.html" title="Christ">Christ</a>. He might be quite convince that ancient cities from <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican.html" title="Mexican">Mexican</a> gulf to Tenochtitlan are related to some Atlántepec, <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tolan.html" title="Tolan">Tolan</a>, A-tolan and other TLan like cities:</p>
<p>Atlán, Autlán, <a href="../../../m/a/z/Mazatl%C3%A1n.html" title="Mazatlán">Mazatlán</a>, Cihuatlán, Cacatlán, Tecaltitlán, Tihuatlán, Atitlán, Zapotlán, Minititlán, Ocotlán, Miahuatlán, Tecaltitlán, Tepatitlán, Tihuatlán, Texiutlán, and the like. Notice that the Nahuatl Tlán root of these place names is exactly like the Tlan in "<a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis.html" title="Atlantis">Atlantis</a>."</p>
<p><br />
He says:_"Should we continue our fun guessing games about Atlantis for another few millenniums? Or should we confidently begin our search for the submerged half of Atlantis from Atlántepec's (<a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>'s) southeast coast? Will the ruins that we'll surely find be those of the real <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis.html" title="Atlantis">Atlantis</a>?"</p>
<p>He believes we should be conducting the search for Atlantis in the Yucatan region of Mexico. Matlock cites place names as one of the compelling proofs:</p>
<p>Atlán, Autlán, <a href="../../../m/a/z/Mazatl%C3%A1n.html" title="Mazatlán">Mazatlán</a>, Cihuatlán, Cacatlán, Tecaltitlán, Tihuatlán, Atitlán, Zapotlán, Minititlán, Ocotlán, Miahuatlán, Tecaltitlán, Tepatitlán, Tihuatlán, Texiutlán, and the like. Notice that the Nahuatl Tlán root of these place names is exactly like the Tlan in "<a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis.html" title="Atlantis">Atlantis</a>."</p>
<p>He also cites an ancient, spiral-shaped harbor with high banks or dikes lining the channels that once existed near San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán, Mexico. This layout is very much like that described by Plato for Atlantis's great port city.</p>
<p>When Gene D. Matlock was seven years old, he became deathly sick from pneumonia. His mother prayed that if he survived, she would dedicate him to the study of theology. She never suspected Gene's studies would lead him to "no-no" conclusions not welcome in Sunday School, the mosque, and the synagogue.</p>
<p>Matlock says that the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguistic.html" title="Linguistic">linguistic</a> revelations comparing different cultures are astonishing. That we are and always have been a global community from the very beginning of civilization. He says: "When I was a young college student in <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, I took a course in linguistics. This course and my experiences in studying <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish.html" title="Spanish">Spanish</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese.html" title="Portuguese">Portuguese</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malay.html" title="Malay">Malay</a>, and <a href="../../../n/a/h/Nahuatl.html" title="Nahuatl">Nahuatl</a>, taught me that a word is much more than a combination of strange sounds. Each one tells the history of the people who use it." According to Matlock, the secret surrounding the location of <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis.html" title="Atlantis">Atlantis</a> -- and thus, proof that it really existed -- can be traced back to the forbidden letter.</p>

<p>SS-Unterscharfuhrer Thomas Hellor Cooper (1919+) was the only Englishman to win a German military decoration during World War Two.</p>
<p>Born to an English father (a Boer War veteran) and a German mother in Chiswick, London, on 29 August 1919, his application to join the police, air force and navy were all declined on account of his mother's origins. Cooper joined the Hammersmith branch of the British Union of Fascists during the late 1930s and later went to Germany for work as a teacher. On 1 February 1940 he was admitted into the prestigious "Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler", the Fuhrer's personal boydguard turned Waffen-SS division, in Berlin. In July he was transferred to the Totenkopf Waffen-SS division (mostly comprised of concentration camp guards) where he acheived the rank of NCO at a training camp in Pomerania. In Februay 1943 on the Russian Front he was severely injured and consequently qualified for the German "wound badge" (silver class). He was later placed in command of the British "Freikorps".</p>
<p>After the war Cooper was tried before the Old Bailey for high treason, found guilty and condemned to death but this was commuted to life imprisonment. He was released from jail in 1953, and is thought to have resettled in Japan.</p>

<p>The <b>Evan Mecham Eco-Terrorist International Conspiracy</b> (EMETIC) was a group that performed acts of sabatage against <a href="../../../s/k/i/Ski_resort.html" title="Ski resort">ski resorts</a> and <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_power_plant.html" title="Nuclear power plant">nuclear power plants</a> in the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southwestern_United_States_dabc.html" title="Southwestern United States">Southwestern United States</a> between 1987 and 1988.

<p>EMETIC's first act was to damage a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chairlift.html" title="Chairlift">chairlift</a> at the Fairfield Snow Bowl near <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flagstaff%2C_Arizona_16bf.html" title="Flagstaff, Arizona">Flagstaff, Arizona</a>. During the incident an acetylene torch was used to cut bolts from several of the lift's support towers. A warning letter claiming responsibility for the damage also contained a threat to "chain the Fairfield CEO to a tree at the 10,000-foot level and feed him shrubs and roots until he understands the suicidal folly of treating the planet primarily as a tool for making money." Upon receipt of the letter the resort shut down the lift in order to repair the over US$ 50,000 in damages caused by the EMETIC.</p>
<p>The EMETIC made two other attacks against targets the group considered to be causing ecological damage before the <a href="../../../f/b/i/FBI_73d2.html" title="FBI">FBI</a> began arresting group members. In May 1989, Marc Leslie Davis, Margaret Katherine Millet, Marc Andre Baker were arrested on charges related to the sabatage against the Fairfield Sun Bowl and on conspiracy charges to damage facilities related to nuclear power plants in Arizona, California, and Colorado. A fourth EMETIC member, Ilse Washington Asplund, was later arrested on related charges. All four individuals pleaded guilty and were sentenced in September 1991.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-22_b389.html" title="Edit section: John Creamer and Stephane K">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">John Creamer and Stephane K</span></h2>
<p>John Creamer and Stephane K are acclaimed New York-based DJ/Producers who work as musical partners and are considered by many to be among the most influential progressive-house music pioneers of the early 2000's. They created a very signature sound - very deep, often dark and always sexy as hell - straight from the grooviest alleys of New York City and into the world's best clubs. Superstar DJs John Digweed, Danny Howells, Danny Tenaglia and Pete Tong were among the first to champion the John Creamer and Stephane K sound and made it an international sensation. What was "the new sound of New York" went well beyond the banks of this metropolis and became a global craze.</p>
<p>There is a certain texture and mood to every track Creamer &amp; K touches. The duo has an affinity for good, quality vocals (but not the over-the-top diva kind), steamy percussion and twisted, tribal efx. This formula has been used time and again in the construction of some of the most popular remixes of the last decade. Their stellar remix portfolio includes reworkings of Kosheen's "Hide U," Satoshi Tomiie's "Love In Traffic" New Order's "Crystal" Nat Monday's "Waiting," Hybrid's "True To Form," Moony's "Doves," Puretone's "Addicted To Bass," The Crystal Method's "You Know It's Hard," Sinead O' Connor's "Troy" and Iio's classic anthem, "Rapture." Although this list features artists representing many different musical styles, they have one thing in common - these tracks have all been made into dance floor hits. Most notable are the remixes of Kosheen's "Hide U" (which won them remix of the year at the 2001 Muzik Awards, entered the UK Top 10 at .. 6 and topped Billboard's Hot Dance Music / Club Play chart), Sinead O' Connor's "Troy" (topped Billboard's Hot Dance Music / Club Play chart) and Iio's "Rapture" (hit ..2 on both the U.K. singles chart and on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart.) Beyond remixing, their acclaimed original productions including "I Love You" and "Wish You Were Here" continue to earn them respect worldwide.</p>
<p>John Creamer grew up in Philadelphia and from an early age was influenced by classic rock; eventually leading to his role as a Trombone player in a garage-ska band. However, like so many others, John's life was changed instantly by his first encounter with the original Sound Factory. Drawn in by the no holds barred approach to music that the Sound Factory DJs instituted, John knew that house music was where he needed to be. Following his instincts, he soon moved to New York and landed a record store gig at the influential Eightball Records. In time, Creamer rose up the ranks to become A&amp;R man for Eightball's growing label (and later A&amp;R for Satellite Records). Constantly surrounded by records, Creamer did quite a bit of DJing around New York City, while also dabbling into the production realm with the release of some well-respected acid jazz under the name Butter Foundation.</p>
<p>Like Creamer, Stephane K also got his start in rock music. The New York resident - by way of Paris and Tokyo - first started out as a bass player in the progressive rock band E Trance and performed with the group at legendary digs like CBGB's and the Knitting Factory. In the early 90's Stephane was also converted by the original Sound Factory and quickly made the shift over to house music production. His first house productions came via a collaborative effort with DJ Katsu under the name Madam. Stephane later went on to record tracks with Satoshi Tomiie under the name Bipath and continues to dabble into the production of his own tracks, most notably "Numb"and "Insane Poem," co-produced with PQM.</p>
<p>Being an A&amp;R man with Eightball, Creamer was quite familiar with Madam's production ability and hired them to remix an Eightball project. A close relationship soon developed between Creamer and K, and they soon began collaborating together with a mutual desire to create vocal-driven tracks. This was quite a bold move when you consider that at the time, long, drawn-out instrumentals were the name of the game in dance music. Well, the rest as they say, is history.</p>
<p>When you are responsible for a number of huge remixes, good things start to happen in all facets of your career. Upon hearing the duo's remix of Trancesetters' "Roaches," Bedrock honcho John Digweed asked them to mix the fourth installment of the label's Compiled And Mixed series. Previously known more for their remixing, this CD provided a forum to showcase their abilities as DJs. The two-disc set was well received around the world and featured Creamer &amp; PQM's naughty "Fucksonnet," described by Muzik magazine as "a fucking brilliant prog-swearathon that would make John Lydon blush."</p>
<p>Drawing from his production and remixing skills, Creamer has launched a budding DJ career. Internationally, he has already played the world's most respected clubs including Cream, Renaissance and Bedrock in the U.K.; Pacha in Portugal, Soda in Athens and Zouk in Singapore. In the U.S., he has played Spundae in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Las Vegas; Axis in Boston and Just about every cool (and not so cool) venue in New York City.</p>
<p>By 2005, the duo Creamer and K had formed their own independent label, NY LOVE, with collaborator Lance Jordan, and had released a string of successful dance singles, most notably the #1 Billboard Dance Anthem Smash "Love Is A Drug" featuring New York singer/songwriter <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosko.html" title="Rosko">Rosko</a>. In early 2006, they followed up the Rosko track in with another #1 remix, "Glory of Life" by Mink, on the heels of the eagerly anticipated duet between Nadia Ali (<a href="../../../i/i/o/Iio.html" title="Iio">iio</a>) and <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosko.html" title="Rosko">Rosko</a>, "Something To Lose," for <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultra_Records_928e.html" title="Ultra Records">Ultra Records</a>. These visionary boys have inspired a tight group of acclaimed underground New York electronic music artists (centered around Creamer, K, Rosko, Jordan and Ali) that is commonly referred to as "The NY LOVE Crew." Together, they continue to throw legendary parties and live performances in New York, Miami, and around the world, in many of the largest and most prestigious nightclubs. <a name="Sources_100" id="Sources_100"></a></p>

<p>Member of the Georgia Institute of Technology's (Georgia Tech) 2006-07 Men's Basketball team. Will be a redshirt freshman in the Fall of 2006. Stands 6-feet, 8-1/2-inches, weighs a "razor-thin" 208 pounds, and plays combo-forward positions. Possesses a great feel for the game. Ridiculously long and skilled. Will be an impact guy, who can step-out, has three-point range, can put the ball on the floor and get to the basket, and is also a versatile defender. Reminicient of Mike Dunleavy, formerly of the Dook University and, now, the Golden State Warriors.</p>
<p>A native of the port city of Dakar, Senegal (pop.- 1.5 million) on the west coast of the African continent. Played on that country's national basketball team prior to the 2005 season. Previously ranked as the #3 junior AAU basketball player in all of Africa and ranked as the #7 "NBA potential" list at the "Africa Without Borders" basketball camp. An older brother, named Assane Faye, played varisty basketball at the University of New Hampshire. Another older half-brother, named Mohamed Niang, was a 6'10" center and played varsity basketball at the University of Delaware. At Georgia Tech, started taking classes in the fall of 2005. Majoring in INTA, with a Management minor.</p>
<p>Sat out the 2005-06 basketball season, having not received academic clearance to play from the ruling National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Practiced with the team during the 2006 spring semester. Recognized by Head Basketball Coach Paul Hewitt as a named factor in the talents of the new players to be added to the 2006-07 roster, ie. "....plus Mouhammad Faye." Acknowledged by much-heralded McDonalds High School All-American power forward and incoming Georgia Tech Freshman Thaddeus Young, as one who "can play the game. He will shock a lot of people."</p>
<p>Dubbed "GT's Mystery Man!" Nicknamed "Muha" by teammates. Thought to have x-ray vision, as well as the ability to freeze time. More than lovable Aussie Center Luuuke Schenscher, of GT's 2001-05 MBB teams, who had his own "possee," the idolized Faye has a cult, is a message board cult hero or, moreso, "Faye is The Cult." Fans already realize that for the elusive Muha, "none of us are witnesses."</p>
<p>The evolving "Legend of The Fayebulous," who has yet to be witnessed in any photographs or videos, has begun to grow exponentially "On the Flats" of the GT Campus, within the ATL sporting community, and beyond the farthest reaches of the universe....well, make that of the internet, sans Athens, GA.</p>
<p>Among the recently, most noted Fayebulous Legends are:</p>
<p>1. One time, after saving the world, Mouhammad was late for his team’s final game of the season. He arrived in the nick of time with his team down by 4 with .7 seconds left on the clock. The other team, knowing that their chances of winning had completely disappeared, tried to intentionally foul Faye by raking his eyes rather than let him score two 3-pointers in the time left. It was, however, too late… They fouled him just as Faye hit the full court shot. Still blinded, Faye refused to be taken out of the game and calmly made the two intentional foul shots helping his team win the game. Afterwards, the other team’s coach walked up to him and told Faye that he must have ice in his veins. To which Mouhammad replied, “Nope, sulfuric acid.” Then Faye left to save the world again.</p>
<p>2. Scientists incorrectly believe the hole in ozone was caused by green house gases. It was, in fact, created when Mouhammad broke through the atmosphere the first time he tried to dunk the ball at age 2. He has learned to gauge his hops better and has not broken through since.</p>
<p>3. There was no light until Mouhammad first opened his eyes. Everything was pitch black up until that point.</p>
<p>4. Mouhammad blinks his eyes over 25 million times per second. He has to. If he looks at you for longer than 1/1 millionth of a second, you will vaporize.</p>
<p>5. Death looks over his shoulders to make sure that Mouhammad is not standing there.</p>
<p>6.</p>
<p>7. Saturn used to be just rings. Mouhammad thought it looked so much like a basketball hoop that he dunked a planet there. It has been that way ever since. (In case you are wondering, he jumped through the same hole in the ozone that he created when he was 2. It was difficult because it did not exactly line up with the Saturn rings, but Mouhammad felt guilty about the first hole and did not want tot create another one.)</p>
<p>8. A mountain range once tried to pick a fight with Mouhammad. That mountain range was called the Grand Mountain Range. It is now called the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>9. Mouhammad is the reason why the Earth turns on its axis. Before Mouhammad, the Earth just stood there. Mouhammed ran around the earth so fast that he caused it to start its rotation.</p>
<p>10. Faye cannot time travel. He does not have to. Time asks Faye permission to move backwards or forwards.</p>
<p>11. The last person to question Mouhammad’s power was Jimmy Hoffa. Enough said!</p>
<p>12. As an Inter-Continental Ball Mauler, he sets off NORAD everytime he dunks.</p>
<p>13. Former Yellow Jackets Captain Clarence Moore (aka "C-Mo") is said to have inspired Faye's adopted, and oft-misspelled, first name, "Mouhammad." During a fiery, players-only meeting, C-Mo went into a tyraid over a certain teammate's lack of "help-the-helper" defense. In response, street-smart Will "The Thrill" Bynum sacrastically queried, "Mo, uh, am mad? Right?" Yes, Mo was mad all right...leave it that Bynum never queried Mo again. Any doubters of the Fayebulous must likewise keep silent or suffer his wrath...and never sarcastically query, "Mouhammad, right?"</p>
<p>14. A low-life winky-dinky Wikipedia reviewing peon, named "Kuzaar" (no doubt a kin to Coach Krazy of Puke) had the audacity to "DECLINE" listing this article in "The Free Encyclopedia." <b>"Decline. Article is mostly nonsense, and the last section reads like a series of those loathsome Chuck Norris jokes. Kuzaar 19:46, 17 May 2006 (UTC)"</b> The uproar from the loyal GT masses could be heard almost instanteously: "Declined? No one declines Muha! No one reclines Muha! No One inclines Muha! Basically don't bring any "clines" near Muha if you know what's good for you." Rumors of the impending censure and demise of "The Free Encyclopedia" immediately began circulating across the internet (ie. the Hive, anyway.)</p>
<p>15. He sees the future and sets its course and knows that the applause he will get the first time he jogs to check-in as a GT Yellow Jacket on Cremins Court at Alexander Memorial Coliseum with be unimaginably deafening. He has put the National Guard on notice.</p>
<p>16. It is understood by his followers that Faye doesn't like Country and Western and he doesn't like dead people either.</p>
<p>17. Faye started &lt;a href="<a href="http://mb25.scout.com/fthehivefrm9.showMessage?topicID=178.topic" class="external free" title="http://mb25.scout.com/fthehivefrm9.showMessage?topicID=178.topic" rel="nofollow">http://mb25.scout.com/fthehivefrm9.showMessage?topicID=178.topic</a>" target="top"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. And he will end it.</p>
<p>18. The fate of Kuzaar is a growing concern among the Yellow Jacket fan base. The concensus is that "he is 'toast!'"</p>
<p>19. Kuzaar "made his bed"...Muha will knock him into it. A "universal memory dump" will erase all of Kuzaar from all of time.</p>
<p>20. After being offered the Head BB coaching job at NC State Wednesday, Faye let out a huge roaring laugh, injuring four members of the press and knocking down powerlines throught Northeast Ga. Rolling Blackouts were reported as far away as West Virginia. After his laughter subsided, Faye remarked to the NC State athletic director that "Ha! You would do anything to not have to have the Wolfpack face me on the hardwood, wouldn't you?" He then b -slapped the NC official into unconciousness as a lesson to all who would insult him thusly.</p>
<p>21. People have noticed something strange about all those who have stated that they have actually seen Muha play. No ardent behind-the-scenes followers GT MBB have been able to frown or say anything bad of our "Mystery Man." It's been reported that a cousin of a friend of one fan who heard about someone who saw Muha play can now only talk about basketball. All other sports seem to be irrelevant to him, now.</p>
<p>22. Those who stare directly at him, while making a play, have their heads immediately explode due to the sheer talent. Medical reasearchers at the Emory Medical college are working on special glasses to prevent this messy side effect. As an incentive for increased giving, A-T is making available special glasses with a rapture filter to all A-T members with 500+ points. These fans can gaze on Faye's prowess without fear of cranial eruption. Members with 50 to 500 points will be given hand mirrors with which to observe Faye over their shoulders while sitting backwards in their seats. Under 50 point members and students will be given ear and nose plugs.</p>
<p>23. Aside from long arms, his primary talent is that he can create seams in the space time continuum. This allows him to warp, or translaocate himself from one end of the court to the other in the blink of an eye. Don't be surprised if the averages 40+ fast break points per game and 12-13 blocks. Warping the space time continuum makes the clock irrelevant to the game, thus giving the team the additional benefit of never worrying about running out the clock or running out of time as Faye can "back to the future" a last second shot as many times as necessary to let it go in. We control the time component in the game. This has been attempted once before with great success by a crack team of Behind the Iron Curtain Scientists. Hence the name: The :"Faye - 72 Russian Olympic Team Effect".</p>
<p>24. Its Muha's ability to control minds that amazes most people and will change the approach to the game. Dickie V. has already named him the only daiper dandy for '06/07, but after seeing Faye this year, he was unable to speak for the rest of the game. ESPN called it a throat problem, but we know the real reason. A cousin of the friend of a fan who once saw Faye said that he has found oil and prices will drop tomorrow.</p>
<p>25. It's been rumored that McDonald's High School All-American PG Jaravis Crittenton has said he is going to redshirt because of Faye's crazy good PG skills. Folks won't even remember who that guy "MJ" guy was.</p>
<p>26. The Carolina, Duke, Wake and Maryland internet boards show that thre is little, if any, realization of the impending Muha season around the ACC. Not one mention of his name at any of those sites. Of course, mentioning of his name can incite terrorist-like violence? They fear to speaketh the name of the demon, lest he appear and reave their very souls from their bodies...Not to mention light them up for triple-doubles..... In the first half.</p>
<p>27. Faye turns the snakes on Medusa's head to stone when they look directly at him.</p>
<p>28. Last week, while visiting the Vatican one loyal GT fan sat down with the Pope to talk about religion. He told the Pope that he was not sure that he believed in God, but that he was scared of Him. The Pope responded by saying, "I believe in God, but the only thing that scares me is Muhammed Faye!" The fan then turned to Kaiser Sose, as his head exploded at the mere mention of Faye's name.</p>
<p>29. Faye played a game of 1:2 against both Superman and Batman, at the same time. The loser had to wear his underwear on the outside of his clothes.</p>
<p>30. In public forums with GT fans, Coach Paul Hewitt has mentioned Faye briefly. All he has said was that he's another new player, he has practiced this past year with the team and he is now eligible to play. CPH said he definitely benefited greatly from the year of practice and will contribute. He did NOT mention his 145 inch vertical jump, his 84% 3-point shooting percentage, or his ability to walk on water. (That's shooting from the opposite 3 point line, of course!)</p>
<p>31. Faye's "Fission Vision" has proved to be a problem for Mouhammad lately. He has recently acquired from Los Alamos a pair of Atomic Diffuser goggles until he learns to blink. Growing up he never blinked and consequentially contributed to the growth of the Sahara near his native land. After vaporizing most of North Georgia's BB goals he was forced to face Florida while dribbling up court in pick up games. This was discontinued, however, when forest fires started raging out of control there recently. Argonne National Laboratory is now working on developing his anti fusion goggles next so when Faye has a cup of coffee in the morning after he has a good night's sleep he doesn't turn the training table into the surface of the sun. Argonne Labs has requested that no one associated with Faye surprise, shock, or present him with any incredible material that may cause a wide-eyed response until these goggles are fully developed. Because of this, Faye is no longer permitted to view BOTD posts on the Hive's Water Cooler.</p>

<li><b>Accept</b>. And, now, backing down from his objectionable and most inflamatory and insulting rhetoric (or, reading this ACCEPT review, flip-flopping back to reinstate his taunting, Brahmin-sounding missive of misguieded, academic snobbery), this Kuzaar has chosen to hide behind the skirts of the "The Free Encyclopedia's" "Biographical Standards." However, noting the following standard for "SportsPeople" and knowing that Muha controls all of time, Faye's qualifications are simply being judged in the current frame of the time continuum, within which future frames he has already established his professional basketball near-immortality with the Atlanta Hawks of the NBA: (Standard) "Sportspeople who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in an individual professional sport, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports, including college sports in the United States. Articles about first team squad members who have not made a first team appearance may also be appropriate, but only if the individual is at a club of sufficient stature that most members of its squad already have articles."

<p>Rodgers Forge Elementary school was founded in 1951 to meet the growing post World War 2 population boom in the north Baltimore, Maryland, suburbs, south of Towson, Maryland, called Rodgers Forge. The brick school was erected on Dumbarton Road, in 1951, and served the communities of Rodgers Forge, Armagh Village, Woodbrook, Haddon, and the Baltimore County portion of Mt. Washington. The school retains its original appearance and serves this population. It has been known as one of the better-performing schools of Baltimore County.</p>

<p>The movie starts out with real scenes of the Mariel Boatlift. We then see Tony Montana/Scarface sitting in an office while some customs officials interrogate him by asking all sorts of strange questions like is he gay. When Tony finally gets tired and stands up to leave, the two guards at the door stop him. Tony then gives a speech that America can't do anything to him that Fidel Castro hasn't done before.</p>
<p>We then see Tony and his partner in crime Manny, riding in a bus. They both talk about how good life will be in Miami. The bus is taken under a freeway overpass where many other immigrants from Cuba await acceptal into the United States as citizens. Manny and Tony have gotten word that a communist who is in their camp, must be killed. If Tony does this, he and his friends will all have green cards. A few weeks later, a big riot is set off in the camp. We see the communist walking around, feeling scared. He walks into his room where many people are slowly following him. When the communist opens a door to walk out, Tony pops out with a knife and stabs him to death. After this scene, we see Tony's green card, along with Manny's and their accomplice Angel's.</p>

<p>Joan Lyscos, believed to be born Circa 3,000 BCE. There are many topics and controversies surrounding her as of the current era, it is said that scientists and scientists at area 51 are studying this such person. Joan Lyscos has appeared in many ancient monuments of ancient peoples around the world over so therefore proves her existence since she has been around all during this time. Though nobody knows her origin, ancient texts tell the stories. Scenes depicting Joan Lyscos can be found in Caves paintings around Australia, Ancient Greek monuments, ancient Egyptian paintings and papyrus. Some say that she may even be the God worshipped by the Christians.</p>
<p><b>Joan, according to Science:</b></p>
<p>Joan has recently been studied in the Institute of Unidentified Biorganisms (I.U.B) In Kennedy, Boston. Joan has been sighted in many different forms of matter, prior to scientific research it has been speculated that she has the ability to shift air currents in her favor in order to somewhat levitate. There has been evidence for this through pictures of unidentified flying Joans over the White House and the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. "Defying the laws of physics is not uncommom for Joan" says Professor Lee Myung Jin of the Insitute of Unidentified Biorgamisms. Another example would be her ability to project her image through space without a medium. Because of this, some people would consider her to be an apparation.</p>
<p><b>Joan, Human life records:</b></p>
<p>Joan Lyscos has been recorded also in her stages of human life. Joan has a family of two boys, one girl and a mother. No father has ever been recorded based on the assumption that her family may just be a figment of imagination. Joan's two sons, Jacob and Josh have the alias of two elementary school boys along with the eldest daughter, Jody. There is little recorded about Joan's mother. Her name is Ruth but known as "Rua" by the three children. She has been assumed to be an even greater force than Joan herself but because no evidence has ever existed to prove so or otherwise, scintists can not be sure what the case may be. Joan has been sighted in a ragedy blue car that,has been assumed to be a manifistation of Joan's mom.</p>

Velazquez, a graduate of Notre Dame Law School is a partner at the Law Firm of Gold, Albanese, Barletti &amp; Velazquez, in Morristown, New Jersey. Velazquez made national news by attacking Gov.

<p>Sigma Phi Omega was founded at the University of Southern California in 1949, and is the oldest Asian-American sorority at USC and third oldest in the United States. It was originally established as a social organization for Japanese and Japanese-American women at USC. There was much anti-Asian sentiment left behind by World War II, which had ended in 1945. As one alumni said, " At that time it was understood that Asian women could not become members of a sorority. It has since changed. Thank goodness. "</p>
<p>In its early beginnings, the founding mothers of Sigma Phi Omega were invited by Chi Alpha Delta, an Asian-American sorority from UCLA, to become one of their chapters. (Chi Alpha Delta had been chartered in 1928 at UCLA, but was rendered inactive between 1942 and 1945 because the majority of its members were unable to attend UCLA due to World War II. After the end of the war, the sorority was reorganized in 1946.)</p>
<p>However, our founding mothers decided to start their own organization. The Greek letters were chosen at random and were not used by any other existing fraternities or sororities at that time. Although we did not originate as a sorority, one could speculate that the choosing of Greek letters was a public way of voicing a dissatisfactory opinion about the treatment of Asian American, specifically Japanese Americans, by the campus and Greek organizations.</p>
<p>Membership was primilary those of Japanese descent in the beginning, although it was open in membership. The pledge program was implemented in the mid-1950's.</p>
<p>Since it was founded, Sigma Phi Omega has established six other chapters located in both California and Texas.</p>
<p><br />
Alpha Chapter: University of Southern Caligornia, Los Angeles : 1949 Beta Chapter: California State University, Long Beach : 1970 Gamma Chapter : University of Texas : May 1, 1991 Delta Chapter : San Diego State University : December 18, 1991 Epsilon Chapter : University of Houston : April 21, 1995 Zeta Chapter : University of California at Berkeley : April 5, 1997 Eta Chapter : Baylor University : May 1, 1999</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sigma Phi Omega has helped young women adjust to college life for over fifty years. College is a time for new faces, endeavors, and experiences. Among this whirlwind of unfamiliarity, being in a sorority can help brighten your path and put things into perspective. It provides a base for lasting friendships and special memories. Sigma Phi Omega prides itself for its diversity in membership as we embrace the unique qualities and gifts each brings. Our alumni have gone onto successful careers in business, law, medicine, entertainment, and education.</p>

Charlene Zettel, a moderate Republican, serves as the Director of the Department of Consumer Affairs for the state of California. She was appointed in March 2004 by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>
<p>Charlene has served the people of California in many capacities. After many years as a parent volunteer, she was elected to the Poway Unified School District board in 1992 and served in that office for six years. Encouraged by her constituents to seek higher office, Charlene was the first Republican Latina elected to the state legislature, serving two terms in the Assembly as the representative for California's 75th District. Charlene ran against California State Assemblyman Dennis Hollingsworth (R-Temecula) in 2002 for the vacant State Senate seat in the 36th District; Charlene lost the election. Many people viewed the campaign ran by Dennis Hollingsworth to be shady and misleading. After leaving the State Assembly, Charlene remained politically active and when Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected he appointed Charlene to be the Director of California's largest consumer agency, the California Department of Consumer Affairs.</p>
<p>Among her responsibilities in the Assembly, she served as chairwoman of the Republican Caucus, vice chair of the Assembly Committee on Jobs, Economic Development and the Economy, and a member of the Appropriations, Education, Health, Rules, Transportation and Governmental Organization committees.</p>
<p>Some of Charlene's accomplishments in the legislature include the passage of AB 526, which preserved critical testimony of abused elderly victims, AB 2063, which allowed an abuser’s prior acts to be admissible in court, determining violent character and AB 1767, which provided protections against computer terrorists.</p>
<p>She also sought to protect our children with the introduction and passage of “Oliver’s Law,” which provided parents with critical information about licensed day care providers, and AB 1789, which enhanced penalties for child abusers.</p>
<p>Charlene resides in Poway, a city in northern San Diego County. Charlene has been a board member of the San Diego Regional Airport Authority and a public interest director of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. She is currently a member of the board of directors of the San Diego and Imperial Counties Chapter of the Red Cross.</p>
<p>Raised in Los Angeles, she received a Bachelor of Science degree in dental hygiene from the University of Southern California School of Dentistry, and practiced in her field for 20 years. She and her husband, David Zettel, a prominent dentist in the north San Diego County area have been married 34 years and have two children.</p>

<p>Since training piolets for fighters is costly and time-consuming, Fleet Command designed the Puppeteer Drone Frigate. It remote-controles around 25 static drones. Each of these has little power, but combined they unleash a withering firestorm. Predictably, it is most effectave against weakly armored strike craft. The arival of a heavy frigate, however, is a bad sign for a drone frigate. If a Puppeteer is hyperspaced while its drones are deployed, the drones will slowly drift to meet it once it comes out of hyperspace. Unfortunatly, it takes some time to collect drones once they are deployed, so a Puppeteer cannot retreat as quickly as other frigates, at least through hyperspace. In Caticlism, the Somtaaw use an upgraded version of this frigate, known as the Hive Frigate.</p>

<p>Casa Video</p>
<p>In 1983, two people who loved movies, Raymond and Gala Mellenberndt, and who were raised with movies, decided to create a store with not just mainstream titles, but classics, foreign movies, documentaries, cult movies, and experimental movies.</p>
<p>There were no more mom and pop theatres like the one they grew up in in Rock Rapids, Iowa...there were no more balconies...no more chandeliers. Where once the movie theatre was the center of small town life, the theatres were now abandoned. So were drive-in theatres. In their place moved cineplex octopuses with twenty small box sized rooms.</p>
<p>Casa Video went out of its way to become unique. In the beginning, it was about the same size as the neighborhood candy store. There were no other stores like it in Tucson. The original location on Grant and Campbell was a universe different from any other video store in the west...like an old book- store, it resembled a cave where someone could discover hidden treasures found nowhere else. Then came Blockbuster...then came Hollywood... then came all other McVideos. Most other mom and pop video stores went out of business. Casa Video grew and grew.</p>
<p>Casa Video is now an 8,000 square foot store located at 2905 East Speedway Blvd., Tucson, Arizona 85716. It has two floors, housing more than 40,000 video rentals...DVD's...audio books...and video games.</p>
<p>It has the largest selection of foreign movies, classics, documentaries, independent movies, and hard-to-find movies in the entire state of Arizona.</p>

<p>The Washington State Guard is an all-volunteer unit organized under the Military Department of the State of Washington. Its members are citizens of the State of Washington and often serve without pay or compensation, but commit to a minimum service obligation such as one year and to show up regularly to scheduled meetings, often one weekend day per month. They adhere to uniform standards, such as height and weight, and wear distinctive insignia, such as a unique shoulder patch and a "WASHINGTON" name tape on the front of the utility uniform.</p>
<p>The Washington State Guard serves under state jurisdiction and is employed only within the State of Washington. It is not subject to be called, ordered or assigned as any element of the federal armed forces. However, membership in the Washington State Guard does not exempt an individual from service in the armed forces of the United States.</p>

<p>"Daft Friday" is the social event of the year at the GUU (Glasgow University Union). During the festivities of Daft Friday, students are expected to dress formally, girls in dresses or ball-gowns and males in suits or kilts. The union is renovated to a different theme each year which is kept secret until the night of the event. The event is open to all members of the GUU and tickets are purchased from the porters box nearer to the event. Other information regarding the event can be found on the GUU website. The alternative union of Glasgow University is the QMU (Queen Margaret Union) which holds the alternative to Daft Friday, 10 hour Cheesy Pop, which is typically held at the end of each term (as opposed to Daft Friday which occurs once a year). Ask any student on campus about Daft Friday and you can be sure of a wealth of stories and folklore surrounding the event.</p>

<p>I visited this rural spot in East Galway, Ireland where a ceremony (which I was not familiar with) was taking place. I think it could be categorized as faith-based. To give the editors a heads-up, it was like those late night TV infomercials where people behave oddly, with only the touch of a "Minister" provoking it.</p>
<p>I assume this is the UK/Ireland spelling of Evangelism. Maybe it's not. Men in priestly cloth celebrated "Mass", mention was often made of the Bishop (Clonfert, Joe Kirby) sanctioning this meeting.</p>

<p>Spherical cows are a tongue in cheek reference to simplifications that are often made in scientific and engineering calculations.<br />
<br />
For instance a physics problem in a textbook might begin with the phrase "Consider a spherical cow of uniform density..." Assuming a uniform, spherical cow greatly simplifies equations dealing with momentum, air resistance, center of mass, surface area, and volume because a spherical cow is mathematically equivalent to the mathematical definition of a spherical solid, e.g. the points in 3-space satisfying x^2 + y^2 + z^2 &lt; r^2. A spherical cow skin is equivalent to the two dimensional surface of a sphere; x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2.<br />
<br />
Depictions of spherical cows, along with jokes and other important information, can be found at the sources listed below.<br />

<p>In 20th century, when archaeologists and scientists who were exploring the ruins of ancient villages in Ural mountains, they found the remainings of settlers and explored their skeletons and this experiment brought to the results which became an incredible discovery. This discovery was a good opponent to Hitler's and SS racial theories.<br />
As Nazis and Neo-Nazis believed in power of blue-eyed and blond-haired people who's origin they thought can be only North Europe, scientists found out that natives of Ural mountains and ancestors of Finnic-Ugric people were also the origins of blue-eyed and blond haired people, but comparing with Nazi's "master race", these people were not nordics or "Aryans", because their appearances were asian.<br />
Uralic people (blue-eyed and light-haired people with asian apperances) spoke language which is relative to Finnic, Estonian and other Finnic-Ugric languages.</p>

<p>4000-3000 BC all people who were part of Uralic Race joined into one group of settlements and began to create common languages which were the origins of Finnic-Ugric languages. In the first 1000 AD years, most of these nations began to move west and began to live with caucausians and mixed with them. Through generations Uralic people began to look completely European and they lost all appearances which were parts of Uralic Race except blue eyes and blond hairs (means all asian appearances which were parts of Uralic Race have disappeared).<br />
The offsprings of these Uralic People are Finnic-Ugric nations including Estonians, Karels, Finnic people and others.</p>

<p>During the migration of Uralic people in the first 1000 AD years, lots of babies in this area of migration were born who were half Uralic and half Caucausian.<br />
Dark haired and dark-eyed Caucausian man and Uralic woman who married each other can have a blue-eyed and blond-haired with European appearance child, which from point view of Nazis looks like and must be a person of "Aryan" race, but really shouldn't be the ancestor Nordic race. This child got European appearance from his dark haired and eyed father, and got blue eyes and blond hairs from mother who's appearance is asian.</p>

<p>Samer Kawak was born on December 3, 1988, in the Glasgow, Scotland. He was the first child of Abboud and Rola Kawak. At the time, his father was studying at St. Andrew's to receive his Ph.D. After a few years in Scotland, Samer's mother travel back to their home country of Syria to stay with Samer's grandmother for a year while Abboud established himself in the United States. From Syria, Samer made his first trip to the America at the tender age of three. Wisconsin turned out to be the family's initial destination. Again, as a doctor, Samer's father was required to move to complete his fellowship; therefore, the Kawaks moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Next, Samer, age 9, and his family moved again to Fairfax, Virginia. Finally, Indiana has become Samer's seemingly permanent home as he flourishes today in an excellent three-time blue ribbon high school, Roncalli.</p>

<p>Kirill is a 2006 Year 13 student at New Plymouth Boys' High School in New Zealand. He comes from Russia and enjoys ceroc dancing. Kirill is somewhat of a rebel, thinking outside the square. For example, he chooses to wear Number Ones, rather than normal uniform even when he's not going on trips. This was a bad choice of his, as some of the other boarders in his hostel trashed his room for doing this, poor Kirill.</p>
<p>Although, this wasn't really Kiril's thinking to do this, he actually copied the idea from Jesse and Shay Jenkin-Povey (a master of the art of chatter rings). When Kirill Gets asked why he wears number ones, he answers an answer that makes so much sense that no-one can understand it.</p>
<p>There are several words and gestures which came about purely from his name, here is a list of examples: RadiKIRILL!!! = radical, KIRILLiminal = criminal, Kiruuul = cool, KIRIILY? = really?, Faux KIRILL = For real, Keep it KIRILL = Keep it real</p>
<p>These popular catch phrases involving his name will later form the basis of a famous bumper sticker company.</p>
<p>Kirill has an interesting personality, which some people call arrogant, but my self and many others like to think of it as "misunderstood". Anyone who has had the honour of meeting Kiril should be counting their lucky stars, or rather star, the star being Kirill.</p>
<p>Yin-Yang!!!</p>

<p>Endako is a very small town located in the center of British Columbia (Canada), between the towns of Fraser Lake and Burns lake on highway 16. The town has only one or two stores including a fine drinking extablishment "the Endako pub" named after the unincorporated town itself. The pub is central to the town which is evident upon seeing the greeting sign that reads: "Endako and Pub". Endako is a quaint town that has a special place in the hearts of all northerners in the Bulkley-nechako and lakes district regions. But be warned, when looking for the town as you are driving north keep your eyes peeled ;if you blink you will miss it.</p>

<p>[STACY'S MUSIC ROW REPORT]</p>
<p>Stacy's Music Row Report is the official Web site of the internationally-known, veteran country-music journalist, historian, author and broadcaster Stacy Harris. Not to be confused with the character actor of the same name, Stacy Harris is the doyenne of Music Row, and thanks to her column's blend of facts and informed opinion, would be the often sordid country-music industry's conscience- if it had one- as her scrutiny strives to hold the gatekeepers accoountable.</p>

<p>Orpheus was a psychedelic rock band founded in 1967. The name Orpheus was inspired by Greek Mythology. Members included guitarists Jack McKennes and Bruce Arnold, bassist Eric "the Snake" Gulliksen, and drummer Harry Sandler. All members also contributed vocals. By its end in 1969, the band recorded three albums and four singles for MGM Records. All of the albums and two of the singles reached the Billboard best-seller charts, including their most famous song, Can't Find the Time. Can't Find the Time is considered to be one of the classic love songs of the late 60's. It has been covered many times by artist such as Rose Colored Glass, the Groovin' Strings, Hootie and the Blowfish, and Johnny Dollar. Comedian Red Peters parodied the song with his own version, Jalalabad.</p>
<p>In addition to recording, the group played many sold-out concerts throughout the United States, sharing the stage with performers like Blood, Sweat and Tears, the Who, Cream, Led Zeppelin, Jeff Beck, the Rascals and Janis Joplin. Their second album, Ascending, reached no. 10 in the 1968 Playboy magazine Jazz and Pop Reader Poll. The group also recorded the theme song for the MGM movie Marlowe starring James Garner, Little Sister.</p>
<p>The group broke up in December of 1969, but reformed in 1971 with Stephen "Steve" Martin as a fifth member. They released a single on Bell Records, Big Green Pearl, but disbanded again in 1972. All of the Orpheus albums were produced by Alan Lorber.</p>
<p>In 2004, Jack, Snake, Harry, and Steve along with other musicians formed the band Orpheus Reborn, with a new style but maintaining the same legacy.</p>

<p>Melissa Galt is an interior designer, national speaker and author known for her no-nonsense philosophy working with clients to design their signature style. Most recently her work is showcased in the 2006 publication, Spectacular Homes of Georgia. Since 1994 when she established her firm Linea Interior Design, Inc., Melissa’s mission has been to create unique and personal environments that reflect her client’s life experiences and passions. “Your lifestyle and home must blend, in order to create the supportive atmosphere necessary for living life to the fullest”.</p>
<p>Often referred to as the Lifestyle Diva, Melissa has been profiled widely in the Atlanta Journal Constitution, Atlanta Business Chronicle, Points North, Atlanta Homes and Lifestyles, Southern Living, Better Homes and Gardens, Atlanta Home to name but a few. She has appeared on national television morning talk shows and talk radio offering tips and helpful advice on “Shortcuts to Better Living,” “Don’t Wait for a Mate, Feather Your Nest Now,” and “Designing Your Signature Life”.

Melissa is also a contributing author in the motivational book Live Every Day Motivated, Successful and Happy. She often keynotes and conducts workshops at conferences, corporate events, fundraisers and consumer audiences nationwide. Design was the natural direction for Melissa career; Melissa Great-Grandfather was Frank Lloyd Wright. His design philosophy blended structure with nature in order to achieve harmonious spaces. Melissa’s philosophy is a natural evolution of those ideals. In the 21st century often our “environment” is a hectic life! Designing your signature life is Melissa’s original concept of using design to bring your life and home into harmony. Her Great-Grandfather would have understood and approved.</p>
<p>While Melissa is in tune with the work and vision of her Great-Grandfather, Melissa’s mother and her god-mother were constants in her life. Growing up with her mother, Academe Award winning actress, Anne Baxter, and blesses with god-mother, eight times Academe Award winning designer, Edith Head, meant exposure to style and design on an international level.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Growing up as the daughter of an actress meant a great deal of traveling. Traveling the world at an early age had a major impact on Melissa’s style and outlook. She has a passion for travel and has visited forty of the fifty U.S. states. Melissa has lived on the West Coast, the East Coast and now in the beautiful South. In addition, Melissa has traveled abroad extensively.</p>
<p>Melissa attended Cornell University’s preeminent School of Hotel Administration. After completing her degree she spent the next several years honing her business skills in hospitality purchasing.</p>

Moving to Ryetown, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Mackinaw Island, Michigan; Charlotte, North Carolina; Birmingham, Alabama; Nashville, Tennessee; and Melissa final hospitality position at Callaway Gardens in Columbus, Georgia. Melissa enjoyed the newness of each position and locale, but was frustrated by the lack of creativity. Melissa god-mother Edith Head, “Aunt Eddy”, had always encouraged her designing impulses, so Melissa obtained her degree in interior design from Southern Institute in Alabama, Georgia. This was the beginning of designing Melissa’s Signature Life and the start of a very successful designing career.</p>

Note that there are 108 episodes of the programme not known to exist (all from the black-and-white 1960s era) and that though the search goes on, many or all of them may be lost forever, a few clips (mostly herein) notwithstanding, hence this collection's title. Audio recordings of all the episodes' soundtracks – made off-air at the time of transmission by fans – do thankfully exist (though it was not always thought so) and have been archived by the BBC. The visual and audio quality of episodes and clips as originally recovered varies, but the work of the BBC-affiliated Restoration Team (visit: <a href="http://www.restoration-team.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.restoration-team.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">official site</a>) is extraordinary and this boxset of rare archived material presents much never before made available, and all of it restored to a quality beyond what had previously been thought possible.

<p>Ian Gough is a general all round hero on the rugby field, and when not on the field can be found flying through the Cardiff sky. When one sees Ian Gough in his plane, one is forced to ask themsleves the question: Is It A BIRD IS IT A PLANE. THE ANSWER IS OF COURSE NO! IT IS IAN GOUGH. He is just as good at flying as he is at rugby, which means that he is awesome.</p>
<p>When not gracing the rugby field with his presence, and flying like an eagle in the sky, Ian can be found modelling all in one body suites. By the way he is massive, so this is a most impressive site. He is by far the most acomplished player on the rugby field and could easily tackle anyone in the world. He is a living legend! And he deserves respect.</p>

<p><br />
WHAT IS HENDERSON'S RELISH?</p>
<p>Though similar in appearance to a Worcestershire sauce, Henderson’s Relish is unique in its aroma and flavour. It can be used both as a sauce on meat dishes, pies, fish, chips and as a cooking ingredient in casseroles, pasta dishes, soups and marinades.</p>
<p>Unlike other comparable sauces, the relish is also suitable for vegetarians.</p>
<p>The special mix of spices are blended together with our secret recipe and a special sauce is made. The way in which the sauce is blended is still a closely guarded secret and at least once a year a rumour sweeps Sheffield that the owner is retiring and taking the secret recipe with him. Upon hearing this supermarket shelves are cleared as people stock up on their favourite sauce. Fortunately all these rumours are unfounded and Hendersons is going as strong as ever.</p>
<p><br />
HISTORY</p>
<p>It was Mr Henry Henderson who first began manufacturing his own special type of sauce back in the late part of the 19th century. Originally manufactured at 35 Broad Lane in Sheffield, Henderson’s Relish is still being made no further than half a mile from the site of the first bottle being filled.</p>
<p>During the formative years of the Company there were two different owners but the current Managing Director, Dr Kenneth Freeman is the nephew of the late Charles Hinksman who began work for the company soon after The First World War, and it has been in this family’s hands ever since. He became MD in 1991 and has overseen some important changes in the Company’s profile. Previously unknown outside of Sheffield, Henderson's appeal is now spreading further and further afield with an increasing amount of supermarket listings and a thriving mail order service.</p>
<p>Up until now Henderson’s Relish was the only product that we sold, apart from the War years when we had to turn our hand to wholesaling products due to the lack of ingredients available to make our Relish.</p>
<p>FAMOUS FANS</p>
<p>It has many famous fans including -Brendan Ingle -Sean Bean -Peter Stringfellow -Bobby Knutt</p>

<p>A State College Iced Tea is an alcoholic <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixed_drink.html" title="Mixed drink">mixed drink</a>. It is a variation of the popular <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Island_Iced_Tea_eb7e.html" title="Long Island Iced Tea">Long Island Iced Tea</a> invented by students at the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania_State_University_be4e.html" title="Pennsylvania State University">Pennsylvania State University</a> in the Pinchot Inferno. The ingredients in a State College Iced Tea are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 oz. Vladimir Vodka</li>
<li>1 oz. Bankers Club Gin</li>
<li>1 oz. Bankers Club or Jacquin's Clear Rum</li>
<li>1 oz. Tortilla Tequila Liquor</li>
<li>1 oz. Triple Sec</li>
<li>Lemon-Lime Flavored <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gatorade.html" title="Gatorade">Gatorade</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../p/e/p/Pepsi.html" title="Pepsi">Pepsi</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The State College Iced Tea is prepared nearly identically to the Long Island Iced Tea. The liquors are first poured into a large glass full of ice in equal proportions. The Gatorade is then added until the glass is nearly full. Pepsi is finally added to give it the color of a traditional iced tea. The drink may then be mixed in a shaker, making it slightly frothy or stirred.</p>
<p>This drink is popular at Penn State mainly due to the cheap liquors used and the availabilty of the mixers. All of the liquors involved in this drink can be purchased in the handle (1.75L) size for under $20 at Pennsylvania Liquor Stores, making it a bargain for college students. Penn State exclusively sells Pepsi beverages, so the Pepsi and Gatorade are available all over campus.</p>
<p>This drink is particularly potent with nearly five shots in a single drink, and it should be drinken responsibly.</p>

<p>Anfflercopius (Derived from the latin <i>Italic text</i>anf meaning to destroy and <i>Italic text</i> clopi meaning obligation) is a syndrome that can sometimes be found in both otters and Humans. Although the latter has yet to be proved, there are distinct rumors in scientific and palentolical circles that this could be true. The otter has a natural urge to destroy or dismantle any simple constructions that they find, such as a net. This feature in the otter has been slowly lost over many years through industrialisation and evlustion, however, it can be seen in the South American bull otter, which attacks most areas with its destructive manors. The copmpulsive need to destroy caused the death of a buddist monestry high in the mountains of Amazonia.</p>
<p>Many scientists are currently trying to prove that this need can be found in some humans. Features of the typical behavoir have been seen certain lawyers and leading pop stars. it seems that they surpress the compulsion for as long as they possibly can, which makes the outbursts more violent and devestating.</p>
<p>It is belived that the habit can be passed on by both genetics and learnt. The thinking that is currently available claims that the person cannot stand anything that is finished, or that they do not want something to be over as they like it too much. Another thought, however, is that the need is wanten, with no real purpose or aim, or even a motive, just that the patient needs the misery of breakdown, as it makes them feel more special, more unique. Or the final theory is that they want to be "normal". They see everyone as on a journey, or in a task, and to fit in they must always be busy. This is directed into anger and destruction.</p>

<p>Teamline is a live sports play-by-play service that listeners use to access the play-by-play of sporting events from any telephone or Internet connection in the world! Since 1990 a company in Kent, Ohio called TRZ Communications Inc. has been providing thousands of games to alumni, displaced fans, and parents of athletes for over 500 college and professional teams.</p>
<p>Tom Zawistowski, CEO and Founder of TRZ, came up with the idea while working in athletics at The College of William &amp; Mary. In 1982 his school received a bid to play in the NIT basketball tournament, and Zawistowski was frustrated that alumni from around the country were unable to share in the experience, since the game would not be available on national radio or TV. To solve the problem, he placed speakerphones in his office and played the radio broadcast of the game to alums that had called in and listened over their telephones! The alums loved it, and wanted to call every game.</p>
<p>The TEAMLINE® idea was born but it was not until 1990 that the idea became a reality on a national scale. Today, alumni, fans, and parents of the athletes can hear their games over any telephone by calling TEAMLINE® during any live game at 1-800-846-4700 and entering their team's four digit code. Fans can call from any phone including home, office, cellular, hotel, airplane - even internationally.</p>
<p>Alumni and booster groups benefit from the service as well. Numerous groups around the country have parties on football Saturdays where they rent a restaurant, call TEAMLINE® during the pre-game show and have the game played over the PA system so everyone can hear. “It is a great way to get the spirit going and have some fun. It sounds like you're on the sidelines, and it really conveys the emotion of the game.” claims Zawistowski. A portion of the proceeds from every call to TEAMLINE® are paid to the athletic rights holders to help support their athletics program.</p>
<p>Since 1990 TRZ has provided live coverage of over 800,000 live events ranging from football, basketball, baseball, softball, hockey, lacrosse, volleyball and auto races. Since new teams are always joining the service fans can check the TEAMLINE web site to search for their favorite team's code at www.TEAMLINE.cc.</p>

<p>Blues Matters!' Story So Far</p>
<p>Blues Matters! was created out of frustration that British Blues did not get the credit it deserved since the 60’s or now.</p>
<p>In the early 1990's, Blues Matters! started as a fanzine for a British blues band and by 1997 had grown to include exposure for other bands. Demand for Blues Matters! meant that by 2000, the 'fanzine' grew to an impressive 120 page 'magazine' to give more bands and enthusiasts a voice, packed full of interviews, reviews and previews of artists, CD's, DVD's, gigs, festivals, music products, post artists' gigs, and exchange information on blues and music. In 2001, Blues Matters! launched as a limited company that reflected the magazines growth and new opportunities arising …</p>
<p>Blues Matters! reputation for representing British Blues was soon recognized in the industry, and by 2004 boasted 3 Record Labels with 25 recording artists and releases, a music publishing company, a National Blues Gig Guide, merchandise, Blues Music Store, and loads more.</p>
<p>So much can and needs to be done for the blues but it's pretty fragmented. Blues Matters! unbrella was needed to help 'champion the blues', spread the word, and promote the wealth of talented artists and music.

<p>Neo-Eldarin is a term that may be used to describe the language of texts attempting to actually use the "Elven" tongues invented by British author and philologist <a href="../../../j/2E/r/J.R.R._Tolkien_b884.html" title="J.R.R. Tolkien">J.R.R. Tolkien</a> for his <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle-earth.html" title="Middle-earth">Middle-earth</a> legendarium. (The word <i>Eldarin</i> means "Elvish" in Quenya, one of the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Languages_of_Middle-earth_3ffd.html" title="Languages of Middle-earth">languages of Middle-earth</a>.) While Tolkien sketched an Elvish language family with many branches, such efforts primarily focus on the two main Elven-tongues of the legendarium, namely <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quenya.html" title="Quenya">Quenya</a> (High-elven, the ancient ritual language of the Elves) and <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindarin.html" title="Sindarin">Sindarin</a> (Grey-elven, the daily speech of the Elves in Middle-earth).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-22_b389.html" title="Edit section: Neo-Quenya and Neo-Sindarin">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Neo-Quenya and Neo-Sindarin</span></h2>
<p>Most texts produced to date are in Neo-Quenya, since Quenya is by far the most well-attested language in published Tolkien material. The first substantial post-Tolkien attempt to write an Eldarin text may be Bj&amp;oeuml;rn Fromén's Neo-Quenya poem <i>Valinorenna</i>, appearing in the pioneering Tolkien-linguistic work <i>An Introduction to Elvish</i> (1978, edited by Jim Allan).</p>
<p>The most widely-published examples of Neo-Sindarin are unquestionably the "Elvish" dialogue developed by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Salo_8c0a.html" title="David Salo">David Salo</a> for <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Jackson_8dca.html" title="Peter Jackson">Peter Jackson</a>'s movie trilogy based on Tolkien's <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_Rings_293e.html" title="Lord of the Rings">Lord of the Rings</a> novel. Except for the samples of Sindarin taken directly from the book (such as <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandalf.html" title="Gandalf">Gandalf</a>'s invocation before the doors of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moria.html" title="Moria">Moria</a>), Salo put together these lines based on his own understanding of Sindarin grammar, extrapolating where Tolkien material available to him was insufficient. This particular dialect of Neo-Sindarin is sometimes called Movie Sindarin.</p>
<p>Asked why they produce Neo-Eldarin texts, writers may cite various motivations. Tolkien himself wrote that <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> was "largely an essay in 'linguistic aesthetic'" (The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, p. 219-220), and writers may want to celebrate the peculiar aesthetic of Tolkien's Elvish. To some it will be an attempt to immerse themselves in the world of Middle-earth. Others will be interested primarily in the languages as such, and try to learn them as some kind of intellectual challenge.</p>
<p>As for the movies, Peter Jackson apparently wanted to include Elvish dialogues for effect, and David Salo set out to produce an approximation of Tolkien's Elvish as well as he could reconstruct it.</p>
<p>Especially after the appearance of the Jackson movies, many people wanted brief "Elvish" inscriptions for rings (often wedding-rings), tattoos and the like. These people rarely take the time to study Eldarin in depth for themselves; rather they may request "expert" help on Tolkien-linguistic mailing-lists, or contact individual Tolkien-linguists directly. Typically such inquirers also want the Elvish message to be written in the "original" <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tengwar.html" title="Tengwar">Tengwar</a> script devised by Tolkien for his languages. They feel attracted to the magical aura and aesthetic qualities of "Elvish", but may not have a deeper scholarly interest in Tolkien's work. Writers intending to compose longer texts must by necessity penetrate far deeper into the linguistic "lore" relating to Tolkien's languages.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-22_b389.html" title="Edit section: Neo-Eldarin vs. Tolkien's Original Work">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Neo-Eldarin vs. Tolkien's Original Work</span></h2>
<p>The exact relationship between Neo-Eldarin and Tolkien's original Quenya and Sindarin is difficult to define. First of all, it should be understood that none of these languages mentioned exist as monolithic, fixed entities that can readily be compared to one another. Neo-Quenya and Neo-Sindarin texts necessarily reflect the understanding (and to some extent, the preferences) of the individual authors. Various individuals may interpret certain grammatical details in different ways, and the understanding of an individual author may also change over time.</p>
<p>In particular, the occasional publication of hitherto unknown Tolkien material may cause Neo-Eldarin writers to revise the conventions they have been using: Since Eldarin grammar is reconstructed from a very limited corpus, the appearance of even a few new lines of Tolkien-made Eldarin text may sometimes significantly shift the balance of the evidence.</p>
<p>If the linguistic conventions used by Neo-Eldarin writers may change, this is even more true of Tolkien's original work on the languages. He worked on them for half a century, but never achieved definite Eldarin grammars (which is why there is still room for personal interpretation when samples of Elvish are to be analyzed). While most of his linguistic manuscripts remain unpublished, it is already clear from published material that they contain layer upon layer of changing ideas rather than a single, unified vision of what Eldarin was "really" like. The language generally referred to as Sindarin even had its name and internal history revised immediately before the publication of the last volume of the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>: When Tolkien actually wrote the trilogy, he thought of this language as "Noldorin" instead, ascribing its origin to the <a href="../../../n/o/l/Noldor.html" title="Noldor">Noldor</a> elves rather than the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindar.html" title="Sindar">Sindar</a>.</p>
<p>Since Tolkien himself revised the languages so often, it can be difficult to directly compare "Tolkien's Elvish" to the Neo-Eldarin conventions employed by any post-Tolkien writer. It is out of the question that any substantial Neo-Eldarin text can be written that agrees with <i>all</i> of Tolkien's linguistic writings, since these writings very often contradict themselves.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-22_b389.html" title="Edit section: Neo-Eldarin Methodology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Neo-Eldarin Methodology</span></h2>
<p>In principle, Neo-Eldarin texts could be based on any of the numerous conceptual phases observed in Tolkien's writings. In practice, writers almost invariably try to emulate Quenya and Sindarin as these tongues are exemplified in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. It is clear that by and large, Tolkien himself felt bound by samples of Elvish that had appeared in print, so this material is as close to "definite" or "canonical" Eldarin as one can get. Typically, Neo-Eldarin writers look to these texts as their primary normative authority.</p>
<p>Obviously the information that can be extracted from these few samples is in no way sufficient to reconstruct a grammar that could support even a semi-functional language. Writers therefore consider other Tolkien material as well. The fact that this material often contradicts itself is problematic from the viewpoint of Neo-Eldarin writers trying to make out definite grammatical rules. The normal approach is to adopt details of grammar that are (or seem) compatible with the samples of Elvish contained in the LotR. Most writers would also want to keep the language largely compatible with other widely-published samples of Tolkien's languages, notably those occurring in the <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silmarillion.html" title="Silmarillion">Silmarillion</a> (though this book was edited and published posthumously and may not be considered strictly "canonical" in all respects).</p>
<p>Since the "canonical" samples of Elvish are relatively brief, they do not provide a complete guide to how Tolkien's linguistic material could be edited into a unified grammar. It must be assumed that Tolkien's post-LotR writings on his languages were <i>intended</i> to be compatible with the samples he had already published in the novel, yet these writings still contradict themselves on many details. An editor trying to produce a unified grammar could in theory come up with a string of different "Quenyas" and "Sindarins" that would be equally Tolkienian and equally compatible with the LotR samples. While these languages would probably not be radically different from one another, certain pronominal endings and the like would differ.</p>
<p>An oft-cited editorial strategy would be to approximate Tolkien's <i>final</i> intentions, Quenya and Sindarin as he saw them near the end of his life. Some feel that this would be a quite arbitrary approach, since these late incarnations of Elvish may not be objectively "better" or more consistent than Tolkien's earlier ideas; he was not necessarily in the process of settling on definite versions of Quenya/Sindarin when he died. (Since most of Tolkien's late manuscripts remain unpublished, definite assessments of this material still cannot be made.) Others have suggested that an editor should consider primarily Tolkien's conception of the languages as it was when he actually wrote <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, though most would also agree that this material should be "calibrated" against Tolkien's post-LotR ideas.</p>
<p>As for <i>current</i> attempts to write in Eldarin (especially Quenya), most writers would probably agree that the results should not be taken overly seriously, and hardly anyone would claim to have reconstructed Tolkien's intentions with absolute certainty or accuracy. (After all, he could not even agree with himself on many details.) Still, many Neo-Quenya writers would argue that the inflection of the <i>noun</i> is fairly well understood: During his lifetime, Tolkien sent an overview of the relevant endings to Richard Plotz, and it mostly agrees well with published samples of Quenya from the 1950s on. Some relatively trivial variations occur, as when the ending for plural <a href="../../../a/b/l/Ablative.html" title="Ablative">ablative</a> occurs as -<i>llon</i> in Plotz, but as -<i>llor</i> in other late texts.</p>
<p>The main outlines of the verb system has been reconstructed to the satisfaction of some, though there is an ongoing debate about a number of features. (For instance, the past tense of <i>car</i>- "do, make" is variously given as <i>carnë</i> and <i>cárë</i> in Tolkien's writings, and it is not obvious which is the best option for a Neo-Quenya writer. An early wordlist actually cites the forms side by side, so maybe both should be considered valid.) There are a few "missing" tenses, such as the <a href="../../../p/l/u/Pluperfect.html" title="Pluperfect">pluperfect</a> (currently only attested in a form of Quenya that far predates the LotR, and the form it had in that early incarnation of the language does not seem compatible with Tolkien's later ideas).</p>
<p>Quenya adjectives and adverbs are perceived as relatively unproblematic, though certain commonly held assumptions so far cannot be proved. (For instance, it is often held that adverbs can readily be derived from adjectives by adding the ending -<i>vë</i>; this is based on one single example from the LotR. Lacking any explicit Tolkienian statements either way, we cannot know if the author meant this ending to be as freely applicable as the English adverbial ending -<i>ly</i>.) For certain important <i>conjunctions</i>, writers still have to fall back on Tolkien's earliest writings; many would like to base such vital vocabulary on the later conceptual phases instead.</p>
<p>Parts of the <i>pronoun table</i> are problematic due to frequent revisions and changing concepts, though material published in recent years seemingly allows a fairly plausible reconstruction of a near-complete system. For certain <i>syntactical relationships</i> there are still no good Tolkien examples that could guide writers. The <i>counting system</i> is uncertain from 20 onwards, though extrapolations some would find plausible are not difficult to make. More information about numbers is known to exist, awaiting publication.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindarin.html" title="Sindarin">Sindarin</a> is altogether more poorly attested and also has its own complexities (phonology and grammar being intertwined in intricate ways). The "quality" of Neo-Sindarin texts is often difficult to assess: Most writers rely on assumptions that are generally compatible with the Tolkenian samples, but these samples would frequently allow other interpretations as well. Hence various writers may base their own Neo-Sindarin texts on differing interpretations. For instance, the word <i>ir</i> occurring in one untranslated Sindarin poem is treated as a variant of the definite article <i>i</i> in David Salo's works. Others see in this <i>ir</i> a possible cognate of Quenya <i>íre;</i>, "when" introducing a temporal clause (<i>The Lost Road</i> p. 72). This would also allow for a sensible (though necessarily unconfirmed) translation of Tolkien's Sindarin poem. Some writers have therefore used <i>ir</i> for "when" in their Neo-Sindarin compositions. Others, following Salo, might use the same word as a definite article.</p>
<p>In the case of Sindarin, matters are further complicated by the fact that material from the pre-LotR period is strictly "Noldorin" instead, and some scholars object to including Noldorin in the Sindarin corpus. Its exclusion would however leave Neo-Sindarin writers with a vocabulary so small that actually composing in the language would be quite impossible. Quenya was at least always called Quenya (though in the pre-LotR period, Tolkien employed the spelling "Qenya"), and even though Tolkien often revised the grammar, the general style of the language remained reasonably stable over the decades. Therefore, many Neo-Quenya writers do not hesitate to use early "Qenya" vocabulary in their compositions, next to words Tolkien devised decades later. Generally, though, Neo-Eldarin writers treat Tolkien's early material as something to "fall back on" when Tolkien's later material does not suffice for their needs.</p>
<p>Obviously many Neo-Eldarin enthusiasts hope and expect that the eventual publication of more of Tolkien's linguistic material will fill many of the current gaps in our knowledge about the languages (and also allow writers to substitute "late" ideas where only "early" solutions are currently available).</p>
<p><a name="Normalized_.22Useable.22_Eldarin.3F" id="Normalized_.22Useable.22_Eldarin.3F"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-22_b389.html" title="Edit section: Normalized &quot;Useable&quot; Eldarin?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Normalized "Useable" Eldarin?</span></h2>
<p>However, it is not to be expected that even the complete publication of the entire collection (supposedly thousands of pages) will allow anyone to simply lift ready-made "complete" languages directly from Tolkien's linguistic manuscripts. If the manuscripts are eventually made available, they will at best provide an editor with <i>options</i> rather than definite solutions.</p>
<p>To some, the ultimate goal is to develop and lovingly cultivate Quenya and Sindarin to the point where they would become at least semi-useable tongues, capable of sustaining everyday conversation. Some, indeed, use the terms "Neo-Quenya" and "Neo-Sindarin" to refer to such hypothetical future entities, which could be studied and used just like other highly-developed invented languages (like <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto.html" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a>, or at least like <a href="../../../k/l/i/Klingon.html" title="Klingon">Klingon</a>). This must be distinguished from the current usage (the term "Neo-Quenya/Sindarin" rather referring to <i>any</i> post-Tolkien attempt to compose in his languages, as opposed to yet-to-be-developed normalized versions of them).</p>
<p>Current projects to develop "normalized Elvish" are tentative and preliminary, due to the incomplete state of the publication project aiming to present all of Tolkien's linguistic manuscripts. Editors trying to establish a normalized grammar should obviously be able to consider the entire collection before suggesting what a representative cross-section of Tolkien's most developed ideas could look like.</p>
<p>The initial stage of the editing process would center on the establishing of a "canon", a selection of Tolkienian ideas that are internally consistent and compatible with the samples of Elvish occurring in the LotR. The editors would not necessarily try to eliminate minor, unimportant variations (as when the Quenya word for "8" variously appears as <i>tolto</i> and <i>toldo</i>). A comprehensive wordlist would be worked out, to determine what concepts Tolkien's vocabulary covers (and what words are "missing"). Tolkien's own decisions and revisions would almost invariably be respected (as when he at one point rejected <i>cainen</i> as the Quenya word for "10", replacing it with <i>quain</i>, though he had been using <i>cainen</i> for decades).</p>
<p>Once a "canon" had been established, material incompatible with it would either be edited to agree with it, or (for this particular purpose) ignored. The editing in question would often only involve straightforward phonological "updating"; this is particularly relevant in the case of "Noldorin" as the earlier version of Sindarin. For instance, many examples from Sindarin and Noldorin show that the former has <i>r</i>- where the latter had <i>rh</i>- (unvoiced R); also, the diphthong <i>oe</i> in Noldorin is seen to correspond to Sindarin <i>ae</i>. Therefore, some editors feel free to transform a Noldorin form like <i>rhoeg</i> ("wrong") into Sindarin *<i>raeg</i>: Wholesale phonological "updating" of Noldorin material already occurs in <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Salo_8c0a.html" title="David Salo">David Salo</a>'s works. (It should be noted that most Noldorin words seem to fit the structure of Sindarin with no changes whatsoever.)</p>
<p>The "core" of normalized Neo-Eldarin would thus consist of a <i>primary selection of Tolkien material</i> that is accorded canonical (or normative) status, supplemented with material that can be made to agree with the "canon" after being subjected to a minimum of editing. Material that would have to be so heavily edited that its Tolkienian status would be compromised, would rather be ignored altogether.</p>
<p>Neo-Eldarin enthusiasts tend to assume that the sum total of Tolkien's linguistic manuscripts would provide options sufficient to compile develop a fairly "complete" grammar. Tolkien noted that he had developed these languages "in some completeness" (<i>The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien</i>, p. 175), though it remains to be seen what this really meant from his own perspective.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Eldarin vocabulary is likely to remain deficient. While thousands of words are readily available, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Tolkien_6f84.html" title="Christopher Tolkien">Christopher Tolkien</a> notes as surprising the fact that his father "was so little concerned to make comprehensive vocabularies of the Elvish tongues" (The Lost Road p. 342). Many animals, tools, substances etc. never received any Tolkien-made Eldarin designations. The author developed these tongues for his own pleasure, not as means of communication, so he did not need a "complete" vocabulary.</p>
<p>Even after establishing a "normative core" of Tolkienian material (edited or not), would-be cultivators of Eldarin would therefore have to supplement it with newly-coined words. As presently envisioned and to some extent already practiced, this does not involve completely random invention with no basis whatsoever in Tolkien's original work. Tolkien's Elvish language family is logically derived from a "Primitive Eldarin" tongue supposed to have been spoken in the pre-historic period of his invented world. He listed a great number of primitive "roots" belonging to this language, used such roots as the basis for "primitive words", and then derived their form in the later Elvish tongues by implementing systematic sound-changes: By simulating the effects of thousands of years of linguistic development in his notes, he could work out the different branches of the Elvish language family.</p>
<p>The Eldarin system of derivation can be reconstructed from thousands of examples, and scholars also believe they have figured out the sets of sound-changes that are used to "produce" Quenya and Sindarin. Some researchers therefore feel able to copy Tolkien's method for deriving new words. The primitive "roots" listed by Tolkien are so numerous and so varied in meaning that it will normally be possible to coin some plausible "primitive" word for a missing concept, and then apply the established sound-laws to derive the forms this word would assume in Quenya and Sindarin. The result is a word that "could have" existed within Tolkien's linguistic framework. If one regards the Elven-tongues only as features of his invented world, such post-Tolkien additions are the equivalent of <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_fiction.html" title="Fan fiction">fan fiction</a>. Many Neo-Eldarin cultivators would rather say they are trying to develop the languages as such, irrespective of the fictional context that only Tolkien could rightly define.</p>
<p>Other methods have also been employed to extend available Eldarin vocabulary without losing touch with Tolkien's original work. Currently, no Quenya verb "to choose" is attested, but <i>cilmë</i> occurs as the noun "choice", and noting that the -<i>më</i> is an ending used to derive abstract nouns, scholars may isolate *<i>cil</i>- as a very likely candidate for the verb "to choose". (Compare such an attested couple as <i>melmë</i> and <i>mel</i>-: "love" as noun and verb, respectively.) Lacking a verb "to think", writers may isolate the probable verbal stem *<i>sana</i>- from Tolkien's noun <b>sanar</b> "thinker" (since -<i>r</i> is an ending used to derive agent nouns).</p>
<p>These would be examples of words that are "deconstructed"; conversely, Tolkien's mechanisms of derivation may also be actively employed to construct new words. There is, for instance, no attested Quenya adjective meaning "visible", but there is the verb <i>cen</i>- "to see" and the derivational ending -<i>ima</i>, usually combined with lengthening of the stem-vowel of the root it is added to. This pattern corresponds to English "-able"; hence some would derive <i>cénima</i> as a possible word for "seeable" = "visible".</p>
<p>Sometimes a certain word is attested in <i>one</i> of Tolkien's two main Elvish languages, but not in the other. Since the Elvish languages are meant to be related, being derived from a single primitive tongue, it is possible to extrapolate the likely cognate in the other language. For instance, in Quenya the verb "to dance" is attested as <i>lilta</i>-, derived from a root <i>LILT</i> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lost_Road_1ef8.html" title="The Lost Road">The Lost Road</a> p. 369). No Sindarin verb "to dance" is attested, but the cognate of the Quenya form would be *<i>liltha</i>-.</p>
<p>Such extrapolation is of course not an exact science; not all Quenya and Sindarin words are direct cognates of one another. Prior to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, no Sindarin noun "name" was attested; the best guess of Neo-Eldarin writers would have been *<i>ess</i> as the cognate of Quenya <i>essë</i>. As it turns out, Tolkien in one Sindarin text used the word <i>eneth</i> for "name"; this seems to reflect another root altogether.</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainties, Neo-Sindarin writers typically feel that using such extrapolated forms is infinitely better than simply coining "missing" words out of thin air, since there would then be no connection whatsoever to Tolkien's original work.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-22_b389.html" title="Edit section: Criticism and controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criticism and controversy</span></h2>
<p>A certain amount of controversy attaches to Neo-Eldarin efforts, especially a large-scale project to develop useable, normalized languages. Tolkien-linguists whose angle on the whole study is primarily academic may see such a project as an unwelcome distraction. In their view, "updating" and "editing" the material (like transforming Noldorin <i>rhoeg</i> into extrapolated Sindarin *<i>raeg</i>) would be quite unwarranted tampering with the authentic Tolkienian evidence. Neo-Eldarin supporters may respond that such efforts are in no way intended to supplant or supercede the original sources, least of all for the purpose of academic studies. They merely want to suggest what a <i>possible</i> normalized version of Tolkien's Elvish could look like, if one wants to compose in such a language. Even if they decide to ignore certain manuscripts altogether (because the ideas expressed are incompatible with a normalized grammar), this does not imply any spiteful "rejection" of these ideas as inherently inferior.</p>
<p>Some claim that even for scholarly and academic purposes, normalized versions of Quenya and Sindarin would be useful. New students could then study tidied-up versions of these languages and get an impression of their general structure before they try to tackle the potentially daunting complexities of the primary sources with their many layers of shifting ideas. In a similar vein, ancient languages like <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Norse_cc89.html" title="Old Norse">Old Norse</a> are often taught in a normalized version that is quite idealized compared to the actual ancient manuscripts and inscriptions. Critics may argue that the never-ending changes in Tolkien's conception of his languages are an integral part of his work on them, so that a normalized version would be a quite artificial construct.</p>
<p>Comparisons have been made with the <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silmarillion.html" title="Silmarillion">Silmarillion</a>, a book Christopher Tolkien edited together from manuscripts of varying age, even writing certain paragraphs himself. It was still published and received as his father's work. People supporting a Neo-Eldarin standard may therefore argue that even if editors produce normalized versions of Quenya and Sindarin (even supplementing Tolkien's original work with newly-derived words), the resulting tongues may still be thought of as being essentially the languages Tolkien invented. Critics may reject the analogy, feeling that editing a book is something quite different from normalizing a language. (Also, Christopher Tolkien later expressed doubts about whether producing a unified <i>Silmarillion</i> was the right thing to do; he came to regret some of his editing decisions.)</p>
<p>Tolkien himself wrote that "of interest to some, and agreeable to me" would be "an historical grammar of <i>Quenya</i> and <i>Sindarin</i> and a fairly extensive etymological vocabulary of these languages" (<i>The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien</i>, p. 381). He never got around to publishing such a work, but if he had, it would presumably have presented "definite" versions of the languages. Supporters of Neo-Eldarin may cite this as evidence that Tolkien was not in principle opposed to such "standard" versions. However, he obviously meant that it was he himself, and not some later editor, that would write the grammar envisioned.</p>
<p>As for post-Tolkien compositions, controversies continue as to whether Tolkien's languages either can or should have any existence beyond the author's own life, and outside the invented world associated with them. Some critics refuse to recognize any post-Tolkien Eldarin composition as "authentic" Quenya or Sindarin, even if all the vocabulary is Tolkien-made and the grammar employed is quite uncontroversial.</p>
<p>For instance, there are probably few Tolkien-linguists (of any camp) who would deny that <i>i Elda lendë i ciryanna</i> is a plausible way of expressing "the Elf went to the ship" in Quenya. Some would still refuse to call this authentic Quenya, since to them "authentic" means "written by Tolkien" and nothing else. Neo-Eldarin authors may claim that to the extent it is possible to reconstruct and understand the structure of Tolkien's languages, it must also be possible to actively use this knowledge to write fresh texts in them. Discussions tend to degenerate into hair-splitting arguments about what is meant by the word "authentic" in such a context.</p>
<p>A few critics regard post-Tolkien attempts to write in his languages as some sort of forgery, and from this perspective it is quite irrelevant how accurately a text may seem to reproduce Tolkien's grammar. Tolkien-linguist Patrick Wynne thus remarks that "skillful counterfeits are, in the end, just as phony as clumsy ones" (from a posting to the Elfscript list, March 28, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>). If this very negative assessment is seen as representing one extreme in the range of opinions, the other extreme would be the belief that qualified Tolkien-linguists can produce texts that are every bit as authentic and normative as Tolkien's own. The more common attitude among Neo-Eldarin writers would rather be that even though they do their best to reproduce Tolkien's Elvish, they make no grandiose claims of total success. The very fact that writers try to closely emulate the patterns observed in Tolkien's texts has made some claim that Neo-Eldarin is hampered by "the dead hand of classicism", but writers obviously have no other authority they can turn to.</p>
<p>Focusing on the languages as they exist "synchronically" and trying to develop (semi-)useable forms of Quenya and Sindarin is dismissed by some as a project that little resembles Tolkien's own work. Christopher Tolkien notes that "my father was perhaps more interested in the processes of change than he was in displaying the structure and use of the languages at any given time" (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lost_Road_1ef8.html" title="The Lost Road">The Lost Road</a>, p. 342). If so one could argue that a project which focuses on the "final" version of the languages (rather than their evolution through ages of imaginary time) would differ significantly from Tolkien's own perspective: The focus would shift from diachronic to synchronic linguistics.</p>
<p>Neo-Eldarin practitioners may respond that no one is obliged to consider these languages only from only the angle Tolkien himself possibly preferred. Moreover, the more accomplished among them do study and appreciate "the processes of change" Tolkien envisioned, actively using this knowledge to derive new words from his Primitive Elvish roots. Enthusiasts may indeed be committed to preserving the interrelationship between Quenya and Sindarin that Tolkien intended, developing their Neo-Eldarin incarnations in parallel to make sure they do not become a mismatched couple.</p>
<p>Since grammar must be reconstructed from relatively few Tolkien examples, many conclusions must remain tentative, but for Neo-Eldarin purposes a certain grammatical theory may be treated as "fact" and used as the basis for new texts. At the same time, it must be remembered that it is only a "theory" if one is studying Tolkien's languages from an academic angle. A potential criticism of Neo-Eldarin is therefore that it can lead the unwary to believe that certain theories are actually well-established facts.</p>

<p>Ballet of Baltazar de Beaujoyeulx. Worms of the father Chesnaye, chaplain of the King. Instrumental music, the bass player and lutist Lambert of Baulieu, and François Cajetan, a disciple of of Baïf which said to compose a “measured” music. Vocal music of Jacques Salmon, cantor and manservant of the King. Decorations of Jacques Shoe, painter of the King. Beaujoyeulx conceived its ballet as a total work of art in which were to mix in a harmonious way the disciplines which were the dance, the music and poetry. The Ballet was conceived like a spoken and sung action. In its introduction, Beaujoyeulx wrote: One should not all allot to the ballet without making wrong to the comedy… Thus, I animated and made speak the ballet and reason the comedy and, adding to it several rare and rich representations and ornaments, I then to say to have satisfied in a body well proportioned the eye, the ear and the understanding.</p>

<p>MIster Tsunami and Mister Bamboo have been on many adventures across the tiny abandoned rock known as St. Croix. These heroes have done many many epic quests such as putting marks on pictures, jumping off high objects, doing stupid stuff, and attacking small kittens. The highlight of these men's lives was when they saved 2506 tiny midgets from a burning hospital in SUnny Isles. Little did they know, the midgets were LAND GNOMES. Being land gnomes, they quickly attacked throwing spears, and other gnomes at the two. Our heroes quickly fought off the gnomes and returned home to their dojo where they found the area infested with the MACHINES. This is where their life mision was to protect the one called kittums.</p>

<p>Reyn Ouwehand (born 2 August 1973) grew up in a village called <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katwijk_aan_Zee_660b.html" title="Katwijk aan Zee">Katwijk aan Zee</a> situated at the coast of <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holland.html" title="Holland">Holland</a>.

He studied 2 major courses: piano and 'toegepaste electronica' which is a study for studio-engineering and synthesizer-programming. In the mean time Reyn was busy making music for videogames for the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_64.html" title="Commodore 64">Commodore 64</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amiga.html" title="Amiga">Amiga</a> from 1988 till 1991 but stopped when he continued his studies at the conservatory in Rotterdam at the age of 19.</p>
<p>In 1995 Reyn founded his own company called Prevue Productions and built his first studio. From then on his main focus was production work for record-companies.

<p>'Sliver' is the name of a creature type in the card game, Magic: The Gathering. Like some other creature types, 'Sliver' identifies that the card will have a certain mechanic - in this case, the "Sliver mechanic."</p>
<p>The "Sliver mechanic" is an ability which is structured like this:<br />
"All Slivers [gain ability]", or an ability which otherwise applies to all Slivers at all times. The Sliver mechanic applies to the Sliver it's on, as well as all other Slivers, even your opponent's.</p>
<p>The only exceptions as of the release of Dissension, are Sliver Queen, Sliver Overlord and Metallic Sliver. The Queen and Overlord have abilities which relate to Slivers but don't share this ability with all other Slivers. Metallic Sliver was simply an artifact creature which had the type Sliver and no abilities.</p>
<p>Because Slivers became exponentially more powerful as more entered play, they clearly rewarded the building of a "Sliver deck". Undoubtedly, there are a group of Sliver fans waiting for their return, rumoured in an article by Mark Rosewater.</p>

<p>The Fomorii were the sea gods in Irish myths, who were extremely violent and misshapen. They are described as having only one eye, one hand, or one foot. It is said that the Fomorii emerged from the waves of the ocean and challenged the rulers of Ireland, the Firbolg and the Tuatha De Danann. It was the Tuatha De Danann, who defeated them in battle.</p>

<p>Brooklyn is the southernmost neighborhood of Baltimore City, and is named after its counterpart in New York City because both communities are across a body of water from the city's downtown area. Brooklyn is a traditional blue-collar neighborhood and is home to 9,500 Baltimore City residents. Many residents work at the multitude of factories, import/export facilities of the Port of Baltimore, or other industrial plants in the surrounding area. Brooklyn has a mix of single-family homes, duplexes, and rowhomes.</p>

<p>In the Northern part of New Jersey, in the Ramapo Mountains, right near the New York State line, live people who used to be called the Jackson Whites. Good luck trying to trace their origins, too: their surnames would indicate they're Dutch, but come from a mixed grouping of people that include African-Americans, Native Americans, and Europeans, possibly of both Dutch and Hessian descent. The name comes from the old way of referring to hill people/freed slaves as "Jacks," and was likely a combination of "Jacks" and "Whites." These days, they prefer to be referred to as "Ramapo Mountain People."</p>
<p>Concentrated around the Mahwah area, historical articles about the group suggest they'd developed their own dialect mixing English and Dutch; other legends suggest they're a mix of prostitutes who wandered off to an area that was thought sympathetic to outsiders. As is typical of secluded types, most of what has been written about them-at least some decades ago -- is of the fantastical variety rather than based in any sort of reality, suggesting that they're something less than human beings.</p>
<p>By most accounts, however, they were indeed quite private, guarding their mountainous territory vigilantly. America is full of clannish types, but the idea of such a group existing, even all the way through to the 1970s, in an area just thirty miles from teeming, overrun New York City, in some ways, is indeed a bit strange.</p>

<p>The Tryptamine Experience (or T.E. for short) is a one man electronic music project who mastered his own style entitled "Deathtronica". Blending Ambience, horror themes, drum and base, and experimental styles John Richard Putignano Jr. is the driving force.</p>
<p>The project began in 2001, under the name "The Rabbi Hitler" in Seekonk MA while he was in foster care. His first release was entitled "Get up and Sit down". A bizzare 100 song demo of weird electronic/techno mix. Many releases were to follow including more notable releases such as "Helter Skelter is coming down fast", "The Original Drug Child" and "World of Rot" which was a soundtrack for a movie never to exist.</p>
<p>Early on,T.E. recieved much criticism about musical content. Horror movie and Third Reich samples were rampant and the name "Deathtronica" was first coined by John during an experience on the designer drug "Foxy".</p>
<p>T.E. has gone through many musical changes, releasing almost two dozen releases. Currently in the works is "Endogenous" and John describes the cd as "More atmospheric, and much more serious. I decided to take a more mature route for the Tryptamine Experience is a forever evolving project"</p>

<p>Takamaka Bay Rum is the first privatly owned distillery in Seychelles to export their product, started by Richard and Bernard d'Offay in 2002, Takamaka Bay has become the most popular Rum in Seychelles and achieved almost cult like status amoung tourists and regional countries!</p>
<p>Takamaka Bay exports it's three products, Takamaka Bay Dark Rum, Takamaka Bay White Rum and Takamaka Bay Coco to South Africa as well as Europe.</p>
<p>Richard and Bernard d'Offay are originally from the Seychelles but went to school in South Africa, their family was one of the first six family's to settle in Seychelles in the late 1700s! They continued to holiday in Seychelles as children and always felt a strong bond with the island.</p>
<p>“Distilling has always been in our family.” As children the brothers would watch their grandfather distil small amounts of rum to sell to friends in Seychelles.</p>
<p>“I was always blown away by what you could create from nothing.”</p>
<p>After completing school – Richard at Victoria Park and Bernard d'Offay at Woodridge – Richard and Bernard both studied marketing at P.E Technikon, Richard then left P.E and was working in London when Bernard phoned him with the idea of opening a distillery in the Seychelles.</p>
<p>“I thought: What did we know about rum? But I went to the Seychelles to investigate the possibility and started applying for licences and lobbying government ministries for support.”</p>
<p>“In the meanwhile Bernard was working on getting the rum blend right. He is the distiller and trained in Sweden and England.” The first bottle was produced in March 2002 with the distillery a success right from the start.</p>
<p>From distilling, bottling and labelling their products themselves, the D’Offay brothers now have an automatic bottling line and bigger stills and can produce up to 20 000 bottles a month.</p>
<p>The rum’s unique flavour epitomises its origin. “It reflects what the Seychelles is about. Everywhere you go there are palm trees, fruit and vanilla trees with a smell of cinnamon in the air.”</p>
<p>To take your rum like a true Seychellois, drink it on ice with freshly squeezed lemon and sugar.</p>
<p>“It’s the spirit of the Seychelles.”</p>

<p>Retail and consumer foreign exchange transactions in most countries use a price quotation system. This means that a foreign currency is quoted in terms of the local currency of the dealer. For example, if an individual asks a bank in Canada for a rate on dollars, the dealer tells the customer how many Canadian Dollars equal one US dollar. That is, the dealer quotes US dollars against Canadian dollars. The US dollar is the foreign currency and the Canadian dollar is the local currency of the dealer for the Canadian bank. USD 1.00 = CAD 1.48</p>

<p>When was the last occasion you ate a fatal poison? It was probably the last meal you just ate packed with harmful pesticides. If you just ate some conventional peaches, apples, strawberries, nectarines, pears, cherries, red raspberries, imported grapes, spinach, bell peppers, celery, potatoes, or hot peppers, those are the most contaminated. (www.downtoearth.org) Did you know that 63% of Americans eat conventional foods loaded with harmful pesticides? (www.ota.com) The remaining 37% eat organic food at least most of their day. Though I’m thinking that it’d be better to be in the 37 percentile.</p>
<p>If you recently ate a conventional apple, that apple had 20 to 30 artificial poisons on its skin, even after rinsing. (www.organicfood.co.uk) The UK Soil Association reported that 50 to 93 percent of pesticides remained on potatoes, apples and broccoli after washing. (www.organicfood.co.uk) To add to that if you had a salad with conventional lettuce that lettuce was sprayed with pesticides 25 times before harvest and before the time it reached your mouth. (www.organicfood.co.uk)</p>
<p>Why is this so alarming? Because food is very important in the American lifestyle and most don’t pay attention to these facts (www.organicfood.co.uk)! Unfortunately the food some Americans (www.organicfood.co.uk) choose is not the best for them. Some don’t choose foods with adequate nutritional value, don’t eat correct, or they eat a high number of foods sprayed with harmful chemicals, also known as conventional foods. (www.organicfood.co.uk) Did you know that currently about 500 additives are used in the conventional farming process? Some of which have been linked to allergic reactions (www.organicfood.co.uk), headaches, asthma, hyper ness in children, heart disease and osteoporosis to name a few. Examples of these additives include aspartame, colorings, and monosodium glutamate, or MSG (www.downtoearth.org). Aspartame can be found in sugar free gum (www.organicfood.co.uk) and no calorie sweeteners. MSG can be found in some potato chips, Asian foods, beef jerky, and other foods. (Janae Mcvean, 2006) Organic food is defined as food produced without the use of artificial pesticides, herbicides, and in many definitions genetically modified organisms or GMO’s. (www.organicfood.co.uk) GMO’s are foods that have been genetically changed, which means that their genetic makeup (www.organicfood.co.uk) has been altered by technology. (www.wikipedia.org) Two examples of that would be now they are making salmon that are genetically engineered to make their mouths bigger so they can eat more to make them fatter. Also they are making rice with higher content of Beta Carotene. (Interview Tim Cunningham 2006) Beta Carotene is a form of carotene which the body converts into vitamin A. (www.dictionary.com) Too much of anything can be harmful to your body which is why this could be a problem. So now your asking, “Well why does that matter?” because conventional foods just don’t harm your body (www.organicfood.co.uk), but the people who harvest them. Did you know that intensive farming could seriously damage a conventional farm workers health? It’s true! There is a higher instance of cancer, respiratory problems and other major diseases in farm workers on non-organic farms. (www.organicfood.co.uk) Animals and the environment are also harmed through conventional farming. Did you know non-organic pigs are routinely taken from their mothers after birth and given antibiotics? Also non-organic chickens are kept in crammed and tight conditions and are pumped full of hormones and antibodies! (www.organicfood.co.uk) However organic cows are a different story. On my milk carton, yes my milk carton, it lists four different steps on how to raise an organic cow so I’ll list the most important one. “Keep her healthy the old fashioned way, with a clean environment and attentive natural and homeopathic care – NO antibiotic drugs.” (My Horizon Organic milk carton). Moreover on that subject these are the words of the author of the web page www.organic(www.organicfood.co.uk)food.co.uk, Ysanne Spevack, “…if you simply like the idea of your children and grandchildren being able to visit the countryside and play in the forests and fields just like we did when we were young, go organic for the sake of all of our futures!” (www.organicfood.co.uk). Did you know that if only ¾% of conventional cropland went organic, it would be equal to taking 1,174,400 cars off the road, and that’s only three fourths! (Food to Live By, Earthbound Organic Brochure, 2004) Also the fertilizers and pesticides used in the soils of conventional farming have been identified as major sources of pollution of natural springs and aquifers. ( (www.organicfood.co.uk) Taste Life, The Organic Choice, David Richard) Organic and conventional foods both have their good things and their bad things. For example a bad thing about organic food is the cost. However there is evidence that if all indirect costs of conventional foods were factored into the price of the food, organic food would cost the same maybe even cheaper than conventional food. Also the prices of organic products reflect the actual cost of productions because organic growers don’t receive the same amo(www.organicfood.co.uk)unt of government support that conventional farms do. So really your paying extra for the intensive labor put into farming organic foods. (www.downtoearth.org) Also the availability of organic foods is another bad thing. I know this for a fact because there are only two certified organic grocery stores in Amarillo! (www.organicfood.co.uk) Which means that all produce is organic and there is no conventional produce. Tim Cunningham who is the nutritional guide at Eat Rite Heath Food Store said, “ Yes, I think that we should (www.organicfood.co.uk) have a wider variety of organic food choices.” (Interview Tim Cunningham 2006) As I’ve been mentioning, organic food has many more positives than negatives. For example, better taste was found (Interview Tim Cunningham 2006) and higher nutritional value. (Interview Tim Cunningham 2006) Actually, organically grown potatoes, oranges, and leafy vegetables have more vitamin C than conventionally grown products. (www.wikipedia.org) Also it’s mentioned that organic food contains on average 50% more vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and other nutrients than conventionally farmed produce. (www.organicfood.co.uk) (www.organicfood.co.uk) Contrary to what I have been mentioning, conventional foods also have their good things as well. (www.organicfood.co.uk) They are available in any non-organic super markets, they are cheaper, and there is more variety. Nevertheless my opinion stays the same, I personally choose organic. (www.organicfood.co.uk)</p>
<p>Before I end my paper, I would like to state one thing. By reading this paper you have probably learned a lot of things about what people put into their bodies. Now I’m not saying that you should drop the grapes and strawberries and run to Eat Rite, I’m saying that maybe we should all consider about what we are putting into our bodies and the quantities of conventional food we are consuming. American’s (www.organicfood.co.uk) can take action in a healthier eating lifestyle through eating right and eating foods not sprayed with harmful chemicals also known as organic. Eating a variety of organic foods can be a simple way to just be safer and healthier! (www.organicfood.co.uk)</p>

<p>Born in 1979, Neal Jandreau and his two brothers grew up as "Air Force Brats" moving from place to place, including Germany and the U.S. Midwest. Finally landing in Fort Kent, Maine, Neal became a noted soccer player in both high school and college. In fact, he was kicking a soccer ball before he could properly walk.</p>
<p>It was in this small town at the top of Maine that he discovered a passion for music. Inspired by singer/songwriter Darius Rucker of Hootie and the Blowfish, in 1995 at the age of 16, he tried his hand at playing guitar. Joining a local band was next. He credits this experience with taking his life in a distinctly musical direction. "I met 4 amazing individuals and 1 kindred spirit. I am convinced that music is a stronger connection than love. We played where and when we could and grew up together and out of High School. What an experience."[1]</p>
<p>After playing with other bands during college, he started singing and writing original songs. He recorded and copyrighted "Ashamed", his first song in 2005. Along with the guitar player on "Ashamed", C.J.Theriault, he formed Still Frame. This acoustic duo played around northern Maine for several months, and lead several enthusiastic open mic sessions that involved other local musicians and college students.</p>
<p>Neal currently lives in the Portland, Maine area and works with his long time friend and musical conspirator, Jack Murray at Jack's production company Odds Are Productions.</p>
<p>"My passion for love and life is evident through my music and vocals and is what drives me to write and perform."[2]</p>

<p>v OBJECTIVES &amp; ETHOS</p>
<p>The aim of Islamic education lies beyond the borders of this world; it is to gain Paradise in the everlasting life and, ultimately, to learn the pleasure of Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. A College of moral excellence, therefore, is our primary objective where the complete personal development of the student is paramount.</p>
<p>Brondesbury College for Boys offers essential aspects of Arabic and Islamic Studies in conjunction with a broad range of Sciences, Physical Education and National Curriculum disciplines. Motivated by a team of dedicated and professional staff, the education offered at the College aims to produce mature young men with leadership qualities and the ability to contribute, as responsible citizens, to the well being of the pluralistic society as a whole.</p>
<p>The College accepts students from the ages of 11 up to 16, accessible to Muslims regardless of race, colour or status. The emphasis is on providing a healthy all-round education in a positive environment guided by the ethical and moral teachings of Islam.</p>
<p>v FACILITIES</p>
<p>The College comprises two buildings and various annexes which are well equipped with modern facilities and apparatus necessary to teach the National Curriculum up to GCSE. In the main College building, a mosque and assembly hall augments the original classic Georgian building and provides a religious focus and space for daily performance of prayers. The second building is of unique architectural design, and includes a modern well equipped laboratory, art and design lab and a further 3 classrooms, together with a purpose build dining hall. The main building houses two classrooms, a small library and up-to-date Information Technology Centre. The nearby Islamia School Centre provides the College with large gymnasium facilities, and Aylestone playing fields offer boys spacious sports grounds for outdoor activities. Class sizes are kept to a maximum of twenty-four so that as much individual attention as possible can be given to each student. For certain subjects, when appropriate, class numbers may be considerably smaller.</p>
<p>The emphasis is on providing a first-class education in a secure environment where the individual student’s development is regularly monitored and assessed. The comprehensive curriculum will prepare our students thoroughly for admission to further education institutions.</p>

<p>Location: United Kingdom of Dragonstone Regional Influence: Powerbroker</p>
<p><br />
The Empire of Ularis is a very large, safe nation, notable for its compulsory military service. Its compassionate, hard-working, cynical population of 126 million are ruled by a mostly-benevolent dictator, who grants the populace the freedom to live their own lives but watches carefully for anyone to slip up.</p>
<p>It is difficult to tell where the omnipresent, corrupt government stops and the rest of society begins, but it juggles the competing demands of Law &amp; Order, Defence, and the Environment. The average income tax rate is 72%, and even higher for the wealthy. Private enterprise is illegal, but for those in the know there is a slick and highly efficient black market in Gambling.</p>
<p>The wearing and manufacture of fur apparel is banned, a spate of enforced closures has left 'Government FM' as the nation's only radio station, the poor are often seen pale and dizzy after selling their blood to make ends meet, and anti-environmentalist protesters are gunned down without mercy. Crime -- especially youth-related -- is totally unknown, thanks to the all-pervasive police force and progressive social policies in education and welfare. Ularis's national animal is the Pyrodragon, which frolics freely in the nation's many lush forests, and its currency is the DragonBond.</p>
<p>Ularis is ranked 9th in the region and 85,900th in the world for Largest Insurance Industry.</p>

<p>William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is the co-founder, chairman, and chief software architect of Microsoft Corporation, the world's largest software company (as of April 2006). He is also the founder of Corbis, a digital image archiving company. Forbes international rich list has ranked him as the world's richest person for the last twelve straight years. In 1999, Gates' wealth briefly surpassed $100 billion, making him the world's first centibillionaire. When family wealth is considered, his family ranks second behind the Walton family.[3][4]</p>
<p>Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. He is widely respected for his intelligence, foresight, and ambition. He is also widely criticized as having built Microsoft's business through unfair, illegal, or anticompetitive business practices. Government authorities in several countries have found some of Microsoft's practices illegal, as in United States v. Microsoft.</p>
<p>Since amassing his fortune, Gates has pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors, donating large amounts of money (about 51% of his total fortune) to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, founded in 2000. He, his wife Melinda and U2's lead singer Bono were collectively named by Time as the 2005 Persons of the Year. That same year he was given an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II. In 2006, Gates Foundation was awarded the Premio Príncipe de Asturias en Cooperación Internacional.</p>

<p>Nandhanar, came from SC/ST caste (not brahman by birth). In olden days people from SC/ST are not alowed to enter Temples, but they can worship from outside. Daily, Nandhanar use to sincerely worship lord Siva from outside, but still Lord nandhiyamperuman will always sit infront of the Lord Shiva. Thus hiding the Lord Shiva. So no one can see Shiva straight by directly standing from outside the temple. But due to his sincere worship and love towards Lord Shiva, The God ordered Lord Nandhiyamperuman to move a little so that Nandhanar can view him directly. This is depicted in a temple in Thripongur (near Chidambaram). For many years he had a big interest for worshiping Siva in Main Temple in Chidambaram. But as usualy no one allowed him. At a moment an echo (obviously of Siva) stating that to drop Nandhanar in fire. So all Iyer/Gurukal did the same. After dropping him Nandhanar came again in golden colour with moopori poonool. Then he became a Brahman and now he entered the temple and mixed (attained moksham) with the holy sprit of Lord Shiva</p>

<p>The British Conservative Catholics was a spoof website created by Tobias Depson, and featuring various members of the Depson family as founder members. The earliest entry for the British Conservative Catholic website on the wayback machine is June 05 2001. The last being February 05 2005. It is thought the site finally went offline in late 2004.</p>
<p>The British Conservative Catholic website featured a hardline catholic organisation, that among other things condememned Brad Pitt as 'satanic', David Bowie for creating homosexuality, and featured various other xenophobic articles that were ludicrously right wing, and yet strangely believable.</p>
<p>The website also featured highly in the press, with their articles about Marilyn Manson appearing in Metal Hammer magazine.</p>
<p>Various members of the Depson family featured in the organisation. Deborah Depson offered hardline catholic advice to spoofed letters sent into the site. In one letter she encourages a wife to purchase an anti-erection ring to stop her husband from msturbating and in another condemns a womans daughter for dating a negro. Martin O' Connel is supposedly the founder member, with press and IT sectors being headed by Tobias and Deborah Depson in charge of administration. Gavin Depson supposedly has the rather difficult task of legal advisor.</p>
<p>The arch enemies of the BCC is the secretive Atheist Movement, which though not publicly known, is purportedly a wide netowrk aimed at limiting the BCC's power and infusing atheism into the public.</p>
<p>In addition to the articles and advice on the website, the BCC also had an online store, that featured products such as anti masturbation equipment, and books with provocative titles including Mein Kampf for children, the bible for women, and bullying tips for catholic children.</p>
<p>The BCC website eventually went down as it's hosting provider would no longer support the site. However there are various other ideas circulating around forums on the internet with regards to it's demise. Tobias himself offered full rights to the site to anyone emailing asking if they could provide hosting to replace it. It perhaps therefore can be speculated that Tobias simply got bored with the spoof after 3 years of posing as hardline right wing catholic extremist.</p>

<p>In the United States Navy, the 3rd Fleet is the fleet responsible for naval activities in the eastern and northern Pacific Ocean. It is headquartered on USS Coronado. The 3rd Fleet was initially formed on March 15, 1943 under the command of Admiral William F. Halsey, and was responsible for much of the campaigning in the Pacific theater in World War II. The fleet was put into reserve on October 7, 1945. It was reactivated February 1, 1973 at Ford Island in Pearl Harbor as part of a Pacific Fleet reorganization. 3rd Fleet took over the duties of U.S. 1st Fleet and the Pacific Anti-Submarine Warfare Force.</p>
<p>Third Fleet was originally formed during World War II on March 15, 1943 under the command of Admiral William F. “Bull” Halsey. He opened his headquarters ashore in Pearl Harbor, territory of Hawaii, on June 15, 1944. The fleet operated in and around the Solomon Islands, the Philippines, Formosa, Okinawa and the Ryukyu Islands. It also operated in Japanese waters launching attacks on Tokyo, the naval base at Kure and the island of Hokkaido.</p>
<p>Embarked aboard his flagship, USS Missouri, Admiral Halsey led his fleet into Tokyo Bay on August 29, 1945. On September 2, surrender documents ending the war were signed on her decks. Third Fleet remained in Japanese waters until late September when its ships were directed to sail for the West Coast of the United States. On October 7, 1945 Third Fleet was designated a reserve fleet and decommissioned from active status. On February 1, 1973, following a reorganization of the Pacific Fleet, the United States Third Fleet was recommissioned as an active fleet and assumed the duties of the former First Fleet and Pacific Anti-Submarine Warfare Force located at Ford Island, Hawaii. Third Fleet trains naval forces for overseas deployment and evaluates state-of-the-art technology for fleet use. Additionally, Third Fleet could deploy in the event of a major conflict.</p>
<p>On November 26, 1986, Commander, Third Fleet shifted his flag from his headquarters ashore to resume status as an afloat commander for the first time since World War II, aboard USS Coronado (AGF 11).

Al is searching for a suitable bride to bring home and impress his parents. Things do not go exactly as planned, and Al soon finds himself seeking the treasures of a long lost gold mine instead.</p>
<p>The game contains slapstick humor and is rumoured to be a comedy of errors, with many of the jokes stemming from the omnipresent God-like narrator poking fun of Al and his bumbling ways.</p>
<p>The game is expected to be somewhat similar in style to the <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leisure_Suit_Larry_07c1.html" title="Leisure Suit Larry">Leisure Suit Larry</a> series.</p>

<p>"Post Mortem": Play by Noel Coward.</p>
<p>"Post Mortem" is what can only be described as a dramatic study of war and its effects. It follows the story of soldier John Cavan who, in the moment of his death, is given the opportunity to see what the future holds for those he is leaving behind. Published in "Play Parade, Volume One", in the introduction the author claims that it was more his thoughts placed on paper rather than a play written to be performed, but nonetheless it posesses certain aspects which some might say would make an interesting and challending performance, and offers a wide range of characters and situations. It was published in 1934 with an introduction by Noel Coward saying that it "might probably be quite effective," (should it be performed)"provided that it is expertly directed and acted".</p>

<p>The Gamblers crew of Korea have become well-known for their amazing performances in Battle of the Year (BOTY) competitions and often featured in internet videos across the web due to their high level of talent. What probably makes them so well-known and loved is the fact that each of the bboys in the crew have their own unique ability used for the good of the whole team, instead of each having generic breakdancing skills like a lot of other crews.</p>
<p>For example, Bboy Bruce Lee and Bboy The End (aka KYS) are skilled powerheads; Bboy Lazer is a master headspinner, often considered one of the best bboys out there at headspinning; Soul Soy focuses on footwork and style; Bboy Sick has a unique contortionist style of bending his body in very flexible positions while he dances across the floor; Bboy Darkness is widely considered one of the best bboys at doing freezes such as handstands and airchairs--often compared to France's own Bboy Junior. The list of the crew's individual talents goes on and on, due to the fact that more and more members seem to be popping up!</p>
<p>The crew have currently opened up a breakdancing school in South Korea and are becoming more and more popular by the day. Bboy Darkness, also caled "The One", is credited for making most of the videos and photographs of the group for promotional purposes. It is said that without his dedication to his crew, Gamblers wouldn't be as popular as they are today.</p>

<p>Lindsay Ballard was born May 7th, 1986 in Wichita, KS. She was immediately given away for adoption due to her love of the hated sudoku and making everything awkward. She was eventually shipped overseas and was adopted by a viking family in Hungary. Lindsay was very bitter about be given up for adoption. She decided to get back at her family by becoming the best Horseshoe Player in the history of the game (some say Hungary was actually the original site of Horseshoes). Ballard quickly became the best horseshoe player ever. Mainly because there are only about 6 people in the world that play horseshoes. After dominating the game for several years she moved on to puzzles. Lindsay Ballard loves puzzles. She is desperately looking for heated competitions for solving puzzles which include Sudoku, Word Search, Chicktionary, Crosswords, Cryptoquip, and long division problems.</p>
<p>Lindsay Ballard moved back to Wichita in the late '90s and really tore up the puzzle scene, but she remained true to her roots and made everybody feel awkward. She graduated from Bishop Carroll in 2004 after reuniting with her parents. Once her parents saw how amazing she was at horseshoes and UNO (see next paragraph) they decided they could look past all the awkwardness and reading, and puzzles.</p>
<p>Today Lindsay Ballard attends KU and plays UNO. In April she was declared best uno player ever. It is said that she wins roughly 73% of the games she plays. The amazing thing about her uno skills is she doesn't even like UNO, she plays to kill time while at work. She does enjoy her job but not her co-workers. Ballard cringes at the site of them. Ballard works at INTRUST Bank where she is a lead teller.</p>
<p>Random Facts about Ballard: She is powered by Dr. Pepper. She has a "SUDOKU RULEZ" tattoo and her shoulder blade. Her favorite activity (besides puzzles) is climbing trees. Ballard despises dogs.</p>

The site was a general entertainment site and the company using the name 'Bukark-u-later' created a wide selection of games for the PC, many of which were available for free download.

<p><a href="../../../y/o/k/Yoke.html" title="Yoke">Yoke</a> A yoke is when a nigger takes their hand and lightly grabs the back of another persons head and pulls back and off of the head. This is not meant to hurt the person just to be a type of entertainment. It is used for no real reason, just a way to entertain. Some use it when a person says something dumb or irrelevant. After "yoking" someone, you must get overly excited to add to the humor. Yoking is also customizable, some like to do a basketball move and then follow up with a yoke, someone who yokes should find their own personal way of doing it. Go ahead, yoke somebody. This was created by a group of students at Clinton High School in Clinton, MS.</p>

<p>Rapt clothing came about as a result of two individuals’ desire to provide people with quality clothing and designs that are rooted in the unconventional. We stand in solidarity with social, political, cultural and spiritual consciousness: one which is neither bold nor underlined, but rather figurative. 2005 is the birth year for the small company with sound ambitions. We will proudly strive to produce pieces that are multi-leveled and ever changing. Funk and class, the powerful and the subtle, the serious and the fun meet on the crossroads called Rapt.<br />
The word “rapt” means to be absorbed or captivated by an event or a moment. We find ourselves constantly seeking aesthetic moments in life that evoke overwhelming emotions, move us in an incomprehensible fashion, and challenge our sense of self. It is the texture of these experiences that inspire our designs. We invite you to view our 2005 collection, hoping that you might become rapt yourselves.</p>

<p>Riverside High School is a public four-year traditional high-school in El Paso's Ysleta Independent School District. The school serves several neighborhoods in El Paso's Lower Valley (sometimes called the Mission Valley). The school opened in 1968 and had its first graduating class in 1973. A 4A school, Riverside has about 1,400 students, most of whom are Mexican-American.</p>
<p>Riverside has a magnet program called the Socratic Institute that caters to students interested in pursuing a career in pedagogy. Riverside is also home to the district's Academy of Science and Technology. The school also began the now defunct CyberInstitute that catered to students interested in computer information. The Ysleta school district is currently studying the idea of creating a law enforcement magnet program. Riverside has had a long history of academic success. At one point, the school was the public high school sending the most Hispanic students to Ivy League universities. Riverside graduates are often accepted to other top universities like Stanford, MIT, Rice and the top public universities in the state of Texas.</p>
<p>Athletically, the Riverside Rangers have arguably given the city of El Paso the most media recognition in prep sports in the last 20 years. The basketball and baseball teams have reached the Final Four in the state tournament (the only teams in the city to achieve this feat recently) and the football team is the only El Paso team to reach the state regional semi-finals two straight years. The varsity football team has not lost a district game in six years and has qualified for the playoffs every year for more than a decade.</p>
<p>Riverside has also had top music programs, dance teams, cheeerleading squads and forensic teams.</p>

<p>It is known as Bladebreakers are the best team in the Beyblade world. A boy, Tyson Granger(Takao Kinomiya in Japanese anime)wants to be the leader of the team. But it was decided by Mr. Dickenson. For that, at his decision he made Kai Hiwatari as the leader and the coach. whereas, Kai is very selfish and always cares about his own tactics. Once, he was also the leader of the Bladesharks(a mysterious group of bladers who defeats opponent and steal their beyblades). Also in the team there were Ray Kong(Rei Con) and Max Tate(Max Mizuhara). Ray is a Chinese boy came from the team The White Tigers. He is also the rival Kai. He is one of the powerful and determined blader beside, Tyson and Kai. Comparing Ray, Max is a American boy who plays beyblades for fun. He loves Kai's speed tactics in beystadiums. And at last, there is a boy named Kenny also known as the "chief". He uses his laptop to create and find databases of beyblades. In the season 2, V Force, they were the world champions. and Kai was most friendly to them. That time a girl called Hilary joined them. She has a crush has on Tyson and also his classmate. At the last season they broke up and joined their own ountry teams. As a sub for rest of the player Tyson got Daichi who was always wanting a rematch to defeat. And Tyson's big brother Hiro Granger(Hitoshi Kinomiya) AKA Jin of Gale(Shippu No Jin) came to coach them.

<p><b>DUMB-DUMB'S AND DRAGONS</b> Billy is upset because he is not a hero. Grim tells him that if he wishes to be a hero, he could slay a dragon. Billy is transported to the past where he meets someone who looks like Hoss Delgado who will train him to fight the last dragon in the area. Billy, unfortunetly, becomes friends with the dragon. When the dragon becomes sick, Billy's trainer says it is the perfect chance to slay him. Billy has a flashback of all the fun he had and decided not to.</p>
<p><b>FEAR AND LOATHING IN ENDSVILLE</b> Grim decides to visit his childhood idol, Dracula. Dracula wants to go to the early bird special and insists on driving. When the car tips into a large crack in the desert, they go on on foot (Featuring a country singer constantly singing about angry women). They are picked up by a fat man who makes arts and crafts from fingernails (and sometimes toenails.) Dracula threatens to steal his book idea and the driver gets mad and says the only thing that will calm him down is "the game" (Connect Four). Grim notices that no one is driving the truck after another game one by the nail-crazed driver and the truck tips into the same crack their car did. The driver heads off on his own, leaving Grim and Dracula by themselves. Will they make it?</p>

<p><b>Lifewaltz</b> is a webcomic written by Richard McCann and Rob Mitchell, who more commonly refer to themselves as Rico and Mitch, respectively. Production of these comics is inconsistent, writers aim to get a new one up every monday. Officially, <i>Lifewaltz</i> has been going since 2005, but the original comics started a few years earlier, albeit with a slightly different team.</p>
<p>The comics follow two characters pretty much based on the writers. Their adventures are often confined to their house, and despite a surreal tendency, are often based on real life events or circumstances Rico and Mitch find themselves in.</p>

<p>1) The Concept - With Normal integrals, we are trying to find an area under a curve. With double integrals, we are trying to find a volume under a curve, within a rectangle R. We have dA, which is the product of dx and dy, and a height z, which varies with dx and dy. The more integrals we have, the more dimensions we deal with. Needless to say, the concept begins to grow more complex at the third integral. (5-10 mins?)</p>
<p>2) Real-life Applications - Can be used to calculate</p>
<dl>
<dd>Center of mass of objects with uneven density</dd>
<dd>Average snowfall over a state</dd>
</dl>
<p>Use your imagination (and the textbook) here. (5 mins)</p>
<p>3) Solving a simple multiple integral equation: Show how one solves a simple equation, then present another problem for the class to solve (then solve it...). (15-20 mins)</p>
<p>4) Describe tricks and techniques to solve more difficult equations (optional - 5, 10 minutes)</p>

<p>Sometimes <i>Lifewaltz</i> follows a story arc, but this is usually interrupted by a more random issue that breaks away from the chain of events or is a simple one-off gag (such as the <a href="http://www.lifewaltz.com/comicview.php?start=28" class="external text" title="http://www.lifewaltz.com/comicview.php?start=28" rel="nofollow">parody of the iPod commercial</a>, arbitarily inserted into the <i>Monkey Paintball</i> story, or a piece of fan work). The writers have expressed their dislike for these story arcs. Each strip also includes commentaries from the authors, although Mitch's comments box is, more often than not, empty. Fans of the series will note that this reflects the inherent laziness of his character.</p>
<p>They also make numerous references to their favourite video games, films, comics, books, television shows and technologies.</p>

<p>Sepermeru was the religious capital of the 19th Nome of Upper Egypt, located on an irrigation canal near the general entrance to the Fayuum Oasis. This outpost settlement was situated roughly mid-way between Oxyrhynchos (Per Medjed) to the south and Herakleopolis to the north. According to ancient taxation records and other pertinent sources, Sepermeru was a noted settlement for active and retired military personnel and their familes, particularly during the New Kingdom reign of the Rameses pharaohs. Agriculture was also practiced here. The chief deities of the town were the god Set and the goddess Nephthys; both of these deities were highly favored by the war-like Ramessid Dynasty of kings for their ominous, agrressive attributes. As revealed by ongoing excavations in the 1980s, two provincial temples were built in Sepermeru, existing from (at least) the 19th and 20th Dynastic periods. One temple was dedicated to Set while the other temple enclosure belonged to Nephthys. Separate, hierarchical priesthoods for both deities are named, for taxation purposes, in the Wilbour Papyrus: two "prophets" of "Set of Sepermeru" and two "prophets" and a "wa'ab" priest in the service of "Nephthys of Sepermeru" (19th and 20th Dynasties). In all likelihood, the temples were either built or considerably refurbished by Rameses III. Only the foundation stones of both temples remain today and, by Ptolemaic times, it is questionable whether the temples of Set and Nephthys (along with the settlement itself) were still occupied. Indeed, a derogatory reference to "Set of Sepermeru" on the walls of the Ptolemaic temple of Horus (at Edfu) notes that the town's canals were "dried up and forgotten" by the turn of the Common Era. This may have been a mere "hieroglyphic insult" rendered to Set, enemy of Horus, for the epithet "Set of Sepermeru" was still obviously familiar to the temple theologians. The capital of the 19th Nome had long before shifted to Oxyrhynchus in any case. Thus, it is likely that the settlement had waned considerably in significance.The history of the site, however, remains notable from an ancient Egyptian perspective because of the favor lavished by the Ramessid kings upon the temples of Nephthys and Set. Set's favor declined throughout Egypt with the downfall of these kings (except in the Delta and various northern oases), while Nephthys achieved greater popularity in her role as a goddess of the Osirian cycle, especially with temples of her own at Komir and Diospolis Parva (Hiw), where the entire 7th Upper Egyptian Nome was considered to be her particular "fiefdom" in Late Period and Greco-Roman times.</p>

<p><b>Penis Theory</b> <i>Abstract</i> Penis theory is a branch of applied masculine studies that analyzes hypothetical (yet existing) relationships in unstructured courtship. Macro penis theory is a corrolary to the Buldge/income equation, in which male desirability is a function of independent variables-- penis size and income. Beginning in April 2006, Penis theory was initially developed as a tool for understanding seemingly irrational female behavior. Derived from non-experimental reasoning, Penis theory builds from several premises resultant from an implicit hierarchy of psycho-social observations: i. Women derive sexual gratification from larger penii. ii. Wealth is an essential component of longterm male/female interaction in western society iii. The sexual revolution has limited traditional societal norms iv. The pop-culture phenomenon of Sex and the City(see Whore studies)</p>
<p>Penis theory has been applied to other social science disciplines including: macro/micro cockeconomics, critical feminism, whore studies, and theoretical buldgenomics. It has drawn attention.</p>
<p><i>History</i> Penis theory was developed by disillusioned University of California undergrads Allen Gilio and Dave Markman in April 2006.</p>

<p>Detroit native J-LYRIQ is a gritty, urban contemporary/neo-soul singer, songwriter and self taught producer. His influences range from Sam Cooke, Donny Hathaway, and Marvin Gaye to Jodeci, Brian Mcknight, and R. Kelly. Like other R&amp;B artist who have emerged in the '90s and 2000s, J-Lyriq looks to different eras for inspiration. The classic soul of the '60s and '70s impact his singing and producing, but so have the urban contemporary and hip-hop of the '80s, '90s and 2000s.</p>
<p>At times, J-Lyriq can be flat-out retro; some of his material would have been right at home on an old Motown LP from R&amp;B's pre-'80s, pre-urban contemporary, pre-hip-hop era. Other times he has a more modern, hip-hop-influenced outlook. In other words, he has some songs that are quite friendly to urban radio, and others that would be too old-school for urban radio.His goal is to not be able to be compared to any other artist.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, where he was the last of 8 children, J-Lyriq had a very musical upbringing -- one that included a steady diet of R&amp;B and soul. When he wasn't performing gospel, J-Lyriq listened to secular soul and funk -- and his favorites included Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, Donny Hathaway, and the Gap Band. As a lead in his choir he had big dreams of worldwide fame.</p>

<p>Ioannis Amanatidis was born on the 3rd December, 1981 in Kozani, Greece. He is a Greek footballer, who has served as a full Greek international.</p>
<p>Amanatidis' early career in football was unconventional, yet promising . He began playing football in Kozani with his friends (rather than with a professional club) on the streets of the town. His first experience in organised football came at the age of nine, when he moved to Germany with his family. It was at SC Stuttgart that he first laced up his boots, demonstrating a devastating instinct for scoring goals even in his early years, and becoming the leading goalscorer during his four years with the Swabian club.</p>
<p>Amanatidis has, since then, played a large majority of his football in Germany, most notable are his performances with German clubs Kaiserslautern and, of course, Stuttgart. He currently plays for Eintracht Frankfurt, and serves as one of their key frontmen in the Frankfurt strikeforce. He played a vital role for Frankfurt in the 2005/2006 season, helping them stay in the German Bundesliga, and finishing the season as the clubs highest goalscorer for the year, with 12 goals. Amanatidis also led the way in the German cup, with Frankfurt just losing out to German champions Bayern Munich in the final. Amanatidis had a chance to be the hero of the night, having his 88th minute strike off a corner parried away by keeper Oliver Kahn.</p>
<p>Despite having such a promising career ahead of him at many periods of his blossoming career, unlike many notable Greek national players, Amanatidis was left out of the Greece squad which won the 2004 Euro Final. When asking coach Otto Rehagel why he was left out, he admitted:</p>
<p>"I asked Rehhagel before the European Championship why I had been left out. He explained and I accepted it".</p>
<p>He is no doubt, in the future, going to be in the plans for Greece, and despite Greece not making the World Cup in Germany, Amanatidis has a lot to look forward to internationally. Amanatidis was also named in the Greek squad that travels down under to meet Australia on Thursday 25th, 2006, in Melbourne.</p>

<p>Born Matt Burns in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Nick Mondo quickly rose to fame in CZW (Combat Zone Wrestling) as one of its brightest stars. Making his debut in March of 1999, Nick Mondo's career, although short-lived was one of the most succesful of all those who competed in CZW. Despite giving up much in size and power to competitors such as John Zandig, Nate Hatred, The Wifebeater and Necro Butcher, Mondo was able to stand toe-to-toe with these competitors in the ring. Notable incidents from Mondo's Career include his fall of the top of the Warehouse in Delaware at Tournament of Death 2. During this 2 Out Of 3 Falls Light-Tube Log-Cabin Match. Mondo and his opponent John Zandig fell from the top of a warehouse through 4 tables and one of the Light-Tube Log-Cabins. This fall left Mondo's back badly lascerated, despite this he managed to win the match. Later that night he would also defeat Ian Rotten to win TOD2. Sadly only a few months after TOD 2 on November 10th 2003 Nick Mondo announced he was retiring due to Injury. In his four and a half year carreer Mondo had won The CZW Iron Man Title 3 times, the CZW Tag Titles with Ric Blade, the AWF championship and the NCWA Hardcore Championship, along with Tournament of Death 2. Other notable Mondo matches include Nick Mondo vs Homeless Jimmy from the original Tournament of Death, a TLC match at Cage of Death 4 between the team of Mondo and Ric Blade and The Backseat Boyz and Nick Mondo vs Nick Gage vs Nick Berk in a Tables, Ladders and Violence Match where Mondo won his 2nd CZW Iron Man belt.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-22_b389.html" title="Edit section: Order of Prince Danilo I of Montenegro">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Order of Prince Danilo I of Montenegro</span></h2>
<p>The Order of Prince Danilo I of Montenegro was the first Montenegrin state Order and was established as a single class Order by His Royal Highness Prince Danilo Petrovic on St. George's Day April 23 (May 5), 1852, as the Order of Danilo I for the Independence of Montenegro “in order to honor the courage and the accomplishments of his subjects and of all those who dedicated themselves to defend the holy thing of the fatherland independence”. The Order became dormant upon the exile of the Royal House, though with living members and is still awarded to prominent champions of the preservation of Montenegrin independence. The conditions by which the Order is awarded are defined by Statute.</p>
<p>Alterations were made to the appearance of the original decoration created by Prince Danilo and during the rule of His Majesty King Nikola I Petrovic the Order underwent two restructures. During the first restructure on St. Goerge's Day April 23 (May 5), 1861, three classes were introduced, The King introducing two upper degrees, Grand Cross and Commander, with specific insignias; the old cross becoming a third class, Knight. On April 23 (May 5), 1873, the second reorganisation of the Order expands the field of rewards to civilian merits, establishes a Grand Chancellery and adds an intermediary class of Grand Officer between those of Grand Cross and Commander. In 1893, a third reform of the statutes establishes a fourth class, resulting from a reclassification of the existing class of Knight. The old cross then became a fifth class.</p>
<p>Throughout the history of the Order, the insignia has been produced by several famous medallists, the best-known being Arthus Bertrand, Beranger &amp; Magdalaine (Paris, France), A. Chobillion (Paris, France), D. Cravanzola (Roma, Italy), R. Marschall (Vienna, Austria), Vincent Mayer (Vienna, Austria), C.F. Rothe &amp; Neffe (Vienna, Austria), A. Ryabkov (St. Petersburg, Russia), G.A. Scheid (Vienna, Austria), Silberberg (Hamburg, Germany) and presently Thomas Fattorini (Birmingham, United Kingdom).</p>
<p>Many deserving men and women have been awarded the Order of Prince Danilo I over time including foreigners. The illustrious list includes many decorated servicemen during the World Wars and a host of other notables, including Queen Victoria and King Edward VII of Great Britain, as well as being written about by F. Scott Fitzgerald in 'The Great Gatsby'.</p>
<p>The Order of Prince Danilo I is the prerogative of the Head of the Royal House of Montenegro. On November 11, 2004 in Cetinje, His Majesty King Nikola II Petrovic Njegos, Hereditary Grand Master, reformed the Order, keeping the organisation of 1873 in five classes, but renaming them into Grand Cross, Knight Commander, Knight, Lieutenant and Member. The Grand Cross class is divided in four grades: Diamond Star, Gold Star, Silver Star and Grand Cross. The Hereditary Grand Master and the Grand Chancellor of the Order both wear an additional Collar of the Order.</p>
<p>The Order of Danilo I is registered in Montenegro as a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO). Revised statutes of the Order were enacted on April 23 (May 5), 2005.</p>
<p>The present Hereditary Grand Master is His Majesty King Nikola II Petrovic Njegos of Montenegro. The Vice Grand Master is His Royal Highness Hereditary Prince Boris Petrovic Njegos of Montenegro, Grand Duke of Grahovo and Zeta. The Grand Chancellor of the Order is John Gvozdenovic, kinsman of the late General Anto Gvozdenovic (the last Grand Chancellor of the Order under King Nikola I).</p>
<p>The Successive Grand Masters since 1852 have been: His Majesty King Nikola II (from 24 March 1986); His Majesty King Michael (from 7 March 1921 to 24 March 1986); His Majesty King Danilo Alexander (from 1 March 1921 to 7 March 1921); His Majesty King Nikola I (from 13 August 1860 to 1 March 1921), and; Sovereign Prince Danilo I (from 23 April/5 June 1852 to 13 August 1860).</p>

<p>Glenn Dellimore Glenn Dellimore, born 1972 in London, England, privately educated in London and holder of various England athletic records, gained entry to the London Royal College of Design and graduated from London Barons Court College in Leisure &amp; Entertainment Business Management.</p>
<p>Dellimore founded a national U.K health club events company, designing membership events for the Lord Sebastian Coe health clubs brand. Thereafter, Dellimore designed and founded a renowned ‘five star’ luxury health club in London.</p>
<p>As Dellimore advanced in the entertainment world, he moved from London to Beverly Hills. Liaising with major Hollywood film studios, Dellimore developed two international talent entertainment businesses. Dellimore’s Celeb Entertainment is an international talent booking company for the world’s most popular international talent attending U.K appearances with CelebEvents, formerly known as Jealous Events.</p>
<p>Appearances booked by Jealous Events include Kelly Donovan and Stacey Scowley for a Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel convention. Kelly Donovan was a stunt double for the show, and Stacey Scowley was an extra in one episode.</p>
<p>Glenn Dellimore was featured on the U.K television BBC consumer complaints programme Watchdog in 2003 regarding the Jealous Events David Boreanaz Event. Many attendees were not satisfaid with this event due to the lack of organisation. Fans were left <a href="../../../o/u/t/Out-of-pocket_expenses.html" title="Out-of-pocket expenses">out-of-pocket</a>, in some cases for hundreds of pounds, regarding refunds that were promised and never delivered. Glenn Dellimore's name is well known on the U.K convention circuit as an organiser who's events most do not wish to attend.</p>
<p>Glenn Dellimore is back on the U.K convention scene as CelebEvents. Many people believe the name change from Jealous Events to CelebEvents is to mask the 'bad reputation' he now has, so new attendees will be unaware of the hundreds of fans left <a href="../../../o/u/t/Out-of-pocket_expenses.html" title="Out-of-pocket expenses">out-of-pocket</a> from his previous events.</p>

<p>The Order of Saint Peter of Cetinje was the first dynastic Order of the Royal House of Montenegro and was introduced by His Majesty King Nikola I Petrovic in 1869. It is sometimes said that this order was actually introduced much earlier by Prince-Bishop (Vladica) Peter II Petrovic-Njegoš. The Order is bestowed upon prominent members of the Royal House, the Petrovic-Njegoš family, as well as to prominent foreign citizens, and is currently held by all members of the Royal House.</p>
<p>The name of Prince Danilo, the first Montenegrin ruler with a purely secular title, is inscribed on the Decoration. The Order was named after the Patron Saint of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church, Prince-Bishop (Vladika) Peter I Petrovic, the person who effectively obtained independence for Montenegro, and to whom is attributed the creation of the modern Montengrin State.</p>
<p>Tzar Alexander II of Russia was the first recipient of the Order, awarded on June 29, 1871. During his reign, King Nikola I never organised the Order and maintained it as a single class Dynastic Order, rewarding only members of the Montenegrin Royal Family and related such as Alexander I of Serbia (1888-1934), King Petar I of Serbia (1844-1921), Ljubica “Zorka” Petrovic Njegos (1864-1890), Duke Ilija Plamenac (1821-1917), Duke Bozo Petrovic Njegos (1846-1929), King Vittorio Emanuele III of Italy (1869-1947), and Jelena Petrovic Njegos (1873-1952) etc.</p>
<p>The present Grand Master is His Majesty King Nikola II and the Grand Chancellor is John Gvozdenovic.</p>
<p>The Order consists of a single class, and is normally reserved for members of the Royal Family and their kinsmen and in exceptional circumstances prominent foreign citizens.</p>
<p>Current living recipients include: Her Majesty Queen France, His Royal Highness Hereditary Prince Boris, Grand Duke of Grahovo and Zeta, Her Royal Highness Princess Altinai, His Most Eminent Highness Fra' Andrew Bertie, Prince and Grand Master of the Sovereign Order of Malta, His Highness Prince Nicholas of Russia, His Serence Highness Prince Dimitri of Russia, His Royal Highness Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy, Prince of Naples, Her Royal Highness Marina of Savoy, Princess of Naples, His Royal Highness Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy, Prince of Venice and John Gvozdenovic.</p>

<p>An errata sheet is a common method of post-production editing in which the errors left in the produced copy are outlined on a sheet of paper bound into the book. This is a common method by which large works are "edited"; i.e. if the volume would cost too much and/or be too incongruous to edit, this is an acceptable method by which one might edit the work.</p>
<p>It should be noted that errata sheets should only outline minor errors within a work (e.g. misspellings, improper punctuation and the like). If a major error in the construction of a sentence occurs, or if the construction is such that the idea that the sentence delivers is unclear or distorted to the point of confusion or the delivery of the wrong idea, this MUST be corrected within the work.</p>

<p>In These Arms was the third single to be released from rock band Bon Jovi's fifth studio album, Keep the Faith. It reached 27 on the US Hot 100 and was a Top Ten hit in Australia and the UK.</p>
<p>In These Arms was co-written by Bon Jovi keyboardist David Bryan, It also appears on his solo album, Lunar Eclipse.</p>
<p>Although a firm fan favourite, it is widely regarded to be under-rated, perhaps due to it's release after that of Keep the Faith (which achieved Number 1 on the US Main Stream Rock Tracks) and Bed of Roses.</p>
<p>It is currently being played on Bon Jovi's current 'Have a Nice' Day tour.</p>

<p>Lorna Tolentino</p>
<p>If she were a Hollywood actress, she’ll be Jodie Foster no less. While children her age were playing wantonly in the backyard, Lorna Tolentino, like the precocious Jodie, was already tugging at moviegoers’ hearts.</p>
<p>The future Grandslam Queen of Philippine Cinema (where grand slam means successive wins in all award-giving bodies for a single performance in a movie) started her career at seven, and with great flourish at that. Lorna, still in pigtails and bobby socks, and with an aunt hovering beside her, bested more than 500 candidates in the search for someone to play the young Susan Roces, Queen of Philippine Cinema in Divina Gracia (Divine Grace). She emerged the top choice in a hotly-contested public voting where the young finalists were all adjudged talented and promising.</p>
<p>It was an auspicious start for Lorna, who found herself being directed by no less than the late King of Philippine Cinema Fernando Poe Jr. (a.k.a. FPJ).</p>
<p>Da King, as FPJ is fondly called, also produced the film. The man many believed could have given Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo a stiff fight for the highest office in the land, lived long enough to see his discovery bloom from an untested talent to one of the country’s most respected actresses.</p>
<p>Lorna’s dramatic acting in Divina Gracia created such an impact, Lea Productions, one of the biggest movie outfits in the `70s, signed her up to a contract. The film company believed in her so much, it didn’t have second thoughts about casting her in a big dramatic outing with internationally-renowned director Lino Brocka. The 1971 film, Lumuha Pati nga Anghel (Even the Angels Cried) gave Lorna her first award – that of Best Child Actress from the oldest award-giving body in the Philippines, the FAMAS (Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences). One moving portrayal deserves another. Not long after, Lorna again made moviegoers cry in FPJ Productions’ Mga Anghel na Walang Langit (Angels Without a Heaven).</p>
<p>Drama may be where she started. But Lorna is versatile enough to swing from tears to laughter with ease. This she proved in such comedies as My Little One, Pag-ibig Mo Buhay Ko (Your Love is My Life), Batya at Palo-Palo(Basin and Laundry Beater,, with Fernando Poe Jr.) and Mediavillo (with future husband, multi-awarded actor Rudy Fernandez).</p>
<p>Lorna also shared the screen with Dolphy, the Philippine King of Comedy no less, in Biyenan Ko ang Aking Anak (My Mother-in-Law is My Child).</p>
<p>At the tender age of 14, when other actors were in the so-called awkward stage and wanting for roles, Lorna was getting juicy assignments.</p>
<p>She graduated from child performer to lead actress roles, the first of which was Cubao Cinema Films’ Sariwang Damo, Matandang Kabayo (Fresh Grass, Old Horse), which was retitled as Langit Ko ang Pag-Ibig Mo (Your Love is My Heaven).</p>
<p>Lorna then pitted acting prowess with multi-awarded actor-director Eddie Garcia in a semi-comedy love drama story, Subok na Matatag (Tried and Tested as Stable). The movie saw local movie outfit and Hongkong Cinema Films joining forces for better results.</p>
<p>One film after another came in quick succession in a span of just one year. Lorna starred with Chiquito, an</p>
<p>established actor-comedian in Boss, Basta Ikaw Wa Na Ko Say (Boss, As Long as It’s You, I Have Nothing More to Say), written by the award-winning Efren Abueg. Leap Year Ngayon, Lagot Ka, Pipikutin Kita (You’re Done In; It’s Leap Year, I Will Force You to Marry Me), was with FAMAS awardee Christopher de Leon. More movies with veteran actors followed: Isang Dalagita (One Young Maiden) with the award-winning Tirso Cruz III, Tutol ang Lupa (The Earth Refuses) with Fred Galang and Apoy sa Ibabaw (Fire from Above) with Romeo Vasquez.</p>
<p>By then, Lorna’s name was already sparkling like a priceless diamond. The year 1978 saw her getting as much as 13 movie offers from various film outfits. Those she accepted proved all the more that she’s an actress to reckon with.</p>
<p>The comedy-drama Gorgonia, based on a well-acclaimed comics serial, cast her as an effeminate’s adopted daughter.</p>
<p>Dulce Amor … Ina (Dulce Amor … Mother), where she played the title role of a young mother exposed to and harassed by the world’s evils, won critical and box-office acclaim. By earning the nod, not only of the general public but hard-nosed film critics as well, Lorna joined the league of big stars in Philippine cinema.</p>
<p>Box-office success came fast and furious. Lorna’s next films, Sapagkat Kami’y Tao Lamang (Because We’re Only Human) with Christopher de Leon and Alma Moreno and Caught in the Act (with award-winning actresses Amy Austria and Gina Alajar) spelled magic at the tills.</p>
<p>Lorna rubbed elbows with legends of Philippine cinema: Asia’s Best Actress Charito Solis, former Miss Philippines Pilar Pilapil (Mga Huwad na Mananayaw /Fake Dancers), Rosemarie Gil and Gloria Sevilla (Baby Doll), Robert Arevalo and the late Vic Silayan (Katawang Alabok/Body of Dust), George Estregan (Paano ang Gabi Kung Wala Ka?/How Will the Night Be Without You?), Rudy Fernandez (Sa Init ng Apoy/In the Heat of Fire), Eddie Rodriguez (Magkano ang Kalayaan Mo?/How Much is Your Freedom?), Philippine superstar Nora Aunor and Johnny Delgado (Mga Uod at Rosas/Worms and Roses) and Vilma Santos (Sinasamba Kita/I Worship You).</p>
<p>By 1982, Lorna has tucked 55 major films under her belt. The projects were no mean feats. They delved on moral and social issues and trends, touching the lives of millions of Filipinos with such depth and magnitude.</p>
<p>These films, crafted under the meticulous hands of the masters themselves – respected, award-winning directors like Lino Brocka, Ishmael Bernal, Chito Rono, Romy Suzara, Jose Javier Reyes, Maryo J. delos Reyes, Emmanuel Borlaza, Marilou Diaz-Abaya, Laurice Guillen, Joel Lamangan, among others – will forever remain classics in Philippine cinema.</p>
<p>The best was yet to come. Year 1982 saw Lorna earning Best Actress nominations in all the award-winning bodies of Philippine Cinema for Moral (with Laurice Guillen and Gina Alajar and directed by Marilou Abaya).</p>
<p>The years 1973 up to the present saw Lorna harvesting a bumper crop of 49 Best Actress nominations. These promptly turned into every actor’s dream – awards – starting 1987. Lorna’s first Best Actress trophy came from three award-giving bodies – the Film Academy of the Philippines (an award given by peers, the Philippines’ equivalent of the Oscars) and the Philippine Movie Press Club’s Star Awards.</p>
<p>Lorna earned raves as a woman obsessed in getting a man’s love by hook or by crook in Lino Brocka’s Maging Akin Ka Lamang (Just So You Can Be Mine).</p>
<p>Her acting chops thus honed to perfection, Lorna reached the apex of her achievements in 1992 . That’s when her role as a mother seeking revenge for her child’s death won her all the Best Actress awards the Philippines can offer. Lorna was declared the best – bar none – by the Film Academy of the Philippines, the FAMAS, the Urian (from the Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino, an exclusive circle made up of the country’s top film critics) and the Philippine Movie Press Club (an organization made up of the country’s entertainment journalists).</p>
<p>Lorna’s victory is called a grand slam – a rarity and an honor reserved only for the best of the best in local cinema.</p>
<p>Still, the public ain’t seen nothin’ yet. Lorna refused to rest on her laurels and tackled each role with the sensitivity and brilliance each of her portrayals has become noted for.</p>
<p>Her winning streak was simply unstoppable. She won Best Actress again, this time from the Manila Film Festival awards for Luksong Tinik (Jumping Over Thorns) where she juggled hero and anti-hero roles simultaneously. Lorna’s complex character required acting nuances that, in the hands of a lesser performer, will lose steam in no time at all. For playing a good single mother who works as courier of fake passports to raise her son on her own, Lorna won the nod of discriminating Manila Filmfest jurors.</p>
<p>Two years later, she played yet another mother role, this time, that of an illiterate woman who taught herself how to read and write for her children’s sake in Abakada … Ina. Lorna won three Best Actress trophies – from the Film Academy of the Philippines, the Philippine Movie Press Club’s Star Awards and the FAMAS for this sensitive portrayal.</p>
<p>Other Best Actress Awards included those for Kislap sa Dilim (A Glow in the Dark) from the Philippine Movie Press Club, Nagbabagang Luha (Smoldering Tears) from FAMAS and Kailan Mahuhugasan ang Kasalanan (When Will One’s Sin be Washed Away, directed by Lino Brocka), etc.</p>
<p>This brings the total number of her acting trophies to an impressive 11 in just three-and-a-half years.</p>
<p>Lorna’s films continue to do the rounds of international film festivals. Sigaw ng Puso (Cry of the Heart) – Emergency Call was exhibited along with Asia’s best films at the 1996 Tokyo International Filmfest. Lorna played a doctor with a heart of gold alongside Japanese actor Heroyuki Sanada.</p>
<p>Another film, May Nagmamahal sa Iyo (Madonna and Child), or Someone Loves You (Madonna and Child), was shown at the Fukuoka, Tokyo, New Delhi, Hawaii and San Sebastian international filmfests.</p>
<p>Magnifico, winner of the International Jury Grand Prix award at the Berlin International Film Festival, and the only Filipino film in history to have won over 60 awards, saw Lorna playing the sacrificing mother of a girl afflicted with a motor disease.</p>
<p>Today, with television dominating Philippine show business, Lorna’s shift from big to small screen has been effortless, and just as fruitful. The country’s top two networks, GMA 7 and ABS-CBN, have found her talent beyond par in drama anthologies, talk shows and a talent search.</p>
<p>Lorna’s soap series, Kay Tagal Kang Hinintay (I Waited So Long For You) was shown all over Asia. Her Jekyll and Hyde character required her to shift from good to bad and back in only a matter of minutes. But Lorna, as always, did justice to her role.</p>
<p>The GMA 7 top-rating drama anthology Magpakailanman (Forevermore), where Lorna played a Filipino worker in Hong Kong who was raped and unknowingly contracted AIDS, won critical acclaim at the Singapore TV Awards. The jurors gave the episode a Highly-Recommended rating.</p>
<p>GMA 7 again banked on her knack for spotting talent when she sees one when it got her to sit in the judges’ bench for the widely-popular StarStruck, the network’s yearly search for young talents nationwide.</p>
<p>She trades witty repartee with fellow co-hosts in the top-rating celebrity talk show Startalk, also on GMA 7. Lorna also hosted Thirty Days, a much-talked about talent search on the same network.</p>
<p>Her own drama anthology, dubbed as Star Drama Presents Lorna over ABS-CBN, aired for three years – already considered a long time in the fickle world of Philippine TV. Needless to say, Lorna has a string of other drama series in the two stations.</p>
<p>Lorna’s wholesome image and appeal among the A, B, C, D and E crowd, and among young and old have earned her TV commercials and product endorsements. She helped push various products, from instant noodles (Lucky Me Lomi), to beauty services (Flawless), mineral water (Crystal Clear), baked goods (Gals Bakery) and women’s intimate wear (Mondragon Philippines). These companies bank on her marketability and mass appeal in their TV commercials and print ads. Lorna’s face lights up giant billboards scattered all over the country – in malls, major highways, high-rise buildings, etc.</p>
<p>Lorna’s work doesn’t end when the klieg lights are out. It extends to other concerns, like the welfare of fellow actors and children. She is a member of the Film Academy of the Philippines, Katipunan ng mga Artista ng Pelikulang Pilipino (Actors’ Guild of the Philippines), Philippine Movie Producers of the Philippines Association (she produced the film Kislap sa Dilim or A Glow in the Dark) and Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB). The MTRCB reviews and classifies films according to audience suitability before they are shown in the country’s theaters.</p>
<p>The mother in Lorna (she has two grownup sons) has found expression and fulfillment as past president and treasurer of the Action for Children Towards Success.</p>
<p>The actress in her thirsts for new ways of perfecting her craft. So she attends workshops that enrich her whenever she can. Those she attended tackled the rudiments of her profession: Oral Interpretation (by the late respected director Ishmael Bernal), Being, Believing (by award-winning director Mel Chionglo) and Craft and Imaging (by Eric Morris).</p>
<p>Still another revered director, Peque Gallaga, conducted a Teacher’s Course for actors which Lorna also completed.</p>
<p>Lorna’s hunger for knowledge knows no bounds. She took a special course on Motion Picture Language and Photography at the Academy of Art College in San Francisco, California.</p>
<p>As a businesswoman, she found the entrepreneurship course at the University of the Philippines (the country’s premiere educational institution) Open University highly useful for her various business ventures in the fields of food, mineral water and others.</p>
<p>Lorna Tolentino continues to evolve as an actress and, most importantly, as an individual seeking excellence in everything she does. It is by going the extra mile that she earns the admiration of peers and the love of those around her.</p>
<p>This is what makes her last in the Philippine movie industry, where public taste is so fickle, lesser stars just fade away, and only the talented ones stay – the way Lorna Tolentino does to this day.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-22_b389.html" title="Edit section: Sepermeru">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sepermeru</span></h2>
<p>Sepermeru was the religious capital of the 19th Nome of Upper Egypt, located on an irrigation canal near the general entrance to the Fayuum Oasis. This outpost settlement was situated roughly mid-way between Oxyrhynchos (Per Medjed) to the south and Herakleopolis to the north. According to ancient taxation records and other pertinent sources, Sepermeru was a noted settlement for active and retired military personnel and their familes, particularly during the New Kingdom reign of the Rameses pharaohs. Agriculture was also practiced here. The chief deities of the town were the god Set and the goddess Nephthys; both of these deities were highly favored by the war-like Ramessid Dynasty of kings for their ominous, agrressive attributes. As revealed by ongoing excavations in the 1980s, two provincial temples were built in Sepermeru, existing from (at least) the 19th and 20th Dynastic periods. One temple was dedicated to Set while the other temple enclosure belonged to Nephthys. Separate, hierarchical priesthoods for both deities are named, for taxation purposes, in the Wilbour Papyrus: two "prophets" of "Set of Sepermeru" and two "prophets" and a "wa'ab" priest in the service of "Nephthys of Sepermeru" (19th and 20th Dynasties). In all likelihood, the temples were either built or considerably refurbished by Rameses III. Only the foundation stones of both temples remain today and, by Ptolemaic times, it is questionable whether the temples of Set and Nephthys (along with the settlement itself) were still occupied. Indeed, a derogatory reference to "Set of Sepermeru" on the walls of the Ptolemaic temple of Horus (at Edfu) notes that the town's canals were "dried up and forgotten" by the turn of the Common Era. This may have been a mere "hieroglyphic insult" rendered to Set, enemy of Horus, for the epithet "Set of Sepermeru" was still obviously familiar to the temple theologians. The capital of the 19th Nome had long before shifted to Oxyrhynchus in any case. Thus, it is likely that the settlement had waned considerably in significance.The history of the site, however, remains notable from an ancient Egyptian perspective because of the favor lavished by the Ramessid kings upon the temples of Nephthys and Set. Set's favor declined throughout Egypt with the downfall of these kings (except in the Delta and various northern oases), while Nephthys achieved greater popularity in her role as a goddess of the Osirian cycle, especially with temples of her own at Komir and Diospolis Parva (Hiw), where the entire 7th Upper Egyptian Nome was considered to be her particular "fiefdom" in Late Period and Greco-Roman times.</p>

<p><b>Penis Theory</b> <i>Abstract</i> Penis theory is a branch of applied masculine studies that analyzes hypothetical (yet existing) relationships in unstructured courtship. Macro penis theory is a corrolary to the Buldge/income equation, in which male desirability is a function of independent variables-- penis size and income. Beginning in April 2006, Penis theory was initially developed as a tool for understanding seemingly irrational female behavior. Derived from non-experimental reasoning, Penis theory builds from several premises resultant from an implicit hierarchy of psycho-social observations: i. Women derive sexual gratification from larger penii. ii. Wealth is an essential component of longterm male/female interaction in western society iii. The sexual revolution has limited traditional societal norms iv. The pop-culture phenomenon of Sex and the City(see Whore studies)</p>
<p>Penis theory has been applied to other social science disciplines including: macro/micro cockeconomics, critical feminism, whore studies, and theoretical buldgenomics. It has drawn attention.</p>
<p><i>History</i> Penis theory was developed by disillusioned University of California undergrads Allen Gilio and Dave Markman in April 2006.</p>

<p>Detroit native J-LYRIQ is a gritty, urban contemporary/neo-soul singer, songwriter and self taught producer. His influences range from Sam Cooke, Donny Hathaway, and Marvin Gaye to Jodeci, Brian Mcknight, and R. Kelly. Like other R&amp;B artist who have emerged in the '90s and 2000s, J-Lyriq looks to different eras for inspiration. The classic soul of the '60s and '70s impact his singing and producing, but so have the urban contemporary and hip-hop of the '80s, '90s and 2000s.</p>
<p>At times, J-Lyriq can be flat-out retro; some of his material would have been right at home on an old Motown LP from R&amp;B's pre-'80s, pre-urban contemporary, pre-hip-hop era. Other times he has a more modern, hip-hop-influenced outlook. In other words, he has some songs that are quite friendly to urban radio, and others that would be too old-school for urban radio.His goal is to not be able to be compared to any other artist.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, where he was the last of 8 children, J-Lyriq had a very musical upbringing -- one that included a steady diet of R&amp;B and soul. When he wasn't performing gospel, J-Lyriq listened to secular soul and funk -- and his favorites included Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, Donny Hathaway, and the Gap Band. As a lead in his choir he had big dreams of worldwide fame.</p>

<p>Ioannis Amanatidis was born on the 3rd December, 1981 in Kozani, Greece. He is a Greek footballer, who has served as a full Greek international.</p>
<p>Amanatidis' early career in football was unconventional, yet promising . He began playing football in Kozani with his friends (rather than with a professional club) on the streets of the town. His first experience in organised football came at the age of nine, when he moved to Germany with his family. It was at SC Stuttgart that he first laced up his boots, demonstrating a devastating instinct for scoring goals even in his early years, and becoming the leading goalscorer during his four years with the Swabian club.</p>
<p>Amanatidis has, since then, played a large majority of his football in Germany, most notable are his performances with German clubs Kaiserslautern and, of course, Stuttgart. He currently plays for Eintracht Frankfurt, and serves as one of their key frontmen in the Frankfurt strikeforce. He played a vital role for Frankfurt in the 2005/2006 season, helping them stay in the German Bundesliga, and finishing the season as the clubs highest goalscorer for the year, with 12 goals. Amanatidis also led the way in the German cup, with Frankfurt just losing out to German champions Bayern Munich in the final. Amanatidis had a chance to be the hero of the night, having his 88th minute strike off a corner parried away by keeper Oliver Kahn.</p>
<p>Despite having such a promising career ahead of him at many periods of his blossoming career, unlike many notable Greek national players, Amanatidis was left out of the Greece squad which won the 2004 Euro Final. When asking coach Otto Rehagel why he was left out, he admitted:</p>
<p>"I asked Rehhagel before the European Championship why I had been left out. He explained and I accepted it".</p>
<p>He is no doubt, in the future, going to be in the plans for Greece, and despite Greece not making the World Cup in Germany, Amanatidis has a lot to look forward to internationally. Amanatidis was also named in the Greek squad that travels down under to meet Australia on Thursday 25th, 2006, in Melbourne.</p>

<p>Born Matt Burns in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Nick Mondo quickly rose to fame in CZW (Combat Zone Wrestling) as one of its brightest stars. Making his debut in March of 1999, Nick Mondo's career, although short-lived was one of the most succesful of all those who competed in CZW. Despite giving up much in size and power to competitors such as John Zandig, Nate Hatred, The Wifebeater and Necro Butcher, Mondo was able to stand toe-to-toe with these competitors in the ring. Notable incidents from Mondo's Career include his fall of the top of the Warehouse in Delaware at Tournament of Death 2. During this 2 Out Of 3 Falls Light-Tube Log-Cabin Match. Mondo and his opponent John Zandig fell from the top of a warehouse through 4 tables and one of the Light-Tube Log-Cabins. This fall left Mondo's back badly lascerated, despite this he managed to win the match. Later that night he would also defeat Ian Rotten to win TOD2. Sadly only a few months after TOD 2 on November 10th 2003 Nick Mondo announced he was retiring due to Injury. In his four and a half year carreer Mondo had won The CZW Iron Man Title 3 times, the CZW Tag Titles with Ric Blade, the AWF championship and the NCWA Hardcore Championship, along with Tournament of Death 2. Other notable Mondo matches include Nick Mondo vs Homeless Jimmy from the original Tournament of Death, a TLC match at Cage of Death 4 between the team of Mondo and Ric Blade and The Backseat Boyz and Nick Mondo vs Nick Gage vs Nick Berk in a Tables, Ladders and Violence Match where Mondo won his 2nd CZW Iron Man belt.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-22_b389.html" title="Edit section: Order of Prince Danilo I of Montenegro">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Order of Prince Danilo I of Montenegro</span></h2>
<p>The Order of Prince Danilo I of Montenegro was the first Montenegrin state Order and was established as a single class Order by His Royal Highness Prince Danilo Petrovic on St. George's Day April 23 (May 5), 1852, as the Order of Danilo I for the Independence of Montenegro “in order to honor the courage and the accomplishments of his subjects and of all those who dedicated themselves to defend the holy thing of the fatherland independence”. The Order became dormant upon the exile of the Royal House, though with living members and is still awarded to prominent champions of the preservation of Montenegrin independence. The conditions by which the Order is awarded are defined by Statute.</p>
<p>Alterations were made to the appearance of the original decoration created by Prince Danilo and during the rule of His Majesty King Nikola I Petrovic the Order underwent two restructures. During the first restructure on St. Goerge's Day April 23 (May 5), 1861, three classes were introduced, The King introducing two upper degrees, Grand Cross and Commander, with specific insignias; the old cross becoming a third class, Knight. On April 23 (May 5), 1873, the second reorganisation of the Order expands the field of rewards to civilian merits, establishes a Grand Chancellery and adds an intermediary class of Grand Officer between those of Grand Cross and Commander. In 1893, a third reform of the statutes establishes a fourth class, resulting from a reclassification of the existing class of Knight. The old cross then became a fifth class.</p>
<p>Throughout the history of the Order, the insignia has been produced by several famous medallists, the best-known being Arthus Bertrand, Beranger &amp; Magdalaine (Paris, France), A. Chobillion (Paris, France), D. Cravanzola (Roma, Italy), R. Marschall (Vienna, Austria), Vincent Mayer (Vienna, Austria), C.F. Rothe &amp; Neffe (Vienna, Austria), A. Ryabkov (St. Petersburg, Russia), G.A. Scheid (Vienna, Austria), Silberberg (Hamburg, Germany) and presently Thomas Fattorini (Birmingham, United Kingdom).</p>
<p>Many deserving men and women have been awarded the Order of Prince Danilo I over time including foreigners. The illustrious list includes many decorated servicemen during the World Wars and a host of other notables, including Queen Victoria and King Edward VII of Great Britain, as well as being written about by F. Scott Fitzgerald in 'The Great Gatsby'.</p>
<p>The Order of Prince Danilo I is the prerogative of the Head of the Royal House of Montenegro. On November 11, 2004 in Cetinje, His Majesty King Nikola II Petrovic Njegos, Hereditary Grand Master, reformed the Order, keeping the organisation of 1873 in five classes, but renaming them into Grand Cross, Knight Commander, Knight, Lieutenant and Member.

<p>Glenn Dellimore Glenn Dellimore, born 1972 in London, England, privately educated in London and holder of various England athletic records, gained entry to the London Royal College of Design and graduated from London Barons Court College in Leisure &amp; Entertainment Business Management.</p>
<p>Dellimore founded a national U.K health club events company, designing membership events for the Lord Sebastian Coe health clubs brand. Thereafter, Dellimore designed and founded a renowned ‘five star’ luxury health club in London.</p>
<p>As Dellimore advanced in the entertainment world, he moved from London to Beverly Hills. Liaising with major Hollywood film studios, Dellimore developed two international talent entertainment businesses. Dellimore’s Celeb Entertainment is an international talent booking company for the world’s most popular international talent attending U.K appearances with CelebEvents, formerly known as Jealous Events.</p>
<p>Appearances booked by Jealous Events include Kelly Donovan and Stacey Scowley for a Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel convention. Kelly Donovan was a stunt double for the show, and Stacey Scowley was an extra in one episode.</p>
<p>Glenn Dellimore was featured on the U.K television BBC consumer complaints programme Watchdog in 2003 regarding the Jealous Events David Boreanaz Event. Many attendees were not satisfaid with this event due to the lack of organisation. Fans were left out of pocket, in some cases for hundreds of pounds, regarding refunds that were promised and never delivered. Glenn Dellimore's name is well known on the U.K convention circuit as an organiser who's events most do not wish to attend.</p>
<p>Glenn Dellimore is back on the U.K convention scene as CelebEvents. Many people believe the name change from Jealous Events to CelebEvents is to mask the 'bad reputation' he now has, so new attendees will be unaware of the hundreds of fans left out of pocket from his previous events.</p>

<p>The peanut test can be used to see if you are (in)compatible with someone in terms of a relationship.</p>
<p>The test was originated in the UK and hence uses the main British flavours in nuts. It can be expanded to other nations' tipples but must be kept concise for clarity and maximum effect.</p>
<p>The test is as follows:</p>
<p>Which type of peanut do you prefer?</p>
<p>a) Dry Roasted b) Salted c) I don't like peanuts</p>
<p>The answer must be one of the above. Such comments as "well I don't really mind" are not permitted.</p>

<p>The Order of Saint Peter of Cetinje was the first dynastic Order of the Royal House of Montenegro and was introduced by His Majesty King Nikola I Petrovic in 1869. It is sometimes said that this order was actually introduced much earlier by Prince-Bishop (Vladica) Peter II Petrovic-Njegoš. The Order is bestowed upon prominent members of the Royal House, the Petrovic-Njegoš family, as well as to prominent foreign citizens, and is currently held by all members of the Royal House.</p>
<p>The name of Prince Danilo, the first Montenegrin ruler with a purely secular title, is inscribed on the Decoration. The Order was named after the Patron Saint of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church, Prince-Bishop (Vladika) Peter I Petrovic, the person who effectively obtained independence for Montenegro, and to whom is attributed the creation of the modern Montengrin State.</p>
<p>Tzar Alexander II of Russia was the first recipient of the Order, awarded on June 29, 1871. During his reign, King Nikola I never organised the Order and maintained it as a single class Dynastic Order, rewarding only members of the Montenegrin Royal Family and related such as Alexander I of Serbia (1888-1934), King Petar I of Serbia (1844-1921), Ljubica “Zorka” Petrovic Njegos (1864-1890), Duke Ilija Plamenac (1821-1917), Duke Bozo Petrovic Njegos (1846-1929), King Vittorio Emanuele III of Italy (1869-1947), and Jelena Petrovic Njegos (1873-1952) etc.</p>
<p>The present Grand Master is His Majesty King Nikola II and the Grand Chancellor is John Gvozdenovic.</p>
<p>The Order consists of a single class, and is normally reserved for members of the Royal Family and their kinsmen and in exceptional circumstances prominent foreign citizens.</p>
<p>Current living recipients include: Her Majesty Queen France, His Royal Highness Hereditary Prince Boris, Grand Duke of Grahovo and Zeta, Her Royal Highness Princess Altinai, His Most Eminent Highness Fra' Andrew Bertie, Prince and Grand Master of the Sovereign Order of Malta, His Highness Prince Nicholas of Russia, His Serence Highness Prince Dimitri of Russia, His Royal Highness Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy, Prince of Naples, Her Royal Highness Marina of Savoy, Princess of Naples, His Royal Highness Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy, Prince of Venice and John Gvozdenovic.</p>

<p>An errata sheet is a common method of post-production editing in which the errors left in the produced copy are outlined on a sheet of paper bound into the book. This is a common method by which large works are "edited"; i.e. if the volume would cost too much and/or be too incongruous to edit, this is an acceptable method by which one might edit the work.</p>
<p>It should be noted that errata sheets should only outline minor errors within a work (e.g. misspellings, improper punctuation and the like). If a major error in the construction of a sentence occurs, or if the construction is such that the idea that the sentence delivers is unclear or distorted to the point of confusion or the delivery of the wrong idea, this MUST be corrected within the work.</p>

<p><b>Charles "<i>Ghozt</i>" Hewlett</b> is a seventeen year old male, currently residing in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><br />
Charles gained a wide degree of Internet fame on American Online in association with many professional wrestling-oriented chat rooms. He began being known as his nickname, "Ghozt" or "Quozt" later on, with a wide variety of screen names in association with the term. Ghozt was frequently picked on for being "emo."</p>
<p><br />
Some of Ghozt's "friends" recall a time when Ghozt had typed instant messages to them stating "Dude where is Charlie?!" Then they told them that Charlie was at the local park, under a tree, in danger of cutting himself.</p>
<p><br />
The poking fun at Ghozt continued when he began having "cyber sessions" over the internet and began having online relationships, which to many was found as a desperate or childish move on his part. His involvement in TRIVIA and Games has also sparked a lot of contraversy.</p>

<p>Fake shaman is a term used for individuals who pass themselves off as medicine men, healers, spiritual advisors, seers, or psychics, claiming a lineage to a native tradition they do not possess, yet claim to represent. The motive for this is often to claim an authority for themselves that they do not deserve, thus leveraging the mystique of these traditions for financial gain or self-aggrandisement. Generally this involves offering fictional accounts in books, workshops, or ceremonies which are for sale in a way which traditional spirituality tends to avoid. One example is the so-called "Path of Pollen", which has been promoted as a "hidden" lineage of European shamanism containing bee- and sex-related practices. The "revelation" of "hidden" or "arcane" knowledge is often a tactic of fake shamans as it makes it obviously difficult for their claims to be verified (or otherwise). Typically, the revelation of this supposedly arcane knowledge is accompanied by the demise of the person who initiated the student into it, leaving him or her free to promote themselves as the new "master" of this "wisdom". This is the case in Carlos Castaneda's work, for example, and in The Shamanic Way of the Bee, a book supposedly written (though this is disputed) by Simon Buxton of the Sacred Trust which invents the "Path of Pollen" as a European tradition, whereas, in fact, it has been demonstrated as a line pilfered from a Navajo Beauty Way song that has nothing at all to do with European shamanism, with bees, or with sexual practices of any kind. The actual (claimed) author of this book has distanced himself from it and from Buxton, claiming that he wrote it as semi-fiction, which Buxton has subsequently promoted as his own work and as fact.</p>

<p>The last word is for people who think they know everything. It hurts them if they do not have the last word. In an argument, or in life in general some people need the last word to feel complete. For them, the sole purpose of their existance if only to have the last word. Only once given the last word do they truely believe they are right. There is no difference between right and wrong for such people. It is all grey and not black or white. For their incapable minds the one who has the last word is the right one. Furthermore, it must be noted that the more insuting the last word is, the better. The lower the blow, the more complete these people feel. A last word has to be extremely pathetic with no aim or anything except to hurt the other person. Why do some people hurt other people for no reason? Its another mystery.</p>

<p>The main characters are Richard Sanston, a religious minister who when not in work acts like a regular man and doesn't care if he sin's or not, despite his job. He has a wife, Carol Sanston who has no job, although she has had some in the past. She is a normal housewife who loves her family and is the love of a homeless person living with the family, called Doug Ferbertstein. He is a <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobo.html" title="Hobo">hobo</a> who was taken in by Richard and is kept in the house. Even though it was Richard who took in Doug, both of them hate each other, but they still continue to live with each other. The family has two children, Sam Sanston, a 14 year old who, like any normal teenage boy with a religious minister for a father, is embaressed by his dad's work. There is also Ruth Sanston, an 8 year old girl who knows quite a lot, but is hardly mentioned in the family. She features in very little episodes and hardly ever ties in with the episode plot.</p>

<p>Magshimey Herut was founded in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> by a number of <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betar.html" title="Betar">Betar</a> activists who were disappointed with what they viewed as a lack of ideological integrity within their movement. When a <a href="../../../l/i/k/Likud.html" title="Likud">Likud</a> government led by <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_2cf9.html" title="Prime Minister">Prime Minister</a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Netanyahu_7e3f.html" title="Benjamin Netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> relinquished parts of <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebron.html" title="Hebron">Hebron</a> to <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasser_Arafat_cf67.html" title="Yasser Arafat">Yasser Arafat</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, Benny Begin led the <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herut.html" title="Herut">Herut</a> faction out of the Likud. As the youth movement most associated with the ruling party, Betar members were uncertain on how to view a Likud Prime Minister betraying their most sacred principles. While the Betar leadership officially supported Netanyahu's policies, Betar treasurer Karma Feinstein, along with a group of ideological purists and veteran activists from chapters throughout the world, left Betar in order to establish Magshimey Herut.</p>
<p>Discarding Betar’s militaristic flavor, Magshimey Herut focused on packaging the ideals of <a href="../../../z/e/v/Zev_Jabotinsky_51f4.html" title="Zev Jabotinsky">Zev Jabotinsky</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revisionist_Zionism_b013.html" title="Revisionist Zionism">Revisionist Zionism</a> in a way that would be more current and appealing to young Jews. Led by a blend of secular and religious <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-wing.html" title="Right-wing">right-wing</a> activists, Magshimey Herut made an effort to be more sympathetic than Betar to the needs and values of religious <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews.html" title="Jews">Jews</a>. In the years that followed its establishment, a number of graduates from the <a href="../../../b/n/e/Bnei_Akiva_6f91.html" title="Bnei Akiva">Bnei Akiva</a> religious Zionist youth movement joined Magshimey Herut, seeing it as a young adult movement most committed to the values that Bnei Akiva instilled in them as youth.</p>
<p>Possibly as a result of its focus on social issues in addition to right-wing <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionist.html" title="Zionist">Zionist</a> ideals, Magshimey Herut attracted many Jews who, although actively <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-wing.html" title="Left-wing">left-wing</a> on domestic issues, believed strongly in <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>’s moral right to the entire <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_of_Israel_af97.html" title="Land of Israel">land of Israel</a>. Magshimey Herut therefore became a unique movement in Zionist politics, combining a faithful adherence to right-wing national goals with a steadfast commitment to social justice within society.</p>
<p>As the youngest movement within the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Zionist_Organization_d167.html" title="World Zionist Organization">World Zionist Organization</a>’s hagshama department, Magshimey Herut continues to grow both in <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> and the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diaspora.html" title="Diaspora">Diaspora</a>.</p>

<p>Magshimey Herut views itself as loyal to the basic Zionist teachings of <a href="../../../z/e/v/Zev_Jabotinsky_51f4.html" title="Zev Jabotinsky">Zev Jabotinsky</a>. There is, however, evidence that the movement takes great liberty in interpreting Jabotinsky’s views. Some critics argue that Magshimey Herut’s ideological leanings are closer to those of <a href="../../../u/r/i/Uri_Zvi_Greenberg_b6a8.html" title="Uri Zvi Greenberg">Uri Zvi Greenberg</a> and <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Stern_1ca5.html" title="Abraham Stern">Abraham Stern</a>’s <a href="../../../l/e/h/Lehi.html" title="Lehi">Lehi</a> group than to Jabotinsky and the <a href="../../../i/r/g/Irgun.html" title="Irgun">Irgun</a> underground (with whom Betar closely identifies). Possibly due to its more religious flavor, Magshimey Herut seems nearer to messianic strands of Revisionist Zionism than to the mainstream component represented by Betar.</p>
<p>Although opposed to many policies of recent <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli.html" title="Israeli">Israeli</a> <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government.html" title="Government">governments</a>, Magshimey Herut views the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_Israel_88e9.html" title="State of Israel">State of Israel</a> as something sacred of great historical significance and deserving of their loyalty. The movement places unity amongst Jews of all persuasions on equal footing with the territorial integrity of the land of Israel and therefore works to build dialogue between Jews with opposing political opinions.</p>

<p>Ghomrasssen</p>
<p>Ghomrassen is located in the south of Tunisia. It's a nice place to visit. The town is surrounded by mountians and you have great views of the sanctuary perched on a cliff right over the centre.</p>
<p>Take some time to visit the caves and climb up the the sanctuary to get a good view over the surroundings.</p>
<p>The most famous attraction is the Ksar Hadada: it was here that parts of Star Wars was filmed - it is not as famous or nice as Hotel Sidi Driss in Matmata though. The Ksar was turned into a hotel. It was closed in 2001 but it was supposed to open again...</p>

<p>Stockdale High School</p>
<p><br />
Stockdale High School is a prestigious school in Bakersfield California. It is world renowned for its outstanding increase every year in the California standarized exams. It is a school of great students and an outstanding staff. It is a clean an safe school with security at every entrance to ensure every shilds safety. There are some jackasses like Holman and Avi Saini. Here is a list of insults that I have thought up regarding the students currently attending Stockdale High School. Holman is an oldman, Amit wants booty, Avi’s an A.S.S, Celine is a gangsta, Iris looks like my grandma, Amol will kick my ass if I make fun of him, Sarah Yoon rhymes with Alice Pyoon, Tyler needs to SHUT UP!!!!!, Lyna is the tallest person I’ve ever met, and Sally has a wang. These people are extremely annoying and should be approached with caution. I hope that you are now warned and will be at an advantage if you should ever be unfortunate enough to come across them face to face.</p>

<p>Drink ball is a highly active 2 on 2 drinking game that tests several different skills. Generally, a <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_pong.html" title="Beer pong">beer pong</a> table is used, though it is not necessary. Each player starts with 1 can of beer, and between the group a ping pong ball is required. Each team lines up on opposite sides of the table, with the 4 cups of beer on each corner. Team 1, Player 1 starts by throwing the ping pong ball at one of team 2's beer cans. If the ball hits a can, Player 2 (of team 1) immediately begins to chug his beer until team 2 recovers the ball and hits the table with it. If the ball fails to hit the opposing team's beer can, then no chugging may occur. After the throw and subsequent recovery, team 2 gets a chance to retaliate in the same way. The next time around, Player 2 of team 1 is the thrower, and player 1 is the drinker. The game ends when one team finishes their own beer.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-22_b389.html" title="Edit section: Audi S4 Cabriolet, One of the World's Most Beautiful Convertibles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Audi S4 Cabriolet, One of the World's Most Beautiful Convertibles</span></h2>
<p>The Audi S4 Cabriolet is a convertible Audi created to compete with the <a href="../../../b/m/w/BMW_M3_813e.html" title="BMW M3">BMW M3</a> convertible and Mercedes-Benz CLK55 convertible. However much Audi is considered the "alternative", its designs and power continue to flourish. It has a slightly lower price than the <a href="../../../m/3/_/M3.html" title="M3">M3</a>, and the CLK55 is well over $80,000, pushing it out of the <a href="../../../s/4/_/S4.html" title="S4">S4</a> and M3's $60,000 price barrier.</p>
<p>All models of the S4 are fitted with the company's acclaimed 4.2 liter V8, which in S4 form generates a more than adequate 340hp. Mated to the [six-speed manual] transmission, the car propels itself from 0-60 mph in a mere 5.7 seconds. However, the even quicker S4 sedan does this exact feat in a supercar-worthy 4.9 seconds with the manual, 5.3 with the automatic. Expect the S4 Cabriolet Automatic to accelerate in 5.9 seconds.</p>
<p>However, <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audi.html" title="Audi">Audi</a> did not stop the S4's beauty at the front. The convertible comes in a variety of colors, from Silver to Sprint Blue, which is by far the best complement to the aluminum trim around the beltline, mirrors and windshield. It does not have the over-designness of the <a href="../../../b/m/w/BMW_7_Series_17e9.html" title="BMW 7 Series">BMW 7 Series</a> or newly designed 2007 Mercedes-Benz S-Class, or the like. The S4 has simple, flowing lines, whilst retaining the dramatic elegance people expect from Audi. The interior is even more fabulous. Even in somber black, the S4's interior delights with gorgeous <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birchwood.html" title="Birchwood">Birchwood</a> trim, red-illuminated lights, simple yet graceful guages, supple leather sport seats, silver piping and leather trim all around. The design is straightforward, and yet it portrays a sense of elegance that you would find in a luxury sedan that is three times the price. This car is truly a jack-of-all-trades.</p>
<p>The real pleasure starts, however, when you turn the key. A low V8 grumble reaches the driver's ears, and the car roars to life. It is quite fast, and knows how to handle it when the road gets twisty, or wet-- courtesy of Audi's legendary <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quattro.html" title="Quattro">quattro</a> all-wheel-drive system. That is something neither of its main rivals can boast about. There is also quite a wide torque band from the award-winning V8, and you can have mid-range punch throughout your drive.</p>
<p>The S4 Cabriolet is the perfect complement to the S4 sedan and <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avant.html" title="Avant">Avant</a>, and this author can see nothing better for the price. The combination of eye-catching, simplistic style, luxurious interior (an Audi hallmark), and V8 power, this car is something to lust after.</p>

<p>Phi Tau Beta is a funky, experimental jam band from Alpharetta, GA, in which a mix of hard rock and punk clash with reggae acoustic jazz.</p>
<p>BIO: The original creators of the band, Joe Winograd (A.K.A. Ja-Lopy) and Corey Walker, begin experimenting with some bass riffs and drum fills in 2002. The original band name was "Cannibal Surplus," and thus, the band was created.</p>
<p>The start of 2003, Cannibal Surplus was looking for a guitarist, and they found good friend Brian O' Saben. They began to play Blink-182 covers, along with some oldies. Their first "show" was a talent show, in which the band played "Reckless Abandon" by Blink-182. In the next year, Cannibal Surplus changed their name to "Poss!" which is hebrew for 'band.' They tried a new song for the 2004 talent show. Poss! played "American Idiot" by Green Day.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2005, Poss! met guitarists Andrew Rose and Nate Simone, who were already experimenting with funk and metal. Also, the band changed their name to "Phi Tau Beta." The name is the greek letters that stand for FTB, or Forbid The Bacon.</p>
<p>As of 2006, Phi Tau Beta was recording. Their first and only two recorded originals are "Chinchilla," an up-beat jam song similar to those of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and the other song is "Organ Donor," a hard and heavy rock song with an organ intro to begin the mood.</p>

<p>Take Strokes Off Your Game by Practicing Katherine Robert's Yoga for Golfers ™</p>
<p>Toronto, Ontario, May 10, 2006 — Golfers in Toronto who are trying Yoga For Golfers™ classes instructed by Debbie Horovitch – Toronto’s first yoga instructor certified personally by Katherine Roberts in her Scottsdale, Arizona location – are reporting dramatic increases in flexibility &amp; strength, more balance &amp; power in their swing that immediately helps reduce the number strokes per round.</p>
<p>Mike, a Yoga For Golfers™ student at the Adelaide Club recently shared his Yoga For Golfers™ success story: "I’m currently playing to a 12 handicap, drive the ball 265-270 on average. After just one class with Yoga for Golfers, I found two major improvements in two consecutive rounds. Specifically my short to mid iron game, without even knowing it, I was able to get the club to the top of my back swing with ease and in combination with the breathing exercises (again subconsciously) recoil my body with an effortless tempo….key result was my ability to control ball flight, high-low what ever the situation required. Both rounds I scored 5 strokes better than average, but maybe the best part of all is an increased confidence level over the golf shot. For the record I’m not a gadget, watch video’s how to improve your game type guy, I just like to go out and play. What intrigued me about this was that I’ve always had an interest in Yoga (primarily for the long to term benefits) but never the courage nor the time, as a lover of the game, simply attaching the word Golf to it and concentration of the “core” (which is the golf swing), was enough for me to try it.”</p>
<p>The unique Yoga For Golfers™ program has been featured in Golf Magazine, GolfOnline.com, Golf For Women and The Golf Channel. The launch of Yoga For Golfers™ in Toronto was first announced in The National Post (March 11, ‘06) and has since been featured in Centre of The City Magazine (April ’06) and will be seen in upcoming issues of FAME Fitness &amp; Lifestyle Magazine (May ‘06), Ruby Magazine (May ‘06) and on CFRB 1010 The John Donabie Show on May 14, ’06.</p>
<p>Golfers everywhere - of all ability levels - are using yoga to increase flexibility and enjoy improved fitness both on and off the course. Yoga, as a component of physical and mental conditioning, continues to take the PGA Tour by storm as one of the golf world's hottest fitness tools. PGA Tour pros Brad Faxon, Jonathan Kaye, Andrew Magee, Gary McCord, JL Lewis, Aaron Baddely, David Gossett, Ty Tryon, Chip Beck and the LPGA's Julie Inkster, Jill McGill, and Betsy King are leading the way in promoting the benefits that golfers can reap from incorporating yoga into their golf fitness plan.</p>
<p>Golfers have praised Roberts' Yoga For Golfers™ program for delivering a wide range of benefits including better performance on the course and better health off the course.</p>
<p>Students practising Yoga For Golfers™ experience these benefits: Improved flexibility and strength = Greater distance and accuracy off the tee Enhanced breathing awareness = Teaching rhythm and tempo in the golf swing Quieter mind = Increased concentration and visualization capabilities Improved overall fitness = Reduced risk of injury and recovery time Increased sense of balance = More effective club control/weight distribution</p>
<p>Yoga For Golfers™ group classes dive deeper into the wide variety of yoga postures each of which have golf-specific benefits - to help you develop the strength, flexibility &amp; balance you'll want, to play better this year than ever before!</p>
<p>Students who are ready to experience the awesome benefits of yoga on their game and life can try a class in the following ways / GTA locations: • Debbie Horovitch is available to lead groups through at your corporate or private tournament, group size from 4 – 200: minimum $250/day; determined by number of students • Private on-site classes throughout the GTA, evenings &amp; weekends: 4 classes = $300 • FAME Fitness And Model Expo 2006, Yoga For GolfersTM demonstrations and Workshops throughout the June 17 &amp; 18 weekend at the International Centre: $25 - $45 per class www.FAMEevents.com • Group classes are open to everyone (non-members are welcomed) at downtown gyms, rates vary: $10 - $30 per class; see www.YogaForGolfers.net for schedule &amp; locations • Complementary Class Passes &amp; YFG Prize Packs available for tournaments: FREE</p>
<p>The First Tee stretch sequence utilizes the golf cart and clubs. These postures should be done before, during and after the round. Keep the muscles loose by stretching continuously throughout the round. You will be more consistent, have more speed and power in the swing and maintain the necessary endurance.</p>
<p>Downward Dog with Golf Cart:</p>
<p>This pose warms up the shoulders, low back, hamstrings and the Achilles tendons. This pose supports push-off power and a solid foundation. Facing the front of the cart, place the hands wider than shoulder width apart. Step the feet back, creating a ninety degree angle in the hips. Roll the shoulders back away from the ears and flex the quads. Hold for five breaths.</p>
<p>Warrior Crescent Lunge:</p>
<p>Working the hip flexors, psoas, quads and gluts, give more extension and power by supporting full hip extension. Bringing the left leg onto the back of the cart, come up onto the right toes. Engage the right buttocks and press the right hip towards the cart.</p>
<p>Seated Twist:</p>
<p>This is a great pose to keep the core and shoulders loose-a great pose to be done at every hole! Bring the body to the edge of the seat, sitting up as straight as possible. Bring the left hand to the right knee and the right hand behind you to increase the intensity. Hold for five breaths and switch sides.</p>

He is known in skate circles as one of the greatest street skaters of all-time.</p>
<p>Williams discovered skateboarding when some kids made a bet that they could pick any stranger and teach them how to ollie. Stevie was only ten years old when the kids picked him and in forty minutes he was ollieing curbs. After taking the bet and shutting up the skate kids, young Stevie and his board became one. When a friend of his invited him to Philly's Love Park, Stevie found the place that would mold him into the skater he is today.</p>
<p>It was at Love Park that Stevie met future star Josh Kalis and their friendship marked a new era in street skateboarding. Kalis wanted to change the sport of skateboarding, so he packed up for San Francisco and he knew Stevie would help him do it. At the young age of thirteen, with barely any money and a desire to pursue a dream, Stevie hitchhiked to Califronia, to try and become a professional skateboarder. Arriving in San Francisco, he quickly learned how to live and survive on the streets. He lived and practiced with a number of skaters including Kalis and moved into a run-down apartment with six other kids.</p>
<p>Now 25 years old</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-22_b389.html" title="Edit section: THE “FIGHT FOR RIGHT” CAMPAIGN">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">THE “FIGHT FOR RIGHT” CAMPAIGN</span></h2>
<p>The “Fight For Right” was the beginning of the ‘Human Rights Movement’ as we know them today. It was the first “Campaign for Human Rights” that actively used and popularized use of the term ‘Human Rights” in 1915. Before the second world war that expression was not in use. It was launched, somewhat improbably, by a noted imperialist, Colonel Sir Francis Edward Younghusband (31 May 1863 - 31 July 1942) who is, better known for his invasion of Tibet in 1904.</p>
<p>The Fight for Right campaign commissioned the hymn “Jerusalem” as its anthem. It was assembled from a poem by William Blake from the preface to his work “Milton: a Poem” (1804). The music was written by C. Hubert and H. Parry in 1916. The most famous version was written by Sir Edward Elgar in 1922.</p>
<p>This commission achieved its goal of being an inspiration to the human rights movement and has become one of England's most popular patriotic songs, often being used as an alternative anthem and is the official anthem of the British National Party and the British Women's Institute. Historically it was sung at public gatherings of the National Union of Suffrage Societies, in their “Fight for Equality and Right,” and today it is sung at the beginning of English Cricket and Rugby League matches as well as other British sporting events</p>
<p>The poem was inspired by the “Da Vinci Code” style legend that Jesus accompanied Joseph of Arimathea to Glastonbury. This is a legend that both Blake and Younghusband firmly believed in. There is some speculation about the line, “Among those dark Satanic mills?” as possibly referring to the Pagan origins of Britton, yet both Blake and Younghusband had sympathetic Pagan leanings. Given the purpose that the song was commissioned for, it is generally accepted as indicating any organization that suppressed human rights with the implied allegory that ‘Christ Consciousness’ will overcome human rights violations in the end. Sporting fans who sing this hymn at competitions see this line as referring to the opposing team. The title of the film “Chariots of Fire” was taken from a line in this hymn which says : "Bring me my chariot of fire"</p>
<p>Contemporary versions have been recorded by the British pop-novelty Fat Les, The Pet Shop Boys, Emerson Lake and Palmer, singer Bruce Dickinson from Iron Maiden, The Fall, Billy Bragg and composer Robert Steadman. In the United States, the music has been set to American patriotic lyrics which was most notably performed at Ronald Reagan's funeral.</p>
<p>LYRICS And did those feet in ancient time Walk upon England's mountains green? And was the holy Lamb of God On England's pleasant pastures seen? And did the Countenance Divine Shine forth upon our clouded hills? And was Jerusalem builded here Among those dark Satanic mills?</p>
<p>Bring me my bow of burning gold! Bring me my arrows of desire! Bring me my spear! O clouds, unfold! Bring me my chariot of fire! I will not cease from mental fight Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand Till we have built Jerusalem In England's green and pleasant land</p>

<p>The Escanaba &amp; Lake Superior Railroad was founded in 1899 to serve the thriving lumber industry of the Central Upper Peninsula of Michigan.</p>
<p><b>Bold text</b> Original mainline and Escanaba branch<b>Bold text</b></p>
<p>The railroad's original mainline was built from Wells, Michigan to Watson, Michigan; then extended from Watson to Channing, Michigan and a connection with the Milwaukee Road. Communities served along the original mainline include Cornell, Watson, and Ralph. There were also several short logging branch-lines off the mainline which have been abandoned for decades.</p>
<p>Besides hauling sawlogs, passengers, and general freight, the E &amp; LS also served as host to the Milwaukee Road's ore trains. The Milwaukee Road operated an isolated ore-dock facility in Escanaba, Michigan until the 1930's, and ran over the E &amp; LS to get to it from the mines of the Menominee Iron Range.</p>
<p>After the Milwaukee Road abandoned their ore-docks, the E &amp; LS remained a profitable line serving local customers. A branch-line was built from Flat Rock Jct. near Escanaba River dam #1, to downtown Escanaba. This served dozens of customers in the Escanaba area, and would be the backbone of the E &amp; LS for years to come. The P &amp; H crane factory in Escanaba would become the major customer along this branch. The Escanaba Paper Company, adjacent to Groos Yard in Escanaba, would also be a major E &amp; LS customer for years to come.</p>
<p>In the late 1950's, the E &amp; LS dropped passenger service from their railroad. Due to highway construction and lack of revenue, it was no longer profitable to operate mixed trains.</p>
<p>In the 1970's, after a strike at the Escanaba Paper Company, the E &amp; LS lost it's contract to provide service to the mill. The spur into the mill was removed, and the E &amp; LS faced hard times for the near future. The closing of the P &amp; H factory in Escanaba heightened the problem. The Soo Line began handling all freight for the Escanaba Paper Company (then Mead Papers, now New Page). Other customers along the mainline and Escanaba branch also ceased shipping by rail, until only a few customers were left.</p>
<p>The closing of the P &amp; H factory was initially negative, but the E &amp; LS purchased 2 builings at the former factory, and coverted one into a state of the art freight-car repair shop. They now handle repairs for a large ELS leasing fleet, as well as repairs for foreign railroads and leasing fleets. The carshop is now the primary source of traffic for the E &amp; LS in the Escanaba area.</p>
<p>Other customers on the Escanaba branch and mainline have all but faded away, however. In fact, the only active customer in Escanaba as of 2006 is DeCock propane, just south of Flat Rock Jct. on the Escanaba branch. The southernmost mile of the branch, once very busy, has been removed. The last active customer along this stretch was Coplin's scrapyard in Escanaba.</p>
<p>Customers along the mainline have also faded, and the E &amp; LS ran their last thru-train along the original mainline in the early 1990's. They now have trackage rights over the CN to reach the Escanaba area. The original mainline is active from Wells to Cornell, and from Ralph to Channing; but the portion in the middle has not seen a train in over a decade.</p>
<p><b>Bold text</b>Wells shops<b>Bold text</b></p>
<p>In contrast to the modern carshops at the old P &amp; H factory, the shops at Wells near Escanaba date to the beginning of the railroad. The complex consists of 2 roundhouses back-to-back, a 2-stall carshop, a machine-shop, and a depot/office building. The south-roundhouse, machine-shop, and offices are still active. All moderate to heavy locomotive repairs for the railroad are handled at the south-roundhouse. The roundhouse is beleived to be the last in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.</p>
<p>In addition to the original buildings, the E &amp; LS purchased a former sawmill building north of the yard in Wells, and coverted this into a sandblast and paint shop. They currently repaint their own equipment, as well as equipment for foreign railroads and leasing companies there.</p>
<p>A large collection of inoperable locomotives are also stored at Wells shops. These locomotives represent one of the largest collections of Baldwin diesels anywhere.</p>
<p><b>Bold text</b>1980 aquisition<b>Bold text</b></p>
<p>In 1980, the E &amp; LS purchased hundreds of miles of former Milwaukee Road track in northern Wisconsin and Upper Michigan. These lines stretched from Green Bay, Wis. to Republic, Mich.; Channing, Mich. to Ontonagon, Mich.; and Crivitz, Wis. to Marinette, Wis.</p>
<p>In addition to these mainlines, the E &amp; LS aquired an isolated branch-line in Menominee, Mich. and the Groveland Mine branch near Sagola, Mich.</p>
<p>The E &amp; LS also purchased a branch-line for Sidnaw, Mich. to Nestoria, Mich. in the mid-1990's from the Wisconsin Central Railraod. This line saw very little use, and is now still intact but only used for car storage. The E &amp; LS also purchased a short ex-CNW branch-line from Stiles Jct., Wis. to Oconto Falls, Wis. which sees regular use, serving several shippers in Oconto Falls.</p>
<p>The ex-Milwaukee Road track, however, is now the backbone of the E &amp; LS. The primary customers providing the railroad with freight are Smurfit-Stone Container in Ontonagon, Mich. and Lousiana-Pacific in Sagola, Mich. Several customers are also served in Marinette, Wis., including Kimberley Clark Papers. In Menominee, Mich. the E &amp; LS served the K &amp; K Warehouse, Great Lakes Pulp &amp; Fiber, and the Menominee Papers mill. Several other customers along these lines also generate significant traffic.</p>
<p>Although greatly expanded, the E &amp; LS also regained it's traditional role as a logging railroad when these lines weree aquired. Pulpwood and sawlogs are loaded at several location along the ex-Milwaukee Road tracks, and shipped to papermills and sawmills throughout the midwest.</p>
<p><b>Bold text</b>Depots<b>Bold text</b></p>
<p>The E &amp; LS has many old depots along it's tracks, some owned by the railroad and some not. Here is a list of those beleived to be standing, some still active for railroad use as noted:</p>
<p>Escanaba, Michigan; inactive; along abandoned portion of Escanaba branch; private business Wells, Michigan; active; adjacent to Wells yard; offices for railroad N. Escanaba, Michigan; inactive, along Escanaba branch, office of Bichler Concrete Channing, Michigan; active; adjacent to Channing Yard Randville, Michigan; inactive; private home Iron Mountain, Michigan; inactive; downtown Iron Mountain, owned by railroad (?) Pembine, Wisconsin; inactive; at diamond where ELS crosses WC Crivitz, Wisconsin; active; adjacent to Y, unknown use Stiles Jct., Wisconsin; inactive; adjacent to former diamond, very poor condition Amasa, Michigan; inactive Ontonagon, Michigan; active; adjacent to Ontonagon Yard, agent's office Marinette, Wisconsin; inactive; private business, former ELS agent's office</p>
<p><b>Bold text</b>Car storage<b>Bold text</b></p>
<p>Besides revenue freight and car repairs, the E &amp; LS also gains revenue by providing storage service for freight-cars. When cars are not needed by large leasing companies, the E &amp; LS will store cars for a fee on unused tracks.</p>
<p>Common places to see storage cars are the mainline from Channing to Witch Lake, Michigan; the branch from Sidnaw to Watton, Michigan; the mainline from Escanaba to Cornell, Michigan; the Groveland Mine branch near Sagola, Michigan; and the mainline from Channing to Ralph, Michigan. Cars are also stored on unused sidings and yard tracks throughout the system.</p>
<p><b>Bold text</b>Locomotives<b>Bold text</b></p>
<p>The E &amp; LS is famous for Baldwins, but as of 2006 only 2 of these diesels are active; RS12 #300 and DS-4-4-1000 #202. The rest are stored inactive around Escanaba. #300 is seldom used.</p>
<p>The core of the E &amp; LS fleet is now EMD locomotives, but the fleet is still very unique.</p>
<p>FP7 #600 wears Wisconsin &amp; Southern paint, and can be seen in regular freight service. SD9's #1220-1224 wear Reserve Mining paint, but only #1221, 1223, and 1224 are active in regular service. GP38's #400 &amp; 401 are used; 400 in ELS paint and 401 in Conrail paint. SD40-2's #500 &amp; 501 round-out the roster, both in EMD-leasing paint.</p>
<p>Another often overlooked member of the E &amp; LS is Plymouth switcher #1, which is usually found switching the rip-track at Crivitz yard.</p>

<p>Nathan Alan Summers was born and raised in Rochester, New York. Growing up in suburban West Irondequoit, Nathan (now commonly known as "Nate"), made friends with other children his age in his neighborhood. Nathan and his friends passed time playing a myriad of sports; including soccer, street hockey, football, and track. Then, at nearly thirteen (13) years old, Nathan and his family moved from their home in Rochester, New York, to their current home in Kingsport, Tennessee. Since graduating high school, Nathan now attends the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, where he is majoring in Biomedical Engineering. There, he plays on the school's club ultimate frisbee team and enjoys a game of disc golf every now and then. Nathan recently acquired a new five string Schecter bass guitar, which he greatly enjoys. The future holds many promises for Nathan Summers. He is considering attending medical school after graduating from UT, but sees graduate school for engineering as a possibility as well. No one knows for sure what the future may bring, but we may rest assured that Nathan Summers will be a part of it.</p>
