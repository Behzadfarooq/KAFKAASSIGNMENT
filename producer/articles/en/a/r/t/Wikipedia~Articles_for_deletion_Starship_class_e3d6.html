<p>This page is an indescriminate collection of information in violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> as the author(s) have randomly chosen several fictional universes and listed ships from said universes.

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't think it's random, so much as incomplete. Possible needs a clarification to Fictional Starship classes (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_spaceships.html" title="List of fictional spaceships">List of fictional spaceships</a>). And maybe better criteria. But on the whole, I find it useful enough to meet <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELISTS_2571.html" title="WP:LISTS">WP:LISTS</a> and better than a category since it allows for quicker red-link access. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:54, 23 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The first problem with this line of analysis is that this is not a list, but an article. Now that, of course, can be resolved by renaming it, and if this article is kept, it should be renamed. As to your second point, it is doubtful that this list will ever be complete, so it remains random due to its incompleteness. Furthermore, it is indescriminate whether complete or not, as the items on the list have no relation to each other except that they all happen to be fictional. As for usefulness, how is it useful? Articles relating to each individual fictional universe undoubtably already has this kind of information, so it is not useful in that sense. Any one looking for a specific ship or type of ship in wikipedia are unlikely to look up a list named "starship class" or "fictional starship class." I cannot fathom that anyone would need to see all this information in one place, and even if they did, it would still fail <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 03:16, 23 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's an article versus a list? I'm afraid I don't see the difference. You'll have to explain what you mean. And I'm sorry, but it's pretty obvious to me what the conection of the items are is, they are all classes of Starships in various fictional environments. Now you may think the entries are random, but that's not true at all. They are all spaceships from more or less notable series, grouped by series. Given that people are most likely to do what they know first, and what attracts interest to them, I completely expect such things to go first. Yes, it's not very systematic, but somewhat haphazard. That's the nature of Wikipedia sometimes. That's also why I agree it's doubtful the list will ever be complete, as I doubt that Wikipedia will ever be complete. People are creating new content every day, but I doubt it's increasing at the same pace of new things to include are. However, I point to this example of people wanting to look at Starships <a href="http://www.merzo.net/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.merzo.net/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> presented as a visual comparison to size. If people want to do that(Slashdot and Sci-Fi Weekly both gave it a nod)), I can easily imagine someone wanting to look at it on Wikipedia. I certainly think it's useful. Perhaps some people might work backwards from it as well, if they're looking to compare several classes or genres. It's certainly no less useful than numerous other lists. You may not find it useful, I however, disagree. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 04:26, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Never mind about the article/list thing, I figured it out. And yes, I agree it should be moved to something like List of Fictional Starship Classes, but I do not feel it needs to be deleted.</li>

Articles on the individual science-fiction franchises will inevitably be very thorough, but compiling an all-encompassing and comparative list of fictitious spaceships is ridiculous.

<dd>Doesn't seem original thought to me. At most, it's a transference of the Naval <a href="../../../s/h/i/Ship_class.html" title="Ship class">Ship class</a> article to Starships. Something that would seem to be well, obvious from the fact that numerous documents on the fictional works say "This is a class of Starships" or equivalent. But hey, you want to redirect to <a href="../../../s/h/i/Ship_class.html" title="Ship class">Ship class</a> go right ahead. I agree, though, that eventually breakdown by fictional universe will be helpful. Since that's already being done though, I don't see the point in objecting, however. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:22, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not only are the first sentences original thought, they are not even provably true. Show me one place in a Star Wars, Star Trek, Firefly, Battlestar Galactica, etc. source where any of the following is stated, and I quote from the article: "By tradition, [a class] are [<i>sic'</i>] named after its first ship, known as the lead or class ship. Classes of starships, like their naval counterparts, are used to save effort and money; it's considerably easier and cheaper to build multiple units to the same design than to develop a unique plan for every individual starship. It also simplifies maintenance, training, and procurement of spares (not inconsiderable factors for any service)." While this is certainly ture when it comes to the real world, no proof exists that any of it is true in these fictional universes. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 05:36, 23 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hmm, so what you're saying is that the information is transference from the real world? Sorry, but I don't see how that fits the criteria of original thought. It does for example, apply to Star Trek, if you look at some of the technical books for it, like the Star Trek Encyclopedia (or see <a href="http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/library/ships/article/71885.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/library/ships/article/71885.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> for something on the web. It is minor, but it's what I can easily find online.) So at most, it's a little overbroad, since it might not apply to every example. Feel free to rewrite it, I could concur with that, as I do think the article itself is slipshop. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 13:56, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Even when it can be observed in practice? I can accept some distancing from it, since it may not be true in every case, and I did try to reword the statement accordingly, but I'm sorry I just cannot concur with you that it's original research. It's observation of readily apparent information, justified sometimes by outright statements (see some of the Trek books for examples).

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is PRECISELY what Wikipedia is good at. Our strength is in chronicling those corners of popular culture which might not end up in any "real" (ie, formally published) encylopedia, but are of major interest to users in certain fields. this page serves another vital role of such articles; ie, it serves as a forum and convergence point for fans of one genre through many different works, shows, franchises, etc, etc. Therefore, i feel strongly that we should keep this. Why shouldn't this be worth keeping precisely because of the people most interested in it, precisely as it is, such as, for example, science-fiction fans, budding writers, or those interested in the broad shape and pattern of speculative fiction, etc?</li>
