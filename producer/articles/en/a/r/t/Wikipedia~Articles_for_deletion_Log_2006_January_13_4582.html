<li><b>Weak delete</b> . Why those particular selected FPSs? It seems completely arbitrary. Of course without that distinction, the list would be incredibly long.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I say it's a nice comprehensive list, however several game articles have a weapons list that should be put into this article. Also, I've put a LOT of work into the article, and to see it removed would make me disappointed. Maybe a rename such as List of real-life weapons in video games could work? Because then we don't have to limit it to just first-person shooters, and maybe third-person shooter games (and certain other games such as <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resident_Evil_%28game%29_631a.html" title="Resident Evil (game)">Resident Evil</a>) could be listed as well. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonicBH_369d.html" title="User:TonicBH">TonicBH</a> 20:34, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>From <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: "Lists of tropical cyclone names is encyclopedic; "Tropical Storm Alex (2010)" is not, even though it is virtually certain that a storm of that name will occur in the North Atlantic and will turn counterclockwise." That seems to match future eclipses perfectly. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 15:55, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, it's not a perfect match. While the chance of a tropical storm occuring in 2010 is extremely high, the chance that future eclipses will happen is orders of magnitude more likely. You could almost say as likely as the sun will rise tomorrow morning.&#160;:) Unless some *extremely* improbable event happens, such as the Earth being destroyed by <a href="../../../v/o/g/Voguns.html" title="Voguns">Voguns</a>, these eclipses will happen. I still wouldn't link to the dates, however.

<li>Maybe I've misinterpreted, but I interpreted that sentence, specifically "<i>even though</i> it is virtually certain", to mean that crystal balling does not necessarily exclude articles about subjects that are certain to happen. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 19:14, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The exact wording is, "Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place." Basically what it would take to alter this schedule is a collision with a very large comet - a collision on a scale neither the earth nor moon have experienced in hundreds of millions of years.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well that's exactly my point. The <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse.html" title="Solar eclipse">Solar eclipse</a> article already has a list of recent and upcoming (to 2020) eclipses across the world. The question I ask to the Wikipedia community in this AFD is whether or not a separate article is needed for China, with eclipses ranging from 1001 to 3000. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonel_Cow_7b4f.html" title="User:Colonel Cow">Colonel Cow</a> 03:34, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Solar eclipses can be seen from worldwide area is very different from solar eclipses can be seen from a specific location. For worldwide, total solar eclipses are common, about once every one or two years, but for a specific location, they are very rare events, about once every 300 years. So it makes sense to list these rare events in a separated article. — Yaohua2000 09:44, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But one could just check the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse.html" title="Solar eclipse">Solar eclipse</a> page and look for eclipses in their region of the world (it says where the eclipse will happen on that page). Now, it doesn't go as far into the future as this article, but whether or not a list really needs to go to 3000 is a separate debate (which I'm sure those at the Solar eclipse page have already debated). --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonel_Cow_7b4f.html" title="User:Colonel Cow">Colonel Cow</a> 14:01, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I always wondering when I can see a total solar eclipse in my hometown when I was a child, total eclipse is rather rare, and it is not easy for a layman to work it out with enough precision, for people with similar questions, this article focuses on the previous and next total and annular solar eclipses from a specific location on the Earth, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse.html" title="Solar eclipse">Solar eclipse</a> doesn't contain such information, and such information is also rare on the web. Wikipedia and this article gives the answer. So I think it is useful, and perhaps encyclopedic, if it has a worldwide view some time, it can be a great article. — Yaohua2000 20:26, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse.html" title="Solar eclipse">Solar eclipse</a> does in fact have that information (or is being added). If I were someone in New York, I could go to the Solar eclipse article and look for the next time an eclipse will occur for me in that list (by looking for "North America"). Same thing if I were anywhere in the world. If I were in Beijing, I'd go and look for eclipses under Asia. Solar eclipse already has this worldwide view that you speak of, and so pages like this aren't needed in my opinion. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonel_Cow_7b4f.html" title="User:Colonel Cow">Colonel Cow</a> 21:01, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you did some research on this topic, you might not think so. Absolute most (&gt; 95%) total solar eclipses in North America is not total in New York. Even in Beijing, Beijing municipality is far smaller than North America, but during A.D. 1001 and A.D. 2000 period <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beijing&amp;oldid=30993185#Astronomical_phenomena" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beijing&amp;oldid=30993185#Astronomical_phenomena" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, 7 total eclipses occured from somewhere in the municipality, but only one visible in the urban area. So for someone only check total eclipses visible in North America, or even State of New York doesn't make so much sense to total eclipses in New York City. — Yaohua2000 21:33, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So then a column on the Solar eclipse page e.g. "Total eclipse viewable in" would be a good idea, but it still doesn't change that a list about China itself (when the information could be put on the Solar eclipse page and represent a worldwide view) is "listcruft" in my opinion, as Sceptre put it. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonel_Cow_7b4f.html" title="User:Colonel Cow">Colonel Cow</a> 21:41, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You can create such a column in <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse.html" title="Solar eclipse">solar eclipse</a>, but make this column as a separated article would be better. — Yaohua2000 22:18, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and keep the future listings too. Eclipses are one of the very few things that really are predictable. Physics and mathematics do not equal a crystal ball. I'm going to go out on a limb here because my father was a NASA scientist and I grew up with this sort of stuff. I see what these list creators are doing and it makes a lot of sense. There should be more lists like this for other major cities. The information at <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse.html" title="Solar eclipse">solar eclipse</a> is too general to be useful for eclipse enthusiasts. These are people who spend thousands of dollars and plan years in advance so that they can observe the real show during a solar eclipse, and by that I mean the very small path of totality where the sky goes dark. This sort of person would want to know, "Will there be a total eclipse in my metropolitan area during my lifetime?" If they're likely to be alive for the next one, then that saves a small fortune. These people would use a series of similar lists because they would designate easy points of travel: nearly two-thirds of the earth's surface is ocean and some of the rest is pretty uninhabitable. I believe this year's total eclipse will be in the Sahara desert. Solar eclipses are about the most verifiable information on earth and they're unquestionably notable. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 07:10, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> on 3 points.

Third point: Even though I am really keen on physics and astronomy as a hobby, this kind of info qualifies as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">an indiscriminate collection of information</a> and really belongs on some astronomy website, where the information probably comes from. Taken to one extreme, if this article is kept then similar articles <i>for every country in the world</i> would be equally acceptable and IMHO is overkill. Taken to another extreme, since prediction of eclipses is not crystal balling, predictions from the beginning of time to the end of time would be equally valid, and <b><a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28numbers%29_3077.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)">Wikipedia is not infinite</a></b>.

<li>If you carried that reasoning to its logical conclusion Wikipedia would become a very small project supported only by journal articles and books.

<p>I had to look up vanispamcruftisement - unfortunately that website represents part of the logo which has only just been submitted to Melbourne IT for a .com.au domain, it has been approved but takes 72 hours. This page has been put up initially so that members of SR can contribute information as they have been allocated.</p>

I believe that the article's statement that the person in a professional wrestler in Canada's Northern Championship Wrestling makes this an improper CSD but I am listing it here out of courtesy to the editor whose speedy tag I removed. No vote at this time. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/s/1/User_talk%7EDS1953_dfdb.html" title="User talk:DS1953"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup> 06:06, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Abstain</b>. I see where the speedy nominator comes from. It makes a claim to notability, but really doesn't say anything useful apart from that. CSD A1 was appropriate, but if anyone is willing to add a line or two of basic information, I'd be happy to keep this without reservations. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 10:34, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

There might be a claim of notability in the article since it says their film was well-received in many places, but it's hard to check since the film's name isn't mentioned in the article and looks to be a hoax.

<li>Sarhad Ke Par Dosti is not a hoax-i saw the movie on google video and was pleased by the quality of the film. These people have obviously put hard work into making this movie.

<li>Raj again, sorry for the somewhat uncivilized comment. Obviously the movie isn't a hoax. There are images, a poster and everything for the movie. I e-mailed FOB Productions and told them about this. They said that their movie was only reaseled through Desi people through hiearchal <a href="../../../d/i/f/Diffusion.html" title="Diffusion">diffusion</a>. They never had a website or a page for Sarhad Ke Par Dosti, as they did simple chartiable work and didn't bother with webpages. Just cause google does not index something does not mean its a fake. If people are going to base reality on what Google says, then i think that there might me a little bit of a problem with that. I am pretty sure if u type in "The Sky is always Hot Pink" im sure you'll get some hits...and as the wikipedia article said, there was a technical dificulty and the video was accidently removed from Google Video. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.1.25.54 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.1.25.54_b495.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.1.25.54">contribs</a>) 2006-01-13 02:26:05 UTC.</small>

<li>FOB Productions is a valid production company with a release to its name. As seen in the article, Sarhad Ke Par Dosti is its debut release.

<li>Raj again: There is always their e-mail source. If their own e-mails are not proof. Then there is no proof. Does culture chartity organizations that don't have google webpages have to not have articles on wikipedia?. The Desi population is dissapointed. I vote <b>Keep</b> article just like most of the other Desi (i think?) commenters here. the rest is up to wikipedia. The nuggets page thing is completly irrelevant. This page is obviously, as seen by it, not just random links to other pages. It has its own content. And to make up all that stuff seems very unlikely. If this article is deleted, what you would have done was destroy, as someone else said of FOB Productions "symbol of the hope and achievements of the Desi pop". Tell me, Does it harm you in any way is Desi's find pride by having this page up?

<li><b>Delete</b>. As per the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> guidelines, <i><b>"Verifiability, not truth"</b></i>. We have a complete lack of third party sources, which means the only people who can tell us the 'truth' are the subjects of the article, and that is <i><b>a bad thing</b></i>. The movie's name doesn't respond in Google. The producers, FOB Productions, score a grand total of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22FOB+Productions%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22FOB+Productions%22" rel="nofollow">7 unique Google responses</a>, which include a model hiring service, advertising for the model service, the Yahoo Group for the model service, the releaser of a hip-hop album titled "FOB", a newsletter of some description, and someone that wants me to install a virused toolbar. If you could provide one relevant website (not created by this production company), or even one article in a newspaper about the film or the company that we can track down and confirm, I'm sure your case would be a lot stronger. Yelling at us and thrusting an email address at us is not going to help you, and will probably hurt. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> - The <a href="../../../z/o/i/Zoids.html" title="Zoids"><font color="blue">Zoids</font></a> Expansion Project 04:28, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The purpose of any encyclopedia is to document the truth. lack of verification <i>on the internet</i> is not valid lack of verification, for there exists a world outside of the internet. there is no possible way to cite FOB productions (barring email, which is deemed invalid by many of you) on the internet; it exists in tangible form, it just doesnt happen to be on the internet, seeing as how its not a syndicated movie (how would it get on the internet?), and done on an extremely small scale. nevertheless, it exists. anonymous testimony (it is not as though personal information will increase verifiability) is all that exists on the internet, but there is no other kind of testimony of verification that can possibly be transferred to a web site. Furthermore, there is no reason, evidence, or suspicion to doubt its existence. this is not a "guilty until proven innocent" trial. -Korok
<ul>
<li>Which is why I suggested a newspaper article, if one has been written on the movie or the company, be brought to our attention. Newspapers aren't online, but it isn;t too difficult for someone to contact the paper publisher and ask "Did your newspaper print an article on FOB Productions on the *insert date here*?". They look through their records, they say yes we did or no we didn't... and bingo.

</li>
<li>I must agree, that Korok person has a fair point. and those FOB productions sites on google are not the same and as far as anyone can tell, this is a different type of FOB productions. this is a chartiy thing, not a model site or something..and if more screenshots from the movie, or if posting the trailer up will help everyone believe the credibility of FOB Productions then i will get the trailers and put them up. Maybe ill do that right now. --Raj</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Failure to provide a third-party source of verification means it gets my delete vote as a vanity. It may be a charitable vanity, but it's vanity nonetheless. In addition I add a plea that the ones striving to get this article kept stop assuming that everyone who votes against it are anti-charity in some way, or out to get you, or whatever paranoia is involved. As for the arguments that deleting the article will somehow "destroy a dream" and "the removal of this symbol of the hope and achievements of the Desi pop will definately not please them", how much of a dream can it be if it's destroyed simply because Wikipedia guidelines don't allow the article? How much of a symbol of hope is it if you start screaming it's some sort of discrimination or conspiracy not to have it here? As harsh as it may be to sum up the 'keep' arguements this way, perhaps Shakespeare put it best with "It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing." <a href="../../../n/e/z/User%7ENezu_Chiza_7976.html" title="User:Nezu Chiza">Nezu Chiza</a> 19:14, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That seems a bit off to what the website actually is. Wikipedia is dynamic right? What are the criteria is there for a webzine. Online publishing is not a small field, and while it is not the purpose here to argue the merits of online publishing, it seems as though the guidelines do not fit the page (for the catagory i mean). So I guess my question is: Is there actual guidelines for webzines or is it all grouped under the link you gave me? I'm just a bit unsure of how we are supposed to "prove it's worth" as it were for wiki, given other webzines grouped here. --chillinvillain</li>

<li>All of User:86.12.160.88's arguments so far have been arguments about adding further meanings to a dictionary article in a dictionary, such as <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sootie" class="extiw" title="wikt:sootie">sootie</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>.

This would further support the fact that anything that someone would want to know about something should be found somewhere in an encyclopedia.

<p>Deletion was requested by an anonymous editor (who, on the balance of evidence, I assume to be Amesbury herself.) The situation is that the subject is a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgendered.html" title="Transgendered">transgendered</a> woman who is primarily notable for two <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_40.html" title="Top 40">Top 40</a> hit singles that <i>predate</i> her gender transition. The anon editor three times attempted to rewrite the article to eliminate any acknowledgement of the transgender issue while still retaining credit for the songs, even though the songs are verifiably credited to a performer named "Bill" rather than Barbara. <a href="http://www.1050chum.com/index_chumcharts.aspx?artist=9256" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.1050chum.com/index_chumcharts.aspx?artist=9256" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>
<p>She then requested deletion when she was advised that the article could not simply pretend that she was known as Barbara at the time the songs charted, and thus the only options are either to acknowledge that she was once known as Bill, or to delete the article altogether since the songs are the main reason she's notable enough for an article in the first place.</p>
<p>Thus, my questions are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the subject of an article have the right to dictate what Wikipedia can or cannot write about her, if the dispute has more to do with personal image management than accuracy?</li>
<li>If so, then how else can Wikipedia handle the topic, given that we quite rightly <i>should</i> have an article on any performer who has had verifiable Top 40 hits?</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a procedural nomination because the request was made — personally, however, I do <b>not</b> favour deletion: the subject is legitimately notable and Wikipedia isn't doing its job if notable subjects can't be on here. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 02:10, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, notable performer. But perhaps you made her a promise you could not keep when you told her either the article acknowledges Bill or gets deleted? <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHollyAm_2189.html" title="User:HollyAm">HollyAm</a> 03:11, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't see how there are any other options...if Bill goes, the songs go too, and if the songs go, her entire basis for being notable enough to <i>have</i> a Wikipedia article goes with them. So there's simply no way this article can realistically be kept without the name Bill in it. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 03:25, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>You are right, but the version of the article up for deletion keeps the Bill references, so there is really no reason for anyone to vote for deletion. And I just got the feeling that she thinks it can be deleted just like that. <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHollyAm_2189.html" title="User:HollyAm">HollyAm</a> 04:14, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wait a minute. Are there any reliable sources establishing that Bill and Barbara Amesbury are the same person? It's not that I doubt it, but I don't think we can legitimately include this in the article without citing a reputable source, and the only sources I can find are <a href="http://www.queermusicheritage.com/oct2002s.html" class="external text" title="http://www.queermusicheritage.com/oct2002s.html" rel="nofollow">a queer radio show playlist</a> and <a href="http://bodzie.freeservers.com/history/feb.html" class="external text" title="http://bodzie.freeservers.com/history/feb.html" rel="nofollow">a freeservers website</a>. <a href="http://trooper.com/default.php?cat=gallery&amp;subcat=178" class="external text" title="http://trooper.com/default.php?cat=gallery&amp;subcat=178" rel="nofollow">Another website</a> credits the song itself to Bill Amesbury but adds, "Written by Barbara Amesbury," implying that they are <i>not</i> the same person. So I vote we <b>move</b> this to <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Amesbury_8d0e.html" title="Bill Amesbury">Bill Amesbury</a>, who is certainly notable, and <b>excise references to Barbara unless a reliable source is cited</b>, in which case I would be in favor of <b>keeping</b> the article. - <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdelaMae_b57f.html" title="User:AdelaMae">AdelaMae</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/d/e/User_talk%7EAdelaMae_cb14.html" title="User talk:AdelaMae">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AdelaMae_415e.html" title="Special:Contributions/AdelaMae">contribs</a>)</sup> 15:55, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Bill is Barbara; the writing credits on her songs were changed from Bill to Barbara after her name changed (which is an entirely normal thing — a songwriter who changes his or her name <i>always</i> has the option of having their past songwriting credits recredited to the new name.) The <i>performing</i> credit remained as Bill, however, because a male singing voice is a lot harder to gloss over. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:00, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> The idea that this article is 'non-noteable and not fit for an encyclopedia' is a matter of point of view. As far as the members of the forum the article is about are concerned it is extremely notable. We, as a whole, have worked to keep the entry in the correct writing style and with links to other Wikipedia article as needed. Also out of the three images in the article the one of Jack Thompson does in fact contain a caption, and the other two are obviously self-explanatory. The first image is the <i>main</i> image of the website and the second is the main image of the forum. As for the 'no other WP articles link to it' issue, the article has only been up and running for 2 days now, so that's not exactly very much time to be linked to by other articles. However we <i>are</i> listed in the Bulletin board systems, Virtual communities, &amp; Internet forums categories. This article is just as useful as others in those categories. –OptimumPx of GTA-SanAndreas.com 10:38 PM (EST), 12 January 2006 <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 4.153.232.121 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.153.232.121_5fd5.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.153.232.121">contribs</a>) 04:41, 13 January 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<dd><b>Rebuttle:</b> By all means correct me: I was under the impression that Wikipedia is a resource for information about an entity. This article aims to give a description of the site in question and gives background information which may be of interest to other potential website administrators, as well as users interested in the site. It is unlikely that the article would be accessed through any other reason than in a quest for information, and therefore is hardly advertising. On the contrary, it often shows the problems that sites go through - <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldenTie_0071.html" title="User:GoldenTie">GoldenTie</a> 23:11, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

But <b>keep</b> as a generally notable site. If the cruft comes back, my vote may change. Seriously, people.

<li>Perhaps a section on <i>Forum Subculture</i> might be an appropriate place to put recurring themes within the forum - e.g. the Redism movement.

<ul>
<li>No, it's just plain not interesting to people that people got pissed off at each other and banninated each other. There's nothing unique or interesting about it to anyone outside your forum. I would suggest creating your own wiki if you want to create a complete and detailed history of every single thing that ever happened on your forum. The "Redism controversy" is... two groups of people getting pissed off at each other on a forum. They had no impact on the broader world and they hold no interest to anyone outside your community. It's not going to help webmasters because it happens on every single forum, everywhere. Don't take this the wrong way, I'm sure it's of amazing import to you and the people on the forum... but to everyone else, it's just more forumdrama that happens on every single forum ever opened. You could write Ph.D dissertations on the forumdrama at some places I participate in, but it really doesn't belong on Wikipedia. What would be FAR more interesting and important to people on Wikipedia is a larger section on what GTA-SanAndreas.com offers to people who play the game - what sort of help can they get, what resources are offered, walkthroughs, whatnot. Every Web site with a forum has forumdrama, that's not unique. GTA-SanAndreas.com appears to offer a lot of great GTA:SA resources, and that is probably more unique, not to mention more interesting to anyone who's never visited your forums. Remember, Wikipedia is a general encyclopedia. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 18:10, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Don't take it too personally - one of the things that's broken on Wikipedia is the "cleanup" system. The quickest way to get attention for an article that is questionable in terms of content is... to put it up for deletion and get a consensus from a lot of people looking at the article. It's not elegant and it's way too confrontational but there you have it, until we come up with a better way of doing it. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 19:10, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> This page has only been created to clean up the 'prank flash' page, you can't split information out and then immediately delete it because it looks wrong on its own. This discussion's been had many times on List of Shock Sites and the proposal to delete has always been shouted down because people find this stuff informative. Take the links down and just leave the descriptions if that will help it fit policy better. - unsigned by User:194.200.167.69 07:43, 13 January 2006</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is not an entry on its own, but a link off the entry for prank flash. It's the result of cleaning up,not a new entry so of course it would be "unencyclopedic", since all the encyclopedic information is on the original entry.

<li><b>Keep</b>. He seems like somebody that people might want to find information about if they're interested. I'm sure he must show up in the credits for these shows - that must at least mean something. And I've heard of most of these shows. I think voice actors probably do not return big hits on google in the first place unless they do something other than voice acting that they are notable for. So I don't think hits on google is reliable in this case. -- <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERediahs_3520.html" title="User:Rediahs">Rediahs</a> 07:51, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Hmmmm. Notability is an issue with voice actors or anyone else. We don't include all actors.

<li>I suppose I better fess up...

<p>The reason why this entry should be kept is simply because it represents an emerging internet forum desperate for definition and recognition. The Red Cedar Mesage Board is not a "fan site" per se - it is a very unique online forum where thousands of people come each day to discuss various issues ranging from Michigan State University athletics to politics and other topics of general interest. With all due respect to the editors of Wikipedia, if the RCMB is permitted to remain on your dynamic online encyclopedia then many more, perhaps more significant, entries will be made regarding the RCMB and the true importance of the definition will be more clear.

<li><b>Keep / Improve</b> - While it's right that no page should just have a list of links, older version of this page had useful comparisons that helped people decide what wiki farms to use and promotes wiki-use and wiki-awareness. A page with descriptions of the different farms and their pros and cons is useful for readers and useful for the wiki space in general. Additionally, many wiki farms have their own Wikipedia pages, like <a href="../../../p/e/a/PeanutButterWiki_461a.html" title="PeanutButterWiki">PeanutButterWiki</a>, meaning that the page can at the very least index the Wikipedia pages about wiki farms. <a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweekly_0be5.html" title="User:Dweekly">Dweekly</a> 01:26, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>This "theory" does not contain rational arguments. It is a confused bundle of fantasy, semi-t*ruths, and miscomprehended biology.</li>
<li>There is no conventional evidence base.</li>
<li>There is no peer review.</li>
<li>The title of the theory is egregious misrepresentation of a paper published in a reputable scientific journal (BJC) several years ago. This latter paper is searcheable on Pubmed.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In addition, the proponents of this theory are causing a significant amount of disruption on the carcinognesis page. They are not amenable to measured discussion. Whilst this is not a reason for deletion per se, it should be taken into consideration. The microevolutionary model being touted has no real distinction from the host of other pseudoscientific medical theories, yet it has managed to get a specific mention on the Carcinognesis page for no other reason than the bloody-mindedness of its proponents. This does not help the credibility of the rest of the page. <a href="../../../j/e/l/User%7EJellytussle_34dd.html" title="User:Jellytussle">Jellytussle</a> 17:06, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The article uses some conventional references to support a "theory" that has little to do with microevolution and arrives at the conclusion that vitamin C cures cancer. The authors of the article have repeatedly attempted to gloss over its orthomolecular roots, masking the vitamin C conclusion, despite that being the main focus of their source text. It seems to be a perfidious form of linkspam. And I suspect some sockpuppettry as well.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocJohnny_db09.html" title="User:DocJohnny">DocJohnny</a> 06:09, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- 2000 downloads per version suggests many more than 2000 users.

Given about 220 MB of transfer a month, i'm figuring they get about 650 downloads a month; this suggests a much larger number of users than 2000, but also counts people who download just to evaluate it (without using) and fails to count a potentially significant group of users who download from a third party (like a package available from an OS vendor as a RPM), which the GPL permits, instead of directly through Sourceforge. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> (<a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMysidia_50b2.html" title="User talk:Mysidia">talk</a>) 08:08, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

The Association of Colleges doesn't describe it on their website or list winners.

They don't claim to be winners, they just claim to have recieved a certificate of commendation (on their site they claim a nomination). Neither nominations or certificates are mentioned on the beacon site as far as I can find. Personally, my main objection to this site is that it's a biased, self-set-up soapbox. For the "largest ever movement for autism and Asperger's syndrome in the UK" there's not a lot of stuff about them on google, just a lot of self done press releases and admittedly lots of pictures with politicians their website (that's not necessarily a <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Amess_eb32.html" title="David Amess">good yardstick</a>, though). A search for Ivan Corea in the [<a href="http://www.stratfordguardian.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.stratfordguardian.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">local paper</a>] brings up a few things. If the article were rewritten by someone not involved in the organization, with trustworthy sources given then I'd be happy.

<p><s>I have no doubt that the fauna of Maine deserves an article, but this ain't it. Sometime, it is possible that someone will want to write a <i>real</i> article about Maine's fauna, and when they do, it will probably only have the word "Maine" in common with this...thing. Maine apparently has such fauna as "trees... pine cones, and etc", it has a coast on its coast and has "lots of rainy seasons including snowy peaks and valleys". I suggest that a large pit is dug and this article is placed at the bottom of it. There's nothing here worth redirecting, and a redirect from this title simply to <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maine.html" title="Maine">Maine</a> seems a little facile.

<dd>Is this a <b>Keep</b> vote?</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Lack of information is a reason to improve and expand. As to the two delete votes: If benefiting from having a WP article is a reason to delete, all articles on specific <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medication.html" title="Medication">drugs</a> have to go just for starters. So far I've seen only one reason to delete - the company or its products may not be notable. Lacking useful policies and guidelines (or am I the only one thinking that <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> declares all companies notable that have ever advertized in a paper?) it is my personal opinion that this company is notable because it is growing exponentially in a niche within an extremely competitive market (which I happen to know to some extent - the market, not Avidian or its products). <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">&#160;AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 20:04, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was a consensus to merge and delete, but I will ignore the "delete" part of that. The materials which people contribute to Wikipedia are licensed under GFDL which makes them public domain, but the authors do need to be attributed if we use their work, and we do that by preserving a redirect with the history.

<p><b>Comment</b>: I nominated this article for deletion shortly after it was created. It has now been moved by its creator to <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borders_of_the_Arab_world_76fe.html" title="Borders of the Arab world">Borders of the Arab world</a>. However, on looking at it again, I notice now that the page has no AfD notice put up, and I can't find any evidence in the page history that there ever was one. I'm pretty sure I was trying at the time to do everything right as by "AfD nomination in three steps". If, by some oversight of mine or by some technical problem, this AfD nomination may have escaped the notice of the creator, I ask that the nomination be kept open until the author has had an opportunity to respond. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> 16:08, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>User has created a page about himself. It was userfied, but after some discussion he has re-created in article space.

<li><b>Comment</b>. After reading the wikipedia's guide on 'importance'; it states that it is important if the person well-known in a community. I know Nicholas Wolfe, he was Chair of the Youth Council of South Glous, and I know that many people over the World know of him due to his attendance at the Global Young Leaders Conference. This concludes that he is well-known in one, if not several, communities, hence it cannot be justifiably deleted. Wikipedia state that if one of any of the three definitions on 'importance' is fulfilled, deletion is not justified. One can't just delete it on the grounds of not knowing the person in the article or obscurity. Do NOT delete! I agree with the person below! -- <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.131.82.121 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.131.82.121_9da7.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.131.82.121">contribs</a>).</small> <small>(agreeing with himself below)</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. This article is about somebody who has not only been a representative for his county but has also, and continues to, be a representative for the United Kingdom. I don't feel that it constitutes deletion merely because of the fact that he hasn't had a 'major' achievement to date. What do you define as 'major achievement'?

<p>That's right, but entry is arguably notable. original entry for deletion cited (nn) and verifiability as cause for deletion and evidence of notability and verifiability now provided. Is there some other valid reason for deletion that can be cited now?</p>
<p>I took the template for this article from [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversations_With_God" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversations_With_God" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>] because it seems to me the two cases are comparable.

<p>-- ok, admittadely I'm new at this but doesn't a counterargument need to be made here or will this be deleted "just because" and with no debate?</p>
<p>I believe I've read the relevant policies and it would seem to me this is not a candidate for deletion. It is verifiable, and is adhering to NPOV (and if its not it can be easily edited). It is arguably important to a "reasonable" number of people (notability) and as <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy_Wales</a> points out, fame or importance are not relevant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Fame_and_importance#No" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Fame_and_importance#No" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Fame_and_importance#No</a> (just NPOV and relevance) (i understand this is an issue of debate)</p>
<p><br />
Since notability was cited as a reason to delete, and since notability can be shown, I'd like to see some specific comment on why the article remains "nn" despite evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p><b>quoting from Wikipedia:notability</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lack of notability is often designated by the phrase "non-notable" or the abbreviation "nn". Whenever using the term or its abbreviation, please explain briefly why you consider the subject to be not notable (e.g. "has written a book but it was never published</p>
</blockquote>
<p>peeps, you might find this discussion relevant as well</p>

In the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cindy_the_Dolphin_44c7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cindy the Dolphin">first one</a>, there was no consensus. At least one, and probably more votes were based on the assumption there was actually a legal signficance to the ceremony. There wasn't. Also the lack of verifiable information about the bride of this dolphin is now clearer. Finally, there is a clear consensus to delete <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sharon_Tendler_ade8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sharon Tendler">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sharon Tendler</a>, which is for essentially the same article. <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 22:51, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>It takes all sorts. It would also be good for essays on the changing attitudes of marriage. Believe it or not this is a significant event in comparison with the recent developments of gay marriage. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishrose_b44b.html" title="User:Englishrose">Englishrose</a> 22:58, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>This is unrelated to gay marriage, as gay marriages are now legal in a number of countries. Also, even unrecognized relationships between gays are at least real. That is, there are actually people who live together, and raise families together. This woman does not live with the dolphin. She visits him a couple times a year. She has no more relationship with him, than millions of kids have with the panda bear at the local zoo. This is starting to smell of POV-pushing on gay-marriage to me. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 23:03, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is related to gay marriage because it shows that the different attitudes towards marriage. 10 years ago gay marriage would have seemed unthinkable is most parts of the world. Times are changing and people are trying to push forward different types of marriage. This is yet more evidence of change in attitudes towards marriage, whether it is legal or not. <i>This is starting to smell of POV-pushing on gay-marriage to me.</i> As a hetrosexual just for the record, I'm not really bothered if it seems as a POV pushing on gay marriage cause to be frank it's people's business, not mine. However, I recognise that it is significant as it shows a change in attitudes just as this article shows...sorry for repeating myself. I'd also like to point out that when gay marriage was deemed morrally wrong, people took part in similar services such as the one in this article despite them not being legal as a show of their love. I think I've made my point. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishrose_b44b.html" title="User:Englishrose">Englishrose</a> 23:18, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What verifiable evidence do you have this "couple" has any relationship beyond the ceremony? There is no marriage. There was an unofficial ceremony. That's it. It means as little as two five year olds pretending to marry. If you want to argue that this has something in common with gay marriage, you have to show this "couple" has something in common with gay married couples or any married couples. Where is your verifiable evidence? This is just an attempt by anti-gay groups to attack gay people, by equating them with beastiality. You know as well as I, that nobody involved, in this actually supports "relations" between humans and dolphins. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 23:22, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please assume <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">good faith</a>. It’s not an attack on gay marriage, it’s not even a pro-freedom article. Although to be honest if someone falls in “love” with a dolphin then it’s not a bad thing, I feel that any type of “love” is a positve thing. As I’ve said before, I’m not against but I’m not really for it. I’m too laid back to have a strong opinion on Dolphin marriage, although I can’t see why it offended some people in the previous AFD discussion. It was linked to gay marriage from people such as Fox News' The O'Reilly Factor, host Bill O'Reilly. <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200601050008" class="external autonumber" title="http://mediamatters.org/items/200601050008" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>. Maybe they’d read my comments on the previous AFD discussion but I doubt it. <i>What verifiable evidence do you have this "couple" has any relationship beyond the ceremony?</i> I’m pretty sure that there is a relationship beyond the ceremony based on the fact that she is reported to be “infated” on the dolphin but based on the fact that she has visited the Dolphin and she has been visiting it for 15 years. <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/woman-weds-dolphin/2005/12/30/1135732715098.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/woman-weds-dolphin/2005/12/30/1135732715098.html" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>. So I think the evidence although journalistic shows that there is apparently a relationship between the woman and dolhpin, thus I believe that this relationship has gone on past the cermony. I don’t think it’s impossible for people to fall in love with a dolphin, although a little strange. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishrose_b44b.html" title="User:Englishrose">Englishrose</a> 23:48, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and clean up</b>. Several of these words are important, particularly in biochemistry, and the -kinesis suffix is an interesting one. I agree about deleted the superhero words, though.

<li>That works... I'm just concerned with the silly terms. Popular bio-chem terms are fine of course.

<li>I just reorganized the article, putting the three commonly used terms at top, and all the rest down below. It's just an idea of a way to organize it so it's useful.

<li><b>Keep</b> These words are not "invented" at all, but are rather heavily used in the (admittedly highly nonsensical) worlds of paranormal research and science fiction literature. The point is, these are linguistically <i>legitmate</i> uses of the suffix itself, regardless of whether the abilities are real or "silly" in their fictitious or paranormal nature. I see no point in deletion, as these articles will simply spring up as stubs elsewhere, and the -kinesis suffix does deserve an article.--172.154.18.45 00:28, 14 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>They are not used ANYWHERE in paranormal research (with the exception of PK). They are not presented as ficticious words in the article that originate from science fiction literature - they are presented as legitimate scientific words used in research (which they aren't). Even then, find a popular science fiction book that uses the term "umbrakinesis". It's just plain silly. <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBleedstupid_3ecd.html" title="User:Bleedstupid">Bleedstupid</a> 00:34, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Simple googling of selected "fictional" terms brings up arrays of conspiracy theorist websites and books expounding on aliens, psychic phenomena the paranormal, and some sort of alleged Unified Field Theory, not to mention various cults. Your issue seems to be one of skepticism, which is entirely understandable, but like it or not, there are message boards dedicated to supposed practitioners of everything from umbrakinesis to faith healers. James Randi would have a field day.--172.154.18.45 00:47, 14 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then I challenge you to google the terms in the article and see if you get the same results. These terms should not be grouped in the same category you describe. These terms are not popular IN ANY FIELD. <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBleedstupid_3ecd.html" title="User:Bleedstupid">Bleedstupid</a> 00:56, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not sure what you're proposing. Do you want these to be trasferred to the wikidictionary? Drawing a paralell to other suffix pages, <i>Optophobia — Fear of opening one's eyes</i>, a real but disused term for the highly rare "fear of opening ones eyes," only gathers 657 odd hits on google, and yet is present on the <a href="../../../-/p/h/-phobia.html" title="-phobia">-phobia</a> page. Chronokinesis gets 667 hits, mostly from psychic websites that assume the phenomenon is real. I'm still not sure what we're debating. It's clear that people use these terms as though they were real, no matter how odd or outre. Like the -phobia page, rarity in reality does not preclude or otherwise disprove linguistic legitimacy in the descriptive abstract. --172.154.18.45 01:24, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Silly" is throwing me off. Is it that <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">neologistic</a> terminology grates? In this case you've got a legitimate complaint regarding some questionable entries, but, as I learned, even chronokinesis has its real world proponents and seems entitled to it's terminology. Simply remove those that are purely neologistic (ex: chlorokinesis) and let those that have their claimant flesh-and-blood "practictioners" be. I point again to those rare and exotic phobias (which may not appear in medical journals at all) as an indicator of popularity and legitimacy not necessarily being mutually exclusive. --172.154.18.45 01:58, 14 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, neologism sounds exactly like what it is. I didn't know the term you guys used. There are no sources for those terms outside of the sites on the internet (and even then, the terms are VERY sparse: please reconsider and compare the results against the results for Psychokinesis). They are not published in ANY medium. I research psychic phenomenon, and it urks me to see these neologistic terms grouped together with scientific terms. <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBleedstupid_3ecd.html" title="User:Bleedstupid">Bleedstupid</a> 02:02, 14 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(Partitioning for easy editing) But here comes the crux of the debate. When does the ever-changing landscape of psychic and occult terminology stop being neologistic? Some that may have started out that way now have their small corners of legitimized usage in internet communities of claimants. Does usage by a claimant to a psychic ability grant legitimacy? Or is the usage itself indicative of false claims? Should another criterion be used, if at all? It seems to be the malleable properties of language itself that underlie this issue. --172.154.18.45 02:14, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, that is the main point of debate. If we look at terms used in parapsychology, it is MOSTLY uniform. I propose we stick to terms that have been around for years, didn't originate on the internet, and have been published by multiple parapsychologists. This would eliminate 95% of the terms on that page. <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBleedstupid_3ecd.html" title="User:Bleedstupid">Bleedstupid</a> 02:20, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Then maybe templated requests for expert opinions are needed here, perhaps even the creation of a "Psychokinetic Abilities in Fiction/Fictional Psychokinetic Abilities" article, which would fall squarly within guidelines and connect with a category here on wikipedia. There are plently of legit articles revolving around fictional tropes as literary institutions, and such an article, linked as a related "See Also" might finally differentiate between discussion as a psychic phenomenon and popular fictional trope.</li>
<li>I could care less about where the terms go (whether they're deleted or re-labelled and re-defined), as long as they aren't presented as legit scientific terms that define psychic abilities. If they are presented as fictional, then that's fine. It's the association with science and parapsychology that bothers me. <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBleedstupid_3ecd.html" title="User:Bleedstupid">Bleedstupid</a> 02:38, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>But that's the issue. If the diction needs to be changed, re-labelled or redifined, or if disclaimers need be provided, it can be requested or even done by you. Your problems with this page could be solved with something more specific than deletion entire, just make your needs clear. Remember, ideally, this is a page for instances where -kinesis is used as a linguistic suffix, nothing more <i>or</i> less. That in itself is a very broad category, so there must be something that can be done here without taking away from that particular purpose. --172.134.253.16 03:54, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think we need to seriously consider what qualifies a word on that page... the DC Comics which are sited a lot never use those terms, i.e., they never say "Magneto, with the power of Magnetokinesis". So why have the terms? What is stopping people from creating a term based on any random comic? For example, Powderedtoastkinesis for the popular Powdered Toast Man in Ren and Stimpy. Do you not agree that it's silly to just randomly add -kinesis to some arbitrary prefix to create a word? I propose only to add terms that is widely known that the superhero's possess. I.e., if it was CREATED by DC Comics, and used by them, then I would think that is a good qualifier if it should be added to the page with the DC Comic as the example. <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBleedstupid_3ecd.html" title="User:Bleedstupid">Bleedstupid</a> 16:25, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>In such a case, you may want to solicit aid from the folks at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Comics_54b1.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Comics">WikiProject Comics</a> in their commons, in determining just how new or how old some of these terms are, and when they are legitimately used. This would go far in determining their verity as literary terms using the -kinesis suffix. A neologism in use for many years would have long since ceased to be so. (Just an amateur's note: ask for assistance from adherants of all publishers, it's not just a Marvel or DC world.) Also, don't forget to cite those reference sources you spoke of if you plan to put disclaimers of standard parapsychological usage versus usage by claimants, and usage in literature. (See the Manual of Style for notes) My main problem with this proposed deletion is the likelihood that this page will simply reincarnate and gradually reform to it's current status quo unless specific guidelines, disclaimers and subarticles are developed. It is part of a node dealing with linguistics, and the base article with the definition will likely be resubmitted after deletion, reopening the door to the issues you are having. It's the nature of open source.

<li>Wikipedia guidelines provide exceptions to the rule in peculiar cases. (particularly if a neologism could be verified as being widely used in certain circles) This case in particular is contentious, perhaps because the suffix <i>itself</i> is <i>genuinely notable</i> for its frequent usage in the coining of neologisms. It's rather unique in that way. Also, an article is usually only deleted entirely if it is named for a neologism, which this one isn't. --172.171.98.229 08:10, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>they may not be important to someone in say...
