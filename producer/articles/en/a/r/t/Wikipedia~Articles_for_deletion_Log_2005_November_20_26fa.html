<li><b>Keep</b> (and mark as stub?) - There isn't much consistency on articles with just a given name as the title. (See <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew.html" title="Andrew">Andrew</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew.html" title="Matthew">Matthew</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carol.html" title="Carol">Carol</a>). Some are disambig pages (with some content), and some are articles. I think these can be encyclopedic, (giving etymology, place in common names rankings, etc). This example should not be a disambig page (no-one looking for E. Persson or E. Lorentzen is just going to type 'Erling' on its own) but I don't think it should be deleted just because the name is unusual to English-speakers or because the article is very brief. It does after all give a translation. --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquiddy_078f.html" title="User:Squiddy">Squiddy</a> 12:50, 20 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are conflating an encyclopaedia with a dictionary. The place for etymologies, meanings, pronunciations, and translations of words is a dictionary, not an encyclopaedia. The <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew.html" title="Andrew">Andrew</a> article requires heavy cleanup in this regard. As <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a> says, disambiguation articles <i>are not dictionary articles</i>. Disambiguation articles are for cases where multiple articles would otherwise share the same title. For <i>name disambiguation</i> articles, this is because multiple people <i>are commonly known by exactly that name</i>. The most common name disambiguation articles are thus for <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_name.html" title="Family name">family names</a> (people often being commonly known solely by their family name — c.f. "Mr Bush"). The name disambigation articles that exist for <a href="../../../g/i/v/Given_name.html" title="Given name">given names</a> are rarer, because far fewer people (mainly historical figures) are commonly known by their given names alone. We <i>do not</i> disambiguate for given names in the cases <i>where the people are not commonly known solely by their given name</i>, because there is no ambiguity in the first place. None of the people in this disambiguation are commonly known solely as "Erling". This article should be about the village in Germany. There is no ambiguity. See <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_names_and_surnames_1623.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy/names and surnames">Wikipedia:Deletion policy/names and surnames</a> for a full discussion of this. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:45, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: there were quite a few Erlings in the English Wikipedia when I went looking, so I added them. Also, I have confirmed that Erling is a town in Germany, but <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Erling%2C+Germany%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Erling%2C+Germany%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">this Google search</a> makes me confused.

<li>BTW, our article on the <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max-Planck-Gesellschaft_275a.html" title="Max-Planck-Gesellschaft">Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</a> states that Ornithology Institute is in a place called Andechs und Randolfsen. BTW, we don't currently have a German Wikipedians board on Wikipedia. I understand that there might be a place on the German Wikipedia where one can leave messages in English. Alternatively, it might be possible to see if a German speaker can see if the German Wikipedia has an article on it and translate it to the English wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 17:25, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>It seems that perhaps Erling could be considered a suburb of Andechs, or vice-versa. <a href="http://nona.net/features/map/placedetail.460721/" class="external autonumber" title="http://nona.net/features/map/placedetail.460721/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> They <i>are</i> close together.

<li>Wait wait! I've finally figured it out. Andechs <i>und</i> Randolfsen means that there is more than one place for it ("und" is "and"). Then I went to the <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andechs.html" title="Andechs">Andechs</a> page and found out that Erling is nearby. Finally, I found <a href="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:9AcOy27XZzoJ:www.orn.mpg.de/+Andechs+erling&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external text" title="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:9AcOy27XZzoJ:www.orn.mpg.de/+Andechs+erling&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">this link that explains everything</a>: apparently Andechs and Erling are rather thought of as the same place, there <i>is</i> a Randolsen as well, and there's a <i>third</i> location for the <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max-Planck-Gesellschaft_275a.html" title="Max-Planck-Gesellschaft">Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</a> Ornithology research, in Seeweissen.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>no consensus</b>. Okay, bear with me on this one. I count: 8 moves, 4 deletes, 3 keeps, with two of the moves being "well, maybe keep" or "well, maybe delete". I personally find the arguments for moving to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_North_American_cities_by_founding_year_dbc5.html" title="List of North American cities by founding year">List of North American cities by founding year</a> to be the more persuasive, but I'm not prepared to go on' move just based on that, given the wide variety of opinions expressed here.

This hardly qualifies as a robust list.

<ul>
<li>That still doesn't resolve the bias problem. Native peoples had massive migrations in the centuries following Columbus. How would a list treat Seminole settlement of Florida? What about the Trail of Tears? Would it ignore Mexico City altogether as a renamed version of previously settled Tenochtitlan? An NPOV article on this subject would have to be an essay. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 00:05, 21 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, Mexico City isn't just comprised of former Tenocjtitlan; it also takes in the former lakeshore cities - Chapultepec, Tlatlelolco, Texcocp, Xochimilco and another one or two (seven in total I believe); and Tenochtitlan was actually the youngest of the lot, and considered an upstart by the others...and all still relatively young compared to Tzintzuntzan, Monte Alban-Mitla-etc in Oaxaca and even things nearer Mexico City like Xochicalco (in Morelos). I agree there's a bias problem; the idea that something is "earliest" is inherently "Colombiano" in ethic. In BC, BTW, there was this place Dimlahamid (Temlahan in Barbeau) which was destroyed by some natural/supernatural catastrophe, possibly older than Tenochtitlan; but I suppose legendary existence doesn't qualify either; of course somewhere like Cahokia does.</li>
<li>A further issue that struck me when I first saw this discussion is when is a city founded vs when did it appear as a settlement. New Westminster brags that it's the oldest city on the mainland of BC; by which I guess they mean their date of incorporation, although I suspect that a now-abandoned town somewhere might be slightly older (not sure which); and there are older settlements - Lillooet, Yale, and Lytton, as well as vanished Port Douglas - that did not become incorporated until the mid-20th Century, even though they were created BEFORE the Crown Colony of British Columbia came into existence (except Douglas); and on an aboriginal timeline, they were founded/named thousands of years before (Lillooet and Lytton are considered two of the oldest-inhabited sites of settlement in North America. So is "founded" only in reference, or to incorporation? Vancouver's founding date is June something 1885, but Capt Stamp's Mill was there in 1867, with Gassy Jack opening his bar in the summer of that year (the opening of his bar is considered to be the founding of the city).<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 05:33, 23 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Another good example of that problem has just been added to the article in the entry "1896: Miami, Florida, from early Spanish settlements dating back to 1566". The date 1896 is correct in that Miami was incorporated that year. There had been a Tequesta town there for perhaps 2,000 years when the Spanish came. There are records of a Spanish mission there off and on, but that doesn't qualify as "early Spanish settlements" in my book. In any case, any remaining Tequestas were removed to Cuba when the Spanish gave up Florida. The area was then uninhabited until the Seminole Wars pushed the Seminoles into the Everglades, and the Army built a fort on the Miami River. The fort was abandoned after the Seminole Wars, and the few remaining Seminoles stayed deep in the Everglades. The area wasn't resettled until the 1870s. My point in all this is that it is already very difficult to verify and maintain this list, as it is quickly becoming a junk pile of civic boosterism and unverified, and probably unverifiable, 'facts'. Add the POV problems, and it is a mess. - <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Dalbury</font></a><sup><font color="green">(<a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>)</font></sup></b> 10:48, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think that some sort of list like this could be useful, but how do we limit it? Founded by Europeans? Make that clear. Still in existence today? Then throw out Jamestown and the Roanoke colony. Otherwise, include L'Anse-aux-Meadows, the Popham colony, and the French colonies in Florida. By minimum size today? To keep St. Augustine in the list the minimum population would have to be no higher than 10,000. What does North America mean? Does it mean just the U.S. and Canada? The article includes "towns or former colonies of major historical note". I can see arguments over what is "major". The list as it stands is strongly biased to places founded or taken over early on by the English, and therefore prominent in U.S. history texts.

<dd>1. Settlement constitutes habitation: this is true for agricultural societies, but not for nomadic peoples. However, most nomadic peoples return to the same locations on an annual circuit. By definition this list excludes all such people on a technicality.</dd>
<dd>2. Settlement by date: many of the earliest North American settlements are questions for archaeologists. It would be difficult to cover them adequately in a list by geographic region. A list by date, consciously or not, inherently excludes most of these questions by rendering them impossible to resolve.</dd>
<dd>3. Inherent bias: the first two factors favor Europeans, who had settled agriculture and written language. This fosters the illusion that previous habitation was insignificant.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I did some simple searches (Neil Hamiton, law, agriculture and got 562,000 hits) and found info to expand the article. Hamilton has a lot of references from law schools around the US. I don't know that lack of expansion over time should be a measure of notability. I don't think "agriculture" would be considered a niche in the midwest. The American Association of Law Schools (of which Harvard Law School is a founding member<a href="http://www.aals.org/members.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aals.org/members.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) has an Agricultural Law section, of which Hamilton is still a part. <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> 18:55, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>No vote yet, but comment: A lot of notable topics haven't been touched in the past three years. I've worked on major composers, african american artists, and other biographic articles that were stubs or just didn't exist. The fact that they didn't have an article didn't say anything about their notability compared to the number of texts that stress their importance.

<li>Delete if not expanded: The figure may be notable, but, as I suppose everyone knows by now, I believe in voting on the article, rather than the topic. There is little room in a biographical article for the <i>CV</i> styled listing of credentials, and the article does nothing whatever to explain the effects he has had on law or agriculture. All we get is that he has a job and wrote some. That's incomplete to the point of not establishing the notability. Indeed, we do have huge gaps in Wikipedia coverage, but there are times with a feeble something is worse than nothing. This is an article that justifies CV postings and Random J. Professor. Certainly, I would leave it for the closer to look at a diff between nomination date and closing date and look for expansion. If there isn't any, I recommend deletion and waiting for an encyclopedic article. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:07, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I have recently argued for "failure to expand" as a sign of the impossibility of a good article on the topic. On the other hand, there is a very strong consensus that AfD is not about the <i>content</i> of the article, except (as with "saves") as evidence about the encyclopedicity of the topic. IMO, a responsible admin would discount any "Delete if not expanded ... bcz AfD should not be about topics" vote -- or even count it as vote for Keep, since the voter has demonstrated regarding the <i>topic</i> as encyclopedic, by saying expansion could save the article.<br />

<li><b>Keep</b> and rewrite. At the time of the VfD it could easily be argued that the article in its current state is merely advertising. However, I believe that as one of the largest UK-specific music game communities DDRUK is notable and visible both to those in and out of the "DDR community". It is for this reason that I will be completely rewriting the article to conform to much higher standards of article quality. <a href="../../../l/a/v/User%7ELavareef_a5e3.html" title="User:Lavareef">Lavareef</a> 13:49, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Alexa: To DDR players, very noticible. To other people, not sure about that.</p>
<p>It's alright to talk about the problem of the site but the outline of the article is a terror. Having a title "Leech" is an huge mistake.</p>
<p>J's (I love DDR)</p>
<p>I have completely rewritten the article, and I no longer believe that it qualifies for deletion in its current state. In addition to being the largest UK-specific website dedicated to the subject matter, the DDR:UK organisation holds public events and tournaments at arcades and expositions and currently maintains a customised arcade game unique to the community. DDR:UK members may be seen displaying the community's t-shirts in many of the UK's arcades, and it is not uncommon for arcade goes to discuss community matters with other patrons. The website owner is frequently furthering knowledge of the game, having appeared on BBC Radio 5 and been featured in The Times newspaper. I believe that DDR:UK as an organisation is notable outside of the Dance Dance Revolution community and is notable for more than merely being "a popular website". <a href="../../../l/a/v/User%7ELavareef_a5e3.html" title="User:Lavareef">Lavareef</a> 15:26, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, All I can say is this new re-written article is full, up to date and factual information as of 15:50 GMT the 20th November. DDRUK might not be very notable to people outside of the UK, but to any players of DDR in the UK it is very notable, it is far more than just a website, it is a community, it was the first and only dedicated community the UK had on this subject, it actively takes part in real life events, it has been on BBC radio, BBC3 TV, Satellite TV, The Guardian newspaper, (Very respected) taken part in promotions of fitness for children events, held tournaments and all attracting people from all over the world. I know this keep argument obviously looks like I am just advertising the site but it is the only way I can put forward the reason why to people in the UK it could and IS very notable community.Phayze</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, important website for DDR players and "appeared on BBC Radio 5 and been featured in The Times newspaper" is a reasonable claim to notability. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 16:49, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Ignoring the rain of poor sockpuppetry that descends upon these AfDs when dealing with an encyclopedia entry about any website (it always hardens my heart towards a delete), the rewrite by Lavareef has turned the article away from advertising into something that might be genuinely useful for some readers. However, I think the notability issue is still in question - we're talking about a single web forum and not the whole subject of Dance Dance Revolution. Web forums, by definition, are rarely notable other than to their members. ➨ <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">❝</a><b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">REDVERS</font></a></b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Redvers_11cc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Redvers">❞</a> 21:20, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Delete: One more time, with feeling: it isn't about whether DDR is good or bad, whether the forum is good or bad, whether we twitch or thump when we play games: the question is whether a specific forum on a website (i.e. divide the website by the number of forums) is so overwhelming to the competition, so outstanding, so controversial or famous, that it passes over the prohibition on web guide entries and the prohibition on advertising. I'm sure it's a fine forum, but it's a forum, and Wikipedia is not a web guide. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 00:22, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Do not Delete</b> This is obviously a new slang term developing in 'adolescent society'. The secondary definition for nugget according to www.dictionary.com is: A small compact portion or unit. It is clear that an inverted case fits this description quite well. As the creator points out, wikipedia is not just your average conventional encyclopedia; Wikipedia is a site made by the people, for the people, which is perhaps the best system for an up-to-date reference. It is for these reasons that i feel the term should stand. I am also puzzled as to how the creator would go about collecting citations? picture evidence has been given, what other sources would be available?</s></li>

<li><s>I'll admit that I have never edited a single article here on Wikipedia... (Although I probably could fix up a few of the sub par ones which are in my areas of interest...) But I'm not just some "Random Person" who was "recruited to save NUGGETS". I love this site dearly and visit it often and there has been no recruiting what-so-ever. All of our comments are our own separate opinion. I believe that this article belongs here as it contains factual information on a current occurence. I know there are people who want this article deleted and that's ok... But you can't go claiming something "Bullshit" when there are actual occurences. "NUGGETING" is similar to "<a href="../../../k/a/n/Kancho.html" title="Kancho">Kancho</a>" in that it is an activity that occurs in the schoolyard... However NUGGETTING isn't quite as... gross... as Kancho. I'm not trying to cause any trouble here, I am simply telling the truth. If you people can't accept that, then I don't care... Flame me all you want, but it does not change your maturity (or lack thereof). Also, if what we were saying was indeed "Do not delete! Nuggeting is awesome d00dz!" I would see why you would want it delete it. As anyone who uses a "0" in place of an "o" or a "z" in place of a "s" is automatically able to be considered a complete and utter idiot. My vote of "Do not Delete" stands.</s></li>

<dd><s><b>Comment</b> Well, there's a difference between Kancho and Nuggeting. Kancho is a widely known aspect of young Japanese kids' culture. It has been well documented by a number of sources, a quick Google search can show you that. However, this Nuggeting phenomena has yet to be picked up by any larger publications (the reference cited is just one school district). Therefore, if for that reason alone, this article should be deleted. --<a href="../../../m/d/d/User%7EMdd4696_2098.html" title="User:Mdd4696">mdd4696</a> 16:02, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</s></dd>

<li><s><b>Do not delete</b> As a student at a Sydney school, NUGGETING is part and parcel of daily life. Whether or not the Wikipedia literati deem this article 'non-encyclopaedic' is irrelevant. It is a reference to today's changing social scene, and is the essence of what Wikipedia stands for. If we want a free, web-based encyclopedia which deals with the real issues, then NUGGETING surely must be included. <i>-- Unsigned vote by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_138.130.60.157_92d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/138.130.60.157">138.130.60.157</a> 2005-11-22 09:57:03</i></s></li>
<li><s><b>Do not delete</b> As to the reasons why John Howards would declare a war against NUGGETING, I'm yet to be convinced. The lack of a national study does not detract from the credence of the NUGGETING process. There is only one way to determine the staying power of this article, and indeed the concept of the NUGGET. Let the article enter the common lexicon through its inclusion into the Wikipedia collection. Deleting at such a premature stage sets a precedent which jeopardises the relevance of Wikipedia to today's youth culture. <i>-- A <b>second</b> unsigned vote by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_138.130.60.157_92d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/138.130.60.157">138.130.60.157</a> 2005-11-22 09:57:03</i></s>

<p><s>This was an interesting case. The article is terrible POV but it also brings up another issue (in my mind at least). Are Muslim organizations in cities notable? There is no information in the article that says how big the organization is and I didn't see any information on the website. I'm also not particularly deletionist but I thought we need to address the implications of keeping an article like this. What is the threshold for keeping an article about any locally based religious organization? There are no real outside sources (that I could find) other than the organizations itself which created problems in my mind. Organizations like <a href="../../../i/s/n/ISNA_c09d.html" title="ISNA">ISNA</a> have national media discussing them but I don't think this organization really has anything. I am also thinking of putting Al-Hajj Samer Mohamad Bazzi up for deletion for the same basic reasons since his notoriety is derrived from this organization. I don't have strong feelings on this issue exactly (besides NPOVing the article) but I do want to see discussion. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 07:41, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</s></p>

<li>James, if the nationwide articles are Sydney-centric, that's a reason to correct the articles' bias, not to create a Melbourne-only fork.

<li>For clarification, I believe that this article should be kept and HSV-7 merged into it.

<li>Perth has it's own channel seven website. I like Melbourne's channel Seven.. but meh, do what you want. I've been to the 2 Melbourne studios and it doesn't say HSV-7 anywhere. It says "7 Melbourne". And both studios have public Cafes and you get to see all the storage of tape and oh my god.. there are so many films and videos. And the digital broadcast center.. surely that needs to be explained. But you know how Channel Seven is networked to every state.. well "HSV-7" was only when it was broadcasted in Victoria right? Now it's broadcasted in every major city. So you know.. I just thought. And with the pics I added.. it seemed like a good idea at the time.

<p>Hoax. See also Ryan Lapshinoff, a related hoax article. Google on "Assistant to the President on Foreign Affairs and Speechwriting" gives no hits other than this page itself, and there is no record of the supposed Victoria incident ever happening.

<p>Actually, this should be a speedy delete. The previously deleted version also cited "Ryan Lapshinoff" and was very similar in most respects, so this should be speedy-deleted as a recreation of a previously deleted article.</p>

<p>On closer examination, Spencer Fontaine was a recreation of an article deleted earlier with minor variation (Luxembourg instead of Belgian, etc) and was thus speedily-deleted on those grounds. The earlier version of Spencer Fontaine also cited "Ryan Lapshinoff". The Ryan Lapshinoff article is simply an extension of the Spencer Fontaine hoax and could be speedily deleted too. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 09:14, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Surely a hoax. "Geraldo Vagabondo" turns up nothing on Google, "Happy Harry Vagabondo" likewise (as well as being an unlikely name), sandwich shop bizzo reads like a bad joke (especially the motto bit). I liked your nomination, Punkmorten: it explained clearly and factually why the article should be deleted. Pity about the vote at the end.

<li>Oh, but I did. I just forgot to add "delete" in big bold letters. I trust I've made my arguments for deletion clear enough without adding a whopping great "vote" to the end of it, though, so I don't particularly feel like changing it. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 03:58, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Because it says in the step-by-step process on the main AFD page that when listing an article, is is usually an idea to present the first vote to begin consensus building. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 03:34, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

That was added by one person, and removed by <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">User:Kelly Martin</a> not too long afterwards (see main AfD talk). Nominator voting, by the way, doesn't "begin consensus building" in the slightest.

Since most of our fans have communicated to us via email so it's hard to show that we have a respectable following for a band of our size, however if any real research had been done the existence of our recorded material would have been easy to find as it is fetured on our website and others. I would also like to note that it's almost impossible for egrind bands to tour and the slightest bit of real research would have made this fact very obvious. As it is the ability to tour does not fall under the prerequisites for forming a band. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_d67c.html" title="User:Anonymous">Anonymous</a> 14:57, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Punkmorten, for once I have to agree with you! Normally I prefer Wikipedia be more inclusive than exclusive, but there's way too much "supposedly" and "maybe" and "some people say" vague talk here. I may try to do some more research on them to try to fix up the article (even though their website is totally gross) but as it stands today, it might as well not exist. Having said that, though, you know I have to point out, as usual, that <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is not the end-all be-all yardstick by which all music entries must pass. From the music notability guide: These are simply guidelines <i><b>"which many editors agree with in principle.

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> represents the views of a substantial proportion of Wikipedians-who-care-about-music. Failing the notability guidelines therein doesn't mean that an article <b>must</b> be deleted, but it <i>is</i> a powerful argument in favour of doing so. What, in your view, is the reason why we have gone to the trouble of thrashing out music notability guidelines, if they cannot be applied in deletion discussions? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 18:29, 20 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>*smile*....It's getting to be a bit like quoting the Bible now... if you can invoke phrases in the guidelines to point out why you think the article should be deleted, I can also invoke phrases in those same guidelines that point out why the article doesn't necessarily HAVE to be deleted. What was once a mere guideline for some has now seemingly petrified into an unbreakable rule for all. I believe <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> does NOT represent the views of as many Wikipedians as you think. It certainly doesn't represent mine. I think most people simply go along with it in a hive-mind mentality because it's already there, and don't bother to challenge it. I'm not sure I'm going to challenge it much either, because I'm still internally debating Wikipedia's usefulness for myself anyway. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 19:10, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Although there is a strong contingent of people arguing for deletion, there is no <i>consensus</i> to do so. Also, in all the arguing for deletion, there aren't really that many persuasive points towards deleting the <i>content</i> – it's all about deleting the page, because we don't like what the creator's about. Okay. My personal sympathies, after reading around a bit, lie towards merging into <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">Motorized bicycle</a> and leaving a redirect at <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Motorized_bicycle_history_a8e0.html" title="Timeline of Motorized bicycle history">Timeline of Motorized bicycle history</a>.

<dd>So a vote from anybody who's opinion on the subject differs from your own is considered invalid? Or?...

<dd>Your comment above is unseemly and insulting. I never made any such suggestions. Generally, a user with less than 100 edits under its belt doesn't get counted as part of an AFD, because of the potential for gaming the system. As I said before, it is common practice to point out when a very new editor is voting in an AFD, since the closing administrator must make a call as to what votes get counted. Note that I said <b>the closing administrator</b> -- which will not be me.

<dd>Sorry if my comment seemed directed at you, I was commenting on the whole deletion process for the motorized bicycle timeline in general, regardless of your opinion on whether or not it should be kept, you can surely see that at this point the discussion of deletion is wholly silly. As for discounting of one's opinion on such, your initial response to my vote seemed to have no other purpose than to attempt and write me off as some sort of lackey for cyclepat - whereas you could have simply pointed out that I was a newly registered member. I'm sorry if my pointing this out has offended you, but maybe a more careful choice of words on your part could have prevented me from taking it in that light.

<dd>I only registered so I could comment in here without being a stranger. I've been writing for this site for a long time, I wrote the original stub for the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subaru_360.html" title="Subaru 360">Subaru 360</a> amongst other things primarily automotive in nature. I will reiterate that this article should not be deleted. If that means it has to be merged with another article, fine, but it will grow and and eventually will just clutter up whatever article it is attached to. Keep it.<a href="../../../k/-/1/User%7EK-111_51fb.html" title="User:K-111">User:K-111</a>
<dl>
<dd>To answer your question, K-111, the reason for deleting it is that it was created by CyclePat against consensus. It is one of three articles he's created, each one apparently attempting to get his <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> across.</dd>
<dd>Now, do you mean keep <i>this</i> article, a <b>timeline of the motorized bicycle</b>, defined as a bicycle which has a motor but is rideable without use of the motor, or do you mean keep <i>a timeline</i> for the powered two-wheeler, including motorised bikes, autocycles, mopeds, scooters and motorcycles (which this is not)? Or do you mean keep <i>a <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_transportation_technology.html" title="Timeline of transportation technology">timeline of transportation technology</a></i>, which will also include these milestones? Or do you mean keep <i>an article</i> on the <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> and its history - from your comments it seems that CyclePat forgot to tell you that this already exists, and that most of the delete voters here are actively engaged in expanding that article and adding history, something with which your help would be most welcome (and in the related <a href="../../../m/o/p/Moped.html" title="Moped">moped</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorcycle.html" title="Motorcycle">motorcycle</a> articles, I'm guessing). - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 11:49, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I am aware of the motorized bicycle page, and I have already done work on the moped page in the past. While this timeline could be merged with the motorized bicycle page, I feel that eventually it will become too bulky as more events are added. Perhaps it could be merged now, and then moved back to a seperate page when that happens? Either way I don't see any good reason to delete it. I don't see any need for a war against two pages that complement each other very nicely.<a href="../../../k/-/1/User%7EK-111_51fb.html" title="User:K-111">User:K-111</a></dd>

<dd>The page title is incorrectly capitalized. There are many Wikipedia formatting errors and there are also spelling and punctuation errors.

Someone once said "the wise man recognizes that he doesn't necessarily have knowledge about everything." This article does have "prospect for expansion."

Some users, such as <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a>, comes in and immediately censors everything (both here and in the article) (*definitely* relevant to the dispute), and the existing conflict is much broader. For example, the history of this article has been in dispute ever since its merger from <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_bicycle.html" title="Electric bicycle">electric bicycle</a>. But back to the main issue at hand, some want to have the article completed before its even started. ("Don't put the horses before the buggy") This article is new. Please allow some time for other users to include their knowledge, facts and sources. The article is a branch of the transportation time-line. It appears that "time-lines", in general on wikipedia, unavoidably repeat most of its information in their sister related articles, hence, a merge/delete is totally inappropriate. Also, as suggested, adding all the information pertinent only to "motorized bicycles" (that will eventually be in the time-line) would drastically bog down the main transportation time-line and is much more inappropriate. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 01:24, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

The article as it stands is negligble, and much of what needs to go in there has yet to be sourced. What there is is small and will easily fit in the main article. This article as it stands contains three events, <i>none of which has any demonstrated significance</i> in the history of the motorised bicycle. Your assertion that I am "censoring" the article is ludicrous.

<dd><b>Comment</b> for other AfD watchers: the timeline currently has exactly three items: invention of the wheel (3500 BC), speculation re the first ever (unmotorized) bicycle in 1816, and the author's pet firm, a small Canadian manufacturer of no discernible wider importance, adding a commercial aftermarket motor to a delivery bike in the 1940s (or 1930s, the author doesn't seem too clear on that). If the article stays:
<ul>
<li>invention of the wheel gets removed, as pointless and irrelevant to the development of the motorised bicycle</li>
<li>speculation re the first <i>unmotorised</i> bicycle gets deleted as irrelevant to the history of the <i>motorised</i> bicycle</li>
<li>addition of a motor to a delivery bike made by a small Canadian manufacturer gets deleted as unverified since despite numerous requests the person who added it has failed to cite any authority to show that this event had any influence beyond the company itself (in whose article it can undoubtedly be covered), precisely the reason it was removed from the parent article in the first place.</li>
<li>other events have yet to be referenced, since neither the author of the timeline article nor any of the authors of the main article have yet succeeded in getting authoritative documentation on this - it is a sideline to the bicycle and the motorcycle, so has not been studied in any great detail.</li>

<dd>(somone might recognize this from his/her user page)(I think it's actually a good mediation) A timeline is defined as: a) "chronology"... but it may also be b) "representation or exhibit of key events within a particular historical period, often consisting of illustrative visual material accompanied by written commentary, arranged chronologically."<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=timeline" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=timeline" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> I think that's where we where differing in opinion. If we take your interpretation of the definition, then you would are possibly correct in saying CCM bicycle doesn't deserve a spot. However, what is a key event? (I think you said the answer to that somewhere else, already) I've indicated elsewhere, that it feels almost like original research or (bias selections) being able to pick and chose. (devils advocat here!) What make you able to discern what information is worthy of notation. As you have said you don't have enough information on the subject. (I don't either, which is why I didn't want to try and speculate if that information was worthy of inclusion). I put the information in as per the a) definition. (and good faith, assuming this information must have some type of influence on the motorized bicycle since it is from a notable source such as the Museum of science and tech of Canada). Chronology could have 3 meaning according to <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=chronology" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=chronology" rel="nofollow">this dictionary</a>. The 3rd one says: "A chronological list or table." (Which make me think... perhaps the name should be Chronological list of motorized bicycles&#160;?) And we know what chronological means right?<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=chronological" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=chronological" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> So please don't consider this me trying to prove a point, I was trully trying to get some usuful information into an appropriat article. Now, what to do? Who's definition is better? (it sadens me to see my information disapear because of some difference of interpratation)

<dd>To answer the substantive question, the microscope timeline runs ofver some hundreds of years and pulls together articles on the major figures in the history and the pivotal innovations.

<dd>I must disagree with your judgement of "trivial milestone" - each thing in the timeline is worth noting and was chosen to give a well rounded representation of bike motor technology over the decades. Both historical significance and technological innovation were considered. The mechanical design as well was significant in the selection of machines listed here, as I tried to include motors that featured roller drive, belt drive, or were sold as complete motor wheels, giving good representation of all the most <i>important</i> motors that have ever been produced. If we wanted to include "trivial milestones" we could easily have over 100 of them listed on this timeline. But as creating as large a list as possible is not the point, the list is tidy and trim. <a href="../../../k/-/1/User%7EK-111_51fb.html" title="User:K-111">User:K-111</a></dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> <a href="../../../k/-/1/User%7EK-111_51fb.html" title="User:K-111">User:K-111</a> has made some constructive suggestions and additions - as well as making me feel <i>very</i> foolish for not following up Andrew Pattle, who I know from elsewhere and is something of an expert on light motorcycles. I believe it is likely that this "timeline" article will be moved to a new title and focus, and widened to include a cross-linked history of the development of at least motorised bicycles, mopeds and scooters, and probably motorcycles as well since the distinction is in many cases arbitrary. I therefore change my vote to <b>neutral</b>, since I think the new concept has some merit even if we are as yet unable to agree on quite what it should be called or what the scope should be, and deserves a chance. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 17:58, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>The result of the debate was <b>closer's choice</b>. Okay, not really&#160;;-)</p>
<p>There is clearly no consensus to delete the content. However, those who did want it kept outright often displayed a preference to have the article moved the hell out of the main article namespace, either to Wikipedia: or Talk:. There was also a strong contingent indicating a wish to merge it with the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> article.</p>
<p>So, what I'm going to do is move it to a subpage of <a href="../../../g/e/o/Talk%7EGeorge_W._Bush_758a.html" title="Talk:George W. Bush">Talk:George W. Bush</a>, then delete the redirect. Anyone planning a merge will still be able to access the content from its new location. It may be necessary to leave a note at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Talk%7EWikipedia_74ea.html" title="Talk:Wikipedia">Talk:Wikipedia</a> explaining where the merged content comes from, for GFDL purposes; IANAL. The article can now be found at <a href="../../../g/e/o/Talk%7EGeorge_W._Bush_Wikipedia_1366.html" title="Talk:George W. Bush/Wikipedia">Talk:George W.

<p>I have a feeling this may be a controversial debate, but it shouldn't be. The relevant guideline is <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_self-references_3b86.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid self-references">Wikipedia:Avoid self-references</a>, which states that "self-references are entirely acceptable on talk pages or in the Wikipedia namespace, but they are inappropriate in articles." This is clear, and it's right. This article is about internal matters, not Wikipedia's role in the outside world, and thus is not comparable to articles like <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> or <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Sanger_037d.html" title="Larry Sanger">Larry Sanger</a>. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 17:08, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Many articles have received media coverage.

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>merge</b> as appropriate. Self-reference should be avoided unless 100% necessary, and this is not.

<li><b>Delete</b> First of all, it's rather early to claim "it will stand along side other politically-driven" neologisms: Wikipedia is not a Crystal Ball. Secondly, it's a personal attack on a single freshman representative--in fact, the most junior member <i>of congress</i>, for a gaffe that will likely be soon forgotten. Next, it's ridiculously POV. Calling a member of congress "shithead" by implication and claiming she " lacks any sense of decency, perspective or irony." in a main article is entirely POV--all opinion, no fact. Next, it is hardly in common use. "schmidthead" as a google search receives 387 results--and on the first page, only one result is political. Searching 'schmidthead jean' without the quotes (so as to get articles with both) gives only 22 results. 22 results in the entire Internet is not a common term. For comparison to other political hackjob neologisms, "klintoon" recieves 13000 and "bushitler" recieves 69000--both obviously not worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia, and yet both in much wider use. I doubt this even belongs in the List of pejorative political puns, though that would be a much better choice.

Anything useful contained within can be incorporated into <a href="../../../v/a/p/Vaporizer.html" title="Vaporizer">vaporizer</a> (from where the link to The Ubie can also be removed). btw, whether it can be used for smoking cannabis or crack or dried kittens has no bearing on its potential relevance - it needs to go simply because it's advertising and because it's not a significant enough product (or company) to deserve an article here.

<li><b>Keep</b> The American Smokeless article can surely be deleted, as it really is nothing but advertising, but I think the article on The Ubie should be kept, and possibly expanded, so as to appear less of an advertisement and more of a description of the invention and it's function. <a href="../../../t/o/b/Tobacco.html" title="Tobacco">Tobacco</a> links to The Ubie article, and it does seem to describe an alternative to traditional smoking. Judgements about the company's choices of marketing, however unfortunate those choices might be to our point of view, don't detract from the existence of the item itself. I think it deserves an entry. Also, I don't think the idea of waiting ten years to see if the technology is widely adopted to be realistic, otherwise we'd have to delete articles on the Itanium and the XBox 360, for example. The article may have started as a blatant ad, but we can make it into something better, rather than throw the baby out with the bathwater. (I haven't yet done so, since there's no point in expending effort to improve the article until the VfD is resolved, but if the article stays, I will step up.) <a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepyHappyDoc_e4b0.html" title="User:SleepyHappyDoc">SleepyHappyDoc</a> 19:42, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As another poster noted, it's really an already existing device (most often used for crack these days) that's simply being sold for tobacco - probably in part to appear legit in the face of possible criticism, in part to try and create a new marketing application. The question is really whether it deserves a separate article, and it's difficult to see that it does. It could warrant a mention in an expanded <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crackpipe.html" title="Crackpipe">crackpipe</a> article, and be linked from the articles on tobacco smoking that way, or it could be treated as a subset of <a href="../../../v/a/p/Vaporiser.html" title="Vaporiser">vaporisers</a>. Consider also that if it is successful as a nicotine delivery device, competitors will apply the same rather trivial technology and sell their own versions, which won't be called The Ubie. - <a href="../../../t/o/h/User%7EToh_d97d.html" title="User:Toh">toh</a> 02:21, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. As the author of this list (i.e., its true author, not the individual who copied it without permission from my website, JINFO.ORG), I must agree with Pilatus that such a list does not belong in Wikipedia. The stated purpose of the JINFO.ORG website (and its only purpose) is to provide a counterweight to the hundreds of anti-Semitic websites now polluting the Internet with every manner of outlandish allegation concerning the Jewish impact on the world. What JINFO.ORG is attempting to do is to provide a quantitative analysis of just what that impact has been, focusing particularly on modern science, which has been largely responsible for most of the material advancement of the human race over the last several millennia. The only reason for JINFO.ORG's publication of its lists of names is to back up that analysis. None of this appears to be Wikipedia's purpose (with its "List of Jewish Criminals," etc.), nor should it be.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>But outside of such a context, Wikipedia's Jewish lists certainly give every appearance of being nothing but a gratuitous display ethnic chauvinism, with the potential of creating even more anti-Semitism. It seems to me that while it would not be be unreasonable to attach to the article on the Jews a list of several hundred of the most prominent Jews in history and perhaps a complete list of Jewish Nobel Prize winners, the listing of thousands of names of scientists who are completely unknown to the general public makes utterly no sense. Even the Wikipedia article on the "National Medal of Science" lists only a few of the most prominent recipients, together with a link to the National Science Foundation database for the rest.</dd>
<dd>I would also like to point out that the eleven JINFO.ORG webpages that were copied without permission to create the Wikipedia "List of Jewish Scientists and Philosophers" are all copyrighted. JINFO.ORG is demanding the removal of this page; it represents both wholesale copyright infringement and plagiarism (putting a one-line "Reference" at the end of a list of ~1500 names is plagiarism). Wikipedia's predatory behavior toward both JEWHOO.COM and JINFO.ORG has effectively terminated operations at both websites - the only two websites that had been producing credible research on Jewish biography. Not only has massive amounts of copyrighted content been expropriated, but it has been then declared to be "free documentation." Many thousands of hours of highly specialized research were involved in compiling the JINFO.ORG lists; do you have any idea what it's like to become the victim of this sort of outrageous activity? Wikipedia warns its contributors: "DO NOT SUBMIT COPYRIGHTED WORK WITHOUT PERMISSION!" and "by submitting your work you promise you wrote it yourself, or copied it from public domain resources — this does not include most web pages." That seems pretty clear to me. <a href="../../../j/i/n/User%7EJinfo_6f46.html" title="User:Jinfo">Jinfo</a> 03:57, 24 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I have not looked at any alleged copyvio on the article. A list seems like borderline for copyright protection; though if the descriptions of the individuals listed are all copied (not just the facts), it's possible. However, it's certainly true that copyvio is a whole different category of concern than AfD is. Whether the article deserves to exist in a non-infringing way is entirely unrelated to whether the current article infringes; neither decision should be based on the other. If Jinfo believes this article is a copyright violation s/he should look at <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems</a>, and follow the appropriate mechanisms for removal of copyrighted material.
<dl>
<dd>Speaking only for Australia, a list is certainly copyrightable, even if all the information in it is in the public domain, if effort is involved in compiling the list. This certainly seems to be such a case. Regards, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenAveling_8f0b.html" title="User:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 06:20, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

That way, there's no loss of info, it boosts an existing article, and if she get more press, we can undo the redir. If somebody types her name (currently no duplicates), they'll be redirected to where info on her exists.

<li>Comment: If AFDs are going to be re-opened till there's a deletion, there's no point in participation. The only valid delete vote in the old one, was based on her being only a junior miss. Anybody could have voted in the last one, if they wished. If we're going to re-AFD till things till they are deleted, than my prior decision to stop bothering with AFDs was probably correct, and I should of stuck with it. I will not validate this AFD by participation. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 22:56, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree both are subject to re-review *if* new the process failed or substantial new information comes to light. Generally, it happens, that new information coming to light favors inclusion. Only ocassionally does new information favor deletion, but when it does that's a valid reason to. For instance, if you feel my first "keep" vote was based on unverified information that was removed later from the article, that would be excellent grounds for re-opening. Also, lets say Pomeroy had done nothing since the Junior Miss (which the other delete voter based their vote on) then I wouldn't have voted, and one single delete vote would be entirely sufficient to delete the article, and there would be no grounds for re-opening it (without new information). I think its absurd everybody feels that its necessary to pile-on in every AFD with ten people all saying the same thing. One voter is fine in some cases (as others were free to review it for five days). I think imperfect processes should be lived with, and attempts to make things perfect, just bog things down, and make things even worse. There is sufficient verifiable information to sustain an article here. I don't criticize anybody for wishing to vote delete, as I thought about voting delete the first time. Its a matter of process, and we have to think about how wasteful of resources we are, on some articles, while totally ignoring others. This article got a do-over, yet most don't get a once-over. Finally, I'm not saying you broke the rules, you didn't; what you did was entirely within the rules. But I still hold to my objection. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 03:04, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>It can be argued that a three-participant AFD is an example of the process failing. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 03:21, 21 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, first I would argue it was two one-particpant processes, and one can be enough (depending). The one-line stub was voted delete (properly) and the full-stub (not full article) was voted keep, properly. I think if its safe for an admin to do a speedy delete with *no* non-admin review than its safe for a non-admin to be the sole voter, when its open to review by everybody for five days (admins and non-admins). Now, if I said "keep all actors and screw wp:bio" then a review/relist would be appropriate. But I gave a valid reason, on which reasonable people can differ. At some point people have to look at the vast growth of new articles, and AFD listings, and figure out that what once worked doesn't work anymore. It's a failure. I see huge numbers of articles with *no* sources, and *no* verification being ignored while attention is paid to articles like this, which have some encyclopedic potential. It seems the only solution ever proposed for handling AFD backlog is widening speedy-delete criteria (officially and unofficially). I note, if any of the admins here, had speedy deleted the original one-line stub (which may have qualified) you'ld expect us non-admins to trust you, even though we have no way of reviewing it (e.g. we can't see the content). You had five days to review this. That's plenty. We should have left this, and moved on. In any event, your desire for more AFDs with more participants is a hopeless cause. It won't work. It can't keep up. It will fail. We just havn't hit the failure point yet. We will. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 03:55, 21 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Admins have (ideally) strict rules on what articles they can speedy, whereas AFD has a broad scope limited only by community consensus. (Personally, I would have relisted that AFD for further content, given the rewrite that barely alleged notability and the limited participation.) While AFD may have major problems, in the meantime, AFD muddles along as best it can, and no AFD variation or replacement would protect a clearly marginal article from consideration just because a previous discussion had demonstrated little interest and no consensus. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 04:04, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per nomination. This is a poorly written article that is borderline vanity, unverifiable (only 6 Google returns on the string mentioned above), and concerns a non-notable theatrical personage. <a href="../../../e/d/d/User%7EEddie.willers_4fa8.html" title="User:Eddie.willers">Eddie.willers</a> 04:00, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Max Kubiak is a prominet feature in the Montreal theatre landscape, and though the entry has been written with a heavy dose of sensationalism, the fact remains that he is pioneering a new theatre form. His public theatre interventions, or 'tactical ambushes' address issues like gentrification, corruption with Big Canola, and careless usage of public water works in montreal parks. His work has been the subject of multiple ethnography studies, and he has been recognized by such television networks as CBC and MTV. The reference to the Bah Hai's approval is actually quite true, as he cooks dinner for Bah Hai's every tuesday night, in exchange for discounts at a local video store, and ofcourse for friendship. Perhaps, heavy editing would be a preferable route to outright deletion?

<li><b>KEEP</b>This article, while not about a grammy winning, multi-platinum group, is not a hoax. Da Pupz do actually have a large following but they are as of right now a very regional cultish kind of group. Like many groups before they become huge successes, their following is based mostly on bootlegs of a very superb demo cd and fans who await their studio album in progress. I think it would be a shame to drop this article because it is informative about a group that is notoriously difficult to obtain information about. Da Pupz are expanding their fan base daily and I believe that one day this group will truly be at the top of the charts. Even if not, don't you think it is nice to find out about things you didn't know about before? The music scene of Albuquerque is not exactly the talk of the town right now, so aside from a few mentions of it here and there (this article being one of the more prominent), how would people ever find out about it if they were interested? I beg you to keep this article up, I think it is important that the curious be able to find out about this awesome group, even if they havent sold millions of records yet. Also I garauntee this is not a hoax, as somebody said, I have actually seen the group live and they were incredible!</li>
