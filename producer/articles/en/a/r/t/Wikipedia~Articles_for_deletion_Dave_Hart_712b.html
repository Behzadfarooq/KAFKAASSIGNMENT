<p>Unremarkable subject/person...lack of notability...does not rise to the level of notoriety necessary for inclusion...classic vanity page (forgive me for using the term, but it's true) which in previous incarnations has included contributions from the subject such as labeling himself a 'great man' and pretending to be a third-party "attesting" to the subject's community involvement and charitable activities <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dave_Hart&amp;oldid=91326974" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dave_Hart&amp;oldid=91326974" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>...Mr. Hart then attempted to cover his tracks by blanking the talk page entry, including a subsequent response from a user raising WP:COI objections to the article. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPassionoftheDamon_4535.html" title="User:PassionoftheDamon">PassionoftheDamon</a> 10:50, 28 December 2006 (UTC):</p>

<li>We will add the additional reasons and proof of the notoriety. Every step that I have been insructed to do to keep this article on WIlk has been done. Why do I keep recieving deletion threats? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavehart_b659.html" title="User:Davehart">Davehart</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavehart_107b.html" title="User talk:Davehart">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Davehart_eda8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Davehart">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li>With all do respect, as I mentioned, why do you consider Dave Hart to hace a lack of notability? Mr. Hart is known throughout the United States and has been an imporatant figure in many areas. In, since the main page was created, we have strived to follow every request to add references, etc. Also, just FYI the WILI link from the Dave Hart website has been removed since this seemed to be a problem. WHat in the world do we have to do to keep this page other than all of the changes and additions that we have already made. It seems to me that no page is safe and perhaps it may pass with 15 editors but then when one finds it to be non imporatant it gets deleted. Is this how Wikipedia works? Should I just gove up here or what?? I truly feel that this is a proper contribution to Wikipedia and just because you haven't heard of Dave Hart doesn't mean that thousands or millions of others haven't.

<li><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> gives the requirements for notability.

<li>Aside from the references provided most of the "supporting evidence" is in print or on video. Shall I upload this information? Please help me here as I want to convey this.

<li><b>Delete It</b> - Stop wasting time talking about it. Just delete the damn thing. Just for the record, I am Dave Hart's web master, I am not Dave Hart. You folks keep saying that this is a conflict of interest because "Dave Hart is editing his own page!" I know the WIKI rules and if I was trying to be sneeky, why the hell would I have created the username of Dave Hart and not my own? When I sat the account up, I assumed that the username had to be the title name as well. WOW, you spent so much time anylizing this!! I set this page up (not as a marketing tool) but as many people consider Mr. Hart to be "imporatant." I am sorry that you don't, but you do have the power to delete the biography so DO IT!! Also, since all of you think you have figured it out see these notes: Passion of the... wrote "subject such as labeling himself a 'great man' and pretending to be a third-party "attesting" to the subject's community involvement and charitable activities ...Mr. Hart then attempted to cover his tracks by blanking the talk page entry, including a subsequent response from a user raising WP:COI objections to the article." MY Response, Dave Hart is a great man and does many charitable activities. It amazes me how much you spent going through the history on this stuff thinking you are diugging up "dirt" on someone. And then I, Steven Reed NOT Dave Hart did not try to "blank the talk page entry" to cover anything up. I made the necessary changes then I thought that I was able to delete the notes stating the errors since they had been fixed. There you go, now stop wasting time and just delete the Dave Hart page. People try to contribute to this site and you shoot them down. It's not like I stuck a site up of a local gas station of something..(here is my signed username&#160;: DAVE HART)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Although since just thoroughly reading the details on COI I agree, I think that some of you have forgotten about your own WIKI rule:</li>
</ul>
<p>"During debates in articles' talk pages and at articles for deletion, disparaging comments may fly about the subject of the article/author and the author's motives. These may border on personal attacks, and may discourage the article's creator from future considerate contributions. Avoid using the word "vanity" in a deletion discussion — such an accusation may be defamatory. Please assume good faith, and don't bite the newcomers."</p>
<p>May I say that this is exactly what has happened here. After recieving constructive criticism from WIKI user such as Elonka, we made the effort to do everything to make the user page acceptable. Then, suddenly this morning all of the derogatory accusations began flying. Of coarse I take it personnal when those who are avid WIKI's appear to be dirt digging and trying to make it as if I have tried doing things towards the wrong. Issues such as deleting an item from an editor was done because I did not know any different. As it was mentioned, I thought that once the issue was addressed, the editors note be deleted. My Bad!! But please don't try to make like I am trying to cover something up. I will speak with Jimmy about this next week. JR Horse used the term Vanity several times. Also, this is not conflict of interest, the actual Dave Hart has only seen the WIKI page of himself a couple of times and I did not recieve any compansation to create it. I am paid to manage his corporate website only. Thanks, Steve R on behalf of User talk:Dave Hart 16:09, 28 December 2006</p>

<li>I understand completly. That was very well put and I agree that it should be deleted. I should have read the rules better before creating the article. I am sorry for the trouble. Steve R on behalf of User talk:Dave Hart 16:24, 28 December 2006</li>
