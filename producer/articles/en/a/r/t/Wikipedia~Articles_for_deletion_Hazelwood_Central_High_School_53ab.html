<p>I am a graduate of Hazelwood Central High. I attended the school for the fall of 1995 to the Summer of 1999. I have a lot of fond memories of the school. With that having been said, however, I feel there is no need fot this article. Whomever wrote this article simply copy the section on history from <a href="../../../h/a/z/Hazelwood_School_District_c95c.html" title="Hazelwood School District">Hazelwood School District</a>. Therefore I move that the article on Hazelwood Central be removed. <b>Christian_Historybuff</b> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristian_Historybuff_fedb.html" title="User:Christian Historybuff">Steve</a> 17:06, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Consensus was never reached (and never will be reached IMO) but one of the things that in the past was generally agreed upon by quite a few people was that High Schools were notable. This was never accepted as a guideline for a variety of reasons and I'm not going to branch off on a rant about that. Suffice to say there is a strong enough school inclusionist movement that this will likely be kept. At least it isn't another Elementary or Middle school.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:20, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>But there is no new information on this page that is not on the Hazelwood School District page. In fact that information and <i>wording</i> is the same. I would not object to a Hazelwood Central High Page that talked about Hazelwood sports, prinicplas and individual school history. However, this page is not any of those. This page could be renamed "The History of Hazelwood School Distict", but then this article is unnessacary since the district's history is on the District's main page.

<li><b>Comment</b> Wasn't the newspaper from this school the subject of a Supreme Court free speech decision sometime in the 1990's?

<li><b>Response to Comments</b> I'm sorry, Guy. I do not understand what you just said. What possible way is deleting a page on a school a religious issue. As to thus who vote to keep the page: This issue is not reallly the deleteion of a High School Page. The issue is: "Do we really need a page that is merely a Xerox of another page. If you will read the history section of the <a href="../../../h/a/z/Hazelwood_School_District_c95c.html" title="Hazelwood School District">Hazelwood School District</a> main page and then read the <a href="../../../h/a/z/Hazelwood_Central_High_School_6c9e.html" title="Hazelwood Central High School">Hazelwood Central High School</a> page you will see that they are identical. This is why the Hazelwood Central High Page should be either written with material about the <i>school</i> or deleted entirely.

<dd>Long and detailed discussions were held to try to agree a protocol for merging minor and unremarkable schools into larger articles for the school district. A small number of people refused on principle to accept anything other than having a separate article for every school and absolutely would not countenance compromise. No article on a verifiable school, however poorly written, however trivial, however small the stub might be, <i>no</i> article on a verifiable middle school or above will ever achieve consensus for delete, because there will always be schools inclusionists who will vote keep. You have, in essence, poked the anthill with a sharp stick. On the plus side, having insisted on saving every single school article, they are also pretty good about cleaning up the abysmal ones and at least leaving only verifiable information, albeit this is often simply a stub.</dd>
<dd>Just as nominating any Southern Baptist preacher for deletion will have you castigated as an atheist who wants to expunge all Christianity from Wikipedia, nominating a school can attract unwelcome attention from those who assume you know the history and are nominating in contempt of what they see as consensus (actually the consensus was simply to stop arguing about it and get on with writing an encyclopaedia). There really ought to be a section in the guide to deletion warning people <i>never</i> to nominate schools, it only ever generates acrimony. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 13:16, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Alot of schools are on Wikipedia. Just because you don't like the format means you have to delete. It can quite simply be solved by editing. I don't see any reason why it should be deleted. Vain? Possibly, but that should be viewed as POV, and warrants edits. Schools are all over this website, they are institutions of education and hence should be on this site. I think you would have to try VERY hard to find a school that is not on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> 00:23, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Not trying to turn this into a forum for the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> debate, but...I tested Yanksox's hypothesis and the first high school I searched for, Runcorn State High School, doesn't exist on wiki. Maybe he meant only schools in the states or whatever, but that's irrelevant; most schools are probably not on wikipedia at all. The second one I tried, the Gymnasium I attended in Germany Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn Gymnasium doesn't have an article either. Nor does it deserve one.
