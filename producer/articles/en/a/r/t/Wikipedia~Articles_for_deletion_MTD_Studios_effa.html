<p>Non-notable independent film company. Google search for ("MTD Studios" -wikipedia) returns 512 hits (mainly directory listings or self-referential). No 3rd party press mentions or <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. <b>Fails:</b> <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28companies_and_corporations%29_0e74.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)">Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)</a></p>
<p>I also suspect that this article is a <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">vanity</a> article self-writen by the head of the company Michael Thomas Dunn, since both these articles along with those for his films were all written by the same user <a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodgem4s_e50c.html" title="User:Dodgem4s">Dodgem4s</a> (<a href="../../../d/o/d/User_talk%7EDodgem4s_1b98.html" title="User talk:Dodgem4s">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dodgem4s_c5cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dodgem4s">contribs</a>) or anonymous IPs. So in light of this evidence, I'm also nominating the following for deletion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alone and Restless - Google hits for ("Alone and Restless" "Michael Thomas Dunn" -wikipedia) = 168</li>
<li>Black Zone - ("Black Zone" "Michael Thomas Dunn" -wikipedia) = 81</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm not Michael Dunn. I am DodgeM4S (John White) and the author of this content. I did copy images off the official sites and cited them. While MTD Studios is your judgement call (don't really know what defines non-notable), the feature films "Black Zone" and "Alone and Restless" are significant films shot in this area (Central Florida). I also believe that Dunn is a rising star. I submitted these articles to Wikipedia and the links to other Wikipedia pages (that seemed to annoy). Sorry if I ticked anyone off, but I still believe these articles are relavant... and I believe not a single article violates the wikipedia agreements: every submission was written in the most neutral, approriate, accurate manner that I was capable. I don't believe I violated any copyrights and the content is significant info for the regional film industry (Orlando, Florida). I will add additional content or edit my existing contributions to meet your criteria if neccessary. -- <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodgem4s_e50c.html" title="User:Dodgem4s">Dodgem4s</a> (<a href="../../../d/o/d/User_talk%7EDodgem4s_1b98.html" title="User talk:Dodgem4s">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dodgem4s_c5cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dodgem4s">contribs</a>) 18:35, 22 August 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As a primary author of the content, I will make whatever changes to make the content appropriate for Wikipedia. But again, to reiterate -- there are already many links to third party sources that are listed within these nominated page for deletion that confirm the accuracy and significance (and violate no Wikipedia guidelines) of the respective submissions. All of these contested projects are currently listed on The Internet Movie Database (a third party source -- and the world's most comprehensive movie database). It was one of the main sources of my research and cite it throughout. The company also meets the Company Notability Guidelines (companies and corporations) -- it is currently among the most productive studios within the Southeast United States. And an objection was made to Michael Thomas Dunn being referenced as a notable alumni of the University of Central Florida wikipedia page. Well, Officially from the University of Central Florida Film Program web site (<a href="http://film.ucf.edu/links_webpages.php" class="external free" title="http://film.ucf.edu/links_webpages.php" rel="nofollow">http://film.ucf.edu/links_webpages.php</a>) he is listed as a notable alumni -- so I am going to once again add his name to notable alumni on the UCF page. Not only is it a third party source, but its from the official site of the College mentioned. I think this is all just a mistake or someone's personal agenda. But the content belongs on Wikipedia. I think I have proven every objective wrong or moot. He also fails to prove that it violates "Wiki is not a Soapbox" as there are no political slant listed in any of the documents.<a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodgem4s_e50c.html" title="User:Dodgem4s">Dodgem4s</a></li>

<li><b>Reply:</b> Before I go on, please follow the established formatting. It's a pain having to clean up comments every time when you cut other people's comments in half and indent in random places. And use 4 '~' in a row to sign so your comments are timestamped. OK. Now to the meat of things, where are the links to "Orlando Business Journal, Arizona Republic Newspaper, New York Times, and the Hollywood Reporter" in the article for MTD Studios that explicitly mention the studio and not just your name? So far you haven't produced an article on "MTD Studios". All I've seen are syndicated listings and synopsises from the <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Movie_Guide_b038.html" title="All Movie Guide">All Movie Guide</a> which has a self-submission policy <a href="http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=21:avg/info_pages/a_product_submissions.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=21:avg/info_pages/a_product_submissions.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> and disqualifies it as a method for determining notability.

Most newspapers seem to delete their articles after a couple of months so there aren't a lot -- and the mainstream media sources don't generally cover a lot of independent film.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I'd also like to add that all these flagged articles were not written to stand by themselves.

<li><b>Reply:</b> I would like to make a very important point. The <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> guidelines do not even apply to "MTD Studios." It is a place, not a company or corporation. Perhaps I didn't word that properly in these wiki pages or the IMDb listing has lead to some confusion -- but there is no company with that name. It is a shooting location much like the city of Orlando or Miami. I think it is a notable landmark in Lake County, Florida -- since it is the only film production site in the county. I'd also like to point out, 4 individual production companies have production offices located there -- including Gator animation and Velocity TV (none of the 4 companies are listed as individual pages on wiki -- so not a single instance that violates the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> guidelines). Again, I will make any corrections deemed necessary, just let me know what needs to be fixed. -<a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodgeM4S_3297.html" title="User:DodgeM4S">DodgeM4S</a> 06:01, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> <i>Alone and Restless was the first feature film produced by MTD Studios in 2004.</i> That implied to me that MTD Studios was more of independent film company than a facility. In my honest opinion, all the separate articles on the movies should be deleted since they have haven't received enough coverage or critical acclaim in the press to be considered notable. However, I would be willing to endorse keeping MTD Studios as part of a series of articles on the <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_Film_Industry_a796.html" title="Florida Film Industry">Florida Film Industry</a> which to me would be a notable article. I suggest that you could probably merge all the above listed movies into a section on the production history of MTD Studios. -- <span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><i><b><span style="background-color: #003333; color:White">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</span></b></i></a><b><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333">&#160;<sup>(Talk)</sup>&#160;</span></a></b></span> 13:41, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> Yeah, it was a little unclear -- it should have read: AAR was first feature produced at MTD Studios.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for merging the articles: I think it is a great idea for most of the individual shorts/documentaries. I will begin the process of merging Steel Legends and The Standoff. However, I think the 2 feature films Alone and Restless and Black Zone may deserve individual coverage (these were large projects in the area). Although, I think the Midnight Conflict short might merit its own article (at least for UCF film program background) since its success prompted the program to allow Digitally Shot (DV) projects in their curriculum -- which had previously been excluded (the film school used 16mm film exclusively until 1998). Here is the updated MTD Studios with the merge. -<a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodgeM4S_3297.html" title="User:DodgeM4S">DodgeM4S</a> 10:51, 27 August 2006 (UTC)&lt;</p>
