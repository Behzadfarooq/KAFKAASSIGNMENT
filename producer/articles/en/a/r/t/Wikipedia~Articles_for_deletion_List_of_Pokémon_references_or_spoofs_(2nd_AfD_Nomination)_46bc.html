<p>First off: <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In Black</a> nominated this for deletion <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_references_or_spoofs_cd12.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Pokémon references or spoofs">a few months ago</a>, and the result was "no consensus"; I didn't know about that debate when I decided to nominate this for deletion. I've had a problem with this article for a few months now. I discovered it back in December and, going against my initial instinct to nominate it for deletion, instead <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_references_or_spoofs&amp;diff=95651688&amp;oldid=95178293" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_references_or_spoofs&amp;diff=95651688&amp;oldid=95178293" rel="nofollow">deleted most of the list items</a>, leaving only the most "notable" items. The current page, though not as long as the one I purged back then, is nonetheless pretty bad. I can see a possible reason for having this page (separating this "trivia" from the main article to avoid clutter there), but that's a weak argument at best. The <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon.html#Cultural_influence" title="Pokémon">small section in the main article</a> is, with a bit of expansion, sufficient: it mentions a couple of the more notable references, and provides links to the appropriate pages. Additionally, unlike this page, the section of the main article that deals with cultural references is much more high-profile, and therefore easier to edit to weed out extraneous, fancrufty information. There is no reason to have this information anyway - it's not encyclopedic in any sense of the term. Who needs to know about a Pokémon card parody by <i>Nickelodeon Magazine</i> back in the late '90s? I saw that spoof, and laughed at it, and could probably even dig it out of my old magazine piles to verify it. But it's not at all notable or important, and neither are almost all the items on this page. This is one of the useless extraneous pages that the <a href="../../../p/c/p/WP%7EPCP_c57f.html" title="WP:PCP">PCP</a> often catches a lot of flak about; the fewer of them the better. ~e.o.t.d~ (<a href="../../../e/y/e/User%7EEye.of.the.dragonfly_c6de.html" title="User:Eye.of.the.dragonfly">蜻蛉の目</a>•<a href="../../../e/y/e/User_talk%7EEye.of.the.dragonfly_9f7c.html" title="User talk:Eye.of.the.dragonfly">話す</a>•<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Eye.of.the.dragonfly_c220.html" title="Special:Contributions/Eye.of.the.dragonfly">貢献</a>) 21:48, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. A textbook example of what's wrong with all "in popular culture" sections and articles: nothing but a non-notable, crufty wall of trivia. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep and improve</b> - While i agree with Krimpet's arguement that this is one of those lists that makes people want to crusade against <i>all</i> pop culture lists, both RobJ1981 and Jerichi need to remember that just calling something <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">cruft</a> is not an argument in itself and should be avoided at AFDs. First, the keep: Any subject that has become so well known that it is criticized, parodied, and referenced in a wide variety of media outlets deserves a section that appropriately details some of the more high-profile or notable cases (e.g. given <i><a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_326f.html" title="South Park">South Park</a>'s</i> ratings, the "Chinpokomon" episode would be high-profile). I could make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a> and go over to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_in_popular_culture.html" title="Wikipedia in popular culture">Wikipedia in popular culture</a> and delete the two rather lengthy lists found there. While there may be consensus for deleting the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_in_popular_culture.html#Miscellaneous" title="Wikipedia in popular culture">Miscellaneous</a> section, I doubt I would get away with rming the first one which are "Landmark references." I'm not trying to make a "two wrongs make a right" arguement, i just want to show how editors tend to say, "Well it's Pokemon, and so if it's not highly important or ref-bloated we should get rid of it." The result is "cruft, cruft, cruft." How to improve: If you take a close look at Otto4711's arguements you can see that this list <i>could</i> be improved if anyone wanted to take the time to provide the importance of said pop culture references - the Wikpedia related article justifies many of it's inclusions because they are the first examples within a specific media (of course 3 of them could be rm for not fulfilling this criterion), this list could follow suit with many of the entries. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">ΖαππερΝαππερ</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappernapper_cf32.html" title="User talk:Zappernapper">Babel</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zappernapper_a171.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zappernapper">Alexandria</a></sub> 16:05, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I don't think anyone would argue that "<a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinpokomon.html" title="Chinpokomon">Chinpokomon</a>" or "<a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirty_Minutes_over_Tokyo_cd9e.html" title="Thirty Minutes over Tokyo">Thirty Minutes over Tokyo</a>" aren't notable - of all of them, they do definitely deserve to be mentioned. <a href="../../../l/i/n/Ling-Ling_8cf3.html" title="Ling-Ling">Ling-Ling</a> too, perhaps, though <i><a href="../../../d/r/a/Drawn_Together_fd54.html" title="Drawn Together">Drawn Together</a></i> isn't as well-known as the others. But these references and the few others that are relatively important can be contained easily in the section in the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon.html#Cultural_references" title="Pokémon">section in the main Pokémon article</a> (as they already somewhat are). And while pointing a finger and yelling "CRUFT!" is hardly an argument in itself, it's an allegation that can't just be waved aside. It <i>is</i> undeniably crufty, but another, more important argument that I was trying to put forward (which may not have come through as well) is that because all of the pertinent information can fit easily on the main Pokémon page, this article is simply unnecessary. ~e.o.t.d~ (<a href="../../../e/y/e/User%7EEye.of.the.dragonfly_c6de.html" title="User:Eye.of.the.dragonfly">蜻蛉の目</a>•<a href="../../../e/y/e/User_talk%7EEye.of.the.dragonfly_9f7c.html" title="User talk:Eye.of.the.dragonfly">話す</a>•<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Eye.of.the.dragonfly_c220.html" title="Special:Contributions/Eye.of.the.dragonfly">貢献</a>) 18:48, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Even if every item on the list were sourced it would still be indiscriminate and a directory. Unless those sources included verification that those items which resemble Pokemon were in fact intended by the creator to be a spoof of Pokemon (as opposed to some other similar card game or toy) the list would still suffer from <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 20:17, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>i'm not trying to say that merely sourcing the list will make it better. We <i>should</i> be discriminating in what is kept in the article. As in the example below, <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kids_Next_Door_00a8.html" title="Kids Next Door">Kids Next Door</a> spoofs hardly seem notable enough as the Pokemon allusions constitute OR unless someone can find a source saying the creators intentionally did it, and even then - it's such a unconsquential aspect of the show that it's <i>still</i> non-notable. e.o.t.d. is of the opinion that all the appropriate references after being properly sourced and having their notability and relevance expanded upon, would still fit nicely into the Pokemon article as a section, i'm disinclined to agree, as i managed to figure about eight entries that are notable, probable enough to be sourceable, and relevant to either Pokemon itself, the real-world, or the medium it was presented in (i.e. the KND episodes wouldn't have been changed much by <i>not</i> including the Ash look-a-like, however the <i>Doctor Who</i> novel makes some significant commentary that affects the overall impression of the reading).

<li><b>Comment:</b> Looking at the log, it seems that the reason the last nomination was "no consensus" even with a decent number more "deletes" than "keeps" is the fact that the "deletes" gave hardly any support to their opinions.
