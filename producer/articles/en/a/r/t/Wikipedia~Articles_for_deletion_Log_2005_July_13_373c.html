<blockquote>
<p>Specializing in Roman history, religion and material culture, Shaw's books include <i>Spartacus and the Slave Wars: A Brief History with Documents</i>, published by St. Martin's Press in 2001; and Variorum editions of <i>Environment and Society in Roman North Africa</i> and <i>Rulers, Nomads and Christians in Roman North Africa</i>, published in 1995.

<li><b>Delete</b> or move to Wikibooks. Whether or not the content is objectionable, it's certainly not in the format of an encyclopedia article. The C article already extensively discusses <a href="../../../c/_/p/C_programming_language.html#Problems" title="C programming language">problems with C</a>, which covers much of this, and anything it doesn't could be merged into that section. Besides, much of the advice is not specific to C. Be gentle on the contributor though — they're obviously new and probably didn't realise this material was inappropriate. I'd suggest <i>merge and redirect</i>, but the title is nothing someone could conceivably type in a search box. <a href="../../../d/c/o/User%7EDcoetzee_a2a7.html" title="User:Dcoetzee">Deco</a> 29 June 2005 19:44 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> (with open mind) fanfiction work-in-progress.

Someday the film, if completed, might rate a footnote on the <a href="../../../g/a/m/Games_Workshop_bae0.html" title="Games Workshop">Games Workshop</a> article or it might rate an article of its own depending on fan response, as noted above. The article certainly could find a home at another wiki. I personally am going to bookmark the site and watch their progress with interest. A lot of talent, energy and hard work is going into this labor of love. ~ <a href="../../../w/c/f/User%7EWCFrancis_461e.html" title="User:WCFrancis">WCFrancis</a> 23:50, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I was the one who originally started the article - I heard about this movie and thought that it would be a significant thing for people who are interested in Warhammer 40K in that there has never been a movie set in the Warhammer 40K universe. Given the amount of information about the games etc in relation to Games Workshoop I think that it would be remiss if wikipedia didn't contain something about this. BTW I am not accociated with the movie in any way - I only put in the info about the soundtrack because I thought that it would be of interest. <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGil-Galad_cb34.html" title="User:Gil-Galad">Gil-Galad</a></li>

<li>Thanks for pointing that list out to me. No disageement about the validity of pop culture for inclusion, just of the merits of a list of this nature.

<li>Length of the article is usually the concern for splitting these off, because these will typically have episode summaries added that would just make the main article far too long. In this case, given the current size of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barney_and_Friends_1105.html" title="Barney and Friends">Barney and Friends</a>, I'm fine with <b>merging</b> until the content grows enough to necessitate splitting back off. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 03:27, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Besides length, I have also noted that FAC nominations tend to hit a brick wall if the articles are too list-heavy. If anyone wants to put the main article up for Featured Article status, they pretty much need to spin lists off into their own articles. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 13:00, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - It does seem very subjective. I wouldn't even agree on the Chaplin -&gt; Downey idea. Chaplin acted, wrote, directed, and scored films.

<li><b>Comment</b> I've already commented on this in the main article but I feel this also bears repeating here. Whether or not the encylopedic nature of an article is in dispute does <b>not</b> mean it's an excuse to goof around and pretend this is an Uncyclopedia article. We do have to maintain a certain professional standard in our article writing, and certainly avoid inserting biased opinions meant primarily to mock instead of inform. Like I alluded to, there's Uncyclopedia if you want to goof around that badly. Also, I think someone should add a clean-up tag (maybe that would be more appropriate than a VfD tag?) User:24.9.10.235</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. He's already broken <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Walsh_9c27.html" title="Tom Walsh">Tom Walsh</a>'s record (two, actually). If we delete his article we might as well delete Tom's and merge with the main <a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeopardy%21.html" title="Jeopardy!">Jeopardy!</a> or <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Jennings_ed15.html" title="Ken Jennings">Ken Jennings</a> article then, going by the logic by some here. User:24.9.10.235
<ul>
<li>Well you can't break a record that's already been broken; it doesn't work that way, or else I would have broken the 1880 land speed record on my way to breakfast this morning. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:05, 20 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>According to your logic, Wade Boggs' (whose about to be inducted into Cooperstown in a few days) entry should be denied because he never has done anything truly exceptional, or John Elway or Dan Marino should be removed from the Hall of Fame because they've never done anything truly Earth-shattering such as Terry Bradshaw's Super Bowl winning record (hell, Marino has <i>never won a single Super Bowl!</i>). For that matter, according to the same logic Tom Walsh's page needs to be verified for deletion too, since Madden (let alone Jennings) have proven it's hardly an insurmountable figure (let's face it, it's only <i>seven games</i>). The reason why it <i>is</i> an important <b>milestone</b> is because this is only the second time that record has been surpassed (although I personally believe it will hardly be the last) but for now it's at least as notable as Tom Walsh's old record.
<ul>
<li>Nope, I'm just saying he didn't break a record, which is true. And, indeed, I'm no great proponent of Walsh's page either, but (like it or not) he did hold a few records, which Daveyboy has not done. And if old whatshername had realized that the Ode to Joy was not 70 minutes long (no matter how slow its played) Dave would be yesterday's news already. I'm not saying he won't be the next big thing in game show contestants; I'm just saying as of now he isn't. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 04:08, 21 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>He may not have broken any records yet but for the time being he's a notable player and it looks like he'll surpass the 15-game mark many people have mentioned as being the threshold allowing him an article. Once again, according to your logic many notable people should be ignored, a logic I frankly find to be ignorant at best. Think of it this way; if he does manage to win $1,000,000 in non-tournament winnings he'll still probably become a 'cause celeb' and yet still be about a third from Jennings' total winnings. Because the new records are so insurmountable, I think we shouldn't be so hung up on them.
<ul>
<li>Nowhere did I say he <i>needed</i> to hold a record to be notable enough for an article, I merely said a record would likely justify one. My main point is that the Walsh comparisons were flawed because Walsh was both a first and a holder of three records (and even his notability is somewhat questionable in my book); Madden doesn't fit either of those criteria. Maybe he will soon warrant an article, but I don't think he has yet, and he certainly didn't when this article was written. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 00:25, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To tell you the truth I've been kinda waivering between "keep" and "delete" myself, but I think we can give Madden the benefit of the doubt and keep it for now. I don't think it will be too much longer for him to gain noteriety (he's only $200,000 away from half a million; that may seem like quite a bit but it took him only, what, two weeks to get $200,000?), and if he falls short we can always delete later. Or whatever the Wikiministrators decide.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Why don't we just give this situation the benefit of the doubt? After all, it would be much easier to decide to delete the article if he loses on tomorrow's episode, for example. Why jump on it now if the possibility exists that he may become noteworthy later on? In fact, David only has to win once more to tie the previously-held record of wins prior to <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Jennings_ed15.html" title="Ken Jennings">Ken Jennings</a> which was <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Walsh_9c27.html" title="Tom Walsh">Tom Walsh</a> who was the first contestant to win more than 5 games when the 5-game rule was eliminated. asert 04:04, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Nothing here really. If he actaully approaches anything like Ken then we can create an article on him. This doesn't say anything anyway. Alex uses the K-word once in a haphazard remark and everyone thinks this guy's on the way to win 70 more games. I think a good test will be to see when and if he's mentioned outside of the show (and internet forums on the show). After Ken won about 12 games or so I think it was, Letterman started talking about him, as did others. Doesn't seem to be happening with Dave yet. All this "chronicling the next Ken" was all over wikipedia the moment he lost, and nothing panned out there.

<li>Comment: Tom Walsh probably shouldn't have an article either. I guess he does only because he was the first player ever to appear on a 6th show, which had basically nothing to do with him, but everything to do with a change in the rules and good timing. (Well, not <i>nothing</i>; he had to win a bunch of games, which isn't trivial, but not exactly encyclopedic). He also held several Jeopardy records.

<li>"Rare" is not "encyclopedic". I could do all sorts of rare things. 8 appearances on Jeopardy will not be so rare much longer as people are no longer cut off at 5 games. In fact, the 5 games limit had only been removed a short while before someone exceeded it by 15 times. As I said, Tom Walsh held 3 records, Dave is <i>nowhere near</i> even one. When he gets his record, he'll get his page. In fact, I'd like to make a Game show records page as place to cover these contestant stubs (like Walsh) as well as some of the info on Ken's page about records he's held. The only problem is that other than Jeopardy and Millionaire and a few others I'm not entirely sure where to find such information. And to cover all, or most, game shows it would be quite a substantial endeavor. If anyone else likes this idea let me know and maybe we can work on it. The best I can see Madden getting is a runner up for most Jeopardy (regular season) appearances if he gets that far. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 21:59, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Last summer, when Ken Jennings was at the peak of his popularity (middle of last July), he had <b>over 23,000</b> hits on Google (for ' "Ken Jennings" Jeopardy ') and 914 Google News hits. ' "David Madden" Jeopardy' has 118 hits on Google, and 0 Google News hits. Ken Jennings has an article because he transcended his genre. Now people are going "9 games? Who cares!" Tom Walsh has an article because at least a modicum of normal people cared about his 7 wins. Dave Madden is still <b>not notable</b> in the context of his newsworthyness, meaning he really does not deserve an article in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">OntarioQuizzer</a> 09:45, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP:</b> 9 games is an impressive streak on Jeopardy, and whether or not he has Google news results (he has one now) has little to do with noteworthiness.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Madden is currently notable only to Jeopardy viewers, but I think this vfd is premature. Why don't we wait and see how long he makes it? If he's eliminated soon and thereby becomes nonnotable, we can always delete the article. If he wins a lot and becomes noteworthy, we won't have to come back and recreate a deleted article. As it is, his chances could go either way. I would suggest waiting until we can be sure. <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinadot_5292.html" title="User:Binadot">Binadot</a> 03:45, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Barely notable in the realm of Jeopardy! translates into not notable for encyclopedic consumption. The arguement that he has performed a "rare" feat is also misleading because Jeopardy! has only recently implmented the format that allows a champion to remain more than five days and much of that period was dominated by a single individual.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I think this debate should have ended by now. He has won 14 in a row which is double that of Tom Walsh. If he is not worthy, then Walsh certainly is not as well. I would say the standard should probably be 10 in a row. As a long time Jeopardy fan my guess is that only 1-2 people per season of Jeopardy will accomplish that feat.</dd>

<li>The Pokemon people point out that Pokemon is a TV show and set of stories, and individual pokemon have a following and are as notable fictional characters as many cartoon characters or characters in books. Personally, however, I believe that most of the Pokemon do not deserve article as they are not notable. Note that the Pokemon rule is merely a rule of thumb accepted by <i>some</i> wikipedians, and by no means the law of the land. Whether you accept the Pokemon rules or not, Chaos Orcs are far less notable than Pokemon because they do not have movies about them, cult followings, or life stories.--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalidecyphon_5f3e.html" title="User:Halidecyphon">Halidecyphon</a> 21:25, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I feel that I should point out that this article isn't about individual Chaos Orcs, but about the group as a whole. And I daresay that Warcraft has a significant following. Perhaps someone would be willing to improve the article. I don't know enough about Chaos Orcs to input anything useful, but I bet if someone took the time to lay out their abilities and weaknesses, and whatever else, the article would flesh out.

<li><b>No vote</b> for the time being. I was originally going to vote delete, and then I was going to vote to merge it into an article such as List of species in Warcraft (species? units?) but similar articles have been deleted in the past. If there seems to be a consensus that lists of units in computer games are not notable, then it hardly seems the units themselves are notable. The <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> policy appears to suggest merging in point 2: <i>Minor characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be merged with short descriptions into a "List of minor characters." This list should reside in the article relating to the work itself, unless either becomes long, in which case a separate article for the list is good practice.</i> However, if we were simply to delete that list at some later time as gamecruft, that doesn't make any sense. --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan_Christensen_06ee.html" title="User:Jonathan Christensen">Jonathan Christensen</a> 06:31, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, This has been heavily revised (to be non advertisement-ish, which was NOT the intent) since all previous votes, and it <b>IS</b> actually a notable software entry. It's newness to the industry belies its growing popularity, hence some have not yet heard of it... clearly some have&#160;:-) If you all feel it needs further revision, no problem, just post in discussion, and I'll be happy to oblige (P.S. If I'm not allowed to vote on my own article, then I humbly apologize in advance!) Rcryniak 22:47, July 15, 2005 (UTC)

<li>You certainly allowed to vote, but as an article author would be nice if you provide some proof that the software is notable (see request for references on Talk page). Please also indicate if you ask people on external discussion board to come here and vote.

<li><b>Keep</b>, Looking at the revisions, the latest seems good, worthy of keeping I think. The product is getting fairly well known, I've used it myself and I'm friends with several International FIDE tournament players and I know a couple of them use it. Dutch1124 0:30, July 16, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I've clarified the criteria as an explicit list of ten or more items, given examples (The Alphabet Song and We Didn't Start The Fire), and removed a few items as a result (notably 99 Bottles of Beer On The Wall); more vetting is still needed. —<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenFrantzDale_c7e5.html" title="User:BenFrantzDale">BenFrantzDale</a> 16:04, July 13, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Point taken.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The inclusion of songs like "Kokomo" and "Walk on the Wild Side" make it clear that one man's "list" is another's "motif", "repeated phrase" or "chorus". Too subjective, and honestly accomplishes nothing anyway. The purpose of lists is to shed light on the underlying subject, e.g., the list of songs about drugs helps us understand how drugs are regarded in pop culture. Do we learn anything about "lists" from this article? Obviously not. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 16:57, July 13, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree it needs cleanup but with the clarification I gave, that cleanup is now possible. I don't think we learn anything about lists from the article, but we do learn about songs and what people like to sing about. For me this list answers the question "What other songs are like <i>The End Of The World As We Know It</i> and <i>We Didn't Start The Fire</i>?" It may not be a deep question, but I find it fascinating. —<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenFrantzDale_c7e5.html" title="User:BenFrantzDale">BenFrantzDale</a> 17:05, July 13, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I appreciate your trying, but the "list" needs more of a definition than a number (and any number has the problem of arbitrariness.) <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blowin_in_the_Wind_e332.html" title="Blowin in the Wind">Blowin in the Wind</a> is quite literally a list of 12 questions punctuated by its chorus. It is a list with more than ten items, but it isn't what you're looking for (I think). I honestly don't know how to qualify things to get what I think you want. Together with others, even if you did have a foolproof qualification, I'm not sure the list serves an encyclopedic purpose. It would be possible to start a List of songs whose first lyric word is "Since", and that might be curiously amusing, but it is essentially an exercise in the absurd. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 23:25, 13 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Trying to get at a definition is tricky. I'd say Blowin' in the Wind doesn't count because it has a collection of sentences not a list in the typographic sense like <a href="../../../w/e/_/We_Didn%27t_Start_The_Fire_0b80.html" title="We Didn't Start The Fire">We Didn't Start The Fire</a>. (If you remove all the "Yes and"s from the lyrics, then it might start to be a list song.) As for List of songs whose first lyric word is "Since", I don't think there's any point to lists of songs when the list could be derived from a complete database of lyrics and metadata. (The same goes for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_by_Muddy_Waters_7adf.html" title="List of songs by Muddy Waters">List of songs by Muddy Waters</a>.) I see the song lists as a good place to collect songs that fall into more-essoteric categories. —<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenFrantzDale_c7e5.html" title="User:BenFrantzDale">BenFrantzDale</a> 06:36, July 14, 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>When you it put it that way, I am afraid the list violates <b>no original research</b>. See, if there is an esoteric genre of "long, rapid-fire list" songs, there should be an <i>article</i> on that topic, citing primary sources that have discussed this genre. One can't "sneak" esoteric, original research into the encyclopedia by way of a list.

<p>At least keep it true and clean and let it stay. Stop messing with it folks.</p>
<p>Not a real article. As a Seattle Mariners fan, I like to rag on Bloomquist as much as any other fan, but Wiki is not the place to do it. Bloomquist is not really of enough signifigance to earn his own Wiki page.</p>
<p>It's fine now. I don't see why he wouldn't deserve a page, he's a MLB regular and linked to by two other articles. He's also a local fan favorite.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> He is notable in the gaming world for his work, as well as notable for his podcast which is regularly one of the highest (if not the highest) ranked gaming podcast. The article would need some work, of course, and I would be willing to do this. There are no names for his multi-million dollar accomplishments because of agreements he signed when selling his company. Also, Steve regularly releases information on his site, especially concerning the game Spore, well before most, if not all other news sources get the information. <a href="../../../s/y/p/User%7ESyphonbyte_a97f.html" title="User:Syphonbyte">syphonbyte</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> If you search for his radio show Gaming Steve on Google you end up with about <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Gaming+Steve%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Gaming+Steve%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">3600 hits</a> which is what his "claim to fame" would be. FYI, I heard about his site through a friend who heard about him through work in a small town up in Canada. So he is definately generating a following. Sure the entry needs to be cleaned up but as someone who hopped on wiki to learn more about him, I can attest that I was personally interested in learning about him... so it's not just vanity thing going on. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraniterock_4f82.html" title="User:Graniterock">Granite T.

<li><b>Keep!</b> (close to Strong Keep) - yes it's silly, but these people are all notable, and agree with Brequinda that this is actually an encyclopedic gem!

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not encyclopedic. <i>Double-barrelled name</i> appears to be a neologism based on raw number of Google hits, but if it's a UK thing, maybe that's why I've never heard it. In any case, if this article is kept, it needs to be renamed to something that non-Brits will recognize. Also, change <i>people</i> to <i>notable people</i>.

<li>further to previous - how about a <b>Keep</b>, but rename to 'A List of Notable People With <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double-barrelled_name.html" title="Double-barrelled name">Double-barrelled name</a>' - is it in fact possible to have a link in an article name ('scuse ignorance)? - and a personal note - this list is of course fun, and a bit silly - but the collection of these names IMO is encyclopedic in the broad Wiki sense, and brings interesting questions of class / power relationships to mind - and could be a useful resource for related research, that's my two pennies! <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetesmiles_8c9b.html" title="User:Petesmiles">Petesmiles</a> 15:48, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>But how does this bring power/class questions to mind? How is it useful for related research? I can see no use for this! What about 'list of celebrities whose surname relates to an occupation - or whose middle name begins with a vowel - or who don't have middle names - are these also encyclopedic?

<li><b>Delete</b>. "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information", including "Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics". Double-barrelled names quite rightly have an article. Various examples in there (as it has for triple-barrelled names) are certainly appropriate. A list of all of them?

Make sure the most famous examples are in <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double-barrelled_name.html" title="Double-barrelled name">Double-barrelled name</a>, and then I'd say delete the list.

I don't think it is possible to expand the article, the Indian rugby union don't have any staff at all and as a consequence have no website or press officers.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi, I'm one of the people that created the Temple. I can assure you it was a member who created the entry. However, if you wish to delete it... then you will, I suppose. Which is a shame, as it's a completely valid site. The only decent case you have against it is the Alexa thing. Never mind. Chimneysweep 13:02, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I guess this is a losing battle (and quite a pointless one at that) but the fact is that Madness Temple is a fast-growing community. Chimneysweep 13:02, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The point isn't that it's a fast-growing community- it's that the temple isn't really a notable site. b3ta has tens of thousands of members, it has got a lot of press attention and it is very well known around the web community. Madness temple has been up for about five days. Hardly anyone knows about it, and it's done nothing particularly important.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi, I'm the guy who wrote the piece...I thought the whole point of Wikipedia was to inform about various issues, including sites on the Internet? I wrote the piece from a neutral standpoint as requested (writing only to inform, as is the whole point, and without giving an opinion either way) and stressed heavily the fact that it was new and a b3ta spin-off of sorts. I didn't realise that Wikipedia only lists major sites; to me, that seems rather moot, as everyone knows all about the major sites anyway. I felt the MT had enough noteworthy stuff on it to deserve a place here, hence my entry. Heh, please don't bash, 'twas an honest mistake if it can really be considered as such. Feral.</li>

<p>Firstly, I know this is a WikiProject. However, the success of <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_WikiProject_Addressing_Anti-Jewish_Bias_477b.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/WikiProject Addressing Anti-Jewish Bias">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/WikiProject Addressing Anti-Jewish Bias</a> has prompted me to create a VfD for this project. My reasoning is that, like several WikiProjects, there is no interest in it whatsoever. In two and a half years only one 'edit' has been made to the page, which was adding it to a category (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWikiProject_National_anthems&amp;diff=16031320&amp;oldid=3959535" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWikiProject_National_anthems&amp;diff=16031320&amp;oldid=3959535" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. Also, i'm unsure theres any need for such a WikiProject. Certainly, when it gets this inactive (the creator was an anon who hasn't edited since 2003) it should just be deleted. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 17:00, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> If there are clear criteria for deletion of WikiProject pages, someone please point me to them, otherwise I will assume that total inactivity for a year is a reasonable benchmark. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 17:32, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure that it would be wise to set a policy of permanently deleting WikiProjects, even if they are inactive. A new set of wikipedians could conceivably find the project interesting and be able to work on the foundations of those before them. Perhaps some method of archiving them would be better. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">Baron</a><a href="../../../b/a/r/User_talk%7EBaronLarf_6f13.html" title="User talk:BaronLarf">Larf</a> 21:03, July 13, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, given the state of this one, theres nothing to archive. Its three years of bear bones - One list, a badly spelled introduction sentence, and some comments about renaming it which were made in 2002. I doubt theres anything worth keeping anywhere. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 21:14, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Granted, there are few people who are interested in national anthems (like me). However, unlike the one VFD mentioned above, this is not dealing with POV but of national symbols. Plus, if the main concern is about who will run it, then <b>I will.</b> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 22:44, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - wikiprojects have no expiration dates. I would not suggest deleting wikiprojects (unless they are potentially offensive) if they are inactive or even if their purpose would have been fulfilled (which I do not think would happen any time soon). Interest in a specific wikiproject waxes and wanes just like everything else in this world. Note that I am not active in any wikiproject. Maybe Wikiprojects could find a way to periodically try to attract interest of new contributors? - <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkysmith_c555.html" title="User:Skysmith">Skysmith</a> 11:21, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep but rename</b> to fix capitalization. The difference between this one and the anti-jewish bias one is that this one is pushing verifiable information, while the latter is pushing POV.

<li>I'd say so, as your the only person interested in it. Theres three votes (one yours) relating to your willingness to run it. Three keep are for not deleting Wikiprojects, three are delete.

<p>One of the founders of the website Television Without Pity was previously ruled not notable enough for an entry here; using that reasoning, I don't believe a recapper at the site should be either. <a href="../../../q/a/q/User%7EQaqaq_a365.html" title="User:Qaqaq">Qaqaq</a> 17:30, July 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> What was the rationale for deleting one of TWoP's founders? There are articles for founders of sites such as Kuro5hin, Ain't it Cool News and Metafilter. In terms of notability, TWoP should be at least comparable to those.
<dl>
<dd>Miss Alli did not found TWoP. That would be Sars, Glark, and Wing Chun (and I believe one of those three came along later). <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Halterman_044d.html" title="User:Mike Halterman">Mike H</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Halterman_f64b.html" title="User talk:Mike Halterman">(Talking is hot)</a> 17:32, July 14, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I know that, but one of <a href="../../../q/a/q/User%7EQaqaq_a365.html" title="User:Qaqaq">User:Qaqaq</a>'s reasons for deletion is that an article on a TWoP founder was also deleted. I'd like to know why.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I wasn't part of the vote, but a page for Glark was eliminated within the last few months; I believe non-notability was the reason. <a href="../../../q/a/q/User%7EQaqaq_a365.html" title="User:Qaqaq">Qaqaq</a> 18:18, July 14, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not non-notability per se, but the fact that they didn't write it about the person, but rather "Glark," the screen name, and that was a big factor in why it was deleted. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Halterman_044d.html" title="User:Mike Halterman">Mike H</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Halterman_f64b.html" title="User talk:Mike Halterman">(Talking is hot)</a> 18:19, July 14, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's pretty actionable. They don't exactly keep their names secret. It could probably be found by a couple of quick Google searches. Miss Alli, for example, is named Linda Holmes.
<dl>
<dd>I'd still vote to delete Linda Holmes, because she's a person who writes recaps at a website. I don't find it notable, even though you do (and don't even sign your posts, at that). <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Halterman_044d.html" title="User:Mike Halterman">Mike H</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Halterman_f64b.html" title="User talk:Mike Halterman">(Talking is hot)</a> 18:34, July 14, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Easy there. I didn't vote on this. I haven't argued for keeping Miss Alli and I'm not that fussed about what happens to this page. I was just asking about the deletion of an article on a TWoP founder.
<dl>
<dd>Sorry about that, then. But yeah, that's why it was deleted, from what I read. There was an argument about "why do we write articles on screen names?" "No! Let's delete!" <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Halterman_044d.html" title="User:Mike Halterman">Mike H</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Halterman_f64b.html" title="User talk:Mike Halterman">(Talking is hot)</a> 18:56, July 14, 2005 (UTC)

<p>Nominated for deletion because I can't find any record of this party existing (despite the fact that the article's believable enough internally). I tried searching for anarchists in West Paris but had little luck. I think it's a fake. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 18:35, 13 July 2005 (UTC) (Note: Please forgive any formatting errors here -- I haven't vfd'd something in months.)</p>
<p>Although I am not a user on Wikipedia I live in Paris and have heard rumors of such a party, however it is very low key. I am surprised to see an article on Wikipedia about it and believe that it is important that it remains on. -In-hawn Yeo</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you provide any news clippings about the party? If it's an actual organization, that would almost certainly change my position -- as it is, I can't find one site on the Internet that mentions "Demunich Gum", the alleged founder of the party, nor can I find "Demunican" used as a word in any context. Is it possible it's spelled in another way? <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 18:43, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I live in France and I think I have seen one of the minor parties named Demunican on a list. Although this shall be soon verified as to see if it really does exist, from what I have found so far from past achieves, there are traces of its existence. It would seem that there is a distinct connection between one of the german parties hence questioning its origin. Could it be that the Demunican party is related to Demunication that is a currently a small but influencial movement that is being issued in Paris? - Seijin Oh</li>
</ul>
<p>Having lived in Paris for a considerable amount of time and being immersed in the french culture for a considerable period of time i can verify the existence of the Demunican Party or more precisely that it is rumored that a party that goes by that name does exist. However there is no existing proof of who actually is a member and hence due to the lack of knowledge regarding them there are no mainstream articles available.- Cormac Vizzard</p>
<p>I am also not a user of Wikipedia but as Mr Yeo, I am also familiar with the party and its whereabouts. I am a resident of the neighbourhood of Passy and come into contact with the headquarters (located on the corner of Rue Beethoven and Rue Chardin). It seems to be very popular with the youths of the nearby schools, but as far as I can tell, it was founded in 2002 and would most probably qualify as a "One Member Party" as described in the article concerning the French Political Parties. It seems to be low key more than anything, and thus would be widely unknown as I doubt their base is strong enough for any actual Political action as</p>
<ul>
<li>Well as I study political sciences at Sorbonne I continuously hear about different low-key parties with few members that one can not hear about via the internet. This is the first such group I hear of, and I believe it is important to leave the article on as it will most likely encourage the other small political parties of Paris to make themselves more public rather than remain private and exclusive clubs. It would also greatly aid my research project on such groups, so would you please let the article remain on Wikipedia. -In-hawn Yeo

Unless you can produce reference to this political organization in published books, news media, or some other independent and reliable source, we can't leave it up.

<p>believe the term party is a glorification of their existance...more like hooliganism with ideals...but then again what is else is a revolution...but it is true they do exist...their most famous appearance was at the St. Lazare metro station where in 5 minutes like a swarm of ants they tore down every piece of advertising in the station and dissapeared...again there is no positive proof to say it was them as officially they don't even exist...but being a journalist in this city you learn things most others don't and I would be willing to wager that it was none other than the Demunicans</p>

<p>Who is to say what type of knowledge is notable or not. Isnt the very purpose of an encyclopedia to gather information from as many different resources as humanly possible in order to further our knowledge and understanding of the world we live in today. The fibre that separates an internet encyclopedia from one in binding is that here space is limitless causing knowledge to be limitless and the thirst for knowledge to be perpetual. Hence those for the deletion of this article should think once more about what they are truly asking for and should learn to see the world from outside the claustrophobic environment they choose to inhabit.</p>

<li>It is pretty difficult due to restrictions placed by governments on multiple citizenship. Also, over the last 10-20 years many governments have withdrawn citizenship rights purely for birth. This means that for the newer generations (those more likely to get two citizenships from parents), one needs to be born abroad in a country that still gives rights (UK, for example, DE, etc, don't) to two parents of different citizenships where both parent citizenships are be transferrable (some countries only transfer from the father or the mother), naturalize to a fourth, and have all four parties accept the arrangement. So, yes, it's not easy. And verifiable through Guinness, i believe. <small>(Unsigned comment by page creator at 84.73.7.39)</small></li>

<li>ok, last comment. do a google on 'four citizenships', you get 5 claims. two of these include a chinese citizenship - china doesn't recognize dual citizenship. one of these contain an argentinian citizenship - argentina only recognizes dual with spain. one contains israel, jordan and palestine - palestine is not a recognized state. the final doesn't list the countries. there is nothing claiming 5 or 6. <small>(Unsigned comment by page creator at 84.73.7.39)</small>

<p>A bit on a non-article, although more complete versions are on the Italian and German wikis.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have not (yet) voted to delete the article, but I have mentioned that I suspect the information is not verifiable. Nothing has been added to this discussion to shed any light on the verifiability of Scarello's standing or importance (which is subtly different than his fame or acclaim). If you have access to resources which would verify the claims, then please share them with us. From what I can tell, not being a reader of German, it seems that if Scarello has any note, it is as a founder of a small Commedia dell'Arte theater company in Mainz, and certainly not as the founder of school or style of art, or as a painter. <a href="http://www.scarello.de/scarello.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scarello.de/scarello.htm" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 21:07, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

It is not an argument on the personal pleasure.

<p>The painting is one free and conceptual art.The painters who make commerce are not important and they do not cost more than 3000 US dollar..., the art is not commerce even if the paintings cost...</p>

<p>Wiki is not an advertising newspaper. Wiki is not a Chat for poor arguments. Wiki is one free encyclopedia. But it does not have to be manipulated... Everyone of we gives its knowledge on specific topics. Without valid scientific goals they do not provoke argument. I it respects your opinion, but me he does not seem reliable. Too much mistaken and with contained not expert. I do not allow myself to write arguments on articles that of which I am not much expert. Even if sure times if these me seem improbable, I do not make comments.... I could be mistaken and write stupid things. For this I understand some various reactions in the argument, it must make much attention... In adding this artist is the much most famous one than other personages who fill up the pages of wiki... I would want to end the argument here (I already I am admonished in order to have too much written ).

<li><b>explanation</b> - The term <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">sockpuppet</a> has a specific meaning on Wikipedia, and VfD is one of the more battle-tested sites for dealing with the phenomenon. Basically what we are looking for with this vote is a consensus of the Wikipedia <i>community</i>. The WP community is made up of editors that are objectively concerned with the project as a whole. Therefore, in determining a consensus, the comments of people whose concerns extend only to single issues can be justifiably ignored. People who have apparently only registered to enter a vote on VfD can be assumed not to be part of the community yet. The comments of people who do not <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> or who engage in <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">personal attacks</a> will also be ignored. Furthermore, these tactics tend to reflect poorly on the possibility of legitimately justifying the article being disputed. It is presumed that strident arguments that have no substance to them indicate that no valid arguments exist, or they would have been brought to bear already. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 20:03, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have not changed my thoughts on this argument. I only agreed, after Solipsist's point, that this is simply a Delete instead of a Speedy Delete. My point remains the same, there is simply not enough third party information available on this individual to claim notability. I'm sorry if you feel that by having this opinion I am personally attacking you; that is not my intent. --<a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunmetal_9df8.html" title="User:Gunmetal">Gunmetal</a> 20:40, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<b>Comment</b> Not problem my friend, dear Gunmetal( and all Wikipedia-Friens), I want to ask You to find a compromise, it is important that this argument supplies a good <i>Wikipedia-example</i>. The opinions are too much various: too much negative or too much positive .What I propose? As an example, with a <i>short article</i>(but not too mutch) Me it seems just to propose a not long article, a compromise for all the opinions...This argument resists from too many days, it is right to allow the administrators to close it, with wisdom and intelligence. Pleasing all we. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterloud_2e9e.html" title="User:Peterloud">Peterloud</a> 12:15, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Changed to <b>No vote</b> - I just took a whack at correcting the grammar in the recent edits. It was a difficult task and the original text made the subject unclear. Can someone verify that we are talking about an artist? Many references to "it" made me unsure. If the subject is actually a type of art just revert my attempt and start over. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">Tεx</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User_talk%7ETexture_2199.html" title="User talk:Texture"><font color="blue">τ</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">urε</font></a> 13:28, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I know that inclusionists like to include every article no matter what, but many people seem to have a skewed view of artist notability. Its really not sufficient to have just sold a painting or something, for the most part that is a level of notability equivalent to having a job. <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge.html" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>, where I live, is less than half the size of <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venice.html" title="Venice">Venice</a> yet has several hundred active artists (you can find a subset <a href="http://www.camopenstudios.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.camopenstudios.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">here</a>), very few would really merit an encyclopedia article.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Now this weekend I started an article on <a href="../../../a/f/e/Afewerk_Tekle_b1df.html" title="Afewerk Tekle">Afewerk Tekle</a>, Ethiopia's most famous artist - we didn't have anything before, although there was an article on the German wiki. In the process, I came across <a href="http://www.the3rdman.com/ethiopianart/whoswho/a.html" class="external text" title="http://www.the3rdman.com/ethiopianart/whoswho/a.html" rel="nofollow">this list</a> of other Ethiopian artists. Notice how many of them have had solo exhibitions, have exhibited internationally, and have their work in national collections. I doubt we will have articles on any of these artists any time soon, but these are the sort of criteria that should be considered with respect to notability. I'm sure that for most of the artists in that list online verifiability will be difficult, but I'm equally sure that if asked, many of them could point to publications where their work is discussed.</dd>
<dd>In general, self promotion is one of the required skills of a modern artists. However, if an artist is writing articles about themselves, but isn't able to point to their national and international shows, or their work being discussed in art journals and the like, it is a fair bet that their notability falls well below the professor test. I can't see why Wikipedia should help promote their work over and above the work of the several million similar artists. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 14:21, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd love to form a quality retort to that, but I've read it 5 or 6 times and I still can't figure out what you're trying to say.

<li>But this is not discussed! If You are not expert , it cannot be discussed. <b>About the "Scarello" there are more information than what You ask</b> , and of what the Vote of Wikipedia demand . I Do not want more to discuss with You.You provoked to an enormous pressure against this article (intellectual violence), To my opinion, Your reliability dont convince me.On Your opinion , there is something of strange, without reason: something that does not have relationship with the article on the Scarello. <b>Like suspicion a Tandem-Voting-job with the User "Solipsist"</b> <i>("Familiar voting method" ? Or , perhaps, it is a a new mode for convincing :"Vanity-Tandem-Vote voting method" ? )</i></li>
<li><b>About Notability</b>: <b>In your voting, used too many different measures. As an example: between the article of Scarello and the article on the African artist , that You have written, it appears clearly that: Your African artists,<a href="../../../a/f/e/Afewerk_Tekle_b1df.html" title="Afewerk Tekle">Afewerk Tekle</a>,has very, very, much less of the evidence of notability of Scarello ,that you do not recognize, also against every strongly personality evidence.</b>For this example I do not want more to discuss about your incompetence about this ! If you do not have idea of this Scarello-article, please not tried to deny, with strange comments and without reason, the Voting of the other Users.</li>
<li>'<b>I ask,kindly, that an administrator puts this argument in the archives</b>.</li>
<li>After this comment I do not want more to write and to answer to you . Now You can try to convince other Users, Your attempt with me has not had effect. <b>The Voting is democratic and free,like a Your opinion, but now You cannot hide behind the evidence of my affirmations.</b> Getlteman I pray You not to call itself more in cause on this disussion .</li>
</ol>
<p>In every case, dear "Tandem Company" Thank You for Your denied supporting comment.Please you do not take this like a personal attack, but in this argument it is important to donate tests and not only words.

<li><b>Abstain</b> - I just wanted to note that I'm the poor moron who re-formatted this page. Don't let the formatting fool you, this page was just a raw dump of the output of the /help command in EQ. I see almost no value to this article, but discussion apparently started at <a href="../../../e/v/e/Talk%7EEverQuest_2451.html#subsites.3F" title="Talk:EverQuest">Talk:EverQuest#subsites?</a>, which you should probably read before voting (this was intended as a sort of reverse-merge of an unmanagably large article) -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 6 July 2005 20:16 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - Consider: Would you think a list of UNIX commands would have a place in WikiPedia, especially if such a list did not explain the greater majority of them? -<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman">RandomName</a> 7 July 2005 03:53 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - You mean something like this? <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_DOS_commands_4265.html" title="List of DOS commands">List of DOS commands</a> I don't see how the EQ list is different. --<a href="../../../n/a/h/User%7ENahallac_Silverwinds_91cc.html" title="User:Nahallac Silverwinds">Nahallac Silverwinds</a> July 7, 2005 19:49 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Exactly. Thus I'll (probably) be VfDing that one as well. Although this is not always a pertinent exercise, try and imagine what you would <i>use</i> these lists for. If, for example, you were writing a year ten report on everquest (or DOS) what place would a list of commands have in that report? If one of those commands had an intersting or unusual history, that would (perhaps) rate an entry in your report. Both of these lists <i>as they stand</i> do not merit inclusion. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman">Aaron Brenneman</a> 8 July 2005 00:01 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Quick Q upfront. Would it make sense to move the discussion to the original page, so only votes appar here? secondly, in regards to the comment of evolving commands...that actually is the case. remember the /LFG command - only was introduced with the "legacy of Ykesha" expansion. /makeleader? makes more sense since GoD with Leadership points. /invite? can do that serverwide since patch June 29, 2005. These are just the first ones I documented so far.--Kajolus 8 July 2005 08:26 (UTC)

<li>It would make <i>great</i> sense to move the discussion to the discussion page and leave just the votes here. However, in practice that is almost never done! <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman">Aaron Brenneman</a> 8 July 2005 11:45 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - (vote changed July 15, due to wikibook being available now). well, first of all sorry for almost simply pasting the raw output from EQ (well, at least I sorted it). I am not much of a Wiki pro, so simply posting the raw data seemed appropriate - as I always consider WIKI a teamwork. I simply wanted to start the page. That the style was simple (mildly put) I know. As Harmil points out (btw, thank you for reformatting!), yes, it started on the discussion page. I am a vivid EQ player, and I am personally missing a list of (evolving and changing - thus Wiki style pages usable) game abbreviations/acronyms/commands. If this is the wrong place, sure, delete it. Although then I don't see the reason for keeping explanations like KEI/SOW etc. on the mainpage. please also check the discussion page though (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:EverQuest_game_commands" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:EverQuest_game_commands" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:EverQuest_game_commands</a>), there is at least one more person quite happy with the existence of the page per se.

<ul>
<li>Kajolus: First off, welcome to Wikipedia! I know having a VfD on your contributions can be frustrating, but please don't take it as an insult. VfDs are just one of the many ways that Wikipedia constantly asks the question, "just what is it that we're doing, here". I'll take my other comments to the talk page to avoid cluttering the voting.... -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 6 July 2005 21:20 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm still trying to figure out a way to keep the page.

<li>Nope, it means the opposite: the # represents, not the raw amount of traffic, but the rank relative to other websites (#1 is <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahoo.html" title="Yahoo">Yahoo</a>, for instance).

Judging from what he wrote in the talk page, he doesn't know what Wikipedia's about. There is, however, a very famous <i>First Love</i> under the misleading title <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Love_%28Ivan_Turgenev_Novel%29_14b7.html" title="First Love (Ivan Turgenev Novel)">First Love (Ivan Turgenev Novel)</a>. My idea is to shift that entry here. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 21:25, Jun 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Love_%28novella%29_9f7c.html" title="First Love (novella)">First Love (novella)</a> as unverifiable. The information (what little there is) must be incorrect because there is no information to be found on a novella of that title with that plot and character names. Maybe the title's wrong, maybe something else, who knows, but without <i>any</i> context as to author or publication date, no one can ever really find out what it's supposed to be. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 21:05, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Replace content</b>. I did a rather extensive search to find this and checked online sources to determine if in fact this was referring to the Turgenev novella, but to no avail. I'm interested in moving the aforementioned <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Love_%28Ivan_Turgenev_Novel%29_14b7.html" title="First Love (Ivan Turgenev Novel)">First Love (Ivan Turgenev Novel)</a> to <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Love_%28novella%29_9f7c.html" title="First Love (novella)">First Love (novella)</a> to better match current naming guidelines, but was blocked by the existence of this page. Rather than deleting the page, the content could be swapped ... if that would be an acceptable solution, then I could handle the mechanics (would not require any admin powers). My interest in this is from my participation in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Disambiguation_bf59.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Disambiguation">Wikipedia:WikiProject Disambiguation</a> rather than a personal interest in the novel. <a href="../../../c/e/y/User%7ECeyockey_fb55.html" title="User:Ceyockey">Courtland</a> 17:17, July 24, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure what you mean by "swap" the content—merely cutting and pasting to change an article name is frowned upon because it doesn't move the edit history. The only proper thing to do, if the Turgenev article should be at "First Love (novella)", is to delete the unverifiable latter and then move the former to that title. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 18:16, 24 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The impact of this depends upon how extensive the edit-history and the perceived importance in preserving it (always important, but less so in some cases). Mind that the history is not destroyed but is accessible as a manual x-reference if the proper edit-commentary is added. Note that I'm not in the habit of doing this often; there are some cases where it can be used without undue negative impact, though. If this is one of the cases where it is felt the impact is not justified, which might be the case, then I'd gladly abide by consensus in the matter and not boldly edit where noone would wish to edit (so to speak). <a href="../../../c/e/y/User%7ECeyockey_fb55.html" title="User:Ceyockey">Courtland</a> 19:07, July 24, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Considering how long this VfD has been going on, I'm just going to go ahead and delete the article per consensus, and then you can move the Turgenev one there if you like. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 19:23, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> This is legit software. A little story: I am going to be downloading an extension for Mozilla Firefox that is an autodownloader but you *MUST* have a download manager installed for it to work, and it lists ~15 that are compatible. I came here looking for info on download managers and one that is compatible was FlashGet. What do I see when I get here, people trying to delete the info that I needed, stop it&#160;;). My second comment is that if you look at this article it is not an advertisement, and if it was then delete the parts out that are NPOV that make it an 'advertisement'.

<li><b>Keep</b>. At least with GetRight - it is a respectable program that is very well-known. Go to any site with an unorthodox download system which doesn't work too well with download managers, and GetRight is the first example that they will always quote.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't see how it matters that they're shareware and contain ads (a lot of programs do, e.g. Opera); they're well-used, and popular enough to merit a mention here. The articles' existence are useful even if only in comparison with other <a href="../../../d/o/w/Download_manager.html" title="Download manager">download managers</a>, which I think is important information in an online encyclopedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't know all Download Managers, but I knew FlashGet and Getright. While I accept that their inclusion is somewhat weird, an article about Download Managers justifies a list of download managers, and that list justifies both articles. <a href="../../../j/a/v/User%7EJavOs_acd1.html" title="User:JavOs">Another Wikipedian</a> 03:38, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Getright and a <b>Weak Keep</b> for Flashget, following on from reasons above, and I'd also echo the rewriting requests. In fact, would it perhaps be better for us to merge all these download managers into a single page/list?

<p>The previous VFD on this article was effectively sabotaged multiple (in some cases self-admitted) sockpuppetry, and was closed as "inconclusive" - i.e. it was not possible for the closing admin to determine what the votes actually were (as opposed to "no consensus").</p>

<p>This article is basically original research.</p>
<ul>
<li>It relies on assuming that <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerome.html" title="Jerome">Jerome</a>'s statement about a "Gospel of the Hebrews" was accurate</li>
<li>It is an almost universal opinion amongst academics and non-academics that Jerome's statement was an (innocent) error caused by lack of information, and that the "Gospel of the Hebrews" that he refers to were in fact 3 seperate texts -
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_the_Hebrews_2456.html" title="Gospel of the Hebrews">Gospel of the Hebrews</a></li>
<li>The <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_the_Nazarenes_878c.html" title="Gospel of the Nazarenes">Gospel of the Nazarenes</a></li>
<li>The <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_the_Ebionites_858f.html" title="Gospel of the Ebionites">Gospel of the Ebionites</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It contains an <b>opinion</b> of why people might have wanted the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> to exist</li>
<li>It presents an extremely POV view of the origin of the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a>, which is totally inconsistent with either the conservative religious view of their origin, or the critical academic view involving
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/r/Markan_priority.html" title="Markan priority">Markan priority</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../q/_/d/Q_document.html" title="Q document">Q document</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_source_hypothesis.html" title="Two source hypothesis">Two source hypothesis</a></li>
<li>The relevant section on the origin of matthew at <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It bases all of this on a totally non-sequitur argument that as Eusebius said that "matthew wrote in hebrew letters", there is an entirely different gospel for the hebrews which is not dependant on Mark, and forms the basis of Matthew, and that this must therefore mean that the above 3 gospels (Hebrews/Nazarenes/Ebionites) are in fact 1 gospel not 3 despite the near unanimous opinion amongst academics and non academics to the contrary.</li>
<li>The origin of the Gospel of Matthew should be, and is already, discussed at <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a></li>
<li>None of the references actually support the argument of the text but instead either adhere to the standard critical academic view, or propose an entirely different argument altogether.</li>
<li>The article is even written as an essay/thesis, with introduction and conclusion.</li>
<li>The author of the article added detail to all articles relating to this area of the bible supporting the POV of the article. The only people setting up links to the article or even mentions of its thesis are <a href="../../../2/0/2/User%7E202.176.97.230.html" title="User:202.176.97.230">202.176.97.230</a> and the article's author themselves, and they may very well be one and the same.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The earlier version of the article had extensive duplication of source texts which are already on Wikisource - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authentic_Matthew&amp;oldid=18807366" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authentic_Matthew&amp;oldid=18807366" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> - when this was removed, it was restored by editors with very few edits indeed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The author of the article has gone to extensive lengths, including RFAR (failed), to preserve it, and there have been many sockpuppets (many of which were admitted to be so - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FAuthentic_Matthew&amp;diff=19342484&amp;oldid=19340805" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FAuthentic_Matthew&amp;diff=19342484&amp;oldid=19340805" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The article has been reviewed by an editor (not me) who has a doctorate (PhD) in the study of the New Testament, and been said to be unsalvagable original research by that editor.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Even the article's title is POV</li>

<li>Delete: The amount of tinfoil hattery around the early Gospels is extreme. This article ignores everything from Higher Criticism on to weave together a wishlist view, arguably to support a further POV (not in the article but which the article will be used to support) for one heretical view or another. Honestly, these schemes and arguments are thick as flies in history. There can be no merge, as that requires equally merging in <i>all other</i> variant readings of the origins of the Gospel and non-Q sources, and we would indeed run out of not-paper doing so. There is no keep, because there is no support for this view that makes it representative enough to need explication, and it obviously isn't just "true" or "accepted as true" by the wider community. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:52, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Extremely strong delete</b> – I have researched and taught New Testament, and I’ve never even heard of ‘Authentic Matthew’. This article takes all sorts of (disputed) asides from the Church Fathers, adds them to several unrelated scholarly theories about synoptic origins – to produce what is a piece of (bad) original research.

<p>If I were allowed to vote, I would vote <b>keep</b> because, if the Gospel is true, then who wrote it is a separate issue from its existence, and if it is not true, then no amount of writing about it will ever make it true.

<li>Simon, the argument here is not whether this theory is correct, or even possible. It is whether this is a position being argued by any notable scholar, in a way that WP can record. It is not (although individual bits of it may be) - and thus it is original research.

<p>Bodmas are a real band they played at Wembley a while back. I think their in Africa now doing a concept album or something. They have a site, its on google.</p>

<li>Can you give us the address for their website? I tried to find something on Google which mentioned this band, I kept getting order of operations information, but when I typed in the supposed albums, I got nothing.

<li><b>Delete</b>, hmm, I have reviewed literally thousands of England-based bands, from the hugest to the obscure; I'm not saying that BODMAS, although it seems like a really unfunny joke to me, are not obscure; but they certainly aren't 'one of the biggest bands' in the UK!

<li>Well to you it might be irrelevant that there are special police patrols, prosecutions and homophobic violence in these areas, but others might feel that even minority interests need to be covered.

<p>I think we need to make clear what we're arguing about here, because the waters are getting muddied. The real question we need to be answering is <b>does a list of gay cruising areas belong on Wikipedia</b>? The answer, I think, is yes. There are dozens of lists on Wikipedia, many of them related to sexuality and sexual behaviours and acts, and many of them far less interesting, useful or long as this. As to issues of naming, those are separate from the main question. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 20:05, July 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well it seems verifiable, and not limited to original research, particularly with this report of it by the BBC: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/education/04/school_tables/primary_schools/html/318_2036.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/education/04/school_tables/primary_schools/html/318_2036.stm" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>. It isn't really written in the <i>style</i> of vanity. The BBC report lists it as 'Chase Bridge Primary School' so perhaps a redirect to there. Here's some more info: <a href="http://www.foxtons.co.uk/education/schools/127.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.foxtons.co.uk/education/schools/127.html" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>, and PDF reports are definitely professional looking: <a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/reports/102/102905.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/reports/102/102905.pdf" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>, and it's even listed here as a school: <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twickenham.html#Infants" title="Twickenham">Twickenham#Infants</a>, where other schools already have their own articles, including another infant school, <a href="../../../o/r/l/Orleans_Infants_School_3b5c.html" title="Orleans Infants School">Orleans Infants School</a>. Well from what I've gathered I see no reason to delete it, I am also curious as to <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">User:Dcarrano</a>'s reason for a change of opinon?

<li>In the US, we don't normally use the "primary"/"secondary" school terminology as far as I know. I thought for whatever reason it was more like what we here would call a "high school," although even then I jumped the gun since I don't think every high school should be included.<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 00:31, July 15, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The primary/secondary terminology is sort of retained in the term <i>post-secondary</i> (to refer to anything after high school). At least, it was in my high school. Interesting, if not particularly relevant. -<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_6303.html" title="User:Aranel">Aranel</a> ("<font color="#BA0000"><u>Sarah</u></font>") 15:36, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> unless someone bothers to at least try to add some material explaining why it is notable or interesting.

<dd>Just to clarify: <b>move and redirect</b> to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chase_Bridge_Primary_School_a0dc.html" title="Chase Bridge Primary School">Chase Bridge Primary School</a>. Notability is not a policy. I think the following web site moreover affirms that the school is also refered to as: <i>Chase Bridge</i> alone: <a href="http://www.twickenham-museum.org.uk/schools/timeline.asp?offset=90" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.twickenham-museum.org.uk/schools/timeline.asp?offset=90" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>, as is indicated by only those words being bolded, as opposed to say, <i>Carlisle Infant School</i>, where that entire sentence is bolded.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There's absolutely no sense in deleting valid information just because it's not "interesting", how subjective's that. If "it's unlikely that it will ever be expanded", then merge it with <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twickenham.html" title="Twickenham">Twickenham</a>, rather than pointlessly removing useful information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And I may mention that I've also expanded it. <a href="../../../s/e/e/User%7ESeeaxid_b28b.html" title="User:Seeaxid">Seeaxid</a> 05:39, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Lack of notability is a valid <i>de facto</i> reason for deletion. (By which I mean is that it's used by so many people that it doesn't really matter if it's policy or not.) Personally, I feel that a school article should at least make a half-hearted effort to explain <i>why anyone should care</i>, since they tend to be of interest to only a very small community (i.e. people who went there or whose children may go there). As long as there is some effort made along these lines, I'm willing to opt on the side of inclusion and let it be. This is my personal choice and you are welcome to disagree. But in light of your expansion I'm removing my delete vote. -<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_6303.html" title="User:Aranel">Aranel</a> ("<font color="#BA0000"><u>Sarah</u></font>") 23:04, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You said: <i>"Lack of notability is a valid de facto reason for deletion."</i> If it isn't policy or guideline, or anything definitive, then it defies logic to state it <i>alone</i> as a reason for deletion, were it policy one could argue, and come to concensus to alter the policy. As there is no place to change the policy, simply stating it as definitive itself, giving no logical basis to support it (which a policy page would act as) it is simply irrational. [annex: this comment is essentially based on the contraversial nature of deletion in regards to schools, and that for most other general topics there notability guidlines at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Precedents_e2a3.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Precedents</a> as you may well know]
<dl>
<dd>You had also said: "I feel that a school article should at least make a half-hearted effort to explain why anyone should care,", now let me quote <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_Arguments_66b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments">Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments</a>: "Those who advocate the deletion of schools sometimes use an argument to the effect that a school that doesn't have some <i>special</i> attribute--apart from being an institution of learning--has no identity and shouldn't be in Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>This is a case of <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_pleading.html" title="Special pleading">special pleading</a>; there is no Wikipedia policy requirement that corresponds to this, it's just an <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hoc.html" title="Ad hoc">ad hoc</a> condition constructed to justify opposition to school articles." <a href="../../../s/e/e/User%7ESeeaxid_b28b.html" title="User:Seeaxid">Seeaxid</a> 04:02, 17 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Part of the point of <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> is that there is not a clear consensus on what should be done ("It's been done, and we should all agree to disagree."). Often there turns out to be lack of consensus to delete, which qualifies as consensus to keep only by default. I am familiar with all of the arguments. (I remember when most of them originated.) I judge each school article on its individual merits and I intend to keep doing so. The beauty of the system is that we are free to disagree with one another on this. -<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_6303.html" title="User:Aranel">Aranel</a> ("<font color="#BA0000"><u>Sarah</u></font>") 17:00, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Essentially, this page is mentioned as one of threee (I believe) infant schools at the <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twickenham.html" title="Twickenham">Twickenham</a> article, so it seems obviously that it is a significant infant school within <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twickenham.html" title="Twickenham">Twickenham</a> (although probably not outside of it and perhaps not inside <i>if</i> Twickenham is actually a very, very small town), so it wouldn't bother me too much if relevant information was shifted to the Twickenham article. <a href="../../../s/e/e/User%7ESeeaxid_b28b.html" title="User:Seeaxid">Seeaxid</a> 11:22, 17 July 2005 (UTC)
