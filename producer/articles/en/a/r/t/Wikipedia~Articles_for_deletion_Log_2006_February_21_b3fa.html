<li><b>Keep</b> but cleanup. This article is tedious to read, which makes it hard to spot that it isn't exactly a "small" church. It appears to be a Protestant denomination with a number of churches in different states. See <a href="http://www.mchca.org/main.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.mchca.org/main.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mchca.org/main.htm</a> for more info, this appears to be a reasonably widespread church denomination. I agree that statements such as "249 people were saved" is hard to verify, but believe that in the context of this article, something like "249 people became members of the church" is meant-- but such problems can be fixed without deleting the article.<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 03:50, 21 February 2006 (UTC) Unfortunately, I just found a big <b>copyright violation</b>: most if not all of the article was copied from the website listed above (under "history"). <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 03:52, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I stuck the prod tag on originally, the article read too much like an advertisement. The original author is probably new to Wikipedia and didn't understand the rules against removing templates. Though I left notes on their talk page asking them not to delete until a sysop had time to resolve the issue. I also suggested that they insert a little bit more biographical detail in the article (ownership, date of creation, etc.) and the original author either didn't read the message, doesn't speak English very well or simply doesn't care to make the article more encyclopedic. *<b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 01:17, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Biography of a dog who has "earned cult status in some online communities".

<p>A biography of a dog which MANY have come to love! There is a large community out there of Dukey fans, and just because one has not heard of the beloved dog, does not mean this article deserves a deletion. There are many seperate large interent relations to Dukey, as well as ACTUAL proof and word of mouth that Dukey is in Trainz. Dukey has become a symbol, and loved by all who learn about him! <b>Keep this article.</b>--Gods killed 04:29, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dukey is quite known though, it would be unfair to delete an article that a few people took time to put up. It's not just there for fun...it's up because it is based on a real thing. I just don't see why you would want to delete this... <b>DON'T DELETE!</b> --King Andy 04:31, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am the owner of Dukey and I do know all the facts. Dukey is no joke although it is unbelievable what he has achieved just by being a dog, its surreal but still REAL. It is amazing how many people know of Dukey. It keeps growing. A lot needs to be added still about Dukey's history and family tree! <b>Keep!</b> --David_VI 04:37, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dukey is 100% real, and has a rather large fanbase, which has extended well beyond Trainz. Most notably, Dukey is idolized among a large portion of those who partake of the last.fm website. Dukey's popularity is continually growing, and the ranks increase on a daily basis. <b>KEEP DUKEY!!!!</b>JeffTheTerrible 04:54, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sock puppet? I did not just join because of Dukey, but reather he is part of the reason. I have contributed twice now to my knowledge, and just because we have just joined does not mean that should exclude us from wanting to share our knowledge of a subject that has become widely known. There are people that even we do not know who talk about Dukey. I recall a discussion on a french forum about the dog.

<li><b>Delete</b> as said above. Wikipedia should not become an area for blogging and similar practises. Perhaps a mention in the trainz article, but fanning it out into a full article is perhaps not necessary. Be aware that there has to be a little impartiality here at wikipedia. Bringing 'sock puppets', albeit accidental, into this discussion is again not the best thing to do. Finally, I think "Someone said to me Duke deserved a Wikipedia page" should have been taken more 'as a compliment' then as a true recomendation... 217.205.250.130 13:55, 21 February 2006 (UTC) (<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommylommykins_0737.html" title="User:Tommylommykins">tommylommykins</a>)

<dd>I will admit, that Yes i signed up for the sake of making a page for Dukey. I will also admit that in my honest opinion he deserves it. There was no, and is no, 'sock puppeting' going on. The closest thing to making people 'sock puppets' was myself in an IRC server telling Dukey's owner that his page we made was up for deletion, and how we had to try to save it. I am sorry i don't know much about editing and so on, on account of i havnt even had my Wiki account for a full day...i didnt know i was expected to be a Wiki-genious in order to pitch in for the community. In all honesty and no disrespect to anyone, what harm could a Dukey page do? All I see is that we are all putting up a strong fight to keep a well known, and real, underground character's page around. I have seen some of the articles up for deletion and I see how they do deserve it...but ours we all put effort into and time into. We all helped write about him, and we all would be quite sad if the Duke cannot have his own page. Im sure Wiki can set a side a tiny part of its server for our tiny page...--King Andy 15:47, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The purpose of rules is not to make exceptions. Wikipedia has criteria for its content; while you are "free" to post, it actually means "free" as in "beer," not "free" as in "lawless" (see: <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">WP:ENC</a>). To give "favor" and make one subjective exception would set a bad precedent and be more unfair than being objective, as hundreds of pages get deleted for similar reasons on a daily basis. And it is nothing personal about your work: if the consensus is to delete, then it simply means that the subject of the article did not merit inclusion.

<p>Several articles have already been created on this subject; several of them have been deleted by the VfD/AfD process, and others have been deleted by speedy deletion as substantial re-creations of previously deleted material. This article contains much of the same text as previous versions; however, the actual reason that the article was nominated for deletion in almost every previous VfD/AfD is a lack of evidence of notability. The article now contains more evidence of notability than previous versions did; in the view of several editors, this is a reason to decide the fate of the article by AfD, rather than speedy deletion.</p>

<p><b>comment</b>Whats up with the deletion frenzy? Guys, we all know that categories are great, but they have their weaknesses. They cant included extra info, like birth date and field of proffesion, something that a article can do.

<li><b>Keep</b> The relationship of a potitician to his or her Islamic faith is potentially much more significant then is the case with most other religions. There are historical and religious reasons this would be so. A category could not deal with that effectively as it can be rather complicated. It is also of interest as a starting point for history people. I took a class on Radical Islam, but it also dealt with modernist and liberal variants, and a list like this could've been a valuable starting point.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<dd>Muslim scholars is an entry way to other lists, some of which I worked on.

As the idea seems to be just delete Muslim lists I think this is essentially a form of bias. We have a fair amount of Muslims at Wikipedia, but not all that many so Muslim lists may not be as well-cared for. The idea that that makes them deleteworthy is silly. Or I'm way off here. Check with some at <a href="../../../m/u/s/Category%7EMuslim_Wikipedians_cc95.html" title="Category:Muslim Wikipedians">Category:Muslim Wikipedians</a> to get a sense of whether they want these or how they feel about it.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<p><b>Strong Keep</b>-This is a ridiculously over the top delete effort that I think should never have happened. Even if some of these do deserve deletion there's no way all of them do. I've been here long enough that I get how intensely some hate/despise/loathe religion related lists, but they do serve a purpose. Policy on lists say lists are valid if the items are important to the topic or contributed to it in some way. To pick one I have on my watchlist, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Christians_ec4d.html" title="List of Christians">List of Christians</a>, much of it is founders of several denominations too small have denominational lists of their own. Or important religious poets and missionaries of said faith. As well as being a link to other, often well made, lists. Things like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Muslim_scholars_2f20.html" title="List of Muslim scholars">List of Muslim scholars</a> is also clearly relevant to Islamic history.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Lists and categories serve completely different functions. The ways that lists differ from categories include: 1) they allow the all-important redlinks, that let us know which articles still need to be written; and 2) they can be <i>annotated</i> with critical facts such as birth and death date, country of origin, single-line-summary, or whatever else might be pertinent. There is an enormous number of useful lists on Wikipedia which contain information you could never find by browsing a category. By the way I strongly suggest renaming Muslim athletes to List of Muslim athletes to be consistent. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 06:08, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> it's fine as a list. It is useful.

<li><b>Keep</b> Though i can't see much significance in Muslim athletes but lists for muslim historians and philosophers must be kept. As for listing versus categorizing, in my opinion categorizing is better but unfortunately most people-related categories in wikipedia are very messy. Biographies are categorized according to date of birth, death, nationality, location, religion, university alumni,prizes,...etc. When categorizing an article -especially for a very notable person or someone with multi-talents- usually one or more categories are missed. However, same articles are not likely to be missed in specialized lists. Consider <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henri_Bergson_5d10.html" title="Henri Bergson">Henri Bergson</a> as an example, a <i>Nobel laureate and not categorized in french writers or philosophers</i>!. Nevertheless, in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_French_people_3931.html" title="List of French people">List of French people</a>, Henri Bergson <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_French_people_3931.html#Philosophers" title="List of French people">appears as a french philosopher</a>. Also, as <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">User: Antandrus</a> previously stated, lists allow for red links. So, for now i support all lists.--<a href="../../../w/e/d/User%7EWedian_2daa.html" title="User:Wedian">Wedian</a> 21:39, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hey dude. Check the history for "List of atheists" again, and very closely. Actually, I <i>did</i> remove the tag. Sorry, your "agenda" theory doesn't hold up. Removing notices "mid AFD" because they were never nominated "AFD" in the first place. Each article you nominate has to be given a separate AfD page - and you have to explain the merits of <i>each</i> nomination - and sorry, anger and want of vengeance because Muslim lists are nominated isn't good enough. It seems to be concensus that you actions here are an inappropriate violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, so I wouldn't make it worse by tampering with <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>.

<p>You are right. I left anger get the better of me, and in what i perceived as injusties, i broke <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. However, i would like to say that there was two (2) people that seriously considered voting down list of jews. Does that make it a little little little bit less bad?`</p>
<p>Ill try to trust the common sense of wikipedians a bit more in the future. I have had some ugly disputes with user:Zora over time, and since nobody seemed to care that i was right and she was wrong, i started to distrust people. I apologise. Feel free to remove any, some or all article on this AFD.</p>
<p>I also apologise for not being civil. I did brake WP:Point, but people broke the "do not remove afd tag" rule, and since people actualy did take my move seriously and voted on them, i perceived it as taken as a legit move. I would also like to point out that i added list of Jews after another user <b>suggested</b> it. That made me feel even more angry.</p>
<p>In short, a user suggested me to break wp:point, and another endorsed the inclusion. That made me confident that the move was accepted as legitimat. People trying to undo that against afd rules angered me and made me uncivil.</p>

<p>And you did such a poor job at picking the "stuby only" articles that you included <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim_soldiers.html" title="Muslim soldiers">Muslim soldiers</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim_scholars.html" title="Muslim scholars">Muslim scholars</a> (who already cleared a AFD) and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Islamic_philosophers_3ad2.html" title="List of Islamic philosophers">List of Islamic philosophers</a> who can NOT be categorized. This gave the obivous result of people assuming you just wanted to delet them since they where lists, period. Why else do you think CltFn said <b>We should probably nominate list of jews for deletion too</b>? Well, i abliged him. Dont spend energy destroying peoples work, we have Zora for that. Im not sitting here to waist time, im sitting here to make Wikipedia better, and having people doing their best to destroy my and other peoples efforts only since they dont approve of how it looks RIGHT NOW is not doing this a good day. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 05:50, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_lists.html" title="List of lists">list of lists</a> article seems to contradict my rationale for my request for deletion. Maybe it is a personal vendetta against lists of this type. Or maybe it's that the over-listing for the Muslim articles irk me. Or maybe it's that Striver is rubbing me the wrong way. I don't know, but I certainly believe that, at the very least, the majority of the articles nominated for deletion are unnecessary and worthy of deletion or moving to categorization. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturner</a> 06:12, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Bro, i have been heated up on this issue, but from the bottom of my hart, i never inteded to uppset you.

All the sudden, every single thing that multiple editors have put their valuable time on is going to be deleted for not being perfect? That made furious!</p>

<p>Might I suggest you all use this chance to re-rationalize the whole Lists vs. Categories scheme for all these subjects. It does seem arbitrary and odd to delete all the Muslim-oriented lists but to keep other ethnic-religious designated lists. Please form a new policy page, discuss, announce on the mailing lists, etc. But edit warring over this is bound to get ugly. -- <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzheado_f8f0.html" title="User:Fuzheado">Fuzheado</a> | <a href="../../../f/u/z/User_talk%7EFuzheado_fba0.html" title="User talk:Fuzheado">Talk</a> 05:53, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Lists can do things categories do not. At <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_lists_c1de.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured lists">Wikipedia:Featured lists</a> there are a few that involve religion or people.

There are some lists I've worked on that I think are more similar to the lists up for AfD here and are of fairly good quality.

<p>If this survives the request for deletion, I am at least reccomending we better organize the pages regarding Muslims. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jews_2000.html" title="List of Jews">List of Jews</a> page seems much better organized. Perhaps would could put all the lists onto the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Muslims_773b.html" title="List of Muslims">List of Muslims</a> page so they are much more accessible. The confusing linking structure through the current lists regarding Muslims makes the lists look like a disorganized and arbitrary. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturner</a> 20:37, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>- there are hundreds of thousands of words in the English language, and most of them are heterological. To include them all would make the list too huge to be meaningful.

<li>I don't think it's intended at a joke. Better than deleting would be making a <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_autological_words.html" title="List of autological words">List of autological words</a>, where it currently says: "(A word which is not autological is heterological. These are also listed)," which I find a bit wry. Obviously, the criterion to be an <i>interestingly</i> heterological word is that it represent a category that is generally applied to words: e.g. "long" is not a long word. It's not interesting that "<a href="../../../t/e/n/Tentacle.html" title="Tentacle">tentacled</a>" isn't tentacled, because we don't generally think of words as falling into tentacled and untentacled categories, whereas we do categorize words as long and short. If we were to keep it, with a criterion for determining which heterological words should be listed, that's the criterion you want. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 16:04, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The press release says that the project is in the negotiation phase. Come on, this deal could fall through at any moment. The article is premature.

<li>There is no deal, and the article doesn't claim there is. The article is not premature, it makes no predictions. The article is talking about a game which is in development, but without a publisher. Should we get rid of all articles about software in development without publishers? That would include most open-source software in development. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracefool_5e64.html" title="User:Gracefool">··gracefool</a> |<a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGracefool_8942.html" title="User talk:Gracefool">☺</a> 05:31, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I was considering precedent in one country (US) to apply to others, despite the disparity in country/show size. FOr BB6 in the US, the winner (before she won) and the bottom two players were all AFD'd, and were all kept. Lack of an article is not precedent for an article (AFD keeps are). BB contestants in general, like Idol finalist, and Survivor contestants, simply aren't being deleted anymore. Those without content are being temporarily merged/redirected. But that's a matter of current content, not notability, and not a deletion issue. There's been, as of late, a general acceptance of notability of BB contestants. As for your Google Test, I see an adequate supply of different sources. I'm getting a little tired of explaining flaws and misues of the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html" title="Wikipedia:Google test">Wikipedia:Google test</a>. People see so many absurdly high bogus numbers, that when they see a moderate number, they to fail understand its meaning. As a story grows older, "free web" stories in newspapers go "offline" into fee-charging archives, but that doesn't mean the person is less notable. It means we should rely less on Google (note: I've voted delete, despite Google counts in the hundreds of thousands). Wikipedia should not be as transitory as Google results. Also, I submit, that if I treat this person like an actor on the show, she'd pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (as the contestants are stars of the show). And getting back to precendent: I think <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Belinda_Thorpe_89fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Belinda Thorpe">this</a> is a pretty relevant precedent. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 00:02, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>In this entries current form, all of the information is correct. While previous versions of this article were incorrect, and thus caused a number of people to help correct this entry, as it currently stands this entry is now informationaly accurate in terms of describing what PPMT can provide over traditional electromagnetic motors. Due to the vast transformation of this entry I recommend this entry be reconsidered for not being deleted.</p>

<p>Article about non-notable cartoon character. The real purpose of the article is to mount a POV attack against the cartoonist. Article submitted by Beucephalia (<a href="../../../b/e/u/User_talk%7EBeucephalia_9b9a.html" title="User talk:Beucephalia">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EBeucephalia_54d9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Beucephalia">contribs</a>) whose entire editing career consists of POV attack against cartoonist <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Leunig_7c9d.html" title="Michael Leunig">Michael Leunig</a>. <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 07:12, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> So this is a notable cartoon in Australia/elsewhere?

In my opinion, this article needs a serious, chainsaw-massacre cull, some kind of sourcing, and a possible merge back into the "Internet slang" article, or some continual, heavy policing to prevent this from blowing back out into the massive, unsourced repository for any tripped-out acronym or "Look what I just created!"

<li><b>Comment.</b> If these dictionary definitions don't deserve a mention in individual articles in the first place, why should they suddenly deserve a mention in Wikipedia once they're clumped up together into this article? By combining the dictionary definitions into a single page, it just means that the user has to go through the trouble of scrolling to the term he/she is looking for, as opposed to having it show up in an article by itself. It also appears to have become a popular article for miscellaneous nonsense and vandalism. See in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> where it says: Wikipedia is not a dictionary, 1. Dictionary definitions. 2.

I have been busy at work for the past two months and haven't logged on to check on things. One of my authors, who has a wiki page <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navtej_Bharati_7b14.html" title="Navtej Bharati">Navtej Bharati</a>, said both his page and mine were up for deletion?? I looked on my publisher page HMS Press and it was only updated until 1995. Mr. Bharati (who incidently is one of London Ontario's largest book publishers) book came out in 2002 so therefore was not in my authors list. I had re-written HMS Press in accordance to one of Wiki's editors and the new layout was accepted in 2005, NOW you say it is up for deletion. You guys dont like Canadians?? I don't understand the logic. I can update the information and add the next 50 books I did and his name will be on the list for verification. Please explain. I have been publishing Canadian and American poets since 1982 and have about 150 publications.&#160;???

<dd>This article describes the possible wars between liberal democracies in more detail. The main article is already very long. It discusses many other aspects like statistical significance and correlation is not causation. Also, the main article looks at other claims like fewer lesser conflicts between democracies and fewer civil wars. The main article now has very little of the information that is in this subarticle. In addition, this subarticle should be greatly expanded with more conflicts and sources from the literature.<a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> 12:43, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>This article remains <b>advocacy</b>, drawn from a narrow range of extreme sources within the subject, and backed up by further PoV (for example, a description of Imperial Germany, drawn from an American book written in support of WWI and published in 1917). Useless for any purpose. Since its complete text can be found in <a href="../../../d/e/m/Talk%7EDemocratic_peace_theory_8655.html" title="Talk:Democratic peace theory">Talk:Democratic peace theory</a>, it is not needed to write a real article on Rummel or Weart; and a real article on wars between democracies would have to be completely rewritten under a less cumbrous title anyway.

<li>Huh? There is no book from 1917 or anything similar to what you state in the sources. White's personal website presents his opinions without any references.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Important blog, described as the 'meeting place of the anti-fascist left' and as such widely read. Mentioned several times in the media, including the guardian and evening standard. The last vote for deletion seems to be full of sockpuppetry. Also, this was deleted by the 'war on blogs' group: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Timecop/The_war_on_blogs&amp;oldid=28729351" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Timecop/The_war_on_blogs&amp;oldid=28729351" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>. Nothing wrong with people co-ordinating their efforts of course, but the Harry's Place article didn't/doesn't even meet their own criteria! But as their rhetoric shows (on the deletion pages as well) there was clearly no serious effort made to discriminate between what is notable and not. Anyway look at the history page, it's clearly important to the several people that constantly vandalise it!

<li>Ok, relevant quotes:</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>"Harry's Place, the "blog" to which he is now a prolific contributor, has become one focus of Britain's culture of political blogging " <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1644298,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1644298,00.html" rel="nofollow">[28]</a></dd>
<dd>When Harry 'left' they gave some space to the event&#160;: "Nigh on 2,500 words of political reflections follow, but that shouldn't detract from the site's significance. It provided a rare example of convergence between old and new media, with Fleet Street columnists, including The Observer's Nick Cohen, championing the site. Harry's postings have prompted a conversation between newspapers and the blogosphere,.." etc. etc. <a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,,1582866,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,,1582866,00.html" rel="nofollow">[29]</a></dd>
<dd>Also, for everyone's information, the guardian's 'Norman Johnson' column is a satire on Harry's Place, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Aaronovitch_456d.html" title="David Aaronovitch">David Aaronovitch</a>, and similar (probably named after <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Geras_607e.html" title="Norman Geras">Norman Geras</a> and Alan Johnson of Labour Friends of Iraq), commisioned by the guardian opinion ed., Seamus Milne (no friend of HP). An example of 'Norman' mentioning the site specifically is here: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1587537,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1587537,00.html" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. This should be put in the article, incidentally... (and adds to notability). Its pretty absurd that a national newspaper devotes several column inches every week to surreptitiously attacking a blog, and usually doesn't let the readers know the context.</dd>
<dd>A search at the guardian's website turned up several more mentions, but that will do. The Evening Standard was where it was first called 'the meeting place of the anti-fascist left'. Not online, unfortunately, but evidence here: <a href="http://hurryupharry.bloghouse.net/archives/2005/08/09/the_meeting_place_of_the_antifascist_left.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://hurryupharry.bloghouse.net/archives/2005/08/09/the_meeting_place_of_the_antifascist_left.php" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikeawade_59cd.html" title="User:Wikeawade">Wikeawade</a> 14:47, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>An afterthought: Presumably Norman Johnson will soon get an article like the other Guardian columnists... in which case we might have an article on a spoof without an article on the original.. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikeawade_59cd.html" title="User:Wikeawade">Wikeawade</a></dd>

<p>Let me know what we need to do to save the FREAK ATTACK!</p>
<p>An encyclopedia, by definition, is a work that covers the entire spectrum of human knowledge. As an online source with an endless supply of informants, Wikipedia should be the grandest encyclopedia out there, and it is. However, how deep does it really delve? Freak Attack may not fulfill any of the criteria on the music list, but this is simply because they have not had time. I know them all personally, they are amazing people with an innovative sound. They're still working on getting their first album out, sure, but it's not easy in the inner-city when everyone is fighting for himself. These four young men have overcome a lot of odds already. If you want to stand in their way of spreading Freak love, there's nothing a few guys on a message board can say to stop you, but consider how pointless it really is. They're just rappers trying to bust into the scene, and from the speculation in the neighborhood, they will do so sooner than later. Your criteria are ridiculous anyway, because circumstances beyond control are going to shut many talented artists out of your endless libraries of information. From an honest standpoint, it doesn't make much sense to delete a true, well written article from your pages. Not many will read it anyway, but those that do will be learning something about this group. To a few kids, these guys are heroes. Let them stay, for goodness sake.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> — As much as I want Wikipedia to become the source of all knowledge, there is a reason that the notability guidelines on <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">music</a> are Wikipedia policy. If we had a lengthy article on every garage band ever created, not only would most of them be disbanded or forgotten, but it would also take up an extraordinary amount of storage space. We, the Wikipedia community, appreciate your interest in a band that you support, but perhaps you can recreate the article once <i>Freak Attack</i> has attained some notability! If you can meet at least one of the guidelines, there's no reason why you can't continue writing. The last thing we want to do is scare you off Wikipedia, but we do have to keep Wikipedia from turning into everybody's "free 5 MB of webspace".

<li><b>Comment</b>. Looks like I can't save this. You're right - there are no published sources I can cite, due to the nature of the project. The information was obtained personally. So I can understand arguments from a verifiability viewpoint. I'm less happy about editors voting for delete as 'hoax' and 'unlikely'. As for the guy voting delete 'for implying that Slayer would work with Linkin Park and Bob Rock', you're exactly the reason the project is under wraps, as you're quite willing to hate the very idea of radically different groups working together. I will say this - Wikipedia is going to be left looking very stupid when the project reaches fruition and you won't have any information on it. People=Shit 12:21, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>People=, first of all, the article did look to me as if it were a hoax. I will take your word that it is not. However, this doesn't change anything regarding keeping this article. Encyclopedias are not the place to publish secret information that is not available to the public. Once this project becomes publicly known, written about in magazines or on major websites, we will end up with an article about it. If you want to leak information about it out ahead of time to someone, there are plenty of online magazines and other websites which would be appropriate places to do so. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 14:16, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The above lists you quote are a much better set than the AFD'd one. They provide lists of songs covered *by* a specific band rather than bands that have covered a song.

<li><b>Comment</b>. A lot of the relevant information here is already available elsewhere.

<li>Yes, you are right. It seems that the information available at the AFD is already covered and easily accessible. The reason why I explicitly voted "merge and delee" was that I find the information valid but the article is redundant. So, if all information is already listed in other NIN-related articles, then this AFD obviously should be deleted. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> | <a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecanismo_b2ea.html" title="User talk:Mecanismo">Talk</a> 17:05, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry, I can't let that pass. Linguistic research has concluded no such thing. The idea of "oldest language" makes no sense. No language is older than any other. All languages change; they all have developed out of some older variety. Khoisan languages or their ancestors may have been <i>in situ</i> longer than others in the area, but they are no older. That argument applies to Tamil too, of course, so <b><s>Delete</s></b>. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 23:56, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a neologism with 4 relevant google hits, which means no widespread use. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 18:30, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Although so far there has been limited discussion of what the generic term for these type of products should be, there is no term for this category of product with more widespread use. Clearly there is a need for some generic term, as products like the the Segway HT are not adequately described by the term "scooter" or other attempts at short descriptions. "Electric Pedestrian", logically contracted to "electriped", is clearly the best categorization. Perhaps "Electric Pedestrian" would be a less controversial name for the article, but ultimately "electriped" will prevail as the most convenient form. --AturoUrbo 21:30, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Keep</b>. A small note to some of the people voting here: long comments spanning multiple paragraphs do not help your case, and when I read these votes when closing AfDs votes, my eyes start to glaze over after a few sentences, so you're really just wasting your time. A <i>simple</i> and <i>concise</i> comment stating your vote and rationale behind that vote is all you need. Anything more makes it harder for us to process, which leads to an article staying in AfD for much longer than it really should. Also, attacking those on the other side of the debate, and comments such as "<i>SHAME ON YOU</i>" breaks Wikipedia's policy of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">No personal attacks</a>. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><i>e</i></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">ath</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 05:26, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>This article of Mr. Strelchik is very note worthy and from the tone of the unsigend (PM_shef) above sounds very politically motivated. Mr. Strelchik is currently President of the New Democratic Party of Canada EDA, he has been nominated for three Noble Peace Prize's and he was the candidate of record for the New Democratic Party of Canada in the Thornhill riding in the recent Canadian federal election. Please keep in mind that this request to delete was from the son of a candidate that ran against Mr. Strelchik in a municipal election a number of years ago. Mr. Strelchik is more worthy of an article than PM_shef’s father, which he posted a while back.--69.156.151.238 18:53, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>For clarification, Strelchik was <b>not</b> nominated for any nobel peace prizes. The organization that he happened to be a founding member (and director) of was nominated, not him. Yes, I'm the son of a councillor, Alan Shefman, Mr. Strelchik's opponent in the election before last, that has been established long ago on here and is not germane. As well, as you can see from the Wiki guidelines, being President of the NDP EDA in Thornhill does not constitute notability. Finally, again if you go to the Wiki Guidelines for Bios, Strelchik does not pass the <b>Google Test, the 100 Year Test or the Verifiability Test</b>. <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 21:54, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>For clarification, past AFD's on unelected candidates have pretty consistently sawed off at the compromise position that they can be kept in a merged <i>party candidates in X election</i> list, but not generally as separate biographical articles unless they meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> on other grounds beyond having been a political candidate. It may not be the ideal situation for some purposes, but as things currently stand it's what the established consensus happens to be. Accordingly, <b>merge into New Democratic Party candidates, 2006 Canadian election</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 03:38, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>For clarification, Strelchik meets the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> because he is a longstanding "Major local political figure who receive significant press coverage." Also, as a founder of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_the_Children_7a3b.html" title="Free the Children">Free the Children</a>, and an author of the influential <a href="../../../y/o/r/York_Region_7f58.html" title="York Region">York Region</a> <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_smoking.html" title="No smoking">No Smoking Bylaw</a>, he is a "Person achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events."

<li>Party candidates in X election is precedent, yes, but I think it's getting awfully clumsy, especially when you have subsets of each sets of candidates who run again in Y election, and Z... do you have to have multiple iterations of the same person? Or do you refer additional references to the same repeat candidate to... the first? the most recent? the most important? But this is a broader discussion. <b>Weak keep or (regular) merge.</b> To Simon's supporters: Please don't try to stuff the ballot box here; let invested members of the Wikipedia community judge whether to take the article in on its own suitability.

<dd>Eyeonvaughan, the only ballot-stuffing going on here is from supporters of the article. Remember, <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> clearly spells out that contributors whose first known edit is to an AFD are at best suspicious, and at worst irrelevant and disregardable. And, for the record, you can can the allegations of partisan attacks; whatever your feelings about pm_shef, Wikipedia has a strict policy of assuming good faith in a dispute — and for what it's worth, I'm an NDPer and so's Samaritan, and we both expressed reservations about the article's keepworthiness too. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 22:52, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> To quote the very first disgruntled poster: "Wikipedia's guidelines for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html#People_still_alive" title="WP:BIO">living people's biographies</a> when discussing politicians reads 'Major local political figures who receive significant press coverage...'" WELL .... Mr. Strelchik is most definitely a local political figure who has received significant press coverage: he was chosen as a local hero by the Thornhill Post in 2000, and the media has consistently reported on his community work and advocacy. As well, running for parliament as the NDP Canadidate in the last federal election at such a young age is also a MAJOR accomplishment, as well as a MAJOR position to be in, and this most definitely makes him a noteworthy individual. While Wikipedia criteria mentions people <i>holding the office of MP, MPP and so on</i>, this is NOT a prerequisite for having a Wikipedia article of mention and his personal and political accomplishments as they stand make him a noteworthy individual. PERIOD.</p>
<p>As an aside, I have been silently watching this thread and simply because I read and dont post does not make me (or anyone) a PUPPET, and I resent the accusation made from afar in my silence and absence from posting in all candor. This is, in my humble opinion, simply a weak tactic made only to circumvent people such as myself from posting in support of Mr. Strelchik's article, and to discredit your opposition for same. However, in my case it had the opposite effect cos I do NOT respond positively to passive aggressive bullying - I never have, and I never will. <i>As the accuracy of the article (Note: with minor clarification/revision Re: The organization for which he was a founding member has been nominated for 3 Nobel Peace Prizes as previously mentioned), AND Mr. Strelchik's political and personal accomplishments have already been verified, AND he has (obviously) met the Wikipedia criteria as outlined above, why all the personal attacks on his accomplishments or his right to have a Wikipedia article?*</i> Consequently, I have to question what motivations or personal agendas are really in play here in attempting to discredit or disallow his being mentioned singularly on Wikipedia. If ANY other individual made such strides in life they too would be entitled to a Wikipedia article, would they not? Personally, I became aware of Simon's many stellar accomplishments during the recent federal election, and I was duly impressed and remain so. Why arent YOU? I now actively watch his political progress due to his personal commitment and huge potential for positive social impact with great interest and support -- so much so that I recently became an NDP Party Volunteer. He is truly inspiring in his dedication and commitment. In my humble opinion, as this IS a forum in which to express one's opinion on Wikipedia articles, and NOT a forum in which to make personal attacks on individuals for personal reasons, your negative arguments at this stage (considering my comments above*) appear to be rather petty to this poster who has absolutely NO STRINGS attached to her fingers or her brain as she types this. Mr. Strelchik's record and political profile speak for themselves, I believe, and I am of the opinion that the article should be kept as is, and hope Wikipedia's Administrator's agree as a truthful account SHOULD be told without personal resentments or censorship and he most definitely warrants individual mention, and if someone chooses to DELETE my posting in order to protect their own agenda....SHAME ON YOU.</p>

<dd>To the anon contributor above: it is <i>explicitly</i> spelled out in Wikipedia policy that these debates are to represent the consensus of <i>established</i> Wikipedia users — people who have enough of a track record around here that we can trust their view of an article's notability to be objective. An editor whose first-ever contribution is to an AFD debate <i>can</i> be disregarded in the final tally, because they don't have that record of reliability — the chances are too high that they're a personal friend of the article subject who came here to stack the vote, and we simply don't allow that kind of thing (or else every high school class president in North America would have an article, because he could just get all his drinking buddies and football teammates to come game the system.) You may not like the policy, but it's there, and we're not going to disregard it just because a newbie thinks it's inconvenient.</dd>
<dd>Frankly, I don't believe for a bleeding second that you just <i>happened</i> to find this article and are providing a purely objective view. Given what's been going on here and on the article over the last few days (and for <i>months</i> over a whole subset of other <a href="../../../y/o/r/York_Regional_Municipality%2C_Ontario_8b85.html" title="York Regional Municipality, Ontario">York Region</a> politicians), without even knowing any of you I can state categorically that you're almost certainly a personal friend of Mr. Strelchik's. The onus is not on us to trust you; it's on you to prove that your words can be taken as an objective view. What you and your talk-page-blanking friends need to be aware of is that you <i>don't</i> have a right to disrupt Wikipedia to prove a point, and this kind of behaviour frankly makes Wikipedians even <i>less</i> inclined to take your side. In fact, in the few years I've been editing Wikipedia, I've never seen a single solitary case where a genuinely notable person needed a sockpuppet swarm to protect their article for them — this kind of behaviour almost invariably surrounds articles about people whose inflated egos <i>outweigh</i> their actual encyclopedia-worthiness.</dd>
<dd>If Simon's legitimately notable, then he <i>doesn't</i> need a bunch of hooligans running around breaking every one of Wikipedia's rules to protect him; he needs a properly-reasoned, mature, calm discussion to be conducted <i>within</i> the rules. So can the bullshit, all of you, and work <i>with</i> us here. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 02:10, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>For Clarification</b> WOW. 1. I AM a regular user of Wikipedia, and do extensive research on this site in order to find the most current info on many things. I also often refer people to this site as well so I have a vested interest in it's accuracy and inclusion of what I believe is important reference information, but admit I do not post, or haven't, before now (obviously) so I am not (yet) "established".</p>
<p>2. I am new to being involved in politics, and the NDP party, as I said, but to the last poster: you assume WAY too much about me from my posting. First of all, I am NOT a personal friend of Mr. Strelchik's, although I did meet him post-election in November, and spoke with him at length at that time, and was duly impressed with his accomplishments, as I believe I said. Now, because I am new to posting, everything I said about his accomplishments is UNsubstantiated? ok ignore me than ... but the facts about what the guy has done speak for themselves.</p>
<p>3. Since the election I have taken an active interest in following many NDP party members, and found this particular 'edit' page by a simple search and ultimately I felt compelled to post something, as i said previously. You dont believe me? Tough. Sorry ... no offence but you have attacked me for NO REASON and Im a tad TICKED OFF at this point. Regardless, I was dismayed by what was being said, and what I believed (and still believe) were obvious 'personal' agendas against Mr. Strelchik, and admit I felt compelled to post something in support of the article about him. I have no personal interest or benefit from doing so. MY arguments are (as outlined previously) simply that the article about him should be maintained on the site in accordance with the site's guidelines because his accomplishments are noteworthy. The other 'established' users ALSO verify the accuracy of the information posted, they just argue that they arent important ENOUGH. Isnt that the administrator's job to determine THO?</p>
<p>4. YES this is my first posting ever and after THIS most probably my last because in choosing to post on this matter, (naively perhaps?) I am now forced to read rude aspersions on MY character? All I can say is ...WOW. While I was fine with the administrators editing my posting if they saw fit to do so, I didnt realize that in posting a supportive commentary, because I am a relative unknown, that it would then leave ME open to be accused of all kinds of ...'bullshit' I think the term was? Again, all I really can say is WOW.</p>
<p>5. I have NO PROBLEM with the guidelines for this site, and IN FACT am arguing, ironically, in support of them! Simply because this is my first posting, I am accused of some alliance with Mr. Strelchik any my opinion doesnt count? Again ... WOW. Ironically, I tried to keep the personal attacks out of it, and did not direct any criticisms AT anyone in particular, and simply expressed my personal opinion about what I felt about the guy's accomplishments, using the site's guidelines to support my arguments. BUT could you actually be saying that an unknown who supports substantiated information is given less importance than negative arguments based on personal agendas simply because of the proflic postings of the other "users/posters"? Good experiential data THERE boyo. Isnt it quality NOT quantity that REALLY matters when it comes to INFORMATION?</p>
<p>6. I feel wholly insulted to be called a "hooligan", and I am amazed that my ONE posting is considered a "swatpocket swarm" or whatever the hell THAT is! I felt that negative attacks that I saw in this thread should have an alternate voice for the site administrator's consideration, and I opted to be that voice. One supportive posting by me and this is what you choose to post about me? A glaring personal attack? WOW.</p>
<p>7. My posting was anonymous ONLY because I obviously do not know how to post properly. I have no problem in identifying myself, and did, or thought I did, and will once again.</p>
<p>8. To the Site Administrators: This further commentary, and my prior arguments, were made simply to support the article as meeting the site's criteria because I strongly felt, and feel, that Mr. Strelchik's accomplishments ARE most definitely noteworthy. As one poster said here it is important "to vote on rules, not politics", which is ALL I argued in support of to begin with! I HOPE that you will determine this matter on THAT basis, without prejudice.</p>
<p>I can only hope. Have a great day. CelticChick (in case I post this wrong again)</p>

<li><b>Weak weak keep</b> in agreement with Punkmorten.

<li>I have no idea where it might fit comfortably.

<li><b>Comment</b> Currently, <a href="../../../d/i/g/WP%7EDIGI_48fe.html" title="WP:DIGI">WP:DIGI</a> is busying itself mostly with character, anime and game articles. If this article is deleted, several dozens more will have to be (see for exemples, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenkimon.html" title="Kenkimon">Kenkimon</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabumon_X_6a02.html" title="Gabumon X">Gabumon X</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witchmon.html" title="Witchmon">Witchmon</a>). The non-list data (i.e. description and attacks) cannot be readily merged anywhere. The article is already listed at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Digimon_7cfb.html" title="List of Digimon">List of Digimon</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Empire_2348.html" title="Metal Empire">Metal Empire</a> (though the latter would be converted to a cat if I had my way, but we don't have the time for it ATM). I think statu quo is preferable at least for the time being, if only because we might have to find back the information anyway if the article is to be recreated based on the Pokemon precedent. <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a> 16:45, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Here's where I disagree strongly. The Pokemon precident is only there because the articles are on the whole, of high quality. See <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html" title="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</a> (almost an FA), for example. There was a policy a while back to merge them but because we took the time and effort to expand them, they weren't deleted. If we hadn't, there'd be no "Pokemon precident" to fall on. if you can't be bothered to write a good stub on a subject, it shouldn't be here in my opinion. --<a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">Cel</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="green">es</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">tianpower</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelestianpower_18a6.html" title="User talk:Celestianpower">háblame</a></sup> 16:52, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The sheer amount of articles in relation to the number of those willing to work them out prevents us to apply such an emergency remedy.

<dd>The point I'm making is that I don't see what good is to become of having it here. Experience shows that redlinks are more inviting for contributors than substubs. Also, if anyone comes across it now, will it help them? No. Better to start afresh when someone gets round to writing something worthwhile. What's already there looks like information that anyone that plays/watches Digimon would know, so nothing's being lost. --<a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">Cel</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="green">es</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">tianpower</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelestianpower_18a6.html" title="User talk:Celestianpower">háblame</a></sup> 18:38, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Very weak keep</b>. As said before, <a href="../../../d/i/g/WP%7EDIGI_48fe.html" title="WP:DIGI">WP:DIGI</a> has recently become quite active again, and the chances of us finding a solution for this information are high. I have another idea; give some time for us to archive information and find the weak articles. Make this a task for WP:DIGI and allow a lasting plan of action on where to store the information (if it is to be stored on wikipedia at all). As big of a fan of the Digimon series that I am, I know wikipedia is not our own personal fansite, and that a line should be drawn sometimes when it comes to the relevance of information. With Digimon receiving a <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digimon_Savers_803b.html" title="Digimon Savers">new series</a> there is renewed interest in WP:DIGI and more activity. I believe we can get the task done if you leave it in our hands. And perhaps a deadline, if we cannot meet (doing something that is satisfactory with the information), would just mean the articles do get deleted? -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I've seen Digimon articles shorter than this.

But the individual pastors aren't notable enough for their own articles. And the fact that you admittedly wrote the article with an objective ("to make ppl aware of these wolves in sheep's clothing) means it is POV. Your anti-racist objectives are wonderful, and I hope you continue that fight, because God knows we need it, but this is not the forum for this particular battle.

<p>Exposing fascists is a great thing to do and I thoughroughly approve, but since this is meant to be an encyclopedia, written in a neutral style, it's better to simply describe the subject of the article rather than write your own opinions - and I've made this mistake before in the past so it's nothing worry about.</p>
<p>In addition, he simply isn't well, important enough to the public, to write an article about, or at least I can't see any evidence of it, even if the article is accurate (which it probably is).

<li><b>Comment to Author</b>, what XYaAsehShalomX has said is right on the money. This is an encyclopedia and it is not the correct place to <i>"make people aware of these wolves in sheep's clothing"</i> even if your intentions are good. I suggest maybe you get a blog, or some free webspace to post your material and any arguments against Mr. Williams. Hopefully XYaAsehShalomX is right and Williams will continue to be such an unimportant fringe element that he will never qualify for an article.

<li>There is no difference in what I have posted, and the other stuff posted about White supremacists! This Williams individual is local for me, and he makes the news nationally all of the time. I understand, but then again I don't. It seems to me EVERY article is biased in some sort of fashion, and mine just tells precisely what is widely known around the southeast. The public deserves to be able to read about figures of all backgrounds for research, including these unwanted ones. Clean it up if you wish, but I don't see how deletion is absolutely necessary. But I am sure it will get deleted anyway...

<li><b>Comment.</b> For wikipedia, the most important fact for people is notablity. If he is a national figure with national (even world) impact, that needs to be put in the article to survive.

<li><b>Answer</b> It's bad enough the guy has to deal with IB teenagers on his ass all day long, does he really need a revert war? Yes, he is beloved by students (past and present), but the man didn't ask for this, doesn't want it, and has even taken down his own site -- davidquinn.com -- because his fool students don't want to allow him a life outside of the classroom (jumping all over his old message board, at least one DOS attack).

As I said, previous editors are claiming that the material they added is <b>copyright</b>.

The problem seems to be that some of the original contributors to the article, did not understand Wikipedia's policies and made edits in good faith with material that they claim should not be edited by anyone but themselves, noting that Quinn himself does not wish the material edited. This is tantamount to claiming <b>copyrights</b> for the material included. Not understanding that no material on Wikipedia can be copyrighted and not familiar with Wikipedia's guidelines for nominating articles for deletion, they then took it upon themselves to try to preserve their material by automatically reverting any changes made. They did not understand that a better solution is exactly what we are doing here, discussing whether or not the material as is, should remain on Wikipedia. If the article does not survive, then the copyrighted material is safe, and if someone feels he is notable enough to warrant an article, they can always recreate with fresh non-copyrighted material.If it survives, well I think we all ought to sit down and have a cup of tea, to decide how best to write the article so that it does not use copyrighted material, yet remains an Encyclopedic article.</s> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 00:38, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>You make my point exactly (except the part where you classify fellow editors as idiotic). Wikipedia should never contain copyrightable material in any form. To say that no one should be allowed to edit an article, is the same as claiming copyright. As far as I can tell, looking at the article, it contains no obvious copyrighted material, with most of the material easily available from verifiable sources. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 04:09, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> Yes I am stubborn. I archived the material. One of the pillars of wikipedia is respect for each other and differing opinions. We should be very careful about what we say on talk pages and not just say whatever we want and then later try to hide our messes. Archiving is an accepted method for keeping discussion pages readable and is preferrable to simply deleting. Also the readability of an article's discussion page or lack thereof, is not sufficient grounds for deleting the article itself (if it were there would be a whole lot of articles in trouble).<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 16:36, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>It seems to me, that the point you bring up about privacy and reputation is one of the big reasons why the Wikipedia community places great emphasis on citing credible reliable sources. An encyclopedia should contain no information that isn't already in the public domain. Also, by respecting copyrights, disallowing original research, and establishing standards for notability and maintaining neutral points of view; the community further ensures that no one is slandered or libeled. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 08:00, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think it somewhat important to note here that a number of contributors are claiming to know what Mr. Quinn thinks about the article. Yet no one has provided a source for his thoughts, and no one has stepped forward claiming to be him and expressin those thoughts. I think it would create a dangerous precedent if Wikipedia allowed people claiming to represent a person (who don't provide a verifiable source), to determine the fate of an article, based solely on their claims. But then again, I'm just a fellow editor, not even an admin, and it's important to understand that I in no way represent the MediaWiki foundation. The opinions I express are mine, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Board of Directors or their representatives. I only know, that if I were notable enough to warrant an article, I would not want someone else claiming they know me, to determine the fate of my article. Ce la vie. I'm just a little guy with a big TV. Furthermore, this comment was not intended as an attack on any user but more of an observation about the verifiability of conversations that not everyone is privy to.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 08:16, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>DELETE - Nuthouse</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b> the article as it is now, check and source facts and improve as necessary. If there are any revisions in the history which provide too many personal details, please point them out so that they can be deleted. The info that is presented now hardly goes beyond matters of public record, like the name, awards, public appearances and academic career. The legal threats are therefore entirely hollow, and I very much doubt that the actual David Quinn has made them. I'm assuming some of his students are running a little prank on him and us here. It would probably be better if they come clean before we contact Mr. Quinn and the techies at their uni to find out what's behind this. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 19:27, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>; seems to be reasonably notable for his TV career, and has had enough of a public life that he can't just go and say "No, I'm just a private person now" and withdraw everything public. His legal threats are ridiculous and we shouldn't cave in to them. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 20:13, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>; I came here fairly randomly. There seems no reason why this article should not exist just because the subject of the article wants it deleted. To make legal threats against Wikipedia editors apparently shows that this man has too much money and time himself (despite his comments about others), but he has been a public figure, and he doesn't have any rights over people writing about him unless they legally libel him. Remove anything that might be libellous, and he hasn't got a leg to stand on, no matter how good his law firm. In fact, it would now be dangerous to remove this article as it might set a precedent, and we might have people like David Irving and even Osama Bin Laden (OK, I'm not entirely serious) complaining about being listed and threatening legal action. He makes a lot of noise, of course, but it seems to be hot air, and as long as Wikipedia are happy to retain this article, it should remain. He has publically admitted that at least one version of the article is essentially correct, and that in itself would prevent legal action. Personally I don't have any interest in this entry, and I won't be watching this talkpage, but for Wikipedia to continue to exist in the form that it does, it should resist pointless bullying.

<dd>Sorry, Thomas, but I think you've got it wrong. The version of the article that should stay is the bio that relates to the acting career (and frankly I don't think that THAT is even worthy). This isn't about a rich guy or about time: It is about a right to privacy. Just because one part of someone's life conforms to certain aspects of WP:BIO, doesn't give anyone the right about every other aspect. --<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.160.17.29.html" title="User:67.160.17.29">67.160.17.29</a> 00:46, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But some of the stuff you <i>deleted</i> was pertaining to your acting career, like the link to your IMDB entry. And none of it seemed to particularly relate to your private life; it was all reporting on publicly-known things like an award you received. The most "private" thing there was mentioning what school you currently teach at; I wouldn't object if that were removed if you think it violates your privacy (by getting lots of screaming fans to mob the school looking for you?), but it's already published on other sites, as linked in the article. I'm sure your great lawyers will advise you that you have no valid basis for any sort of complaint. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 01:12, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>DELETE: YOU ASKED, I'M ANSWERING</b> I have been involved with online communities since 1991, and I deeply respect the premise of wikipedia. That said, I have to question why so many strangers (Ringess, FCYTravis, RedGlobe, Trey, OlympicFlame) would care at all about my biography or this entry. I would hope that there is a more valuable use of your lives than the endless reverting of this entry (or the many hours some of you appear to have spent researching and documenting elements of my life). Here's a shout-out to Ringess: You have too much time on your hands.</li>
</ul>
<p>I returned from a brief trip to California this morning (BTW, the Image Awards are a lot of fun, and I urge you all to donate to the NAACP). I came back to school to get some paperwork done and found more than a few emails in my box. Most are from students, but at least one is from a resourceful wikipedian who very simply searched the Edmonds School District website for our directory, then sent me an email, directing me to this page. Anyone who wishes to email me may, of course, do this as well. You can even get my phone number from the directory and call and leave me a message. I'm happy to verify myself.</p>
<p>That said, I really could (mostly) care less about what you all are doing here. I didn't create this entry, I think that it is a complete waste of space, and I find the behavior of some of you to be completely anti-intellectual and downright childish. I don't suppose that anyone had my privacy rights in mind when they created the first Quinn entry, but now that I'm here, I think you should all just stop it. I'm voting for a delete, mostly because I think that you should all spend more time reading and seeing theatre.</p>
<p>The protected version of my entry is mostly correct, but I still fail to see why an entry for me exists in the first place. I am a private citizen, albeit one who once had a career on television and who has a career as an entrepreneur. My life is private, which is why davidquinn.com doesn't exist anymore. The biographical information that is found on my corporate sites exists for a simple reason: it answers basic questions for investors and media folks. If I wasn't required to put it up, I wouldn't have it up. My life is primarily dedicated to education. Anyone who has read my bio knows why: I made a promise to someone, and I'm keeping my side of the bargain.</p>
<p>If you want to continue to waste parts of your life on me or this entry, I cannot stop you. But rather than continue this wiki-farce, I urge you to delete this meaningless entry and concentrate your time and karmic energy making the world a better place to live in. Rather than spend all night reverting my bio, why don't you spend all night sending emails to political figures so they hear your voice? Or to relatives, so that they know that they are loved? Or how about just get in your car and go volunteer at a soup kitchen or an AIDS charity? I'm sure that you all have favorite causes. They need your help. Go.</p>

<li>Yes, this is EXACTLY why Ringess has been making sure only information verified is on the article, and nothing "self-verified" by the anonymous IP trying to raise havoc. I do not agree that the article should be deleted, you fall within the guidelines to have an article. We are doing our hardest to only have truthful information. I think some information still needs to be taken out of the article, too. <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonic3KMaster_d8d0.html" title="User:Sonic3KMaster">Sonic3KMaster</a> 21:36, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry David, I've desired for this article to be deleted a long time ago. You're right, I didn't want to be involved. I have better things to do, such as exercising instead. I think my points didn't help for the deletion of the article.

<li>Just had a lovely phone chat with FCYTravis. He's really great, and explained much about various wiki policies that I knew nothing about. I had no idea that asserting my legal right to privacy would be considered a threat, so I've withdrawn those statements and I'll deal with JWales and the foundation's legal team on future matters. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.160.17.29.html" title="User:67.160.17.29">67.160.17.29</a> (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.160.17.29.html" title="User talk:67.160.17.29">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.160.17.29_d2be.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.160.17.29">contribs</a>) 00:09, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The society can be considered to be one of particular importance as it has close tyings in with some of the notable names of Linux and is a close knit and friendly one. The individual who started this AFD request does not provide a valid excuse as such, the age old Cardiff Vs Swansea debate should not be brought into context for this page.

<li><b>Keep</b>. 180 members is pretty big for a student society -- I would guess it is one of the biggest student compsocs in the country. How big does it have to be to be notable?

<li><b>Keep</b>. Deleting an article because you don't like the location is not reasonable. It'd also argue that the society is notable because it has long been linked with Linux (SUCS was name-checked up until the 2.4.19 kernel for the work <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Cox_e02c.html" title="Alan Cox">Alan Cox</a> did on the network drivers while he was at the university). I also note that the nominator's discussion page has a number of complaints from people about his other edits. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireFury_cebb.html" title="User:FireFury">FireFury</a> <small>User has 26 edits, mostly to the article in question. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:22, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If this was a serious AFD, the nominator would have gone through all of the similar articles in the same categories as the SUCS one, found out how many members each society had and then given them the same treatment, depending upon whether he found their physical locations to his taste, of course. As it is, the nominator did not take this action. The location of the society is no justification for the deletion of the article. As FireFury mentioned, the society plays a part in the history of the Linux operating system and for this reason it is just as, if not more, noteable than other university society articles on wikipedia. <a href="../../../w/e/l/User%7EWelshbyte_e6fa.html" title="User:Welshbyte">welshbyte</a> 21:20, 21 February 2006 (UTC)<small>User has 24 edits, mostly to the article in question.　--<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:22, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. What portions are copyrighted and how can i fix this to make correct for wiki.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Its not the fact that they are copyrighted, its the fact that this is basically an ad for an unknown site. There is no reference to any contribution to anything that is of note. Okay, so its a Help forum. Check out Google for once for a Help Forum, you will find at least 10,000 results. Your site is like being a needle in a pile of needles. You can take this personal all you want, but this is the second time you have done this; and its wrong. Wikipedia is useful for the masses as a great reference. Your site doesnt add to that. No other forum for anything gets a free plug, yours shouldnt either. WissNX-01</li>

<p>Non-notable book. This book is self-published (published by Lulu press, who will publish anything if you pay them to) and its Amazon sales rank leads me to seriously question whether 5000 people have read it, let alone 100. I previously prod'ed the article, but it was removed, and I agree with that removal: we should probably debate this at least. Beyond notability: there's really nothing to write about this book: it's never been reviewed, it has no historical context, and there's nothing worthwhile to say about its author -- essentially, all that can be there is a plot summary. There's a significant lack of verifiable information here. If this page is deleted, A Modern courtesan and "A Modern Courtesan" should also be deleted. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 21:44, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>About Evonews</b> We are a group of 14 people who are interested in the development of dance music culture in Wales, and feel that there is an important story to be told. The main problem is that since the events were most popular in the very early 2000's its going to be hard to get online references, but we are adding and strengthening the article all the time. The reason our tag is called Evonews, is because we used to produce an unofficial magazine about the Evolution events and therefore have some interesting knowledge to share about the events. There are probably over 100 newspaper articles, national music press cuttings, radio recordings and court transcripts directly relating to The Evolution Experience all as independent sources which we will endevour to add to the article. In answer to the user who is wanting this article listed as news, this is certainly not news it is of historical interest.

<li><b>Strong Keep!</b> Important information about a notable clubbing event, good sources, nice article.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The tenor of the article is to promote the company which is, according to its website, trying to open international markets. Having news included on Wiki about an alleged fix-up conviction can add extra credibility to the promoter's personal reputation among potential customers. There are cited BBC pages for the conviction. I find it surprising that there are no comparable pages for the Court of Appeal quashing the convictions. If something was newsworthy enough for the BBC to report at first instance, it would be even more interesting to Welsh readers to find that the conviction was unsafe. There are no Google entries for the appeal. The reference to Smith Bernal Reporting (part of WordWave International) is also not a verifiable source. Smith Bernal do supply professional transcriptions for use by the legal profession but the price reflects their expertise (i.e. depending on the length, we could be talking several hundred pounds per copy). Without an accessible citation for the appeal, I am inclined to the view that this section in particular and the article as a whole are not encyclopaedic. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid91_7ed4.html" title="User:David91">David91</a> 06:40, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, having just gone back to the article, I now realise that I had misread it and conflated the two cases together. However, if the Court of Appeal quashed the drugs conviction, a reference "The Milford &amp; West Wales Mercury, Feburary 25 2000 - "Club owner's drugs conviction overturned by <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_Lords_263d.html" title="Law Lords">Law Lords</a>" referring to the House of Lords is not encouraging and does not cause me to change the vote (it simply confirms how badly written the article is to a casual reader). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid91_7ed4.html" title="User:David91">David91</a> 17:23, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I honestly do appreciate that <a href="../../../e/v/o/User%7EEvonews_77a9.html" title="User:Evonews">User:evonews</a> has (have?) worked hard on it, but I don't think that it is neutral and I don't think that it can become neutral. It reads in every version of the page history I have checked as a sort of defence (or promotion, but this is the weirdest promo article I've seen, full of claims of victimisation and suggestions of hidden agendas) of this Evolution Experience and people associated with it. The court case section is a prime example. There are lots of other problems with the article which could be fixed (editorialising; <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>; <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMoS_1f61.html" title="WP:MoS">WP:MoS</a>), but as long as the article reads as a defence of the thing and its members I don't think it should stay. The talk page should definitely <i>not</i> stay in its current form: fair use is one thing, but surely wholesale reproduction of complete newspaper articles without permission is close to copyright violation? --<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelsa_283c.html" title="User:Telsa">Telsa</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/User_talk%7ETelsa_ea14.html" title="User talk:Telsa">(talk)</a> 15:43, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was merge and redirect. Redirect is necessary to meet the attribution requirement in GFDL. "Merge and delete" and "merge then delete" are opinions incompatible with the attribution requirement in GFDL. The "unlikely search term" argument is irrelevant. (Yes, there are complicated, cumbersome and error-prone workarounds that still preserve the attribution history but I see no justification to go to that extraordinary effort for this article. Redirects are cheap.)</p>
<p>Having said that, I personally found little worth merging. Perhaps the good content had already been moved. Anyone interested in merging more content may do so by reviewing the article's history. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 06:13, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result of the debate was delete. AfD is often inconsistant, and we should attempt to correct that by coherently applying agreed upon standards. This is a discussion, not a vote, and there have not been presented compelling reasons to disregard <i>both</i> the previous afd result <i>and</i> a widely agreed upon guideline.<br />
<br />
<b>Re:Speedy deletion -</b> Looking back at the previous nomination, it was expressed that it failed at that time to satisfy the website inclusion guideline. Noting that it then mentioned Alexa ranking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability_%28websites%29&amp;oldid=31071283" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability_%28websites%29&amp;oldid=31071283" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>, the change in ranking can be seen as "new information" and thus barely avoids deletion as a recreation.<br />
<b>Re:Current Alexa -</b> As it still fails to meet the 10,000 mark of the guideline at the time of the pervious afd all of the first nomination editors' concerns are still valid. The use by newer editors' of the wp:web guideline that has no alexa ranking re-enforces this.<br />
<b>Re:Other articles -</b> A few editors made comparisons to other existing wikipedia articles, or to mention in the TV Tome article. There appears to be a gross imbalance between this article's subject and tv.com, for example, and the mentions in TV tome could easily be removed... which is why we don't use other wikipedia articles as references.<br />

So I'm listing it here.

<dd>It was originally removed by an anon, then reinserted by Aaron and then removed again by me. I came upon this while doing speedy deletion patrol and saw that the article's proponents were complaining. I checked the Alexa rank, saw that it had very substantially improved since the last AfD and decided that this was enough new information to make speedy deletion as a recreation inappropriate and recommended a new AfD if someone still wanted this deleted. But you didn't really have to defer to me just because I'm an admin, if any user in good standing objects to a speedy deletion in circumstances like this that's probably grounds for a new debate.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Aaron, I have edited other stuff prior to this article (but since I don’t use an account and use different computers from different stations, I don’t have a steady IP) and I personally rearranged it and removed every statement that according to some might be considered POV, bashing or "promotional mumbo-jumbo." Now this article is an impartial encyclopedic account of what TVRage is and stands for – pretty much like TV.com's article. If you feel that this article is a "blatant spamvertisement" then please go to the TV.com article and put an AfD over there too, because both articles are very alike. The differences between this and the older article are blatantly obvious! And since when only people with many edits can voice their opinions over here?

<li><b>Keep</b>: I've argued up and down this website as to why we should stay, so repeating old arguments does no good. I'll simply point out that we definately qualify under #3 of the new terms. Aside from Google recently making us one of the top 10 sites you see when referencing shows, Newzbin.com, EpGuides.com, and even Wikipedia.com (through television shows on here listing us as a reference) are three websites we get heavy traffic from. I think it's obvious that we're not affiliated with either Google or WP. And you can definiately check the other two. I do find it disheartening to know you've removed the Alexa rule, especially since that was the big reason we were deleted last time. To be blunt, we're a <b>television catalog and information website</b>. Any show that airs on television around the world, we catalog it's airdate, guests, notes, quotes, etc. Think of us as a more detailed version of IMDb. We're not looking for a billboard to advertise on, but we do want to be cataloged in Wikipedia as a source for entertainment information. If you haven't looked at our website, I suggest you do. Go find your favorite shows and see what we've got. That's as simple as I can make it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnQ.Public_5b87.html" title="User:JohnQ.Public">JohnQ.Public</a> 17:00, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: I feel that this site deserves a stop here. And if you purely want my opinion about this situation, I think it's not wise to even consider to remove the article.

Memory Alpha is a reference site with an Alexa rank in the same ballpark as TVRage.com There may, of course, well be reasons to keep one and not the other as some are arguing here, I just thought it was a comparison worth making, simplistic though it is. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 17:08, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

And now that you see more Keep votes than Delete votes, you want to try again? Not to mention you didn't bother to say anything specific, you just did what half the other modirators here do and that was post a link to a description page that doesn't explain our specific situation. That way you don't have to explain anything, and make yourself feel justifyed in your action.

<li><b>Comment</b> Well your information of who runs this place isn't exactly easy to locate, so what better term did I have? If you bothered to post a link to the list of Admin's or people in charge of deciding what gets the axe or not, I'm sure it would be more user friendly. <i>Now, the following is just my opinion and should hold no basis on this argument. I am just responding to what was posted by Lar</i> As far as the topic of being versed in the ways of the big W, have you bothered checking the net and on television on what people think of this place? I have, it's actually part of my real job. Wikipedia is widely considered a joke. You rely on people to come here and add information on anything and everything. That leads to false info and biased opinions, making your webpages unreliable. And since you like to site sources, go check out pages like Hitler, Abortion, and President Bush (and about 100+ other U.S. officials) just to name a few. Locked down and frequently edited because of those very arguments. If you were truly aiming to be an encyclopedia to the world, you would have joined up with the Library Of Congress and several other information sources across the globe. As opposed to relying on people with no lives who know everything about a single topic to find this place and post. I'm sorry, but when CNN goes on air and once an hour for two days straight says your website is a piece of garbage... do I really need to say more. I don't bother to become versed or get involved because my experience with this place is that most of my material gets edited and deleted frequently on a whim. Both on my other user name, and anonymously. And because of that, I honestly don't think a lot of the "Editors" here are the best people to judge what belongs and what doesn't. You're not professors, you're not experts, and I doubt any of you were dumb enough to claim you know all there is to know about everything. Unless someone can step up and claim they research daily every single topic that comes to this webpage on a daily basis, I don't think it's too much to say that this place is due for a management overhaul. So seriously, stop dictating to me that you know what should stay and what should go. Especially when I know for a fact that only a few of you who are "in charge" here have come to check out the website and explore the info it has to offer. To quote one of the people who started the Encyclopædia Britannica "We may document it, but we sure as hell don't study it.

<li><b>Reply to Lar &amp; Perfecto:</b> To Lar, no, that isn't right. You came to the defense of this website and your decision. I pointed out why I think that decision was wrong and why I (based around the attitude of the staff, and the non-simplistic rule system) defended my stance using sources such as your own webpages and CNN to back that statement up. Sorry to be a smartass, but I thought that's what you wanted? Non-trivial published works and recognition through broadcast. I would have added external links, but MSNBC's article was erased last week. You act like ridding WP of our website is like killing a disease, or to a lesser extent, popping a pimple. And a number (not all) of the editors I've dealt with on here act as if they're the all curing doctors of information and they're the only people whose medicine matters. When in reality very few of you bother reading the right medical books to look for the proper cure. As if this one medicine can cure all. Well, it doesn't. I urge you to take a look at our website with fresh eyes and judge it on the content, not on the manner of which it's posted on here. Text can be fixed a corrected, a delete cannot. And to Perfecto, no, you know better. In fact if you recall, you complimented me on my skills at the last discussion and said I would be perfect here. I registered a name to use in these forums so that you can see an actual Admin from the website was here to defend it's existence here, and that our staff wasn't just sending people in waves (like so many other websites do) to defend the article. I take an active role when it comes to our website, I don't hire lackeys to do my speaking for me. While I haven't done much under this username (which wasn't registered long ago), I am here to improve Wikipedia. But you will excuse me if I come to the defense of the place I call home and assure that it stays before I go adding more info for your staff to post for deletion. You want a lot more from me? I'd like more from you. A list of Editors and Admins for new people to turn to, especially in matters such as this where I feel we're being unfairly treated. And how about guide of how to properly do things at Wikipedia that doesn't read like IKEA guide to building an entertainment system? And that goes for every page you have here for rules and regulations. You demand your users to make pages simplistic, yet you've made the very codes for this site about as easy to understand music sung by Kurt Cobain. As far as adding more info, anyone who has seen my guides at TvTome, Tv.com, and TvRage knows I'm dedicated and detailed. (Again, you need to come look at our website.) I'd be happy to add information to a number of other topics, especially in television history, broadcasting, filming, news, networks, unions, and anything else involving entertainment. But seeing how dedicated much of the staff here is into removing a website that <b>catalogs television information</b>, I really question whether or not my info would just be monitored and deleted anyway under the guise of it not meeting the standards of another set of unreadable rules. You really can't deny the actions you and I take speak louder than the words we type. I have a proven track record for all to see of doing my job and doing it right. All I've seen from you is to frequently delete material you deem as obsolete or useless. I'll be happy to add more when I see that everyone gets the same fair treatment. So far, we're still sitting on the fence here. We've met the requirements of the last delete, and at least one of the new system (if you'll look back to another discussion, someone else mentioned our website in in an article or two). I'm sorry if Time Magazine and the Nobel Prize judges haven't gotten around to us yet. (Which I might add, if you're saying a website must have all three to stay, you might want to start deleting every website on this encyclopeda.) Not to mention the large amount of Keep votes from both users and staff members. Yet your still pushing for a delete using the same rule over and over despite explanations and defense from your own members. I think I'll wait to add more until after the final decision. That's not to say I'll leave if we're deleted. But it's not too encouraging to get a two sentence response from you Perfecto, that comes off like you're looking for a reason to get rid of me. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnQ.Public_5b87.html" title="User:JohnQ.Public">JohnQ.Public</a> 22:11, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>The result of the debate was ambiguous. The straight vote count is 2-1 for keeping. However, when reviewing the article myself, I agree that this is more essay than encyclopedia article. Furthermore, I believe that the current text is a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. While there are groups that call themselves various names including variants of "independent business alliance", I am unconvinced that this is a significant social phenomenon about which there has been any significant independent press. Moreover, I do not believe that the many organizations using this name would all agree with the set of goals and/or aspirations which the article attributes to them.</p>
<p>However, even with my own opinion, that merely reaches 2-2. I am closing this as a "no consensus" decision. As an ordinary editor, I am also tagging it as a possible <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> violation and a possible <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> violation. If the article is not cleaned up in a reasonable period of time, it may be appropriate to renominate it for deletion. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 06:01, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I cannot provide evidence that they are false, but I don't believe that most of the claims demand evidence. I don't see how mustaches are relevant at all, or most of the other information for that matter, and what's more, some of the information is not only unverifiable but also subversive. Read the bit about switching parties because of the money, for example. In addition, if you view the history of the entry's changes, you will see that the information you verified (House Rules Committee, Chris Bell) was entered at the same time as all the other information. For this reason, we cannot trust that the article was written in any sort of good faith. Even if it was, then it would easily amount to a vanity article. I believe it should be deleted for the sake of Wikipedia as well as for the sake of this individual. 71.194.162.89 00:34, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep or Merge</b> I feel rather weakest on this, because of the six notable campaigns I made entries for, this is mine, and I feel very lame arguing for my material. It comes down to this. Theatre Style LARP is rather under-represented on the web, because almost all of the discussion of it has taken place in a few specific forums. However it is a meaningful vital art form, and this campaign occupies a significant place in any larger discussion of its evolution and development. I would point out that there are Live Combat groups which have standing references only because they happen to have an active web page themselves, not because they have any particular intrinsic merit other than existing. I hope to expand the body of theoretical and historical information available on Theatre Style LARP, which is in fact a real writing discipline, emanating from Harvard and MIT in the early 80s. But if every supporting reference to it is going to be picked apart, that's difficult. I feel that because some entries may ultimately accrue quite a lot of detail, it would be best to let individual entries stand, however I can also see a valid argument for combining most of the significant examples on a single page of works within the discipline. --Jgodean 01:55,
<ul>
<li>My major concern here is the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">Wikipedia policy against original research</a>. You say you hope to expand the body of theoretical and historical information available on Theatre Style LARP; that's a great goal, but Wikipedia is not a primary source. Wikipedia articles should be based on other, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. One of those Google hits, <a href="http://www.thelarper.org/drink_deeper.html" class="external text" title="http://www.thelarper.org/drink_deeper.html" rel="nofollow">thelarper.org</a>, is arguably a reliable source, but it's the only one I'm aware of, and it doesn't say much. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 06:30, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
