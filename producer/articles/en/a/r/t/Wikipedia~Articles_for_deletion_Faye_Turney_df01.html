<dd>The only information which should be added to this article is material which is properly referenced. In this case it is almost certainly going to be news stories from credible media organizations.

<dd>Anyone can add anything, and by going through the history anyone can see what was added by someone and then deleted. Some bright spark might give information that does not meet wiki criteria, is immediately deleted, but gives them a stick to beat her and her fellows with. The Iranians might have people on their team who are aware of the power of the net as a means of gaining info and leave no stone unturned, and actually know a thing or two about dredging up info beyond the ubiquitous google search.

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> Can someone explain what a comment above: "Yet another example of people creating an article of something tied to a current event that would otherwise be a very frivolous article" even means? Um, yes obviously it would be a "frivolous" article if the current event hadn't happened. Yet it <i>did</i> happen, so therefore it isn't frivolous anymore. To me, that's like saying, "The article on George Washington would be frivolous if he was just a Virginia landowner and had never been elected president of the United States." Yes, and? So? This is an article about someone involved in a very notable current event. People turn to Wikipedia as a resource for information. Keep. And I agree with the concerns above regarding her privacy. <i>Everything</i> in this article needs to be sourced and sourced properly with reliable, public media sources (preferably with the stature of, say, the BBC). There can be no conjecture. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 03:28, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If there is enough information available (from credible sources) on the other captives then I would be in favour of creating articles on them as well. In any case, each article stands or falls on its own merits or demerits; good or bad practice elsewhere in the Wikipedia has no bearing on the question of whether this article should stay. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenshed_5a67.html" title="User:Greenshed">Greenshed</a> 21:16, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The fact that more of the focus is on her than the other hostages is not her fault, but is an undenyable part of the story. Iran have chosen to make her the key figure and so have the media. Whether that is right or wrong, it gives her greater prominance.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> She is the most recognisable figure in one of the biggest news stories for years and years between two of the world's most prominent nation. There are a great many articles on here about people who are far far far less famous. How many amateur sports stars are on here? How many other people who were in the news for 10 minutes? There is even an article on the detective who led the enquiry into the Ipswich murders last year, who was a far less recognisable figure in a far smaller news story. Faye Turney will dominate the news for the next month. When she comes home she will be recognised everywhere. There is even talk of a movie deal.</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> -- I'm kinda torn on the issue of deleting this article, because Faye Turney has indeed received a significant proportion of the international press attention of the current hostage crisis. It is conceivable that she could play a pivotal role in the coming days and weeks as the standoff is eventually resolved. But not every person who has ever been in the news deserves a Wikipedia entry, and I think her fame will be short lived. Her actual role in this minor incident is itself minor. So does a minor participant in a minor incident deserve a wikipedia entry?

<li><b>Reply</b> How has she been singled out for special abuse? She was admittedly the first to be shown in the videos, but others then followed. I believe I've read that she has been kept apart from her comrades - but the Wikipedia article doesn't actually state that, nor does it mention that she was compelled to wear a hijab, for that matter. If you are going to argue the psychological torture angle, then those points are surely relevant and should be added. I appreciate your point about the media having singled her out, but if it's a keep, then it's a 'weak keep' or a <b>merge and redirect</b> at best. Assuming this situation is resolved with no further damage to the captured personnel, how will the article on Turney benefit future people reading about the incident? There is nothing in the Turney article that couldn't be transferred into the main article, except for various completely irrelevant points (daughter of a non-notable footballer, married in a non-notable church, etc) <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_of_York_f588.html" title="User:Richard of York">Richard of York</a> 17:02, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

As I indicated above, it is an uncontestable fact that the article on Turney easily meets the at least one of the criteria; this is not a borderline case. All those arguing for deletion need to explain why this article is special case for deletion <i>vis-√†-vis</i> the guidance. So far no one has done that - because, I suggest, there is no valid argument <i>which stems from the relevent guidance</i>. This discussion does not run along the lines of a simple numerical vote and so those who want to see this article deleted need to develop their argument in light of the clear guidance to the contrary. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenshed_5a67.html" title="User:Greenshed">Greenshed</a> 16:48, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. That the other servicepeople don't have articles now (and are you sure they all don't? Have you checked?) is an absurd reason to delete this one.

<dd><b>*Comment</b> You misunderstand me Moncrief. I am not saying that her article should be merged <i>because</i> none of the other soldiers have one, merely that under Wikipedia's notability guidelines all 15 would qualify, and yet she's the only one been given her own page. (PS I haven't checked all fifteen names but her name is the only one with a link to it on the main article.) I see it as less like your "counties" argument and more like <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_2001_%28UK%29_dd86.html" title="Big Brother 2001 (UK)">this article</a> on Big Brother. All the contestants got national coverage for weeks in the media, but only those who went on to have notable careers outside of BB have their own article (which is how she differs from Lynch, who has gone on to become the subject of a film). Nothing to do with moral judgements, and I realise that I am in the minority here, but my personal view is that the article adds absolutely nothing to Wikipedia. Although actually, I have revised my original view - it's not a delete, but a merge. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_of_York_f588.html" title="User:Richard of York">Richard of York</a> 22:35, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Reply to Richard of York's points</b>. I have considered starting articles for other captives but I am disinclined so to do whilst this article is facing the chop. I see no point in putting in the work on another captive only for it to be deleted as well. Anyway, as Moncrief outlines above, the absence of other articles has no bearing on whether this article should stay or go. My view is that one of the benefits of the notability guidelines is that they let editors know when their verifiable, NPOV, notable, (etc) contributions will be kept/improved. Those arguing for a merge have a better (but not that good) argument than the deletionists. If I thought that this article had no prospect of making it past a stub then I too would favour a merge. However, with a few hours of work it probably could be taken past a stub now and anyway it is a near certainty that further information about Turney will become available. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenshed_5a67.html" title="User:Greenshed">Greenshed</a> 18:53, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Conditional delete</b> I'm a little suprised of these outright "keeps" that just say "of course she is notable". I'm afraid I would have to disagree with you, at the moment <b>she</b> is not notable, the capture of 15 British troops <b>is</b> notable but <b>she</b> alone is not. <i>However</i> I agree with above points that if something happened in the future which makes <b>her</b> notable then the article ought to be kept. If nothing happens then I don't feel it is notable enough to stay on its own. <a href="../../../s/g/g/User%7ESGGH_ea0b.html" title="User:SGGH">SGGH</a> 14:14, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

The article states that she was assigned to Serria Leone and that HMS Cornwall was patrolling to catch smugglers. I may just not have read somewhere where it says otherwise, but from this information alone can we really say she fought in the Iraq War? <a href="../../../s/g/g/User%7ESGGH_ea0b.html" title="User:SGGH">SGGH</a> 14:14, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Excuse me, but I have a very good understanding of what notability is in the context of wikipedia. She is <b>not</b> notable outside of the events. Now that they have been released the article of her alone will most likely not expand more than a few sentences. If a user wants to research the event, then they will look at the article on <b>the event</b> not another article that just looks at <b>the event again</b> from the perspective of one of the sailors. I would appreciate it if you didn't question other user's capabilities just because they don't agree with you.

<li>I'm sorry if that came off as a personal attack - I'll rephrase it as <i>The argument that that she's not notable shows no understanding of the meaning of notability in the context of Wikipedia</i>. I didn't question the capability of anyone - I didn't speculate on <i>why</i> they didn't understand the policy in question, and I won't now. But this is a discussion, and it is important to note when an argument attempts to apply a policy in a grossly inappropriate way. That way, the closing admin can look at the arguments and realise the "keep" argument is <b>Passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> and WP:V]]</b>, while the only argument advanced for deletion is <b>Fails <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a></b>. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:49, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, My reason being that I came on to this article to find information about her, and that therefore makes it useful as an encyclopaedic article.
