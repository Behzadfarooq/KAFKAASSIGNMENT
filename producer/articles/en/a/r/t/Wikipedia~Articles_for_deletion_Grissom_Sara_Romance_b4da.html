<li><i><b>Do not delete</b></i> CSI has been for a long time the number one show on American television and GSR is the first and only canonical relationship portrayed in it. It has caused much debate among fans and attention from the media. Moreover, having read the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> page, it does not break any of the guidelines or rules that wikipedia use. All CSI communities and discussions talk about GSR, either for or against, and if they don't it's because the topic has been banned because it's so controversial. It is definitely relevant to the subject matter. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#When_you_wonder_what_to_do" title="WP:NOT">Here</a> it says that if you expect something to be in a real encyclopedia then it should be in wiki. If I were reading an encyclopedia that had a CSI entry but nothing about GSR, I'd think it would definitely be lacking. It is not a fanfic at all. It's canon CSI and there's no disputing that. It does, however, need a clean-up. The list needs to be edited so that someone who wasn't already in on what the quotes mean would understand it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHermit789_922d.html" title="User:Hermit789">Hermit789</a> (<a href="../../../h/e/r/User_talk%7EHermit789_0afb.html" title="User talk:Hermit789">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hermit789_c4b9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hermit789">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The question becomes whether this particular subplot of the series has any real world independently published articles about it. If the article contains ONLY plot elements, then it doesn't meet WP:NOT#IINFO's requirement that plot summaries include verifiable analysis or real world context. Now all that being said, I vaguely remember one or two TV mags having cover pictures and stories specifically about this fictional romance. <i>If</i> the article can cite some of those published articles, it would go a long way toward vindicating keeping it as a separate article. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:16, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>DO NOT DELETE.

The "timeline" apparently consists of cryptic references to every scene in every episode in which the characters might be perceived as flirting with each other, which is both far too much detail for an encyclopedia article and also completely incomprehensible to non-viewers of this series. For example, among the entries is "2x03: Pickle scene." Once the timeline is gone, it will be easier to merge the remainder. As a second choice, and if necessary to avoid a "no consensus" result, my next recommendation would be to delete this article entirely. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 23:49, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Changing my recommendation to <b>delete</b> per Ohconfucius, to avoid a "no consensus" result and because the timeline is just too embarrassing to allow to stick around. By "embarrassing", I mean that keeping a record of how they "exchange a flirty smile when Sara matches the paper to the printer" and Grissom "helps Sara with chess" makes the article look like a junior high school student's diary of a <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limerence.html" title="Limerence">crush</a>. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 16:30, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i><b>DO NOT DELETE</b></i> Significant pop culture fan following of a slowly developed relationship on the program. (For example, currently there are &gt;1800 videos dedicated to this relationship on YouTube.) This is not fan fic, it is an explicitly demonstrated part of the program's canon. As previously mentioned, there have been magazine articles on this precise topic (including Galaxie Magazine July 2005 and TV Guide September 14, 2006's cover story). First choice is keep the article with a revised or eliminated timeline. Second choice, merge the two articles. Any article on the series which excluded mention of the only relationship between two major characters on the show would be incomplete and would misrepresent the nature of the show as being solely work-place focused.Abcadog 05:54, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article merely details the sexual tension present between Grissom and Sara <b>in the TV series</b>, and <b>has nothing to do with fan fiction</b>. Although the article could use some cleanup, AFD is not the cleanup department. The facts presented are verifiable as they are part of a published work (a tv series). For a similar article that is written better and, more importantly, is accepted by the community, see <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirk_Spock_d5fb.html" title="Kirk/Spock">Kirk/Spock</a>. —<a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisavian_2333.html" title="User:Disavian">Disavian</a> (<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDisavian_f80f.html" title="User talk:Disavian"><sup>talk</sup></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Disavian_e056.html" title="Special:Contributions/Disavian"><sub>contribs</sub></a>) 02:08, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. First, as noted in previous comments, CSI itself clearly fits Wikipedia notability criteria. Second, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fancruft#Policy_relating_to_fancruft" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fancruft#Policy_relating_to_fancruft" rel="nofollow">"there is no firm policy on the inclusion of obscure branches of popular culture subjects"</a>, but there is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fancruft#Background" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fancruft#Background" rel="nofollow">"the issue of bias with deletion of verifiable material under the vague notion of it being 'unencylopedic'"</a> to be concerned with.

<dl>
<dd>Just to reply, there <i>are</i> policies and guidelines though for handling articles about plot lines in fiction. <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> both specify that for plot summaries, "Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot. A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger topic." Thus while a plot summary can be a valid part of an article on a topic, it should not be the <i>only</i> aspect of the article. In addition, articles should also meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> standards which require multiple, independent, verifiable published references for verification and to establish proper notability of the subject of the article in question. In this case, the article hasn't yet provided those references.</dd>
<dd>Now mind you, I think it <i>might</i> be possible to correct those issues and save the article. The reason is because I think that there have been reliable independent real-word articles published specifically about this fictional romance. So if a few of those sources are cited in the article, and the article presents some real-world analysis of the romance (aside from just listing plot details) then it would I think satisfy all the requirements of WP:NOT, WP:N and WP:V. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:22, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm inclined to agree with <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisavian_2333.html" title="User:Disavian">Disavian</a>'s comment above that "Although the article could use some cleanup, AFD is not the cleanup department." Why delete the article if all that would be needed to fix it up are some outside sources? Here's a start:

<li><b>Delete</b>, cited sources do excellently well to establish the notability of CSI itself, and of a general article about television romance, but this would be a better fit under such an article and does not require its own. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 18:03, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> Having now read the Kirk/Spock article (which is apparently well accepted and non-controversial) I'm not even sure why we're having this discussion as the topics are quite comparable. If anything, CSI has now been on the air for four years longer than Star Trek was, and the relationship between the two characters is actually show canon, and not just a fan phenomenon. (I did not know the origin of the term "slash" and was very interested to learn it, btw.) Both shows have had a significant impact on popular culture, and each features a relationship (either among the fan following or within the context of the series) between two of the lead characters which has developed a life of its own and for which there is a widely used descriptive term. If the Star Trek article, which I found interesting and informative, is appropriate on Wikipedia, then so should be the article on GSR. I've made some fairly significant edits to the material, in particular replacing the timeline with a narrative of the relationship. Abcadog 05:15, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
