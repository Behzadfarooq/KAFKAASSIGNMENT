<p>Wikipedia is not a dictionary of slang - which this article says the term is <a href="../../../e/d/d/User%7EEddie.willers_4fa8.html" title="User:Eddie.willers">Eddie.willers</a> 00:27, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I agree to a point- if the slang has any kind of cultural impact or is widely-spread enough that it is part of the vernacular, it deserves an article. In this case, however, it is at best obscure profession-specific jargon, and as such doesn't deserve its own page. <b>Delete.</b> --<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatadyBag_273f.html" title="User:PatadyBag">PatadyBag</a> 00:29, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This term isn't all that obscure - it's used in lots of contexts including the track (racetrack) where it refers to someone who will cash your winning ticket for you to avoid tax withholding.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure I understand why you think it ought to go into <a href="../../../p/o/s/Positioning_%28marketing%29.html" title="Positioning (marketing)">Positioning (marketing)</a> of all the places it could go. Some people think that this constitutes a valid article in and of its own right, so I don't think that if it belongs anywhere it should be as an example in an article about marketing. You can't just have a few paragraphs on a washing machine in the midst of a business article, so that would completely eliminate anything you want to say about CWM apart from the marketing sector. It seems to me that it would be much more fit (if the vote is to keep or merge it) to either leave it as its own article with a link from <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaos_theory.html" title="Chaos theory">chaos theory</a>, or merge it with aforesaid chaos theory. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcap_a87c.html" title="User:Blackcap">Blackcap</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackcap_5870.html" title="User talk:Blackcap">talk</a> 16:35, August 28, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> Because as far as I can tell, the whole CWM concept is primarily an attempt to create a new market segment within the market for washing machines to make use of the buzz that surrounded chaos theory in the early 1990s.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I apologise for my bluntness, but, come on! This is not even a <i>convincing</i> hoax. Yes, there is such a person as Padraig Stevens. But this guy is not him. Padraig Stevens is a Saw Doctor. How could a member of the <a href="../../../s/a/w/Saw_Doctors_4bb1.html" title="Saw Doctors">Saw Doctors</a>, a hugely popular band in Ireland (and fairly popular in the ex-patriate community over here) still be playing after apparently committing so many murders? How could this (hoaxed) person who hates the Saw doctors actually be a part of them? I very frequently read the Irish newspapers, and, believe me, if there were a serial killer slaughtering fans of the Saw Doctors, it would be <i>huge news.</i> In any circumstance, a serial killer would be on the front pages for more than a week, specifically if it were such an interesting case such as 'this one.' There would also be huge documentation online of it. Take it from me, there have not been many mass murderers in Ireland; if this guy were amongst them, he would be incredibly notable. But there is no such killer. <i>I don't see why you should redirect this to Padraig Stevens. Sure, there should be a Padraig Stevens page, perhaps, but <b>one about the Saw Doctors</b> member.</i> Making one out of this hoax is utter stupidity. <a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27s-is-not-a-genitive_382d.html" title="User:It's-is-not-a-genitive">IINAG</a> 18:09, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I disagree. A more general search <i>"EVE X-tier"</i> turns up the technology in the same context as Microsoft, and Sun technologies. A google search returned over 8 pages of conversation, exceprts, articles on this technology. Since when do search hits dictate notability? I see no violation here and vote for it to remain.</p>

<li>Sorry, but that's a completely fake comparison. Haven't you ever wondered how one of the world's busiest websites only has 200 non-duplicated references? The preponderance of Wiki-hosted results throws Google's duplication tagging for a loop. If you remove the wikipedia site from your search, you have 10 <b>million</b> different results and you don't trigger a Google duplicate tag. Here's one way to do the [<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=wikipedia+-wikipedia.com+-wikipedia.org&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=wikipedia+-wikipedia.com+-wikipedia.org&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">search</a>]. Per mgm, the news sites are not, in my view, notable, but I admit that is my view. [<a href="http://www.nodo50.org/aspa/module.php?link=modules/desurasur/indice.php&amp;ID=5" class="external text" title="http://www.nodo50.org/aspa/module.php?link=modules/desurasur/indice.php&amp;ID=5" rel="nofollow">This</a>] is fairly typical. <i>Sur al Sur</i> is hardly notable. And the article less so - a sort of quo-vadis on the nonviolent movement, mostly consisting of Gandhi remembered. I don't see notability, my vote to delete stands. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 17:17, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, I should have been clearer. As you may know, Google limits its returns on searches to 1000, so as it processes through the top 1000 results it filters for similar results and eliminates duplication in the displayed 1000 . What you have discovered is that searching google for "google" returns roughly 50% duplicate content on the top 1000 pageranked matches. (Excluding the site is a good way to get higher individual returns in your 1000 sample since, for high-profile sites like Google or Wikipedia, the site itself has a high pagerank score). Put in a random word ("frank", "hairdress", "kappa", whatever) and click through - you will see that most times Google returns a duplicate message before you reach the 1000 limit even if the search term has millions of results and is seemingly random. This is because there is inherent duplication in the 1000 sample that Google returns on whatever search you do. Let me sum up: "Pietro Ameglio" triggers a TOTAL of 124 results of which half are duplicated; that is a sample size of 100% Wikipedia generates millions of returns; the duplicated content on the sample you have linked to above (which is itself so small as to be unrepresentative) is a mere 15%; the overall duplication, were it possible to run a 100% sample, would probably be considerably smaller still. Your google link is also a good example. Between the time you conducted the search, and the time I clicked it, the pagerank of the top 1000 sites that mentioned Google had change significantly enough to alter the duplicated results within the sample by over 15%. For high return search terms (like Wikipedia) simply waiting an hour (or hell,maybe five minutes) between running the search can change substantially the duplication level in your 1000 sample. You surely didn't think that google only somehow triggered 511 non-duplicated entries out of tens of millions of results!? <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 01:31, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, for what little it's worth: While the quality and POV of this page is seriously sub-par, the topic is quite encyclopedic. I took an Anthropology class a year ago, a signifigant portion of which was devoted to the sexuality of Brazil, which stands in great contrast to that of the U.S., and is really quite an interesting topic worthy of inclusion. If the author could start a more neutral page (i.e. Sexuality of Brazil), I would be happy to furnish him with notes and references. ‚áù<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasito_3c90.html" title="User:Casito">Casito</a>‚áù<a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECasito_0bf9.html" title="User talk:Casito">Talk</a> 05:05, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: Good suggestion. You don't seem to be claiming that there is any useful <i>content</i> here to save, and IMO there isn't, it would be much easier to start again. Perhaps there is even enough encyclopedic information available for an article on <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexuality.html" title="Bisexuality">bisexuality</a> in Brazil, but a more general article is the place to start.

<dd>For your consideration: Camo dudes
<ul>
<li>Google search of "camo dude" + "area 51" yields less than ten unique sites, mostly talk forums, and none of note. This indicates a use of this term that is truly arcane ‚Äì hardly wide enough to merit an article. It's singularly uncommon slang, nothing more.</li>
<li>The only other link to the page is at (<a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_51.html" title="Area 51">Area 51</a>), added by the creator of the article himself.</li>
<li>Article is short due to granularity of its subject.</li>
<li>Poorly written: incorrect capitalization ("Perimeter" as a proper noun), improperly titled (plural rather than singular); and with misspellings (including the term "cammo" itself). It appears the writer doesn't even know how to spell his own word.</li>
<li>Statements range from the unsubstantiated ("Some observers have been detained on public land for pointing camera equipment at the base.") to the trifling ("some of these vehicles have been seen equipped with red and blue pursuit lighting").</li>
<li>The photo is captioned: "In the full version of this picture (q.v.), a "Camo Dudes" vehicle can be seen on the top of the hill", but it reveals only an unexceptional car, without pursuit lights ‚Äì and no camo dudes.</li>
<li>The sign in the photo reads "Nellis Bombing and Gunnery Range", which is adjacent to, but not part of, Area 51.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>In summary, it smacks of Area 51 chat room ephemera, and, in my opinion, is a first-rate candidate for deletion. Take a good, hard look at it. Anyone care to disagree?</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> fuddlemark's last reason and Uppland's reasons are compelling. Plus I'm pretty sure the U.S. isn't the only place where ethnic stereotypes, which means if this list <i>could</i> be formulated in a way that didn't have the aforementioned problems, it would have to cover stereotypes world-wide, at which point I believe it would run afoul of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT Sec. 1.7.2</a>: No Lists of Loosely Associated Topics, as the only thing every ethnic stereotype in the world has in common is that it's an ethnic stereotype, and when you're talking on a global scale, I think that qualifies as a loose association. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 14:36, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - <i>some</i> of the stereotypes listed here are encyclopedic, but can really only be fairly covered in the context of a proper, well-rounded article about the ethnic group in question - and I'm willing to bet that all of the encyclopedic content here already is in those articles.

<li><b>Keep</b>- one of the best things about Wikipedia is its ability to cover topics that wouldn't appear in a regular scholarly encyclopedia (pop culture, etc.) Like it or not, this page does represent an aspect of society that people may want to look up. Furthermore, on the issue of its inherent POV-ness, it's sort of an equal-opportunity offender, so it's not slanted against any one group in particular. --<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatadyBag_273f.html" title="User:PatadyBag">PatadyBag</a> 18:47, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: The problem with this list is not that it <i>covers</i> POVs, but that it <i>is</i> entirely POV. An article <i>reporting</i> on ethnic stereotypes, putting them in some kind of context and giving references, would not be a problem. As a worst-case solution, if the current garbage ends up getting kept, I suggest cleansing this page of every stereotype which does not have a citation to support its existence. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 19:21, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I certainly agree with you that the article could and should be a lot better. A lot of it is poorly organized and poorly typed almost to the point of patent nonsense; at any rate, it's far from being up to our usual standards. With your suggestion, I'm just somewhat concerned that we might run into the article becoming <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">a collection of external links</a>. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 20:09, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

It need not be completely POV; it's certainly possible to determine whether or not a meme is widely held, otherwise we wouldn't be able to determine which urban legends are notable and which aren't.

<li><b>Keep</b> - As much as I hate to say it, most of these are widely pervasive and well-known stereotypes. Much of it was offensive, but it would be a very bland world if anything offensive was censored. There was enough truth (or at minimum common misconception) to merit a keep.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm the original author. I guess I'm really not entirely clear what Wikipedia's "notability threshold" is (ten thousand people interested in the subject? I really don't know, and I can't find the relevant guidelines), but HRG's Cat is an argument that's seen thousands of pairs of eyes and thus that someone might want to look up.

<dd>Well, I've seen references to HRG's cat on CARM <a href="http://www.carm.org/boards.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.carm.org/boards.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, AARM <a href="http://aarm.mywowbb.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://aarm.mywowbb.com" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, ARN <a href="http://www.arn.org/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arn.org/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, and Theologyweb <a href="http://www.theologyweb.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theologyweb.com/" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. So, four Internet fora in all. The argument is also referenced on Paltalk discussions. I'm certainly not going to take the stance that it's the most notable atheist argument ever - certainly not up there with the "problem of evil" - and I wouldn't object to it being merged into some larger "atheist arguments" kind of page... but I consider it at least minimally notable, and growing. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 16:23, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. These comments are proof that it is far easier to destroy than create, especially the anagram nonsense. If good reasons for deletion are presented then I am all for it (and a few mentioned above are), but how about making changes to the article to make it acceptable to Wikipedia. Keep in mind that every article must start somewhere and that 'somewhere' will not be the final polished solution guaranteed an A in your English lit. class. I propose that if you have a legitimate good reason to delete the article, then spill it out, better yet make changes to it to make it more acceptable. If you just want to say something critical for the heck of it, then 'you' get a blog.</li>

<p>NN. I Googled "Matthew Dean", and came up with hits for a comedian, BMX free-stylist, Actor, and a Whistle, Flute and Bodhran player, but none for this vocalist. Perhaps the most notable thing about Mr. Dean according to the article is that he co-founded a Russian Folk group, but this group does not have a WP entry. I found such a beast on Google at: <a href="http://www.golosa.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.golosa.org/" rel="nofollow">Golosa Choir</a>, but under the "History" section on this site, Mr. Dean is not attributed as a co-founder (before you ask, the two listed founders don't have pages in WP). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Henderson_796b.html" title="User:David Henderson">David Henderson</a> 03:19, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>One of the five pillars of Wikipedia is that the Wikipedia"Neutral point of view criterion is paramount. If there are "many" entries that are point of view based, they are in vioaltion of this precept. Please point to a couple so they can be dealth with. Having said that, please note that new users' votes on Pages for deletion are generally discounted because they have no prior Wikipedia presence. And no, the purpose of Wikipedia is not to publicize up and coming anything, but to document people, places and things which can be considered to be encyclopedia-worthy.

<li>Gee. I guess it's alright to just slam on someone for a user of Wikipedia with a "prior Wikipedia presence" to break the rules presented by the site, which was reportedly a "newbie-friendly" site. So much for "don't bite the newbie". Whereas previously I'd intended to become a contributor of information to wikipedia, I believe I'll stick to writing paid guides to subjects from this point on. I'd hope that the administration of the site pays mind to this Zoe's reaction to my commentry. Pardon the ignorant newbie who was glad to find a good writer's biography set up on wiki already.

<p>=The author wishes to be deleted. She didn't asked to be placed on wikipedia nor did she ask for any type of publicity. Her fans took it amongst themselves. So I recommend removing it due to the author, Ms. Evans wishes. That was my faux pas.</p>
<p>Please delete this entry, and please for the love of God find some way to stop certain users from lingering on the deletion section, as it seems a CERTAIN user likes to bash on any "up for deletion" topics. Perhaps it would be advisable that the wikipedia administration find a better way to stop the newbie bashing and belittling. Damned if you visit wiki, it seems.</p>

<p>Disagree - John Bowndre - Ive seen them play, no idea about the harrogathshire part nor the 2.2 million, they're a sunday league team 4D in Norfolk. They do have an Irish striker, 1/8 th apparently , met him in the local pub when our team played them at Old Catton Sports Ground. Don't delete, we need some humour in our lives (albeit in the form of a Sundayleague team)</p>
<p>Ronnie Piles; just a team by the looks of it. Seems a good idea to put teams up on Wilki, so locals wanting to play for an SL can find one. I found this looking for Sunday League divisions. If more teams did this the better. Disagree with deletion.</p>
<p>- Alex James - Thankyou for your concerns about this being a hoax, you've shown how speedy you can detect jokes and fakes. However this is no fraud. I do manage a 4D sunday league team called Dancing Farmers FC. We are an amateur club in the Old Catton part of Norwich. 4C next season for sure. Don't delete this page because it could be useful to people such as above, and also it is a lot better than some of the other articles on your website. Perhaps this will start a lot of average joes using your site rather than the usual: obsessed, "geeky", hobbyists and boffins that mostly do at the moment. - Disagree.</p>

<p>This is King Street, Cambridge, which branches off from Jesus Lane, named after Jesus College that it runs behind. It makes a turn and then runs parallel to Jesus Street for maybe 500 meters until it reaches a small roundabout. The only coffee house in Cambridge that doesn't close at 6 PM is on that road, as is the delightful St. Radegund's pub, which has a selection of well kept guest ales on offer. There are a few shops and pubs more. It it away from the main shopping area. As I say, it's not particularly long, not particularly wide, it's not particular in any way in fact. It's not even a B-road.
