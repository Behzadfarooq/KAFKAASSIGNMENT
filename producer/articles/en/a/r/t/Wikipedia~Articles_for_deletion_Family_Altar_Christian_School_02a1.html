<li><b>Comment</b>. For some reason, nominating schools for deletion is one of the most controvbersial things you can do on Wikipedia. Nonetheless, this article has serious deficienies, first and foremost the article doesn't say <i>where</i> the school is located, although a Google check indicates that it is in <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_Creek%2C_Michigan_17ce.html" title="Battle Creek, Michigan">Battle Creek, Michigan</a>. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:33, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as unverified. I just see some directory listings of the school, and don't see adequate info for an article. The one in Battle Creek seems to be the one mentioned (as said above), but it's not made clear in the article. In any event, the school closed in 2002, so there seems little point or potential in an article. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 10:12, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Even with rewrite my vote remains delete as the new school this article points to is even less notable then the unverifiable one the article originally was implied as being attached to.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 22:45, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. So as I understand it, it's about a little school, that's been closed for 3 years?

<li><b>Comment</b>. The article has been rewritten.

<ul>
<li>There is no way of telling which Family Altar Christian School the author had in mind, since no sources were provided in the original article before it was rewritten. But the fact that the Battle Creek Community Foundation recently set aside $13,800 for the one in Battle Creek, Michigan <a href="http://www.bccfoundation.org/Grants%20in%20Review.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bccfoundation.org/Grants%20in%20Review.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> leads me to believe this one is still alive and well, so I will vote accordingly.</li>
<li>That's the DEFINITION of original research. Wikipedia is not the place to publish the info you get from contacting the articles subject! - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 22:48, 27 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You miss my point, completely. What evidence is there that the school is closed? I just provided an external link which demonstrates that a great deal of money was granted to this school during the 2004-2005 school year. There is an obvious discrepancy here if someone else believes the school closed in 2002. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 22:53, 27 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If there's no independently verifiable information, it's time to just put this one to rest. What are you going to do when you do call them? How is that at all a verifiable source?<br />
This is another problem with school articles in general. You're forced to rely on contacting the subject to get most of the information. How is someone, person or entity, ever a reliable source when their own interests are involved? - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 23:12, 27 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No one is forced to do anything to get information. If you wish to conveniently ignore the fact that a generous sum of money was donated to this school, according to the link I just cited, then by all means please continue revelling in all your bliss. Save your dime and read the link. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 23:21, 27 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You still have the problems of verifiability. How can you substantiate any of the claims even in this nascent article, other than information from the subject itself? For example, they have a very good student-to-teacher ratio; how do you know it's accurate? - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 23:33, 27 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>he told you go read the information on the link regarding <b>verifiability</b> and yet you still haven't done so. The verifiable accuracy of those aspects comes from the Battle Creek Enquirer newspaper, A profile published by a local newspaper is <b>precisely</b> the sort of source called for, (and used as an example) in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Professional journalistic publications are sufficient for WP purposes. It is also irrelevant if the information provided by the Battle Creek Enquirer is "true". It is clearly stated in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth.". --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 01:31, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

As said, the <a href="http://calhounchristian.org/" class="external text" title="http://calhounchristian.org/" rel="nofollow">Calhoun Christian School</a> is known to exist in Battle Creek, but it is not <a href="http://www.battlecreekenquirer.com/communities/schools/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.battlecreekenquirer.com/communities/schools/index.html" rel="nofollow">listed under private schools at BattleCreekEnquirer.com</a>.

<ul>
<li>Well, I'm somebody who "routinely nominates and/or votes to delete unverifiable articles". As mentioned above, the original version of this article stated the old school was closed, and kids went to the new <a href="http://calhounchristian.org/" class="external text" title="http://calhounchristian.org/" rel="nofollow">Calhoun Christian School</a>. It seems the existence of the new one proves the non-existance of the old one. Also, I don't have to prove this doesn't exist, the article must prove it does exist. This is a matter of policy per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Also, its seems odd to justify keeping an article on the grounds the original version was entirely wrong regarding the school's status. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 00:43, 28 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Could be that the original version is this that or something else. It really doesn't matter if the original version of the article said "this is a sex school for crackheads on the dark side of Uranus". My vote, as clearly stated, is about keeping the re-write. It verifiably exists as referenced by the links added to the article and is verifiably a school. Two sources to verify it are provided along with it's address and phone number. Anyone who wishes to verify it can phone it. Phone a school to see if it is real is not "original research". Also, see my comments about re: the sourcing by the Battle Creek Enquirer, which as per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is more than sufficient to meet the criteria of verifiability.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 01:22, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Real schools tend to be notable, but non-existant schools generally are not. Look at the article's own "source" at <a href="http://www.greatschools.net/modperl/quickprivate/mi/4869" class="external text" title="http://www.greatschools.net/modperl/quickprivate/mi/4869" rel="nofollow">greatschools.net</a>. It says the school is associated with the <a href="http://www.acsi.org" class="external text" title="http://www.acsi.org" rel="nofollow">Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI)</a>. However, ACSI does not show a school by this name in Battle Creek (or any similiar named school in the state). They do however list <a href="http://calhounchristian.org/" class="external text" title="http://calhounchristian.org/" rel="nofollow">Calhoun Christian School</a>.
