<li><b>Delete</b> A lot of people seem to be voting 'keep' on articles with no sources today. As it stands now, this article has done nothing to establish notability.

<li>There really isn't any notability guidelines for comics though... In any case, I think the first Christian "manga" (though it's not a manga) makes it noteable enough.<a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6303292.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6303292.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Plus, I think that any comic series <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593109415/ref=pd_luc_10210215931087291593109415/103-3905867-1834260" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593109415/ref=pd_luc_10210215931087291593109415/103-3905867-1834260" rel="nofollow">sold on Amazon</a> is important enough to include.--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 08:07, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Notability requirements are the same for comics as for most things: we need multiple, non-trivial sources that make more than a passing mention to the topic in question. The source you cited (publishersweekly.com) may be a good one but it's a long standing precedent in AfD's that being on Amazon.com does not establish notability (since you can find virtually anything on Amazon.com). If you could find one or two more third party sources I'd change my 'vote' to keep. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 08:13, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Even if Serenity was a <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a> (which it isn't), it wouldn't be the first Christian manga. <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Tail_cc72.html" title="Saint Tail">Saint Tail</a> has a religious theme, and it definitely predates Serenity.</li>

<p>"The story follows students in a private religious school, and while Saint Tail's stealing is sinful to her religion, she always asks for God's forgiveness before a caper."

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, I would suggest Sales figures as a useful benchmark for Notablity, but other than marketing fluff describing it as America's premier Christian Manga, I haven't found anything. However, they are distributed by Diamond, so there may be some hard figures out there, and this source indicates <a href="http://comics.ign.com/articles/692/692816p1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://comics.ign.com/articles/692/692816p1.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> some other notability as they are sold in a lot of retailers.

<li><b>Delete</b> I can copy the 50 anime articles send 'em to a vanity book publisher and get it on amazon.com as an anime guide book. Being listed on Amazon is not an indication of notability. One of my pet-peeves with anime and manga articles on Wikipedia is that there is virtually no enforcement of notability guideline for titles. As long as it's not published by a doujin group, it seems, a minor one volume manga can make it as an article. It's certainly not the first time manga has been used to present a religious belief. The Aum Cult, famous for the Sarin gas attack in Tokyo used manga to further their views. And it's certainly not the first christian manga (per this <a href="http://www.animenation.net/news/askjohn.php?id=1376" class="external text" title="http://www.animenation.net/news/askjohn.php?id=1376" rel="nofollow">source</a>.)

<li>I don't care where this page ends up, the point is "Serenity" is not <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a>, and therefore shouldn't be called manga. Manga, in the western slang sense, means comics from Japan. To call "Serenity" a manga is misleading. Just as comics from Japan are called <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a>, comics from China are called <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhua.html" title="Manhua">manhua</a>, comics from Korea are called <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhwa.html" title="Manhwa">manhwa</a>, comics from America (or Canada, or the UK, or Australia etc...) are called <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comics.html" title="Comics">comics</a>, no matter what style they are in. "Serenity" is American-made, therefore it should be labelled a "comic" not a "manga". --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECandy-Panda_1c75.html" title="User:Candy-Panda">Candy-Panda</a> 10:13, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
