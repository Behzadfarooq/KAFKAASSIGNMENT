<p>This is the second VfD for this article. As shown below, the first time there was twice as many votes to delete, but it was kept. This article is a vanity/soapbox/original research by <a href="../../../m/p/l/User%7EMPLX_3a0d.html" title="User:MPLX">User:MPLX</a>. The only Google references to this organization are from Wikipedia or Wikipedia mirrors. The same user who did this article also created a series of questionable articles and inserted original research on several more. The other articles by this person that are currently on VfD are:</p>

<dd>I (MPLX) left Wikipedia some months ago after running into the onslaught of the ill-informed Christian right wing. Although I am not monitoring Wikipedia and do not have any intention of rejoining Wikipedia due to the small cabal of noisy and ill-informed (as opposed to uninformed) people who love deleting stuff, I have been pressed to add this comment due to the sudden interest in deleting a few of the articles that I contributed to. (I have written about many topics.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It would appear that someone has it their head to sever any ties between John Lilburne and the foundation of American law. This led to a constant barrage of negative comments on the Hugo Black article. Now I see that the idea is to claim that "Carolana" is a misspelling of "Carolina" and to go further and claim that the article about Carolana is a hoax. To this end both Dr. Kenneth Brown of the University of Houston and Dr. Eric Gilder of the University of Sibiu have also been smeared as being not noteworthy and at worst as the creators of vanity and even hoax articles. Such rants by the few lunatics who have gained a noisy control over Wikipedia are one reason why I left Wikipedia and why Wikipedia is in danger of becoming the refuge of right-wing idiots.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It would seem that a handful of people are trolling with the intent to delete anything that they may disagree with. I noticed the same approach was used on the subject of copyright law within articles dealing with the subject of recorded music and broadcasting which I also contributed to. Now I see that all broadcasts by 4FWS have been tagged as not worthy because they were on "pirate" radio stations - even though several were on licensed stations. However, everything is being smeared and tarnished to make it appear that everything and anything that I contributed to was either a hoax, a work of vanity or unnoteworthy. I also created the history of the development of the jet fighter, but I have not as yet (and probably won't bother) checked to see if those entries are also being targeted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is unfortunate to say the least because I thought that Wikipedia had merit, but when I discovered that a mere handful of dedicated zealots could take it over and put their own stamp of ideological approval on it - I left.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Before making more claims that Carolana never existed I would suggest that you perform a little serious research. Unfortunately the zealots have decided that they are a jack of all subjects (and master of none), and because they have never heard something before it means that the subject is either a hoax or a vanity creation by someone else. How pathetic for Wikipedia!</dd>

<p>I am nominating this vanity page for deletion because I strongly suspect that it violates several Wikipedia policies, especially:</p>
<ul>
<li>no original research</li>
<li>Wikipedia is not a soapbox</li>
</ul>
<p>A Google search for this so-called institute brings up only 501 hits.</p>
<p>The user who created this page has been attempting to link several pages (like <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miranda_v._Arizona_0d43.html" title="Miranda v. Arizona">Miranda v. Arizona</a>) to this page when such links, if any, should link to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lilburne_f893.html" title="John Lilburne">John Lilburne</a>. Furthermore, as I have already argued at great length on the <a href="../../../j/o/h/Talk%7EJohn_Lilburne_6e19.html" title="Talk:John Lilburne">John Lilburne talk page</a>, Lilburne's impact on modern law may well be of historical importance, but in terms of how modern American criminal law is practiced at present, his impact is minimal when compared to giants like Blackstone, Story, and Ely.</p>

<dd>No, I'm not kidding. Typing in John Lilburne Research Institute into Google brings back only 501 hits, and putting quotes around that (in order to search on the phrase) returns only 9 hits (which all appear to be Wikipedia content, either direct from WP or mirrored).

<li><b>Delete</b>, vanity. This article was written with love and care by an insider who tried to make this non-notable group sound as though it had an actual impact in the world. I would also vote for deletion of Four Freedoms Federation and all the other links these articles contain to non-notable groups and people. This set of inter-linked articles has the veneer of gravity to it, but it's all just a well-crafted set of vanity articles. <a href="../../../t/e/m/User%7ETempshill_7c70.html" title="User:Tempshill">Tempshill</a> 23:03, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> unless you can show me why an organization that essentially went into decline around 1992 should have a lot of hits on Google in 2005? By this reasoning only current organizations can be mentioned. Second, this organization obviously did attract attention back in the period from 1984 to 1992, as referenced by publications and broadcasts. For some reason <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> who describes himself/herself as a "law student" has decided that it is of no consequence that Chief Justice Warren linked Lilburne to Miranda in his opinion of the 1960s, because according to some strange logic here, only cases of the present age are of merit according to this "know-it-all" law student who does not cite books but only various Internet research tools. But not everything is already on the Internet. That's one reason for having Wikipedia! Consequently Leonard W. Levy who won a Pulitzer in 1969 for his work (Origins of the Fifth Amendment) that has Lilburne at its core, is of no avail according to <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a>, who actually went pretty much to the limit by virtually calling Justice Black a senile old git who could not remember the day of the week for adopting Lilburne as his hero. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> dismissed Black's biography as being "what did she know, he was too old". I have not used the Heritage Foundation and many other sources for reference because the article is quite long already. However <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> is making a POV rant by his call for deletion to get rid of something that was news to him/her that did not fit in with something that he/she already knew because on this score <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> has gone to great lengths to explain his/her superior knowledge about all matters relating to law ... without having a clue as to who he/she is attacking. Anyway, its only a historical article, so whatever. However, if this article falls for this silly reason, then just imagine how many other articles totally unrelated to this subject would be immediately struck from Wikipedia using the same criteria used by <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a>. The sad fact about many Internet junkies is that they declared war on traditional libraries and it is within the books of those libraries that the jewels of education are to be found. When the Internet swept in many libraries began dumping and sometimes selling huge quantities of books and anything else that was printed in order to make space for computer screens. Fortunately many collections were rescued, but not all. But what has been created is a world where books are dispised and the computer screen is thought to hold the keys to all truth. In 2005 it does not. <a href="../../../m/p/l/User%7EMPLX_3a0d.html" title="User:MPLX">MPLX/MH</a> 02:02, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>None of the above rant answers the criticism that this odd set of articles is, collectively, a vanity piece that doesn't belong on Wikipedia. By the way, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lilburne_f893.html" title="John Lilburne">John Lilburne</a> is not the subject of the discussion, but John Lilburne Research Institute. <a href="../../../t/e/m/User%7ETempshill_7c70.html" title="User:Tempshill">Tempshill</a> 22:13, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
