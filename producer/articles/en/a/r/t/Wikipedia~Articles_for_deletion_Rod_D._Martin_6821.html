<li><b>Delete</b> This page is filled with claims about Rod Martin that are not substantiated. References to a biography that a politician provides for himself do not count as substantiation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> The anonymous challenger's hot-tempered vitriol, intemperate language, willingness to misrepresent and over-represent "evidence," and persistent attacks against Mr. Martin and persons and organizations related to Mr. Martin demonstrates for the Editors that Mr. Martin must, in fact, be QUITE relevant and of growing influence. Such bile is not wasted on the weak and irrelevant. Mars-Sekhmet 06:45, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Do you actually have any arguments to make that Martin is notable? Your personal attacks ("hot-tempered vitriol, intemperate language, willingness to misrepresent, persistent attacks, bile," etc.) do not show that Martin is notable. Please assume good faith. The fact that there is a difference of opinion about whether Martin is notable also fails to make him notable
<dl>

<dd>PayPal would be enough by itself.

<dd>There is no reliable source that demonstrates that Rod Martin played any management role at Paypal. He is not mentioned in any PayPal histories that I have seen. You need to familiarize yourself with Wikipedia rules on reliable sources. Furthermore, being one of the fifty or so members of the Arlington Group is not inherently noteworthy. You are not seriously contending that all the groups listed on the Arlington Group's website are noteworthy, are you? (TeenMania? New Yorkers for Constitutional Rights?) Finally, he is not the leader of a consequential organization, he is the programmer for a self-promoting website. You seem to continue to avoid the point that no claim that the website makes about its own achievements is independently verifiable. The verbal games you are playing here illustrate why Wikipedia needs to be more than a group of articles that refer to each other; rather, they need to refer to something real and verifiable in the outside world.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Has obviously satisfied <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> and the article has been under repeated attacks by vandals for days. The "special counsel" matter was cited to the publisher of his book (which is itself noteworthy), the publisher's website is clearly a valid source, and the president of the publishing company itself was a central figure at PayPal at the time Martin worked there. There is no reason for this discussion except the initiator's dislike of Martin. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamdmd_7727.html" title="User:Samdmd">Samdmd</a> 03:16, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This assumes things that are not true. The "special counsel" matter, contrary to what you say, is asserted nowhere except on Rod Martin's website! Being the second editor of a book is not inherently notable. Please assume good faith and avoid personal attacks.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Not notable. Many of the claims about Martin are not verifiable, period (CNP membership is secret) and others are unimpressive (Martin having his own website is not notable as such.) The reference to the NFRA might be notable if I had ever seen that the NFRA actually has any influence on politics, in the same way (say) that the Republican Party does. The claim that Martin was a senior executive at Paypal is not substantiable except by Martin's own website. The Martin entry is sheer puffery, a vanity entry set up by Martin or one of his buddies.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.15.59.130 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.15.59.130.html" title="User talk:69.15.59.130">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.15.59.130_1272.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.15.59.130">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>Obviously this anon editor has never been to California, where the NFRA state affiliate is the largest Republican group in the state.<a href="http://californiarepublicanassembly.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://californiarepublicanassembly.com/" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> And while former employees are not noted on the PayPal website, Martin's job title there is listed on the World Ahead Publishing site<a href="http://www.worldaheadpublishing.com/authors/index.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldaheadpublishing.com/authors/index.php" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. As to CNP membership, it sure has a lot of information out about it for a secret group,<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/28/politics/campaign/28conserve.html?ex=1146110400&amp;en=f173712f417dcad1&amp;ei=5070" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/28/politics/campaign/28conserve.html?ex=1146110400&amp;en=f173712f417dcad1&amp;ei=5070" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> and anyway, Wikipedia's rules require good faith acceptance of autobiographical information unless there's a good reason not to accept it. Not liking someone is not a reason. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelosHarriman_4570.html" title="User:DelosHarriman">DelosHarriman</a> 17:19, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Martin's alleged job title is NOT listed on the World Ahead Publishing site that is footnoted. As usual, DelosHarriman is simply making things up and hoping he will not be caught. The membership of CNP is secret; its existence as such is not. As usual, DelosHarriman is confusing two things that are entirely different. Finally, what is your citation for the idea that we are required to accept politicians' claims about themselves and not apply any scrutiny to them? Please provide the wikipedia rule. This has nothing to do with "not liking" Rod Martin, and I do not respect your attempt to divert attention away from the rule that content must be verifiable.</dd>
