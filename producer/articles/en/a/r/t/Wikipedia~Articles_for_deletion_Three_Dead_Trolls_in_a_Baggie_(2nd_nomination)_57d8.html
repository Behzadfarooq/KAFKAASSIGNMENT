<li><b>Unsure</b> I voted keep on this last time, but that was a long time ago and it looks like verifiability has been a lasting problem since then. Google News Archive has some articles, but some are just press-release stuff and others are tangental or simple mentions. I can't really tell one way or another whether it would be enough to support an article or not. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 20:41, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The fact the article hasn't been improved is something to be discussed within the article. The comedy troupe is quite notable in Canada and as noted in the article even had their own TV series. Unless the nominator has some evident to suggest this article is a hoax, I don't see any reason why it shouldn't be kept. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 20:58, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - it'd be a full keep if there was anything resembling a source in there. It desperately needs work on the verification side, but I know these guys were quite the thing in Canada for a while, and the CBC show indicates a high level of notability - if we can find proof of it. (There are plenty of mentions of the show on different pages, but I can't find a knock-em-dead kind of source right now.) <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 21:51, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you Google "three dead trolls in a baggie" CBC and weed through, there's lots of mentions of it in different places, but it was slightly pre-Internet, and it was only five episodes, so it's a challenge to find online unfortunately. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 22:57, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You've either misrepresented or misunderstood the original AFD conclusion; there was a <i>duplicate</i> article on this comedy group at a title with a marginally different spelling (the Wikiserver does not treat "in" and "In" as the same thing in a title). <i>That</i> article was nominated for deletion, and the final result was to <b>redirect</b> the <b>other</b> article <b>to this one</b>. There has <i>never</i> been a proposal to redirect the article anywhere other than its current spelling, and the deletion nomination <b>failed</b> because people felt they <i>were</i> sufficiently notable for an article. At any rate: they <i>are</i> a fairly well-known group in Canadian comedy, and they <i>do</i> get a reasonably good number of Google hits. An unverifiable claim is not, in and of itself, a legitimate reason to delete an entire article if <i>other</i> parts of it <i>are</i> verifiable; it's only a legitimate reason to remove the specifically unverifiable parts. And for what it's worth, <a href="http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/K/htmlK/kidsintheh/kidsintheh.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/K/htmlK/kidsintheh/kidsintheh.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a> <i>does</i> make at least a passing reference to the Trolls as an example of Canadian television comedy; whether that by itself is sufficient to verify the television show claim is certainly debatable, I grant, but the verifiability of the TV show claim is not, in and of itself, a deletion criterion. <b>Keep</b> and <b>cleanup</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 23:18, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> — I misunderstood. I'm not sure why I am supposed to think that this is actually a well-known group; I don't live in Canada, and I certainly have never heard of them. The article reads like any of the other article about a non-notable group on Wikipedia, their web site looks amateurish, and they self-release all of their CDs and DVDs. It just looks like some dudes who made an article about themselves. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> (<big><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisGriswold_df5d.html" title="User talk:ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:red">☎</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ChrisGriswold_d1f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:black">☓</span></a></big>) 00:48, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> --- being a stub isn't itself a valid reason for removal, but a reason for expansion.

<dd>There are a ton of minor comedy groups on Wikipedia, and most of them have articles that look and read very similarly to this one. Notable group articles tend to explain the notability right in the intro, for example, rather than giving a rundown of the membership changes.I did look for information, but as I said, I did not dig too deeply because the article had not had sources for so long, despite editors' having worked on it. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> (<big><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisGriswold_df5d.html" title="User talk:ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:red">☎</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ChrisGriswold_d1f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:black">☓</span></a></big>) 10:11, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
