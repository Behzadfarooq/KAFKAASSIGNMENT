<p>This article makes no sense to me.

<li><b>Comment</b>. While I agree with Aleph4, I think that first the author of the article should have been contacted to see whether this issue can be cleared up. I copied the comment to Talk:Algebraical quantity, <a href="../../../2/1/9/User_talk%7E219.64.184.191.html" title="User talk:219.64.184.191">User talk:219.64.184.191</a>, and <a href="../../../2/1/9/User_talk%7E219.64.184.180.html" title="User talk:219.64.184.180">User talk:219.64.184.180</a>. The same author has written the related articles <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compound_expression.html" title="Compound expression">compound expression</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_expression.html" title="Simple expression">simple expression</a>, and <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinomial.html" title="Trinomial">trinomial</a>; it seems like he/she is trying to build up a classification of mathematical expressions. I first want to see whether we can establish contact with the author; if not, I think the article (and the other I mentioned) can be deleted. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 12:57, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. The article is not clearly nonsense, but it seems to give a rather narrow definition of an idea that could admit a much broader one, and it is not so clear that the concept of "algebraical quantity" is really needed. "Everyone" needs to know what <i>terms</i> are (things that get added or subtracted) and what <i>factors</i> are (things that get multiplied) and what polynomials and rational functions and various other sorts of expressions are, but I don't see any clear need for this concept. The word "algebraical", as opposed to "algebraic", seems archaic, and I suspect it came from a somewhat out-of-date book — maybe published in 1840 or so? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 01:47, 16 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Comment</b> I find <a href="http://www.learningmatters.co.uk/education/a_to_z/maths/l.html" class="external text" title="http://www.learningmatters.co.uk/education/a_to_z/maths/l.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>: "like terms" are defined as "Multiples of the same algebraic quantity. Hence if terms are not of the same algebraic quantity they are unlike terms." For example, n, 2n, 0.5n, 4n, are like terms and thus presumably are "of the same algebraic quantity" while 2, n, n<sup>2</sup> and n<sup>3</sup> are unlike terms and presumably of "different algebraic quantity." In other words, "algebraic quantity" is the answer to the question "what is it that is 'alike' between 'like terms?'" This resonates with me, because I think that in physics—specifically, in the context of units, dimensions, and metrology—"quantity" has a similar meaning. Feet and inches express the same "quantity", namely length, while feet and acres do not. I think. I could have that garbled. So, ok... my vote is...</s></li>
<li><s><b>Mark for cleanup and move to Algebraic quantity.</b> Put a note on the Talk page linking to this discussion. If nobody can make anything sensible out of it after a few months, nominate it for deletion again. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:24, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</s></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> and replace by redirect to <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expression_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Expression (mathematics)">Expression (mathematics)</a>. This seems preferable to the solution proposed by Dpbsmith which would leave an unintelligible article on Wikipedia for months; a merge is not possible since I would not know what to merge. It seems to me that the website found by Dpbsmith means something else by <i>algebraic quantity</i> than the author of the article, who would presumably consider n and 2n as different algebraic quantities. The definition of mathematical expressions and its representation is crucially important in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_algebra.html" title="Computer algebra">computer algebra</a> (and probably also in other disciplines that I'm less familiar with like logic), and there is an article waiting to be written here, but it should not be called algebraic quantity or <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebraical_quantity.html" title="Algebraical quantity">algebraical quantity</a>. By the way, there are also articles on <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebraic_function.html" title="Algebraic function">algebraic function</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebraic_number.html" title="Algebraic number">algebraic number</a>; both seem quite different from what the author had in mind. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 22:59, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, but only because its poorly written.

Jitse's sugesstion is good, except that <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expression_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Expression (mathematics)">expression (mathematics)</a> is too high-brow.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I agree that <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expression_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Expression (mathematics)">Expression (mathematics)</a> is the best place for the concept the author seems to be getting at. I think it is actually similar to the concept used on the website mentioned - it wasn't saying that terms such as n and 2n were "of the same algebraic quantity", but that they were both (scalar) multiples of the same algebraic quantity n. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> 12:49, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
