<li>We are a burgeoning poetic movement, soon to be as important as any that ever existed. I'm not sure how something can become "notable", but we've already covered a large area of North America, Australia and Europe with these broadsides. That's pretty dang notable. We are a real entity, a revolution in publishing and poetry, and since we are "underground" and do this under the cloak of subversiveness, we will not have any "non-trivial coverage in independent reliable sources". At least not yet. Delete us if you want. that's fine. but, we will be back. And, when you venture to your local bookstore (assuming you read books) and find one of our broadsides, will we then be legitimized? will we then be notable? -- The GPP. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.143.187.254 (<a href="../../../2/0/9/User_talk%7E209.143.187.254.html" title="User talk:209.143.187.254">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.143.187.254_a5e4.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.143.187.254">contribs</a>).</small>

<p>I'd argue against the deletion of this article. The group consists of a number of notable and prolific underground poets from Luis Berriozabal, Miles J Bell, christopher cunningham and others who are published widely on the net and in the small presses. Google the names of the members and you'll get a lot more than 39 hits. I'd also argue that Google isn't a good standard to judge whether a movement is 'notable.' A large number of poets are not internet savvy. Particularly because underground literature, which is a growing movement, works in direct opposition to traditional mainstream methods, you aren't going to find a lot of media coverage in the easy to find places like Google or newspapers. Is Wikipedia just a mirror of what Google thinks is important? God help us if so. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 142.59.195.166 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_142.59.195.166_a83f.html" title="Special:Contributions/142.59.195.166">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I just checked the site and many members are notable in the small press poetry world. Some of the publishers involved have books exibited in the Museum of Modern Art and the Getty. Some of the poets are very widely read and published by some big New York poublishing houses. Look at the site and google the names. I say to let them stay. We don't want the deletion of them to be a footnote in the future.

brother, if that sarcasm was rude, and NOT civil, then we're in a world of hurt as a society. as for the smug jab; it was both, but I assume you knew that. the use of the word "theoretically" is sarcastic (and rude) and just as smug as anything i said...but I assume you knew that (again). LitLives is right. Gold help us. as for us not doing the organization any favors, what does that mean? hmmm.... there's no arguing against the deletion of this article with smug, sarcastic, rude people who don't even know (or acknowledge) when they are being smug, sarcastic and rude. theoretically, they should know the difference. delete it, already.

<dd>But it's so much fun to insult wikipedia! It's easy to pick apart, because at its core it's just a bunch of geeks in an old-fashioned usenet-style argument wankfest. Nothing important is being done here, unless you consider disinformation important. I do in many ways, so what wikipedia has become is amusing to me, but no one should take the entries here seriously. Anyone could go poke around for five minutes and find a dozen inaccuracies, but we all know that.</dd>

<dd>What's funny about the wikipedia cult's benchmark for what is "notable" is that the thing itself is only marginally notable. I know that many of you believe that you are doing Good Work, but you are delusional. You aren't editors - that's an insult to real editors - you have simply memorized a lot of someone else's rules, and you use your access to a computer to make sure a bunch of other people follow them. This is an anthill, and you are worker ants. When you drop dead the other ants will just eat you and continue marching.</dd>

<p>Irish Guy, With all respect, What you like and don't like does not matter. We do not need your support and would not welcome you into the group. We are CREATORS, not DESTROYERS. It seems that your big issue is proving that others are not "legitimate" while subverting the very same Encyclopaedia by changing history to show that Ireland is not part of the British Isles. Why, because YOU hate the British. That is territory for a blog, but a serious encyclopaedia. Can the information in this encyclopaedia be trusted as accurate? Well, that all depends on what "editor" changed it last to show his point of view is notw accurate. Not really an encyclopaedia in the real sense of the word. Also, the blog was posted when we were attempting to save the "article". We leave it there for our MANY, MANY members to see as an example of why we are doing this. Also, it will be nice when Wikipaedia cannot ignore the movement and they are forced to recognise it. It is kept up as history. We are a serious movement and are notable regardless of what "editors" at Wikipaedia can understand or not. Deletion af a one page "article" cannot change that.

<li>Wikipedia should consider enlisting persons with some sort of expertise in the subject matter of the article when assessing the significance of that article if there is any grey area in determining its "significance". In my own experience, one of the artist's that I published wrote an article about my small artist's press for Wikipedia. It was subsequently deleted, as it was seen as having been made solely to publicize that artist's efforts (which, perhaps, it was, as I can't know his motives). What I found very aggravating was that an argument over my press' "significance" became part of the Wikipedia record, when I certainly didn't ask for any such critique and had nothing to do with Wikipedia in the first place. In assessing this "significance", it seemed that the jurors' only understanding of the word "press" was a large commercial publisher. It seemed that noone who was responsible for making this decision knew anything about printmaking, the fine arts press, the small press, or any other relevant subject relative to the decision. Anyway, my point being, that to use a uniform yardstick for "significance", especially in areas related to the arts, wielded by people with little understanding of the various venues, means of distribution, and history of practitioners within those arts, will eliminate anything that is at all contemporary from Wikipedia. Only the most corporate, mass-produced, and ultimately insignificant products of contemporary culture will find homes here, because that's what will be most prominently displayed in Google. Polling a few folks who have no relation to the project, yet have some expertise concerning the small press and the poets involved, as to the significance of this particular movement would be the most sensible thing you could do.

<li>IrishGuy, your "forum" example is a prime indicator of how you so-called "editors" work: you make a decision based on INCOMPLETE information. the forum at the site is NO indicator of the movement's size; just look at our <b>2 month old</b> MEMBERSHIP RANKS for that info: 70 members. which is it? so you choose the evidence that supports your frail claim of NON NOTABLE and expect us to agree? plus, if you have any inclination, you can google some of the member's NAMES and find out exactly how notable we actually are. but you won't. and I stand by my ACCURATE assertion that you are a MST3K geek. check out my recent post at the blog where I compare you to the geek on the UK OFFICE. funny stuff. although I myself enjoy tom servo and crew on occasion..remember, we are about uniting artists and thinking, feeling people who seek a larger vision in re: art, poetry and human connections. so far you've evidenced none of these traits in your stubborn refusals, my rule monkey friend...&lt;---not rude, amused, see? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.215.167.172 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.215.167.172_b857.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.215.167.172">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>Of course Marc is right. And Irish Guy, I said that you had a slanted point of veiw towards the British as I have read many of your posts. You may not have said that you HATE them, but it is clear that you do. You also said that as you have more contact with GPP members, the less you are "attracted" to us (see your post above.) As far as the members that called you names, that was not me. I always sign my posts with my IP or my name. Finally, The GPP was started 60 days ago with 10 memebrs, we now have over 70. Some of those names are not only big names in the small press, but well known actors, Media personalities, etc. One of our members is an actor who is listed on your very site. The fact is that we do not need to make our membership roles open to Wikipedia to prove that we are an important organization. If there was an "Editor" from Wikipedia that was familiar with this type of poetry, you would have heard of us.</p>
<p>Finally, as marc stated, you do not have the knowledge to know what we are doing. That is not an attack, just a fact. Just like I would have a hard time judging who is a well known Irish majician and who is not. There are ewperts in that field who know who is and who is not. The point is that I would not assume to tell others that a personality or entry was not significant BECAUSE I DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT. Ask ANYONE in the small press poetry scene AROUND the globe and they know who we are. They know our movement, and they know many of the individual members. Many of our members are often published writers and are known throughout the world. By the way, please don't associate all comments from all members as mine and I won't associate all comments from other editors as from you.

<p>To restate the request.... Please delete the page. We are not interested in being included in the Wiki project. I can safely way, Irish Guy, that I know that you do NOT get small press poetry. You may pretend that you do, but if you did, you would know who we were. The fact that you do not and rely on Google to see who we are, means that you do not know anything about the subject that you are claiming to want to control. That is all that need be said. I know that your type likes to argue. Frnakly, it has become very boring to me. I'll end this by saying that while you are making enemies, I'l be printing poetry and trying to CREATE. Again, in case youdid not get the point. Tell the folks at Wikidia to delete us. We do not need your website to be a movement that is notable and it probably works against us even being listed in a such a website.

<dd>I didn't put this up for AfD. I placed the importance tag on the article which you removed. That caused it to go to AfD. The guidelines state that the article must illustrate verifiable notability <i>within the article</i>. Hence, my placing the tag on the article for the authors to provide this information. That never happened. That means either your organization doesn't care enough, or there is no verifiable information to add. That is why my original statement in this AfD was: <i>importance tag was removed without any sign of notability being given within the article.</i> No, you cannot safely say anything about me as you don't actually <i>know</i> anything about me. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 21:37, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whoever wants to read this, I'm not sure who blanked it, but it was not me. Since you (IrishGuy)kept telling us that we were not notable enough to have an "article" on your "website", we decided that it was not worth it to argue with you and beg you to be on a site that would do us no good anyway. So, I guess one of the other members did it. We don't need the red tape. If Wiki decides that they want to have us listed, they know where we are.... In the mean time, we will subvert the corporate bookstores with fine literture and grow at a FAST rate as has happened in the last 60 days. Funny thing is that the 'bots' noticed that the article was deleted and restored it. Please, anyone in the GPP, let's let them delete it. I could care less if they remove it, but I say that we should let them remove it. It would really be funny if Wikipedia decided that IrishGuy was wrong and ignred his recommendation to remove us.

<p>Also to Wikipedia, I'm not very computer literate, but I see 387 google hits under "guerilla poetics project". These are references to our work from websites (many are NOT members) from all over the world. They know of the movement and the organization and are talking about what we have done and continue to do. If you google some of our member's names, you willl see tens of thousands of references, including some that have articles on your very site. "S.A. Griffin" is only one example. Google "justin.barrett", "Christopher Cunningham", "Hosho McCreesh", "C. Allen Rearick", "Glenn W. Cooper", "Bottle of Smoke Press" and you will see we are not expecting Wikipedia to be a crystal ball. You should see that these names are some of the biggest names in the small press poetry scene, bar none. I can give 30 or 40 morre names that would qualify, but I have only listed a few that are involved with this literary movement. All best,Bill/GPPBospress 21:20, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>SO IrishGuy, I guess that you don't trust your fellow "editor" Guy to report the links correctly? What wold make you think that he is wrong? Or are you just making the statement as a point of argument? The fact that you said "There is no reason at all to assume that 15 more links showed up on a couple of days." just shows that you have an axe to grind and everyone is wrong, BUT you. What would the original "editor" GUY have to gain by giving false information.

<p>FOR THE RECORD.... WIKIPEDIA... PLEASE REMOVE THE "ARTICLE". WE ARE FAR TOO IMPORTANT TO FIGHT WITH CLOSE MINDED LITTLE "EDITORS" WITH AN AXE TO GRIND. Thanks and have a great day! Bill/GPPBospress 22:47, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>IG, It is not a personal attack. Just a truth. Hey, we should start a Wikipage on you... ha! Again, you made your "argument" now is the time to bother someone else. We have asked how many times to remove the page and even tried to do it ourselves. Wikipedia 's "bots" put it back. You apparently care more about this issue than we do. This is NOT reverse psychology. We ave asked, over and over "REMOVE THE PAGE", "REMOVE THE ARTICLE"... What will it take? Bill/GPP</p>

<dd>For someone who claims to be a poet, you have an extremely tenuous grasp of the English language. Calling me <i>a sad, paranoid, little man</i> is a <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTACK_3b8e.html" title="WP:ATTACK">personal attack</a> in every single sense of the term. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 23:20, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>IrishGuy, I never claimed to be a poet and am not a poet.... There you go making assumptions without any facts. Where was it again, that I claimed to be a poet? I thought so... how very, very sad... Bill/GPPBospress 23:40, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Where? I don't know...maybe <a href="http://www.bospress.net/authors.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bospress.net/authors.html" rel="nofollow">the author page</a> of your site. Why be listed as an author if you don't write? <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 23:50, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>IG, You are sad and hopeless. "Poets, Publishers &amp; Operatives." Where do you see MY NAME listed as a poet? I am a publisher. Published some of the biggest names in Poetry in the last 50 years.... Again, you made assumptions. Maybe you should go back to writing about "magicians". ha..... Bill/GPP/PUBLISHER/PRINTER.Bospress 01:08, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>So when a name is listed under the <b>author</b> page it is an assumption to call that person an author? Frankly, if you aren't an author than it is your own fault for putting your name on the author page, not mine for calling you an author. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 01:30, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>IG, 1) You called me a "poet", not an author. 2) You don't know my last name. If you did, you would see that I am not listed as an author, either. 3) There is not a page that lists "authors". There IS a "Poets" page, and I am not listed on that one either. You really are sad when you grasp at straws in a feeble attempt to prove to ANYONE that you are somehow right. I'll YOU a favor and I wuill stom embarassing you in front of all of your Wiki-Friends. I will not respond to your inane posts. You are done. Argue with yourself. Argue with the Brits, Argue with your boss. I have more important things to do that to argue with someone so ignorant. Again, you can say whatever you want, but I will not reply. I KNOW that you cannot let it go and you MUST reply, but I will not read it. Hey, maybe you want to start a page on me? I'm like one of those "magicians" that you write about. Watch this... Poof. You're meaningless! Smooches... Bill/GPP (Not a Poet), (Not an Author). p.s. When are your wiki-friends going to remove the "article? I'm waiting.... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bospress (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bospress_dc09.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bospress">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Actually, your name <i>is</i> listed on the author page. Continue to deny all you want, I really couldn't care less. Your posts have grown pettier and more fueled with inane personal attacks.

<dd>Why are <i>you</i> here? Do you post incessantly on every "article for deletion" that you see, or just this one? Will you answer this question with yet another question?</dd>

<dd>Allow me to answer for you, since you <i>will</i> answer with a question. The reason you are here is because it's the most excitement you've had for as far back as you can remember. That in and of itself isn't necessarily sad, but it does make me a wee bit weepy, so maybe I can help. We have members in Ireland, if you'd like, I can see if it's possible to scrounge up a date for you. You know, so you'll have something to do other than refresh this page every 30 seconds.</dd>
