<p>This is article total junk. The periodic table in chinese?!? We can't have articles about how everything looks in diffrent languages, especialy when there isn't much diffrence. I suppose if we keep this we should have the periodic table in German, Spanish, Hebrew, Arabic and every other language too. And if we start making articles about how things look in Chinese then this would be the tip of the iceberg. Come on. This version of wikipedia is in English. This article should go on the chinese wikipedia. (and probably already is.) <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobyk777_9e17.html" title="User:Tobyk777">Tobyk777</a> 00:11, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a well written article, aimed at the english reader; it's interesting (at least, I found it so).

<dd><b>Comment</b>: If Wikipedia had articles on how <i>anything</i> looks in Chinese, we'd melt their servers. The bit about the fact that they use single characters is interesting, but I don't think the periodic table in itself holds any attraction for the average bored reader. If they are looking for the periodic table, in Chinese, they must be able to read Chinese, and hence they are better off at the Chinese Wikipedia, where the information is, no doubt, more complete. Perhaps <b>merge</b> the historical information with <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_and_technology_in_China_4995.html" title="Science and technology in China">Science and technology in China</a>, which, on another note, is an article that could do with some work. <sup><a href="../../../r/i/a/User_talk%7ERiana_dzasta_b0bf.html" title="User talk:Riana dzasta">T</a></sup><a href="../../../r/i/a/User%7ERiana_dzasta_07ef.html" title="User:Riana dzasta">riana</a><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Riana_dzasta_06fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Riana dzasta">C</a></sub> 01:19, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I originally voted delete, but now that I've chewed on it for a while, it really is pretty interesting (read:notable) how they represent chemical symbols in Chinese characters.

<li><b>Merge</b> as per riana.

<li><b>Comment</b>: that only addresses more articles on periodic tables. A lot of things are likely to be difficult to translate, such as Macbeth into Navajo or the translation of rhyming poetry into an unrelated language while keeping the rhymes. Also, some editors don't make those kinds of distinctions. They will just say that the Chinese periodic table exists, so one in their language should exist. They may leave out the part about the Chinese periodic table being unusual through ignorance or to help their case.

<li><b>Oppose</b> this proposal: for one you can't copy and paste individual characters for an image, nor can they be modified.

<li>What if each symbol was an image as suggested, but in the image description (on its image page) the text form of the symbol was there? Or the textual form of the symbol was underneath each image in the tabel. It strikes me that the Chinese periodic tble could probobly be found elsewhere, so the wikipedia version should be for interest/encyclopedic sake to illustrate the text.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The order and arrangement of the elements in the Chinese periodic table is the same as that in any other language. The only difference is that they use different symbols for the elements rather than the element abbreviations used in Roman characters.

Maybe a very slight merge into <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periodic_table.html" title="Periodic table">Periodic table</a> would be appropriate to incorporate the following sentence: "All languages use the same Roman-alphabet symbols for the elements except for Chinese." <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 19:18, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article is not a translation, it's <i>about</i> the translation.

<li><b>Merge</b> Reading through the votes here, I think the issue is not with the <i>information</i>, but with the <i>format</i>. The first part of the article is interesting information, and should probably be in either <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periodic_table.html" title="Periodic table">periodic table</a> or <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_and_technology_in_China_4995.html" title="Science and technology in China">Science and technology in China</a>, like riana suggested. The <i>information</i> in the table (the chinese character used for each element) is good information, but it is also true that Wikipedia is not a translation service. However, what about the Wiktionary? That sort of information should be in their listings, and I know that at least some of it is already. However, the <i>format</i> of the table isn't really useful to an English speaker. Think in terms of usage: an English speaker might run across an element written in Chinese, and want to know what it is in English. Or, the reverse: they may simply want to know what the Chinese character is for an element. In either case, looking at that table probably isn't going to help them, unless they also happen to know the atomic number of the element they want to look up. If they want to figure this information out, they're going to search for the element or the character on the Wikipedia, or hopefully the Wiktionary. The only use I see for the table is if they have a image of the character (rather than text they can copy and paste), don't know how to type it, and feel like looking through rows and rows of similar characters for an exact match. So, save the information, scrap the table. -- <a href="../../../r/a/b/User%7ERablari_Dash_6f98.html" title="User:Rablari Dash">Rablari Dash</a> 07:56, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's interesting to have the table there. It adds significantly to the feeling of completeness to the article from an aesthetic standpoint. Furthermore, I realize that Wikipedia is not a translation service, but the table is not hurting anything. This is a case where a little bit of leniency in terms of policy application is necessary. From a perfectly legalistic standpoint, should we get rid of the table? yes. But what is best for Wikipedia? Keep it. Now as far as your proposal to merge, I simply cannot imagine this large, cumbersome article fitting into <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periodic_table.html" title="Periodic table">Periodic table</a>.
