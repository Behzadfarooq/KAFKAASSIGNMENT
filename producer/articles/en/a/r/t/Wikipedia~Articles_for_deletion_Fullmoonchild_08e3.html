<p>This band was marked for speedy deletion as a non-notable band, but the article's author makes an assertion of notability on the talk page (and there are a few assertions of possible notability in the article text), so I have moved it here to AFD. â€”<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleared_as_filed_a7db.html" title="User:Cleared as filed">Cleared as filed.</a> 12:56, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I did some research on this last night, and they seem notable enough so that speedy delete is perhaps too harsh. However, IconDevelopment (the label they recently signed with) doesn't seem to be important enough to count as <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria, and they don't really meet any of the other requirements, unless they're popular enough to merit enough demand for an article. <font face="futura"><a href="../../../s/n/u/User%7ESnurks_9a10.html" title="User:Snurks">Snurks</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/n/u/User_talk%7ESnurks_2400.html" title="User talk:Snurks">T</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snurks_439e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snurks">C</a></sup></small></font> 21:36, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - 'Icon Development' is starting up as a label/distributor/promoting agency, and does not have many noticeable bands in their "portfolio". That doesn't change the fact that the band is known in the "underground" Metal scene, and all over the world, especially in Europe.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're striving to get more "successful" and I think our hard work will compensate in a few years. We hope that our new EP will help on making us more "notable". And again, if u compare FMC to Hand Fated (in their "website" no news since 2000), why r they more noticeable? Why does HF have a Wiki and FMC doesn't? It seems to me that it's not fair...And btw, Moonspell is great, I love them, but not the only Heavy Metal band in Portugal...</p>
<p>Tnx to Snurks for the support also. Cheers!</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, nn, as per original speedy tagging. ThunderDrum did some good work on the article (much better than a simple vanity editor), but <i>known all over the world, especially in Europe</i> is still too vague to assert notability, unfortunately. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchutz_72ef.html" title="User:Schutz">Schutz</a> 23:23, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Ok, I agree we aren't that notable, but can someone explain to me where's the notability in the band Hand Fated? And they r at Wiki since April 2005...</li>
</ul>
<p>So why their article is not purposed for delete also? I just wanna a fair chance and equal rights, if someone could explain why HF is more notable than FMC I would appreciate and repent (lol)... I've done my best to assert our notability, I realize it's not enough...I understand what u do here in Wiki, I honestly do understand that we r not notable enough to be in a Enciclopedia, but I found other band even less notable (IMO) than us...and seems no one cares about their "notability", and even I that live near the place were they (suposedly) play, never heard of them before...and I get around in music since 1993/4 I've seen also some 'stubs' and vanity articles and I've tried not to do one... Cheers! --ThunderDrum 10:47, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. According to the article the band is notable enough. Unfortunately, article seems to have been created and maintained by a member of the band, so it's nothing but a serious <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> violation. ThunderDrum, think of it this way: your band is notable enough when someone else writes the article. Writing one yourself is the worst you can do. (By the way, next time you see less-notable bands, nominate them for deletion. Just because an article exists, doesn't mean it's worth it.) -- Parasti 22:47, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Parasti u r absolutely correct, I understand your POV...</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll wait until someone writes it again...Cheers! --ThunderDrum 19:12, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
