<p>Already been up for deletion twice before, but both times consensus was hard to reach because of the post-Katrina immediacy of the article. To quote one user from the previous votes, "Millions of people lose loved ones in tragic circumstances every day. The fact that a TV crew happen to stumble upon Mr. Jackson does not make him notable... If Jackson gains notability, then we can add an article." Eight months later, with the benefit of hindsight, I'm not sure how Jackson is any different than the hundreds of other victims interviewed by the media. Unless he's done something of note that hasn't been covered, this is more memorial than article. <s><b>Delete.</b></s> <a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass">Tijuana Brass</a> 00:15, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>comment.</b> You still do not establish notability. His story was very briefly broadcast worldwide, yes, but only through media outlets which use emotional stories to raise their ratings. What happened to him is unfortunate but that does not establish his notability. The media exploited his bad fortune. He is nothing more than a passing and media figure with nothing to show for it. Wikipedia is not a place for articles on victims of tragedies. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 02:45, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think that Strothra meant any disrespect by that, he was just trying to make a point. Saying that Jackson was "the human face of the Katrina tragedy for millions of people" is, well, hardcore POV. Speaking out of personal experience, I don't remember the guy at all outside of Wikipedia, and I was glued to a television for weeks after the hurricane, keeping up with it. He's one of the thousands of faces of victims of the storms, but not particularly notable. Memorials are good and well, but Wikipedia isn't for that. <a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass">Tijuana Brass</a> 03:39, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I apologize if you thought I was attacking you. That was not my intention. I was simply attempting to point out that the media exploit many individuals for their tragedies and they have nothing to show for it. This individual is no different than the many who have come before him. The mass public forgets these individuals easily and grow tired of seeing these tragedies on TV and so the cameras move on to the next big story and the money stops flowing into these disaster areas when they no longer recieve widespread attention. It's an unfortunate truth about society and there are quite a few studies on this trend. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 05:35, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Sorry, but I completely disagree with that statement and I wonder to what extent you are familiar with the case. Klinghoffer's notoriety has nothing at all to do with the opera. He has been a symbol of the inhumanity of terrorism for over 20 years.

<dd>Kinghoffer was merely one victim of "terrorism" and is not different from any other victim. His story was simply exploited by others as is the case here. This fact in itself does not make him or this guy especially notable. And I would argue that your usage of individuals serving as "symbols" is POV. Symbols for who exactly? How are they a symbol? What does it mean that they are a symbol? Does the fact that they are a symbol change anything? It's a loaded term. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 15:31, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You make decent points but I do not hold them as wholly valid as establishing the notability of this alleged symbol. I simply do not believe that he is a "symbol." My deletion vote stands.

<li>That's fine. Note that I never tried to get you or anyone else to change votes. I merely made a comment with my initial Keep vote. When you boil it down, my personal view is that Mr. Jackson for reasons completely out of his control is a sort of symbol of all the victims of Katrina, almost none of whom will ever get an article here. I guess I agree with CNN, which featured Hardy Jackson prominently in their "quarter century of newsmakers" round-up <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/12/02/cnn25.top25.tan/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/12/02/cnn25.top25.tan/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. If people want to see him as just some guy who watched his wife get swept away by the flood waters from the roof of his house, that's fine with me too. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 18:29, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

Leo Frank and Emmett Till have had more <b>books</b> written about them than this Jackson fellow has Google hits. Laci Peterson remains in the tabloids today, and will no doubt do so for quite some time to come ... and so on and so forth.

<dd>You make a good point, but keep in mind that Wikipedia is not necessarily supposed to be an encyclopedic reflection of popular culture.

<dd>How are you judging the fame of the hurricane victims? The victims as a group are famous. There were famous actors and senators who held property that was destroyed and thus they are victims. This individual is hardly "famous". Still, the vote is about notability and not fame. This individual has not even met the standards of notability. He did not impact the tragedy in any way and is not unique from the other thousands of victims. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 15:48, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

If Hardy had fleeting notablity at the time, it's certainly dissipated. In fact, it appears that he fell out of the public eye within a couple weeks of Katrina; there are only scant stories about him with a dateline later than mid-September. - <a href="../../../r/y/n/User%7ERynne_b8d8.html" title="User:Rynne">Rynne</a> 18:30, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
