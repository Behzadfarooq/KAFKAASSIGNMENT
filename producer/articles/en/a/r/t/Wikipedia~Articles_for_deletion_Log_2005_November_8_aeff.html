<p>Either extremely nonnotable or hoax... Google cannot find any mention of this person or his supposed short story, idea that it might be a pen name of Bram Stoker doesn;t go with the fact that a photo is presented, photo of this individual has false source information listed (link there for origin of photo goes to someone else entirely), claim of being Jack the Ripper means he'd be listed on one of the comprehensive lists of 200+ suspects that exist, and he doesn't. This is either not real or bizarre original research on a nonnotable figure, but I'm going for hoax.

</li>
<li><b>Speedy delete</b>: I was about to go ahead and delete it. If you want addresses, use the Yellow Pages. The page is a dab, but it does not disambiguate <i>articles,</i> which is what dab pages are for. Further, having the "information" that there are two schools with the name is utterly useless. If we really, really, really want to make sure that someone can find out that there are schools by that name, put the information in the "Schools of Ottowa" article. If there isn't one, make one, but don't argue that broken pointers to non-existent places are "content." <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:44, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Disambiguation pages with no existing articles have always been accepted, and we have many thousands of them. There is no obligation for disambig pages to have content, because they are not articles. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 16:10, 8 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I nominated it for speedy deletion, and SimonP just removed the tag. I firmly believe this should be speedily deleted, as should any and all other dab pages that disambiguate between nothing, and nothing (i.e., pointless). Geogre put it better than me. Failing this, my vote is <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Proto_c67f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Proto">c</a></small> 16:14, 8 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>These have always been standard practice. A disambig is not an article, it is a technical page that has no need for content. Why wait for one of the articles to be created, then have to move it, and disambiguate all the incoming links. The red links should not be pointing to the same place, even if that place doesn't contain an article. Over the years I've literally created hundreds of these pages, and they have never before been deleted. The various missing encyclopedia articles projects in particular tend to generate hundreds of these pages. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 16:22, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't think a dab page with redlinks warrants an AfD (there are plenty of geographical dab pages. many of which contain nothing but redlinks). I think such dab pages simply reflect a request to have pages created about those subjects, and also provide a useful service by having properly-titled pages ready for editing. However, the point is moot in this case since the dab page now contains no redlinks. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindmatrix_3c6f.html" title="User:Mindmatrix">Mindmatrix</a> 20:08, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

His own stat counters, as he informs me, have counted on the arcade page he has recorded 10,000 unique visits a day, in contrast to the Alexa rank. As for his involvement in flamewars, that is a political issue, not to be judged by his worthiness as a wikipedia article.

<p>I'm sure everyone in here is familiar with what non-notable is since I'm the only one here who runs a website that exceeds the ten thousand mark on a daily basis. Since no one here is able to quit college because of earning money from a website, no wonder everyone is so familiar with what non-notable is. And considering Alexa is rated malicious spyware by Norton and Spybot, I'm not exactly sure what such a low-standard is being used on Wikipedia. Oh yes, this is Andkon himself.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Not able to quit college? Andkon, I think a lot of your arguments are pretty fair and you raise some good points. However, you are a little presumptive in this opinion re: college and notability. Believe me, Wikipedia users come from all backgrounds: different age groups, different countries, different sexes, different races and, needless to say, differing socio-economic groups. We don't all need to run websites such as yours in order to be able to quit college and, in any case, some of us left "college" a long time ago! <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 11:36, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Who ever set this up for delete has issues.Andkon is a site with nearly 700 arcade games all free and without pop-ups or anything malcious. Not only that it features a webcomic that as spanned over 100 issues and is constantly in updation. To say this site is insginificant is quite ignorant. This is site is so popular that the author of it can actually make a living off of it out of ad revenue alone. If this site where to actually be deleted you would also need to delete almost every other article entry that is about a website. This article in fact, was not even done by Andras, but by a friend. Every single reason to delete this site is unfounded and/or horrbly incorrect. This is a joke and stains what Wiki really is. <a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDrunkCat_f44b.html" title="User:DrunkCat">DrunkCat</a> 18:02, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: Delete every article about a website, too, for that matter. WP is not a web guide. The criterion for inclusion is not "pays its way," but, instead, "is much discussed by second and third hand parties, has a large effect on the world around it." It may be pleasant, fun, well done, etc., and yet it is just another website for all of that. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:35, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> there seems to be some new-to-wikipedia people here and that's fine. Wikipedia is not just your private webhost, the only articles that are supposed to be here are ones which are notable. A good guideline of what that means is <a href="../../../w/e/b/Wikipedia%7EWebsites_fbda.html" title="Wikipedia:Websites">Wikipedia:Websites</a>, which clearly this site does not pass. 10,000 hits a day is about enough for a 200,000 rank on Alexa... based on experience (2 million daily pageviews is about a rank of 1,500 for example). Ultimately there are millions of sites as popular as this one. Sorry. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 19:04, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<hr />
<p>Delete this from Wikipedia. This is not a 'best of the web' site. If it was, Ankon.com would not feature.</p>
<hr />
<p>No, marsh... closer to 500,000 "hits" per day. Please consult <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics#Web_Analytics_Concepts" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics#Web_Analytics_Concepts" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics#Web_Analytics_Concepts</a></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: This site is beneficial to a lot of people. Considering he gets hundreds of thousands of page hits, its a unique site.

<ul>
<li><b>Non-Notable?</b> Hey, I have an idea, lets be mean and ignore the <b>facts</b> and label this article as non-notable despite Andkon having an arcade with over 700 games <b>with no pop-ads or malcious coding</b> and having enough unique hits to gain a living from the money of ad revenue alone.

<li>I'm glad people enjoy the site, and kudos to the builders for making something that people like. But mildly successful businesses are not automatically notable; otherwise we'll have to list every sandwich shop and convenience story in the country. To change my vote, you'll need to come up with press clippings, <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webby_Awards_f079.html" title="Webby Awards">Webby</a> nominations, or an Alexa ranking two orders of magnitude higher. A more collegial and reasonable tone from pro-keep partisans would be nice, too. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 20:35, 8 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Webby Awards is nothing but a get-rich scheme. Registration to be considered costs money and can be done by the website's owner. It's lovely see WP using spyware and get-rich schemes as standards. The corporate run media can't be trusted to report correctly on an elementary school science fair, so unfortunately I haven't been able to buy my way into newspapers through PR firms. Andkon 20:52, 8 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry, but I find the proposed alternative standard (that the site makes money and has a few ardent fans) unpersuasive and unverifiable. Best of luck in becoming notable, but so far I'm going by <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, Google's count of incoming links, and the other markers I mentioned. The world may not be properly honoring your talent and effort, but Wikipedia's not the place to fix that. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 21:39, 8 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So why is a completely unremarkable place with five people staying while Andkon is out? 209.184.165.20 22:35, 8 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a reasonable question. I can't find the policy, but <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Morristown%2C_Ohio_7957.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Morristown, Ohio">you can see</a> that the strong consensus is to keep all recognized places, no matter how small. My theory is that the legal and social recognition of cities and towns means that the world has formally noted them, and that they're therefore notable here. You might reasonably feel this is inconsistent, in which case I'd encourage you to lobby for a change in policy on notability of small towns. But <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, like <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, are all pretty clear: existence isn't enough for notability; you have to really stand out from the crowd. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 23:35, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>With almost a million entries, it'd be nice to see Wikipedia getting a bit more organized. I'd personally prefer a system *without* anonymous edits and semi- to fully-professional editors with anonymous/registered users only flagging for changes and entries. Under such a scheme I wouldn't get in but with a million entries I insist on having my part of the pie. If Nowheresville, USA gets in for absolutely no reason, I'm not sure why I or other like me shouldn't. I mean are you people saying all of the almost million are all more noteworthy than Andkon. You must be kidding, right? I'm pretty certain I have a bigger following than this guy: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_Ali_bin_Al-Hussein" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_Ali_bin_Al-Hussein" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_Ali_bin_Al-Hussein</a> Andkon 00:27, 9 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That would also be an interesting way to run things, and if you think a site like that would be better, you should start it. Under Wikipedia's license, you can even start with the all the current Wikipedia content. I'm sorry that you're upset, and if you think you have found articles that don't meet the current criteria for inclusion, you should nominate them for deletion as well.

<li>I personally don't care if Limecat or whatever the hell else has its own page. But if they do, I want to be held to the same standards. So far, I've been told that my website doesn't confirm to "proposed" guidelines which are "not policy." That's like breaking a law before it's made. Andkon 00:41, 10 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This isn't a government; it's a wiki. The guidelines are extracted from many discussions like this one. After a long process applying them and seeing how they work, they become so uncontroversial that we call them policy. (This is basically how the Internet developed, so there's some precedent.) If you have some reason to change the proposed policies besides not liking them, then by all means go to their talk pages and propose changes. Or if you have some first-principles argument about why this should stay despite not matching criteria that have been working for us otherwise, please do make it. Honest, this isn't some vast conspiracy against you; if you look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2005_November_8" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2005_November_8" rel="nofollow">other AfDs</a> on the same day as yours, you'll see that dozens of things get deleted as non-notable <i>every day</i> under similar criteria. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 16:58, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>'<b>NOT A WEBSITE PAGE'</b> People keep complaining that this is a "best of the web" page. It's not even about a website, it's about a man named Andras Konya, who commonly goes by Andkon. He notable not only as a webmaster, but also as an activist in the Mozilla community. The page is not vanity, because it was written by me, The Reverend, who is not only a distinct person but also more than 2,500 miles away from Andkon, and it can be proven by the logs of the editing of the article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_reverend_a70a.html" title="User:The reverend">The reverend</a> 01:22, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Correction: outcast not activist. As you'll remember, the idiot savants at Mozilla refused to take that Mozfest idea, which of the same technique of guess/check has doubled/tripled my ad revenue. But in my glory days I was being headlined every other month on Mozillazine (and thus on the bottom of the front of Mozilla.org). Oh well. Andkon 01:29, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response from creator of the askEd wikipedia entry:</b> Everything W. Marsh wrote is essentially correct. However, the demo which the entry refers to is a bona-fide working system which is non-commercial and is the result of university research that attempts a very different approach to automatic question answering. The system was also a participant this year in the annual <a href="http://trec.nist.gov" class="external text" title="http://trec.nist.gov" rel="nofollow">Text Retrieval Conference (TREC)</a> Question Answering evaluation. It differentiates itself from other systems in 2 fundamental ways: (1) by offering input in English, Japanese, Chinese, Russian and Swedish which no other system does, and (2) by providing short answers to questions, not sentences or text snippets as other systems do. In that sense I believe it is of interest to anyone researching question answering systems or the field in general. Moreover, the demo itself serves the additional purpose of data collection for furthering the field of automatic question answering as a whole and for providing a comparison of the state-of-the-art with other systems. I tried to facilitate such comparisons by including links to other demos of similar systems on the web (including commercial systems) and for some of which there are also existing Wikipedia entries. (Presumably those entries are not suggested for deletion because they are already reasonably well-established sites, I don't know.) Incidentally, no one has so far objected to a link to the demo placed on the main Wikipedia question answering page (a much higher profile page) so would you also argue for the deletion of that link or is it that the site itself simply does not warrant an entry at this stage? Would the proponents for deletion consider an argument for moving the page or expanding it rather than deleting it? Is there anything in particular they would like to see about the system's workings to justify the entry's existence? Do they have a stronger argument for deletion other than that there is little other media coverage? Because while W. Marsh's observations about the site's low profile are correct there is a somewhat vicious circle here in that because the site is new, Google does not give the main site a high ranking so correspondingly the traffic to the site is also low. If there is a Wikipedia policy for deleting entries that nobody knows about then I guess I have to concur. But in that case, it would be nice to see a larger number of people arguing for deletion with an explanation so that one can judge at which point a site does warrant a Wikiedia entry. I think contributors both for and against should also state their credentials to argue for and against deletion since their decisions necessarily affect many other people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, I have had a fair number of readers of the Wikipedia entry go on to try the system and while I realise this is not an argument for the entry in the first place I believe it is an argument for the site's relevance to the question answering community and therefore to Wikipedia. Ed Whittaker</p>
<p>Please feel free to comment on my comments as I'm obviously interested to understand your objections better to see if they can be resolved without deleting the Wikipedia entry. 12 November 2005</p>

<li>Come on you guys! I don't know whether you're paranoid about spam pages or what but I am genuinely trying to understand what the issue is here and you're not helping.

<li><b>Comment</b> What I perceive here is a badly executed article <i>request</i> by someone who wants to know what these things are, and couldn't find them in Wikipedia because he didn't know what they were called. Unfortunately, his description isn't very clear and I can't figure out what he's referring to. It is not a trial frame or <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoropter.html" title="Phoropter">phoropter</a>. Most likely, he is describing a kind of very cheap, disposable sunglasses that are nothing more than stamped plastic sheet of clear, dark grey plastic. They have no frames, hinges, or temples so they cost very little. They are placed underneath a regular pair of glasses and rely on the regular glasses to hold them in place. Eye doctors sometimes offer them to patients to wear on leaving the office after their eyes have been dilated. The only thing is, these don't fold. Hey, <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardian_b62f.html" title="User:Edwardian">Edwardian</a>, any thoughts? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:08, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: I don't think that playing college basketball alone is an assertion of notability. Most professions alone don't establish a claim of notability, and non-professional sports are at an even lower level. An assertion of notability would be winning a notable award (voted a College All-American, for instance), or being a member of a national championship team. <a href="../../../1/6/5/User%7E165.189.91.148.html" title="User:165.189.91.148">165.189.91.148</a> 22:29, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep and rewrite</b></s>. Charles was actually a professional basketball player, but his career in the NBA and the US was short-lived. He spent the vast majority of his career overseas. Not only that, but he went to <a href="../../../u/c/l/UCLA_052f.html" title="UCLA">UCLA</a>, not Michigan where he was a crucial member of the NCAA title-winning team in 1995. Plus, the information on <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_O%27Bannon_caa4.html" title="Ed O'Bannon">Ed O'Bannon</a> is wrong too (I should know, I wrote most of the Ed-O article). I can probably take a stab at rewriting it later.

<li><b>Delete</b>, I just did a quickie Google search and found no evidence of Charles dropping the "O" from his name. This article as it's written is completely bogus. Charles is alive and well and playing in Japan for Toyota Alvark. He's good enough for at least a stub, but at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_O%27Bannon_aa7c.html" title="Charles O'Bannon">Charles O'Bannon</a>. --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-weight: bold; color: #33C;">howcheng</span></a> <small>[ <a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Howcheng_7e82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Howcheng">c</a> • <a href="http://www.howcheng.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.howcheng.com/" rel="nofollow">w</a> • <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><i><b><span style="color:#0C0">e</span></b></i></a> ]</small> 20:34, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, because nobody searching for Charles O'Bannon would use the name Charles Bannon (who was a real person -- <a href="http://www.ndcourts.com/court/news/bannon/bannon2.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ndcourts.com/court/news/bannon/bannon2.htm" rel="nofollow">the last person lynched in North Dakota</a>). So deletion of this is warranted with a new article started in the correct location for Charles-O.

<li>Well, fbow, I DO think that the wishes of the subject of an article should be taken into account where the the subject's notability is marginal and the subject's views are ascertainable. If the subject is truly a non-public person (not quite the same as non-notable, I suppose) and wishes to remain so, I don't believe we have the right to splash information about him/her on WP, even information that might be true and veriable (e.g., someone is sued or loses a nn lawsuit). Here, it's (to me anyway) a close question whether Brandt is enough of a public/notable figure that we can feel free to disregard his wishes.<a href="../../../f/r/s/User%7EFRS_3198.html" title="User:FRS">FRS</a> 23:18, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Subject of this article is only marginally notable, and most of what notability does exist arises from what is essentially a current dispute in which WP and (more recently) several editors/admins are involved. The subject of the article vigorously objected to being the subject of an article (after trying unsuccessfully to control its content), and the disagreements rapidly escalated to his being indefinitely blocked. Given his marginal notability and the ongoing, current, dispute with WP, I think this article should be deleted. At least, the pros and cons of doing so should be fully aired. <a href="../../../f/r/s/User%7EFRS_3198.html" title="User:FRS">FRS</a> 22:56, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b> - Since the last RfA I have seaached the web for content about Brandt. I'm no longer as confident that he is notable.

<li><b>Weak delete/merge with <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Watch_419f.html" title="Google Watch">Google Watch</a></b>. I don't think Brandt clearly passes an "average activist" test. I'm not convinced that Namebase is notable enough for its own entry, so his creation of it isn't enough; details on his involvement with various alternative publications are sketchy and the details we do have appear non-notably techy; his teaching of computer skills to a few fairly well-known people doesn't seem that notable. Does his involvement with the anti-Vietnam war whilst at university seem that significant? I don't think so. What's left is Google Watch, which again doesn't seem notable enough to justify a separate entry on its founder. It is a weird post-modern irony that at this point Brandt's attempts to delete his Wikipedia article (on the basis that he isn't notable) may be a significant factor in him being considerered notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia (at least by Wikipedians - probably not by your average man-in-the-street). But I would suggest that if this episode does have any wider significance then it could perhaps more relevantly be documented under <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>. A delete/merge of this article (with <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Watch_419f.html" title="Google Watch">Google Watch</a>) would retain most notable material and be a reasonable outcome. Also, (post-modernism again) - the injunction on people to be careful about editing articles about themselves should also apply to articles where Wikipedia itself is covered; there's an obvious potential for bias of various types since almost by definition most Wikipedians are more favourably disposed towards Wikipedia than most non-Wikipedians. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 23:27, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not going to vote one way or the other, except to point out that Daniel Brandt is at least as notable as several other people who have their own Wikipedia articles. As someone who objects to the notability of many such biographies, however, that's not necessarily an argument for keeping Brandt's article. I do want to encourage voters, however, to base their decisions here on whether they feel Brandt is notable enough for an encyclopedia article, on not on his behaviour here. Specifically, I sincerely hope that Wikipedia editors will not be intimidated by his legal posturing into deleting the article; neither would I want this article to be kept simply to spite Brandt for trying to have it removed. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 09:19, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Having been in close contact with many of the people that came through this place, and having never been there myself while it was around I would say that it served a very important function in not only Louisville, re: crimethinc convergence, but also the greater midwest. It served as a sort of underground railroad clearing house for political hobos who were moving from action to action in the midwest.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am the original author of this article. I am new to wikipedia, but trying to catch up. As I understand it, my page has been marked for deletion under <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>*KEEP</b> I agree with what Electricz just said. I remember fort not portland. It was a good place that had shows there. I meet new friends and learned about anrcho culture. A culture previously keepen from me by an overbearing society. Fort Not Portland was a good place and needs to be remembered.</p>
<p><br />
Given the current state of the article, I can understand this complaint. Its current incarnation mainly consists of what might be refered to as the "downfall of ft. not portland." It does not currently discuss the reasons that Ft. not Portland became an important establishment to people in Lousiville and throughout the United States. This was the Principled anarchist collective I hinted at in my original article but did not expand upon.</p>
<p>I wrote about this part of the history first for two reasons. First, This is the time period that I have the most direct knowledge regarding. Second, I hoped by posting this cursory information I could entice editors with more direct knowledge to expand the article.</p>
<p>Please understand that the article is only one day old, and has had only one major edit (its creation). I will enumerate why I do not believe this article qualifies as a vanity article: 1) I was only a one-time guest at ft not portland, and thus do not consider myself directly related to it. 2) Part two of <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> states that "There is currently no consensus about what degree of recognition [that] is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia." Thus, even though the great majority may not know of Ft not Portland's existence, this does not make it irrelevant. In fact, the fort was very relevant to a great many people. It was an important punk rock and anarcho-folk music venue in the Louisville community for over a year. It was also an important center for organizing radical political activities. It's impact on the anarchist and punk community in louisville and the South-East region of the United States is still deeply felt. Just because this community is small in relation to the greater community does not mean their interests should be ignored. 3) This article is the first article in what I was hoping to be an attempt to document "Punk Houses" in the United States. A category has been created to aid in this. It is a phenomenon that is actually very interesting and has many anthropological implecations.</p>
<p>I understand people's concerns with this article, but I really don't think it warrants deletion. Perhaps there is a more appropriate tag something like "we're working on it" or some-such that will denote the inadequecy of the article. Electricz 03:57, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Vanity is just incidental. You say you want people to add edits from their own personal experience... that's a big problem, as Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and needs to be able to cite published sources. See <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>... that's the real problem here. Unless you can cite actual media or equivilent published 3rd party coverage of this place that confirms your claims... there's no way it could pass the AfD, in my opinion at least. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 16:05, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Where did the source information for those original sources that you hold so sacred come from? First person experience, anecdote and accounts are all valid sources for a scholarly article, as long as there is a well rounded collection of these views of events. I am not trying to make a comparison of importance, but what you are saying is that no first hand account of an event is valid as a resource, or that no analysis of current events, in writing, with out "published source material" is valid.
<ul>
<li>The Wikipedia is *not* a compendium of "scholarly articles." It is an encyclopedia. No original research is allowed here. All articles require hard references of their factuality. Anecdote is clearly not allowed. First person experience would only count if you have two or more such experiences/accounts that are unconnected and referenced somewhere that can be pointed to. Simply discussing such experiences in the article isn't good enough; there has to be backup for these things. — <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><span style="color:green"><b>Stevie is the man!</b></span></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 18:24, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I did some research on the wikipedia "no original research" policy today. I do not believe that it applies to this article either. <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> states the following: "The phrase 'original research' in this context refers to untested theories; data, statements, concepts and ideas that have not been published in a reputable publication; or any new interpretation, analysis, or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts or ideas that, in the words of Wikipedia's founder Jimbo Wales, would amount to a "novel narrative or historical interpretation'." Essentially it seems that <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is mostly relevant to academic articles. Articles involving the hard sciences as well as the social sciences. My belief is reinforced by section three of <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDP_6910.html" title="WP:AFDP">WP:AFDP</a> none of the examples given seem to apply.

<li><b>Keep</b> I started this article. This case has generated a lot of controversy across the board. The blogs are notable because there are strong feelings the case which are not represented in the mainstream media (MSM). Due to the Aruban system, where the prosecutor rarely makes press conferences and information does not want to be free, even the MSM turned to these bloggers for information. I find it interestng (and therefore notable) that a strong contingent wants to delete references to the blogs, as well as the other subjects related to this case such as the sex trade theory, the drug cartels and racism in Aruba. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaquin_Murietta_3d07.html" title="User:Joaquin Murietta">Joaquin Murietta</a> 05:18, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I started this article and it looks like it is about to be deleted. So I am adding what I told Yamla in response to her inquiry:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A brief paragraph on my perspective, I started Grassroots coverage of Natalee Holloway because the blogs that link to media coverage were continually deleted in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalee_Holloway_a742.html" title="Natalee Holloway">Natalee Holloway</a> article. The same people went over to the new article and voted to AfD it as nn blogcruft etc. If that is consensus, then I think the Kuroshin reference in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalee_Holloway_a742.html" title="Natalee Holloway">Natalee Holloway</a> article should be deleted. Kuroshin's sole "coverage" is what is conceded to be a "profanity-laced editorial". But the blogs which act as mini-encyclopedias of media coveragev videos, ( e.g. www.blogsfornatalee.com and joranvandersloot.blogspot.com ) are continually deleted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can understand the anti-blog attitude, but a couple of the blogs have no outside posts, they are, like I said, mini enyclopedias of the news coverage. But they keep getting deleted from the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalee_Holloway_a742.html" title="Natalee Holloway">Natalee Holloway</a> article. It is interesting that the case evokes so many emotions, and has brought several Aruban govt. officials over to Wikipedia. Well, time will tell. Thanks for your votes and your consideration of this AfD. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaquin_Murietta_3d07.html" title="User:Joaquin Murietta">Joaquin Murietta</a> 04:26, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I've said repeatedly, both on <a href="../../../n/a/t/Talk%7ENatalee_Holloway_d276.html" title="Talk:Natalee Holloway">Talk:Natalee Holloway</a> and in edit summaries, if you have a case as to why a particular External Link is useful and encyclopedic, make the argument on the the Talk Page so that a consensus can be reached. That's how the Kuro5hin link became part of the article after I and others had been deleting it several times. Be aware that Wikipedia does have policy for external links (<a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a>) which favors adding information to the article rather than just building a link farm. The <a href="../../../n/a/t/Talk%7ENatalee_Holloway_d276.html#Kuro5hin" title="Talk:Natalee Holloway">argument in favor of Kuro5hin's editorial</a> was that it had achieved exceptional notice among discussions about the case, as evidenced by its ranking in Google searches. It sounds like a decent case can be made for some of these others, but I maintain it's your responsibility to seek consensus rather than forking to new articles that are obvious candidates for deletion. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 05:22, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm curious what, exactly, the people saying merge think ought to be merged? The existance of this student club? (It doesn't sound like it's even a proper team). Its membership and history? The kid who hurt his foot? Any given high school is going to have many many student clubs. Unless they're somehow significant, I don't think this type of incredibly-local-interest detail needs to be included. And, by local interest, I mean only the members themselves are likely to be interested. A good high school football team might have enough interest (and coverage in local papers) to be mentioned in the H.S. article, but a <i>club</i>?? What could they have done that would be verifiable? <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:38, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>All words are "made up". The question is, is the word useful and used by people. Google references 36,000 web pages that use horked. It's pretty clear that it's being used a lot.

<li>I agree, this would be better moved to Wiktionary.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>.This is an important independent production. It is a crime to try to censor struggling artists as they attempt to get noticed for their artistic accomplishments. Just because you aren't cultured enough to be aware of these films doesn't mean that listing them online is inappropriate. It is the very height of arrogance to suggest that since a film is not the product of the corporate and stagnate Hollywood system, it is therefore not valid as artistic expression. Just because the makers of this does not have the studio dollars or distribution muscle behind the many so-called mainstream films, it doesn't mean you can shut them down. Do not use your ignorance as an excuse to limit a filmmakers access to the viewing public. That...is un-American. - Peter O'Toole <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 199.237.168.53 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__199.237.168.53_e0e3.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 199.237.168.53">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>. Riotto Ulriggio happens to be my absolute favorite independent, non-mainstream director, and his rendition of "Ice Cream Man" is one of his absolute best works. Additionally, despite criticism to the contrary, Joe Howard and Chris McPeak offer up stunning, Academy-award-winning quality performances. I was terribly disappointed when I learned that Chris McPeak's entry had been deleted before I had a chance to defend his immense cultural significance, and could not let the same happen to this masterful film. The influence these three artists have had in the Independent Republic of Freemont, Seattle, WA is impossible to gauge, but let it suffice to say that to remove knowledge of this film from the public sphere would be a grave injustice, and would be an act of violence against the American people. ~Saul Madigo <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Saul madigo (<a href="../../../s/a/u/User_talk%7ESaul_madigo_dbf8.html" title="User talk:Saul madigo">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Saul_madigo_e13d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Saul madigo">contribs</a>).</small></li>

There are innumerable magazines and newspapers bringing out list of top ten colleges each year - we don't need an article for each of them. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 04:09, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>And for the record I would also delete Rolling Stone's top 100 guitarists and <i>all</i> the other subjective lists by random publications, with the possible exception of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_100.html" title="The 100">The 100</a> if it can be proven <i>beyond doubt</i> that this genuinely started the whole stupidity, and even then It could go either way on the grounds of being a blindingly obvious concept. A list of this nature without the spurious authority of a publication would instantly be deleted as inherently subjective. Having someone else without a NPOV rule publish it just allows it to be slipstreamed into Wikipedia without the benefit of a provable basis for inclusion or ranking. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub>&#160;:: <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 13:52, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Amen to that. I think Rolling Stone can host their own list. The material seems fine on individual school pages, and I'm happy with a page that describes in an NPOV way the topic of ranking schools in country X that has links to these lists.

This is your friendly neighborhood <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intellectual_property.html" title="Intellectual property">IP</a> <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney.html" title="Attorney">lawyer</a>. Listing the names of the schools can not be a copyvio, because Newsweek is simply taking a set formula and applying it to publicly available facts about the schools in question. See <i><a href="../../../f/e/i/Feist_v._Rural_4040.html" title="Feist v. Rural">Feist v. Rural</a></i>. The formula itself is merely an idea, and is not subject to copyright; only the expression of the idea can be protected, and the listing here does not duplicate the expression because it differs significantly from the layout of the Newsweek list. See <i>Kregos v. Associated Press</i>, 937 F.2d 700 (2d Cir. 1991).

He has received 42 commercial endorsments, significant local press coverage, has a fan base of several thousand this alone should give him a place, quite apart from the other issues my sock puppeting friend above has raised, I must add that I know this Jimbo and although I didnt write the article i would be prepared to verify the details <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob15v_6805.html" title="User:Rob15v">User: Rob15v</a> <small>(comment originally by 217.44.195.40 (<a href="../../../2/1/7/User_talk%7E217.44.195.40.html" title="User talk:217.44.195.40">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_217.44.195.40_ecea.html" title="Special:Contributions/217.44.195.40">contribs</a>), then edited by <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob15v_6805.html" title="User:Rob15v">User:Rob15v</a></small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Typecasting is indeed real but just because somebody is famous for certain role or certain kind of roles, they are not necessarily typecast. Especially if the role in question just launched their career, it may be too early to say if they are typecast or not. Not to mention to some actors intentionally want only certain kind of roles, when "typecasting" usually refers to something undesireable. This list would make sense if, for example, it would include people who are <i>widely accepted</i> to be typecast (ST:OS cast) or have publicly complained that they are typecast. Otherwise the list is POV - <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkysmith_c555.html" title="User:Skysmith">Skysmith</a> 15:09, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The place to merge would be <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness.html" title="Guinness">Guinness</a>, but I don't think that's the appropriate thing to do. Similar articles could be written on other advertising campaigns, surely. I'd think this falls under <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a>. In other words, merging this into <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness.html" title="Guinness">Guinness</a> (or <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol_advertising.html" title="Alcohol advertising">alcohol advertising</a>) would disproportionately discuss one single ad campaign at the expense of others. Instead, I think Guinness should have a summary of the Michael Power campaign but not in the same level of detail (this would also address <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">systemic bias</a>). Incidentally, when I started the article, I thought "Michael Power" was a real person. That's the general attitude in Cameroon, and that's how Guinness is treating this character. People even debate what village he's from. Perhaps this should be made clearer in the article. —<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 18:41, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ok, here is the reason why towns and burgs are always kept. I think I have pretty good credentials as a "deletionist," but I'm in favor of keeping all the places (and few of the schools). There have been at least three occasions where the subject has come up, most spectacularly with Eequor's mass listing of 20 or so towns and a "delete 'em all under population 15,000." Essentially, a town occupies a specific nexus in a biographical, historical, military, or industrial article. Even if Possum Trot isn't big now, it might be the location where the Battle of the Big Hill took place in the past. Each city/town is unique as well, having a particular narrative built into it. On the other hand, public schools in the US, for example, are, by nature and law, designed to be as nearly identical as possible and to fulfill an entirely predictable and dependable function with each and every student, so there is less character to discuss with them. Particular schools that deviate from the uniformity achieve note and become "notable" and warrant inclusion, but a school that looks and acts like the others is, at least for me, no more worthy of writing about than a particular gas station or hot dog stand -- important to its customers but not having an unique or particular effect beyond the local. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:45, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Argh!</b> Not another school article!! On the one hand, we all know that most schools are not really encyclopedic. On the other hand, my non-encyclopeic school has an intake of 300 pupils a year. It has been open for about 50 years. That means it has been significant to around 15 000 children. Each child has 2 parents: so that's around another 30 000 lives impacted on. Then there are teachers, support staff, neighbours, local businesses which support the school and so on and so on, so that, all told, my old school has probably had a "notable" impact on around 100 000 lives.

<li>A compromise would be a victory for school deletionists, just as a "compromise" to delete articles about countries with less than a million inhabitants would be a victory for people who thought that small countries are not encyclopedic. About two hundred school articles are added a week and almost none are deleted. It is obvious which way things are going. The only posssible resolution to the problem is for the school deletionists to give up this fruitless and time wasting campaign. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 16:06, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, CalJW, a compromise is where all dissenting parties agree. There is no 'campaign', 'victory' or sides - it's not a war, and comments like yours do not help. The very loose (and very informal) compromise <i>was</i> heading towards 'high school articles kept, below high school not kept, unless particularly notable'. However, this soon got ignored. Which was a shame. An earlier suggestion was merging short school articles into an article on the educational district. Which also got ignored (again, a shame). <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Proto_c67f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Proto">c</a></small> 16:27, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>While I respect your opinion CalJW, it is inherently a totalitarian argument meant to stifle any dissent from those who don't share the ultra-inclusionist view. I can't fault the logic behind the unwillingness to compromise, but it essentially dooms wikipedia to an endless stream of AfD discussions about schools. If that means endless debate then so be it. I'd rather have an endless AfD debate (and hopefully a <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> one at that) about schools than an environment where dissention is silenced.

<li><b>Comment:</b> What you are saying, CalJW, is in effect that the simple existence of a vocal group of people willing to vote consistently againt deletion of a class of article is a valid reason for that class of article to be kept in perpetuity, and further debate to be curtailed. How would you feel about a group of unsigned band inclusionists, for example? The school in question is a middle school, not a high school, and the inclusionist cabal [TINC] has not (as far as I kow) extended its coverage to such schools. And as it happens I went to a genuinely notable school (<a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Albans_School_%28St._Albans%29_42fa.html" title="St. Albans School (St. Albans)">St. Albans School (St. Albans)</a>) so I do find it perplexing that there are schoolw with much shorter histories and zero notable alumni which have *much* larger articles, 90% of which content is trivia - the removal of which trivia would, in most cases, leave "it's a school, it's in this town, it teaches the usual stuff.". - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub>&#160;:: <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 18:32, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think that I need to spend a bit more time clarifying my thoughts in my own head first and foremost.&#160;:) I think that I should remove "important infrastructure" and replace with historical and educational keystones of a community -- schools, libraries, and points of historical interest (unless the first two fall under this category as well). Now, I'm not suggesting that we go as far as the Elementary School level for articles, but I think that middle and high schools are noteworthy in their communities, just as libraries might be.

The PRISM Program has been very successful and almost eveyr single student that has come out of it has had a successful high school life, taking many AP Classes or taking IB and doing extremely well (as in top of the class) on all those classes. The PRISM Program has been very helpful to advanced and gifted students. Not only that, but PRISM is going to extend into high school, and a suggested high school program has been sent to Harvard and got a reply saying that the program was a very good idea and was a great college entry program.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The program consists of (in middle school) an extended math program into 11th grade (pre-calc), a 9th grade Honors Freshman composition/Philosophy/Ancient world studies class, and a 9th grade biology class (of course these highlights are for the 8th graders). Not only that, but the programs are more in depth than other schools; there is more discussing rather than reviewing the material. Those who go into high school from this program say they are BORED in AP classes, some even skip from 9th to 11th grade in high school.</p>
<p>The High school program extends the Math, English, and Social studies classes even further, and if it takes the AP path, will create a biotechnology class, along with other classes, just for the PRISM Students. In the IB path, the PRISM students take the IB program from 10th to 11th grade, and in the senior year in both paths, creates University of Washington classes, such as the "Social/Political/Economical/Ethical Case studies" program. I don't think this is exactly non-notable.</p>

<li>It seems to me the inclusionists have as much to win by coming to consensus as the deletionists do. Kappa, you have raised concerns before about how you have to waste your time coming here and sifting through AfD to make sure school articles are kept. If there were a working compromise, that would no longer be a necessity. You see, it's not just the deletionists' war - it takes two to tangle, and it also takes two to make peace. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 04:52, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>How was that helpful, Kappa? Who's a deletionist? Why is this "war"? How is <i>"I will not be shifted <b>at all</b> from my position despite what circa half the population thinks"</i> working together? Holy cats. Self-contradictory paradox aside, we seem to be divided into two camps: one that thinks there are two camps and one that does not. Aren't we supposed to <i>accept</i> and <i>accomodate</i> a plurality of views? It does not, in fact, "take two". If one group wants to enforce their views on another, giving no quarter, that's hardly a "tangle" - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 04:58, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>A <b>bit</b> unnnice? I find it outrageous that Kurt's comments about "deletionist vandalism" (which I do not really consider a personal attack) are excised from the page, but a back-handed insult calling him retarded is somehow allowed to stand. Incivility and personal attacks by "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles" are commonly allowed to stand across school AfDs while the self-appointed hall monitor cabal descends upon school inclusionists who lose their patience with castigation and threats of RfCs.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> -The article is not up to date and needs more information because the programme was only last week axed from the TG4 schedule. It does indeed exist but is currently battling to find another broadcaster, due to TG4's untimely cancellation. Despite the programme drawing the largest viewing audience of any programme in the 10 year history of the TG4 station and in recent years having garnered a cult like following encompassing all ages of viewers, the head of the TV station, Colmán Ó Driceoil, was forced to remove the programme from the schedule due to huge criticism from the government and others that the programme contained too many sound-alike jokes (despite having perfectly acceptable Irish language meanings)and suggestive material for a programme intended for children. The government threatened to cut funds to the station (being a semi-owned state company) if the programme continued to be aired.</li>

<dd>Well, at least we've got another nice big entry for BJAODN. Of course if the programme was real it would have a production company, and if the production company was trying to find a broadcaster then the programme sould appear on their website. And there would be articles in the Irish newspapers. But full marks for effort. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 14:35, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> This article seems to be based solely on subjective opinions about which Southern colleges are "Ivy league-caliber." To its credit, the article now states that this is a "colloquial term" and that "the designation of "Southern Ivy" has no official meaning." However, unlike other Ivy League colloquialisms with no official meaning, "Southern Ivy" does not appear to have published material ("<a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Ivies_e052.html" title="Public Ivies">Public Ivies</a>"), historical context ("<a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesuit_Ivy_7d0c.html" title="Jesuit Ivy">Jesuit Ivy</a>") or documented usage ("<a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Ivies_fe2e.html" title="Little Ivies">Little Ivies</a>") to support its listing as an encyclopedia article. The sources provided (an entry from a Job-Seeking chat room and a reference to a 1960's letter to the editor from a sports blog) suggest that "Southern Ivy" has very limited currency, official or otherwise. They also reemphasize how subjective this term is. In fact, the apparent "neutral" criterion for inclusion in the article--a ranking among the top-50 in US News &amp; World Report--does not legitimize the term any more than a similar criterion would legitimize an article on the "Midwest Ivies," the "Harvard of the West," or other inherently subjective colloquialisms. 129.105.35.130 17:44, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The question on this one is whether or not this phrase really stands on its own, or whether calling a school a [name of region] "Ivy" is just a way of opining that it is a very good regional school. I am going to try a test. I do not know yet how it will turn out. I am going to try an online search of The New York Times for the exact phrase "Southern Ivy" and the exact phrase "Southern Ivies." If either of them gets any (relevant) hits, I'll vote keep, on the assumption that if it's really a well-defined, frequently used phrase at least one mention of it should have crept into The New York Timies sometime. Otherwise, I'll vote delete. Here goes. "Southern Ivy," 2000-2005: Nope. "Southern Ivies," 2000-2005: Nope. "Southern Ivy," 1857-2000: Three hits. One reference to "Southern Ivy" as a church Easter decoration in 1902; one to a horse named "Southern Ivy" that ran in a race at Aqueduct on Nov. 24, 1999; and one to an athletic sports meet listing "Automatic NCAA Bids" where a table in which "Appalachian State...Southern" and "Pennsylvania...Ivy League" was erroneously picked up by the search engine as a reference to "Southern Ivy." "Southern Ivies," 1857-2000 picks up exactly the same hits.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Before I act precipitously, a reality check on my self-chosen criterion. A search on "little Ivies" plus "Amherst" turns up a hit mentioning "Amherst College, a partner with Williams and Wesleyan in the Little Ivy League." "Public Ivies" turns up several relevant hits, with headlines like "Ivy League Finds Itself Locked in Bidding War For Prospective Students" and "An Eminent Voice Pleads for the Soul of Rutgers" and "Suddenly, State Universities Have More Allure." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:42, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete.</b> "Public Ivies" and "Little Ivies" are well-enough known and frequently-enough used to have been mentioned in the New York Times; "Southern Ivies" is not.

<li><b>Waffling.</b> On the other hand, a search in Google Groups for exact phrase "Southern Ivy" gets 25 hits, which is reasonably high for Groups (other things being equal you usually get about 1/4 to 1/10 as many hits in Groups as in a Google Web search) and most of these are colloquial uses to describe Southern schools, although a couple are to the racehorse. There are a couple of posts that suggest there <b>is</b> a Southern Ivy League athletic conference; is that right? My vote above stands for the moment... <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:50, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> From some of those hits I got the impression there might be an actual athletic Southern Ivy League, but there isn't. <a href="http://baylorbears.collegesports.com/genrel/040104aaa.html" class="external text" title="http://baylorbears.collegesports.com/genrel/040104aaa.html" rel="nofollow">this 2004 web page</a>, answers the query: "Is there any truth to the possibility of an Ivy League South forming? Baylor, Rice, Vanderbilt and other like schools like this would form the new division" with the reply "I have not heard any serious discussion about a 'southern ivy league' forming and believe it to be highly unlikely. I believe that most of the schools that would be under consideration for such a league are fully committed to their current conferences." A Google search on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=ncaa+conference+%22southern+ivy+league%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=ncaa+conference+%22southern+ivy+league%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">ncaa "Southern Ivy League"</a> does show that such a conference <b>has</b> been frequently proposed. <a href="http://tulanegreenwave.collegesports.com/genrel/102702aac.html" class="external text" title="http://tulanegreenwave.collegesports.com/genrel/102702aac.html" rel="nofollow">An article about Tulane</a> says, for example, "From the late 1950s, there was growing talk that the Green Wave could no longer compete in the SEC. A 'Southern Ivy League' consisting of schools like Rice, Southern Methodist, Duke, Vanderbilt and Tulane was constantly advocated, but each of the other schools decided to stay in their league."

<li><b>Delete</b>: I <i>still</i> have to vote to delete. The meaning of the term is better covered at Wiktionary. The question is whether there is substance for an encyclopedia article on the Southern Ivies as they are. Since <i>who</i> they are is still and evermore shall be a debate (is Emory one? why not? is Tulane one? why? is Davidson one? why and why not?), there is little chance to talk definitively <i>about</i> what they are and what they do and what they hope for. The context is virtually impossible to establish, other than as a testimony to the inferiority complex we in the South have been handed about our schools. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:03, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If it's well-known, used often, and a part of southern culture, than it should not be difficult to provide much better <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">source citations</a> than the very sketchy ones we presently have.

<dd>Let me try one more. Once again, I haven't tried this yet and don't know yet how it will turn out. To see whether the University of Vermont calls <i>itself</i> a "public ivy," I will perform a Google site search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=site:www.uvm.edu+%22public+ivy%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=site:www.uvm.edu+%22public+ivy%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">site:www.uvm.edu "public ivy"</a>. 38 hits (although interestingly enough the self-references seem to be mostly to its having <i>formerly</i> been a "public ivy!"). Now let's try a similar search on Duke: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=site:www.duke.edu+%22Southern+Ivy%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=site:www.duke.edu+%22Southern+Ivy%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">site:www.duke.edu "Southern Ivy"</a>.

<dd>As a U.

I'm surprised that they call themselves "The University of the South" and quickly peeking at their website I don't know where they get the "University" appelation; I suppose because they have a College of Arts and Sciences <i>and</i> a School of Theology. They are best known to me (and many others) as publishers of the "Sewanee Review," which carries some weight in lit-crit circles. It seems bizarre to me to make a serious comparison between it and Harvard or Princeton, unless you are only comparing undergraduate colleges... I suppose it <i>might</i> bear comparison to Williams or Amherst, which would presumably make it a "<a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Ivies_fe2e.html" title="Little Ivies">Southern <i>Little</i> Ivy...</a>"</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Once again Alexa fails.

<li><b>Comment</b> - This comic indeed has seen print. It's available in 6 shops in Australia or to buy online. I don't think it's been picked up by a major publisher by any means and is probably self published or a very small local publisher. The forums have 50 members. A google search for Terinu or Terinu comic picks up very little. But this seems to be a primarily PRINT comic, with print editions appearing before web editions. I've not voted on this one because I don't know how popular the thing is in the local area, but I would be erring on delete. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 19:23, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: if this comic is notable in print, then someone should edit the article to mention that. Right now it's described as a webcomic, with no mention of any print presence at all; and as a webcomic it's clearly non-notable.

<dd>Since the nomination (which I've fixed up by adding the template) was so utterly awful, I suppose it behoves me to provide a better one.

<p>The result of the debate was speedy delete.</p>
<p>I decided to bend the rules a bit and speedy this. Here's why. First of all, the article says in no uncertain terms that the band does not meet the music guidelines, so three's no need for the review process that is allowed by AfD but not by CSD. More importantly, the article is basically an ad for the band's gig in a week or so. By keeping this up for several days the article will have served its purpose as an ad, and it will encourage other bands to get 5 days of free advertizing for their gigs by writing such articles (the fact that few people are likely to view the ads is beside the point). Keeping these for any length of time is a bad precedent. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 21:51, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As the author said in the article, this is a personal essay. It can't be speedy deleted because I don't know whether the blurb on the top of the article is a request or not. It could be a copyvio, but I can't find a definite source.
