<dd>To just address one small point - to the extent that the concern is that information about the Supreme Court case needs to be "housed" somewhere other than in the companies' articles, might I suggest that the case have its own article? That's pretty standard practice - see, e.g., <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases_from_the_Hughes_Court_through_the_Burger_Court_df81.html" title="List of United States Supreme Court cases from the Hughes Court through the Burger Court">List of United States Supreme Court cases from the Hughes Court through the Burger Court</a>. If it also turns out that Whip Jones is only notable as part of that case, he should just be mentioned in that article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 04:20, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Bob, addressing your comment here and the one below. Whip Jones, the individual, is the one who started the legal action against ASC in 1979. There would be no case without him. He is the one who had the gumption to accuse the ASC of violating the Sherman act. In the Supreme court, it is an appeal, and the ASC is listed first. Whip was still running the company during the action and the appeal. Even without the supreme court case, I do not think it makes sense to delete this bio, and I do not think it makes sense to cram it back into the AH article, as Whip stopped any involvement in the AH in 1993. He founded, ran it, and fought off his rivals for 35 years. I only wish the bio wasn't so impersonal now that we've pruned it and pruned it.<a href="../../../b/m/c/User%7EBMcCJ_d979.html" title="User:BMcCJ">-BMcCJ</a></dd>

<li><b>QUESTION</b> I'm a newbie, Why is it we immortalize short term fictional soap opera characters and then debate whether or not to keep entries for real people that made lasting contributions??? I realize that Wikipedia isn't a geneology site, but clearly the contributions are huge!, lasting and notable ~ whether or not you've ever heard of these people, or whether or not the original author is related. Isn't that the hope with Wikipedia that we work together to create the timely encyclopedia with balanced, verifiable - neutral viewpoints?

<dd>Arthur, you keep bringing up notability, I'm using your autobiography as an example, because you wrote it and you put it there for us to read:<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Rubin_108b.html" title="Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> or <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whip_Jones_36c0.html" title="Whip Jones">Whip Jones</a>, whose slopes will kids be learning on in 50 or 100 years?

We are deciding what (if anything) belongs at the wiki entry for "Whip Jones" is it the founder of AH or short term soap opera character?</dd>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../w/h/i/Whip_Jones_36c0.html" title="Whip Jones">Whip Jones</a> seems to be the only entry we are discussing now. Perhaps the bio needs to be shortened and less colorful. But there are two important reasons to keep it, and I'm not sure what deleting it accomplishes. Maybe its less notability (although I think if you checked with anyone in the ski industry Jones would be considered notable) and more for referential value that I strongly feel its important to keep. <a href="../../../b/m/c/User%7EBMcCJ_d979.html" title="User:BMcCJ">-BMcCJ</a>.
<ul>
<li>First, <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspen_Highlands_8447.html" title="Aspen Highlands">Aspen Highlands</a> the Ski Mountain will not be going anywhere in the next 100 years, creating this is a lasting contribution for which Jones was inducted into the Colorado Ski Hall of Fame. Wikipedia will have an entry for Aspen Highlands (one of only four ski areas in the famous <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspen.html" title="Aspen">Aspen</a> resort for longer than the next 100 years. The first sentence of the Highlands entry references founder <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whip_Jones_36c0.html" title="Whip Jones">Whip Jones</a> so I would aggue that the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whip_Jones_36c0.html" title="Whip Jones">Whip Jones</a> entry completes and gives detail and background to the <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspen_Highlands_8447.html" title="Aspen Highlands">Aspen Highlands</a> one. Originally the Jones BIO was stuck into the Highlands entry and I thought I was helping by moving it out and making it separate as it makes the Highlands entry cleaner.</li>
<li>Second, there is a competing entry for a <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whip_Jones_III_%28B%26B%29_61d2.html" title="Whip Jones III (B&amp;B)">Whip Jones III (B&amp;B)</a> - a seven month soap opera character.

<dl>
<dd>Yes, but...the WP:Bio excerpt you cite has its limitations. There are three moving parts here: A widely recognized contribution, that is part of the enduring historical record, in a specific field. Here the concern is that the field may be too specific; the contribution not widely enough recognized. Is this person notable outside of the local Colorado skiing industry?
<dl>
<dd>Yes and the achievement is as well. The Colorado Ski Industry is huge (in customers, narrow in terms of owner/operators) and internationally recognized. I suspect that none of the people favoring a delete are members of the ski industry. But, we have evidence that in his field he was recognized twice and inducted into two industry halls of fame. <b>His industry recognized his lifetime achievments and lasting contributions ~ TWICE.</b> And I don't know of anything more enduring than a mountain. <a href="../../../b/m/c/User%7EBMcCJ_d979.html" title="User:BMcCJ">-BMcCJ</a>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that a mountain is enduring - and please don't take this the wrong way, but, come on - he didn't build the mountain. "God" did. Forget to oil the gears on the chair lift for a few years, and it would be back to God's Mountain rather than Whip Jones's. (Sorry - I know that's rhetorical.) So you're right that the industry considers him a hall of famer. The problem comes if the industry is too narrowly defined to have "wide recognition." An inductee into the Kansas Electricians Hall of Fame would probably not be notable, for example, if no one in Missouri had heard of him. So although I hear your point about the Colorado ski industry, it's not open and shut. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 17:16, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I'm not sure, so I definitely see the argument that this fails WP:Bio. I think the Supreme Court case is a red-herring because the importance of that case has nothing to do with the personalities underlying it - it was something the Court did, not something notable that Jones did. I don't see any reason to think that a person, who founds a company, that becomes a party to a case, that makes it to the Supreme Court, which then creates interesting law, is therefore notable (sorry - that was a lot of extraneous commas).
<dl>
<dd>ok, I get your point. It isn't that he founded a company that later went on and became party to a case. He was the party that initiated the case, through his company. big difference.<a href="../../../b/m/c/User%7EBMcCJ_d979.html" title="User:BMcCJ">-BMcCJ</a>
<dl>
<dd>Not really. First off, he didn't change the law - the Court did. Still, if he had been the named party, there might be some minimal value to having an article so that someone could look him up for more information. (Just as someone might, for example, look up who that "Brown" or "Roe" or "Lochner" person was.) But he wasn't - and involvement in a case that goes to the Court does not seem to me to create notability in itself. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 17:16, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Or, to put it another way, thousands of pages of legal commentary have been written about the Aspen Skiing case - but I've never seen one that discussed Whip Jones.
<dl>
<dd>When a case is presented from one company sueing another AH vs ASC and then again an appeal ASC vs. AH. The AH is Whip Jones. It was a small front office, with only one owner. From 1956 through to 1993 Whip personally signed every paycheck, and ran the place, skiing nearly every day, meeting for photos with nearly every celeb from 1956 through to 1993. They wanted their picture with him hanging on the wall in the Merry-go-round lounge midmountain. He was the man, in separable from the company and the mountain. Again, '<i>he was the man</i> with the gumption to start the action. I can tell you from spending time with him, that he really didn't publicize himself very much. It was all about the mountain.<a href="../../../b/m/c/User%7EBMcCJ_d979.html" title="User:BMcCJ">-BMcCJ</a>
<dl>
<dd>The AH wasn't Whip Jones for the purposes of the case, as above. As a result it is the case, and sometimes the company, rather than the man that has been discussed in outside sources. If we were weighing his value as a person, it wouldn't matter whether it was the mountain or the man that got the press. He is most definitely impressive. But we're discussing notability - and notability requires outside sources. And while having gumption is impressive, that's not the same as notable. If he sat quietly back in the shadows, always making it about the mountain rather than him...then he probably let the mountain become notable without becoming notable himself. (Though, just to reiterate, I'm not sure that this is the case - he may have become independently notable. I'm neutral on how all this weighs out.) --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 17:16, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I encourage those reading and deciding to actually read the revised article and comment and discuss and vote based on the current article -- as opposed to what was voted above about the original article. What do you think about the current article??? Also, your feedback, input and help with the articles: <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edison_Pioneers_6b38.html" title="Edison Pioneers">Edison Pioneers</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_I._Beggs_7189.html" title="John I.

<li><i>Ask Yourself:</i> In the fifty years, between now and when <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspen_Highlands_8447.html" title="Aspen Highlands">Aspen Highlands</a> has its centennial celebration, will this article be useful to persons in school doing research. I think the answer is YES, for reports like "The History of Skiing in America", "Places I'd like to visit: Aspen", "The history of Aspen and its Ski resorts". This is a useful article for those reports. Thank you for your patient consideration! <a href="../../../b/m/c/User%7EBMcCJ_d979.html" title="User:BMcCJ">User:BMcCJ</a></li>

<dd>Arthur, I've only voted once, and yes have moved from my original user ID: SavageGecko to one I prefer to develop in the future: BMcCJ. I am open about it on my User page and have the old one redirecting there. And I've taken my "Soapbox" thoughts and my personal opinions about you and your own supposed "notability" there as well. Feel free to take the personal discussion to my page, where I'll be glad to talk to you there. Let's stick to the merits of this biographical entry and whether or not it stands on its own or should go back into the Aspen Highlands entry where it came from. I didn't create this content, I moved it from an existing Wikipedia page. You know this is a legit article, stop roasting the newbie. I get the feeling you would rather win the debate than do what is right. This should be a KEEP (bold removed), period. Look at the article, is it ok or not. This whole discussion and the vote got messed up when you wiki professionals started trying to bundle the articles. <a href="../../../b/m/c/User%7EBMcCJ_d979.html" title="User:BMcCJ">- BMcCJ</a> 02:37, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - You did vote more than once, though all in the same two additions. I know you're a newbie, but it is really really bad form to cast more than one "vote". While afd is a discussion, not a vote, is has vote-like properties, only in that you may not "vote" more than once. A vote is placing anything in bold and then commenting after it. -<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 02:44, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Ok, thanks. a) I'm sorry, how would I have known? b) should I undo it? c) do you have any thoughts on the actual subject article? d) is there a way to take out all the discussion that is not related to the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whip_Jones_36c0.html" title="Whip Jones">Whip Jones</a> article<a href="../../../b/m/c/User%7EBMcCJ_d979.html" title="User:BMcCJ">- BMcCJ</a> 02:52, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, it would help if you could be much more precise. As it is, anybody that wants to know anything about the man will have to comb through 4 pages of discussion.

<li>Removed my errant use of BOLD, fixed my user ID/IP address problem, striking all comments regarding other BIOs for McCulloch, Beggs or Edison Pioneeers. I believe my changes are fair to the spirit and accuracy of the discussion. Just wanted to make it easier to read. With a smile and newbie appologies to all. Fingers crossed that I don't do this the wrong way (again!).<a href="../../../b/m/c/User%7EBMcCJ_d979.html" title="User:BMcCJ">-BMcCJ</a></li>
