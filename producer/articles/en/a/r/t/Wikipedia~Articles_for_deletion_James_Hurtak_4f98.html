<li><b>Keep</b> Regarding James Hurtak: This person has two credible Ph.D.s and for the person who said founder member of the Mars Society what it says is founding member of the Mars society which I checked and it is true. Alice Coltrane is a very popular musican and is already listed in Wikipedia and this supports her reference. I see no reason to delete this person as he is an important person to have listed. He is connected also with the United Nations -- you cannot say that for too many people. Regarding "Keys of Enoch" although I don't see why these two are linked together -- there are now several independent science sources that have been placed at the end of that page and some interesting science sections that should be kept on Wikipedia. It appears to be a valuable source of information from something that has been a popular term in some circles for over thirty years.User: PriscillaW 1:39, 3 January 2007 (UTC) <small>— Informed1212 (<a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInformed1212_9dbc.html" title="User talk:Informed1212">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Informed1212_78f2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Informed1212">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small> <small>— 24.6.140.56 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.6.140.56_82ec.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.6.140.56">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> Can anyone specify what fields his Ph.D.s are in? Both articles are horribly POV, written in a very noncritical way (especially the "science references" in the one about the book). Also, I don't know if "discussing particle physics with physicist <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burkhard_Heim_0098.html" title="Burkhard Heim">Burkhard Heim</a>" should be considered an accomplishment, or something to be ashamed of. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHEL_f701.html" title="User:HEL">HEL</a> 15:36, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Regarding the Keys of Enoch: this book is quite uncommon but definitely worth a read and already translated to about eight languages. Regarding James Hurtak: he is not very present in the net but his work has influenced a lot of different people and he did not write just one book, it is more like 20 books and papers not counting the audio books. The Keys of Enoch are just his main book and it is already over 30 years old. James Hurtak is also quite often a guest in TV and radio interviews. I already seen him twice in Austrian local TV. In my opinion the book and the author are defenitly notable. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetaByte_f4ab.html" title="User:MetaByte">MetaByte</a> 01:20, 5 January 2007 (UTC) <small>— <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetaByte_f4ab.html" title="User:MetaByte">MetaByte</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MetaByte_3d86.html" title="Special:Contributions/MetaByte">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As a “surface user” of Wikipedia I have never before added or contributed to an article (though use it often for encyclopaedic references). But seeing an article on Hurtak I felt it was about time someone did that. I am a psychotherapist working in Germany and first read about the Keys of Enoch in an article on somatic psychotherapy and biosynthesis in the renowned German journal ' 'Energie &amp; Charakter' ' where concepts of that book were taken in psychotherapeutic practice. (I have added the link.) The book contains valid concepts that have contributed to this work in Germany. Years later I heard Hurtak speak in Munich at the so-called "Genesis Symposium” where he spoke with physicists Simon Shnoll and V.P. Kaznacheev on cosmic radiation fields and their impact on mind and behaviour. Yes, I think the man is notable.Given the notability of both the book and the man, the two articles are probably not self-promotion as whoever wrote about Hurtak would almost certainly also post on Keys of Enoch.Soundscape12 07:02, 5 January 2007 (UTC) <small>— Soundscape12 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Soundscape12_53a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Soundscape12">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> References keep getting added to sites and articles that either: (a) do not mention Hurtak or his book at all, or only mention Hurtak or one of his organizations tangentially (b) are press releases or other self-promotion by Hurtak or associates, or (c) are not from sources that fit our definition of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Reliable Sources</a>.

<li><b>Re Comment</b> Thank you for concrete hints that help understand. Nevertheless I am surprised that when the original complaint was against an "author and his book" under a) you now WANT us to to cite articles that mention both together. We have taken care not to. And we have deliberately entered the book and the author separately.

<dd>No RS sources have been given to show he is a scientist of any sort. or even a scholar of any sort. He may have Ph.D's, but he has published no scholarship in any subject whatsoever except in self-published sources or work published by his organization. Even his scholarly-sounding first book is published by his organization. the only RS listed at all is the symposiums on space law.</dd>

<li>As for Keys of Enoch, the only RS's cited in the article are sources that talk about other people's work on which he has also written about--but not his work. Check them out. The article fails RS , V, NPOV --let alone notability. all the arguments for notability made above come down to "it sounds notable to me"--that phrase is actually used in the discussion.<br />
