<p>Ironically, this page might just survive AFD, though it's almost certainly vanity of the most pernicious water... This guy has been a royal pain in the neck on science fiction-related bulletin boards across the web. He has one published novel, which keeps on receiving identically (or virtually identically) worded fulsome praise on bulletin boards, and there is understandably considerable speculation as to who this anonymous is (the name Eng springs to mind). What's more, if other authors criticise the book, dozens reviews of their works suddenly appear on bulletin boards - all identical, all slating the criticiser's work. His frequently-repeated claim to be the youngest-published sf novelist in America is very questionable, and the anonymous reviews now speak of "one of the youngest...". <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 00:43, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>But you haven't explain why a <i><b>Chinese</b></i> proverb should be here. Or Russian, or Arabian, or African, or Spanish.

<li>I disagree totally. Unless an expression is commonly used in the English language, who would search for it in Wikipedia? Via the same argument all proverbs are notable, all languages are notable, and therefore Wikipedia should include every single proverb from every single language on earth. That, however, would suit another project better than an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 01:38, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>It'll be a sad day when a researcher has to <i>stumble</i> on something useful in Wikipedia. Furthermore, if you don't know Chinese (I reckon &gt; 99% of the users here don't), how would you check this expression up? If you <i>do</i> know Chinese, would you be searching for this in an <i>English-language</i> Wikipedia? <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 02:05, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I took one year of Chinese and I'm interested in this culture. However I could not use the Chinese Wikipedia because I don't know Chinese all that well. All I can say is things like "I'm an American" and "I'm going to the bookstore." I wouldn't have looked this up on my own, but I'm glad I learned it now. I'm not sure if it should be a stand alone article, but I'm not sure I would favor a merge to <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argumentum_ad_populum.html" title="Argumentum ad populum">argumentum ad populum</a>. If my interest is Chinese sayings, which it can be, I wouldn't look there.

<dd>We're not a traditional encyclopedia, notably in that Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia" title="WP:NOT">is not paper</a>. We can afford to have obscure topics in our database (in fact, we want to: cf. <i>"Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge"</i>). In answer to your question, there are many translations of non-English works that preserve the original phrasings, proverbs, maxims, etc. as they were said in the native language, so that the idiom remains intact (the <a href="../../../i/_/c/I_Ching_a792.html" title="I Ching">I Ching</a> springs to mind as a good example). Thus, it is a simple matter to need an explanation for a proverb in a language you don't speak, such as this.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete</b>. This was a tricky one. The page was moved durign the AfD debate, which is usually a bad Idea. I take the Afd as applying to <b>both</b> the moved page and the resulting redirect. I count 7 votes for delettion, and 2 more for either a redirect to <a href="../../../k/a/f/Kafir.html" title="Kafir">Kafir</a> or deletion. I count 2 straight keeps, and two who suggested that the DAB be kept but the redir resultign from the move be deleted. I count 1 who wanted supported only a redir to kafir. i count 1 who wanted a merge to Kafir, and one for a merge to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_studies.html" title="Islamic studies">Islamic studies</a>. So out of 16 who expressd opnions, only 4 were for keeping more or less as is, and only 6 for keeping in some form, while 9 were for deletion as a first or second choice, and a tenth for the near-oblivian of a simple redirect. Delete is clearl;y the preferd option, although the consensus is not as large as i would normally like. But IMO this is not a reasonable subject for a DAB page (which is what this has become) and I think this is better deleted than left as is.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I think we should decide what would make a tower notable enough for inclusion and delete those that aren't all at once. I think height is the main claim to fame for towers, so how high should the towers have to be? How about the top 10 in any country (but only if over 500 feet/150 meters) and the top 50 in the world, unless there is another claim to notability? The list could remain, just without articles for every tower. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 00:46, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I like the idea of establishing criteria, but I would argue that's too broad, since by the time we're talking about Canada's eighth-tallest mast we're talking about a pretty boring mast.

<dd>Thanks for finding that, Calton. #2 is a problem because non-notable towers are allowed to have articles if they have a substantial amount of information not on the list. I looked at the list and there are many non-notable towers that have a large paragraph or two. Also, no one seems to be working on redirecting the stubs to the list.

<p>See Talk:Shia view of Muawiyah ibn Hind. I have cut-n-pasted the explanation given there to to this page too.</p>
<p>I did not even know that this article existed before its creator, Striver, linked it to the <a href="../../../m/u/a/Muawiya_I_b2d2.html" title="Muawiya I">Muawiya I</a> page. The very title is a slur. It implies that Muawiya was not the son of his father, Abu Sufyan, but was a bastard. Muawiya ibn Hind means Muawiya son of Hind -- Hind was his mother.</p>
<p>The Shi'a view of Muawiya (which is very dim) is given on the main Muawiya page. There doesn't seem to be any reason for this article to exist, as the only material in it is a quote from Maududi, who is a Sunni, not a Shi'a. The title is irrevocably POV, the subject is covered, the article has no content. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 03:14, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> This particular user has established a whole roster of Shi'a-POV articles. I think several of them were put up for deletion, but kept. Can I submit the whole dang Shi'apedia he has created for deletion? There are at least eight articles that start with "Shia view of ..." (see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Islam%7EThe_Shia_Guild_4ca8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Islam:The Shia Guild">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Islam:The Shia Guild</a>) <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 23:33, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

I think it is important the Shia view gets accurately represented in the main articles, for the same reason we don't want Protestant view of Mary, the mother of Jesus. There is no Shi'apedia though, there are also "Sunni view of X" articles (e.g. <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunni_view_of_Ali_a942.html" title="Sunni view of Ali">Sunni view of Ali</a>). IMHO, these should all be merged. squell 12:53, 9 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The "Sunni view of ..." articles were created by the same Shi'a editor and consist of inaccurate, strawman statements of the Sunni position, followed by Shi'a "refutations". They are grotesquely POV. I just haven't been able to <i>deal</i> with these articles -- I seem to be the only person watching this editor, who makes ten to twelve new articles and perhaps 500 or so edits a day, and I can't keep up. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 13:50, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>In fact the 'ramblings' are not 'various' nor 'incoherent'. The title is Tibetan Americans.

If <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_American_4105.html" title="Italian American">Italian Americans</a> get an article, Tibetan Americans are <i>prima facie</i> entitled to one. At minimum the burden of persuasion should be in showing that the Tibetan immigrant community is insignificant. The <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slippery_slope.html" title="Slippery slope">slippery slope</a> argument doesn't work here; few will be moved to bother writing articles about minimal or hypothetical immigrant communities in every nation. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 17:13, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There's a problem in that because there's some people that take proof existence of something as a claim of notability where others would pull the trigger. It just doesn't work on all things.

<dd>I'm uncertain. Possibly a list of just the celebrity centers would be notable, if quite small. Otherwise I'm thinking this could be like, or lead to, a list of every center of every religion. Which is not what most lists are. I don't think we have a List of Unification churches. Or even a List of Kingdom Halls. If we do then I'll change my tone and be for keep. Right now I don't know.

<dd>Some of those other lists also have problems. The thing is, with this list there is no way in which it can be useful. If an user wants a list of scientology centres, then they would go quickly to the CoS's own website, where they will find a superior one. If an article needs to invoke a list of scientology centres, then it would also give a link to the current CoS directory instead. Even if written optimally, this list can only verbatim repeat the official, centralised listings, presenting no additional data, collating information from no additional source, and offering no summary or introduction or interpretation that will distinguish it and make it a rightful resident of wikipedia. There is no need for this list, and having this list is harmful because there will be a temptation to use it when in any concievably circumstance, the official CoS list will be better.--<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFangz_eec0.html" title="User:Fangz">Fangz</a> 06:07, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>One might just as easily posit that one ought to look elsewhere to a more official website for <i>anything</i> rather than on Wikipedia, by the same token.

<li>You've misunderstood Skeezix's objection. Lists that are indexes to articles here on Wikipedia have a useful organisational role to play in this encyclopedia. Lists of links to content elsewhere on the internet are quite different: if a page consists mostly of these, then it is rather like a section of a directory, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> expressly says that is not what this enterprise is about.

<li>The article is not called "List of Links to Scientology Center Webpages", and it was never intended to be that. It's "List of Scientology Centers". I only threw the links in as a sort of, you know, <i>extra bonus</i>. *smile* Like I keep saying (over and over and over), I'm fine with the external links being removed, because it's not about the links. I <i>do</i> maintain that a list of centers for this highly controversial and high-profile organization is extremely notable and extremely important information for researchers of all viewpoints.

<li><b>KEEP</b> Most micronations of today are considered large if they have anything above five "citizens" or members. This hobby may be small, and it's easy to brush an article about it aside, but this is the largest and oldest micronation, and as such deserves the tiny disk space it takes up here. -foghorn5950|<sup>(talk)</sup> 9:57 PM, 7 December 2005 (UTC +5)

<li><b>Live and Let Live</b> Shireroth is the godfather of micronations, deleting this means almost total rejection of the hobby itself- we have stood longer than any other, and as was pointed out, we're doing a lot better than others that have been allowed to keep theirs. And really, why do you need to nitpick at this stuff? Surely you have better things to do than take on a page and 25 protestors? -Oz Mons <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.128.41.59 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.128.41.59_9d96.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.128.41.59">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> Shireroth is, by the standards of the hobby, huge. It's peak population is may seem small compared to some random generic forum, but over the years it has earned a place in the hearts and minds of many people and comunities. I has has links with a TV show with one of the highest audiance participation levels around (of non sports related or prize giving shows) -<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConglacio_318e.html" title="User:Conglacio">Conglacio</a> 3:29 AM, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> Calling Shireroth the largest and the oldest is a bit of an exaggeration, but as micronations of its type go, it is quite old, the oldest yet standing of its tradition; and it is larger than most micronations than it has contact with (the Kingdom of Lovely being the notable exception). If, despite this, having only 25 people ulimately makes it unsuitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, then so be it; but this will also exclude for the forseeable future all other members of a vibrant and diverse community, which itself is, as a whole, poorly represented in Wikipedia. -Shyriath <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 12.77.52.31 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.77.52.31_98a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.77.52.31">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> This is more than a children's club, or just a message bourd, it is a thriving micronation of over 5 years, which in of itself is a feat, which has a sizeable, in micronational terms, population. The Micronational community exsists, and just because individual micronations are not massive in scale, (5,000+) members/citizens does not make them any less real, or any less worthy of mention in an article. This article interfers with no other articles of similar name that I can see, there are NO copyright issues over the name or the micronation itself. The Imperial Republic of Shireroth has a citizenship spanning many nations and continents. Why is it many who may not even know what a Micronation is to begin with are seeking the deletion of this page, passing it off as simply a "children's club" or some juvinile group. Yes, many members find their age to be under 25, does that make them, and what they have built any less substantial. Is not this article informative, and is not that the point of an encyclopedia? To allow people to look up and research information, no matter how obscure. Now I recognize there are some lines that need to be drawn. but saying a Micronation of sizeable age and population is unworthy of mention, is drawing the line in the wrong place. If you are seeing this as unworthy of mention due to the age of members, that is ageism, in it's purist form. If you are judging it by it's current citizen base, you are judging it by the wrong criteria. Shireroth has endured much as a political model for many years, and through it's trials and tribulation much can be learned about government, political-science, psychology, sociology and even religion/spirituality. The point is; this article is more than just the organization that it covers, it is all that has been learned and discovered through the project that is the Imperial Republic of Shireroth. To delete this article would be to deny the world information, possibly useful, possibly not, but it should be up to them to decide.

<li>The article is about the organization, not the website. As for the organization, it exists - that much is certain. Its existence is corroborated by a United Nations document I found in which the organization is up for conversion into a "specialized agency of the United Nations." The Wikipedia article offers as much information as can be gathered about an organization that few know about. Just because it is a somewhat esoteric entity that falls beyond the public's radar does not mean it shouldn't have a page.

<li><b>Whatever</b> - I think you all take too narrow a view vis-a-vis the "non-verifiable" and "non-notable" lines of thought. A great deal on Wikipedia is not verifiable, or not notable in one way or another (check out the entry for Wongo.com - what the hell is that nonsense?). When I use wikipedia, I use it as an all-encompassing resource. If something's out there, regardless of what its true nature is, I'd like a wikipedia article covering it. We know this website exists, it seems mildly interesting. It could be an organization, or it could be a rock band, or something else - however, it exists. The article addresses its existence. Sure, this isn't "Babylon 5" material or anything badass like that, but why delete something just because you don't know about it? In any event, I'm indifferent at this point. Delete it if you like, leave it if you like. Whatever. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Written (<a href="../../../w/r/i/User_talk%7EWritten_4fe6.html" title="User talk:Written">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Written_ccb2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Written">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>The user, being me, accidentally put it on the user page and user talk page trying to learn how this all works. The doctrine is not a just a religious theory but is a world wide group of people whose uniqueness is of great interest in all seminaries and theological studies. I will go to my talk/user page and figure out how they work. 23:12, 6 December 2005 postscript: I just left a better synopsis of this article at your, Mr. Gustafson's talk page. Slowly I am figuring this out. Thanks for your overview.</p>
<p>--- If an individual is not of seminary or theological background, this article may seem trite. However, within the large religious community this article is a vital resource for understanding this group of people. ---</p>
<p>Here is a copy of what I submitted to Mr. Gustafson:</p>
<p>Hello, Hope this is the proper spot. I have just started working on an entry on shout voice trump. Having studied the Rapture doctrines and seminary theology, this doctrine is unique because it involves people instead of belief. This doctrine is actually a large group of people worldwide. I have been researching it and currently have added some of the basic reference links I was directed to.</p>
<p>Your comments about user page and talk page need clarified. It took me awhile to figure out how Wikipedia works. I finally signed up with a username that would match the article title thinking that was proper. Then I tried to create the page accidentally on the user and talk pages.</p>
<p>Thank you for your considerations as I continue to expand on this group of individuals. You could say, that just as there are Methodists or Catholics, there are now a group of people who are Shout Voice Trump'ers for lack of an official title. I have had trouble finding clear resources and considered building a website but have now decided that the quality of Wikipedia would be the best choice for consolidating information for the research community. <small><small><i>Above unsigned comments from User:24.151.228.4 aka <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShout_Voice_Trump_6ad4.html" title="User:Shout Voice Trump">User:Shout Voice Trump</a>.</i></small></small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I am convinced that it is a genuine good faith attempt at an article. There are references that help to support the article's point of view. There are issues relating to its notability (<a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Shout+voice+trump%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Shout+voice+trump%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">36 google hits)</a> and the way in which the article is written. It is clear from the history that the author is trying to make the article as good a quality as he possibly can. But the AFD was put on the article almost immediately on creation. I believe that, as with all but nonsense articles, an article should be given a good chance to develop, say perhaps 1 month, and then we can judge. It is too early to really say one way or the other. So for the moment I am saying keep. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 09:30, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>From Author:</b> Type in William Branham, the author of this movement and you get 291,000 hits at Google. As I previously mentioned, there is no official title for this group of individuals.

</ul>
<p>Also, look at it this way, Wikipedia would be one of the main sources for research on this topic. Also, at Google type in shout voice trump without quotes, 237,000, and you will see the validity of interest in this scripture and interpretations, which I plan to include. ie: other interpretations, rebuttals, size of movement... I found one site <a href="http://WMB1.com" class="external text" title="http://WMB1.com" rel="nofollow">WMB1.com</a> that shows church groups worldwide. It has also been translated and distributed throughout the world. Here is a quote from <a href="http://bibleway.org/wmb" class="external text" title="http://bibleway.org/wmb" rel="nofollow">Bibleway.org</a> "To the millions of believers around the world who have heard and received the Message which God has sent through His prophet, William Branham..." From the same site, India alone has had over 2,000,000 books printed. From my research it looks like the move has turned from who William Branham was to what his message, I Thessalonians 4:13-18, has produced.</p>

I have no doubt that this is a good faith attempt at an article. Google, on the other hand, yields 3 pages of results for "shout voice trump", none of which seem to identify a particular body of followers. While the teachings are worthy of an NPOV article, not sure these three words are the best choice for a title. The phrase itself is not something that is likely to be searched for.

<li>(Jim posted this on my User page, but has now posted his own reply below along with his vote) Lunkwill-- I'm not sure I'm doing this correctly... responding to your nomimation for deletion of my biography entry. Please let me know if there is a more appropriate forum. I was encouraged to post on wikipedia (which i use and love, btw) by professor colleagues, students I've taught, and a number of others who use wikipedia. It wasn't written by me, though it was posted by me. And it's hardly vanity. Everything in the narrative is veracious. I'm not sure I understand how one "qualifies" to be an wiki writer. Seems self-selecting, at best; and I'd think that as long as information is verifiable and not overtly "marketing," then it should be okay. The writer didn't know how to post... I did... and the article was not written in a vacuum. It was patterned off of existing, approved articles. I'm happy to provide you any number of references to support the veracity of the information, and I'd appreciate you not deleting the bio. Cumulusguy 15:54, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Keep</b> Cumulusguy 14:01, 13 December 2005 (UTC) I'm frankly surprised at the vitriol from a couple of you. If you're going to review, please do, but do your homework. The cursory opinions as to the content of my character or thought-leadership are not informed, nor helpful.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I didn't write the article, but I did post it. Why is it a transgression to endeavor to see one's work recognized and recorded for posterity? The information is completely accurate-- every word-- whether or not one agrees with the editorial. It is ironic that most of the (written) objection is around the references to McLuhan and Campbell. I suggested the writer use the entries for those two great thinkers as a template for how to write/post in wikipedia. I suggested them as exemplary not because I feel I belong in their pantheon-tier, but because they are two role-model thinkers I have studied and admired. The words <i>heir to the legacy of both Marshall McLuhan and Joseph Campbell</i> were not written nor suggested by me. They are paraphrased words spoken by my students and audiences. If they offend you, my apologies. It is an aspiration I continue to pursue, and if you'd read my book or attended one of my lectures, you might even agree. Furthermore, I see the word "promo" in some of the comments below. I don't sell my book, nor my services at my lectures. My lectures are designed for erudition, not revenue.</p>
<p>If necessary, I'm pleased to provide recommendations from many "notable" folks as to the legitimacy of the information, the deservedness of the posting, and the veracity of my efforts to add to the body of knowledge around digital media literacy.</p>
<p>If I was *truly* being self-promotional... I would have included links to the world-wide press on the breakthrough hybrid tv-game project I created and I'm doing with Ron Howard and Fox (airing next year), or posted more than just a link to the Hollywood Reporter's 75th Anniversary Future of Entertainment edition which decided my work was deserving enough to single-out on the cover alongside only four others-- Neil Gaimon, George Lucas, Jim Cameron and HBO's Chris Albrecht. But I didn't. I stuck to the tuition aspects of what I do-- educate others on all I've learned so that they have the leg-up I didn't have. They can decide for themselves whether my thought leadership is worthy of following. If you think writing books designed for tuition is a money-making proposition, then you've never written and published such a book.&#160;;-)</p>
<p>Anonymous insults and cursory reviews should not be the order of the day in wikipedia. That is not my understanding of the spirit of this body-of-work. If you're really going to review, then please do your homework. I was careful to read the guidelines for posting bios, and I believe we've adhered faithfully to them. If you'd like to be more specific about what exactly you object to, I'm happy to consider editing to suit the majority of reviewers. Many thanks. <b>Jim Banister</b></p>

<dd>Perhaps this nomination was too concise: the word can not be found on Google in this context, neither is the show that the article refers to (that the word supposedly comes from) mentioned in the schedule on the radio channel's website. The Livejournal that the article links to, does not exist either. Therefore, the information is extremely hard (if not impossible) to verify. --<a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanneB_e69b.html" title="User:JoanneB">Joann</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoanneB_dae6.html" title="User talk:JoanneB">B</a> 12:01, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is on the website, if you look in the schedule. The vagueness was just temperally while I try and work out a way of phrasing what I mean. The live journal does exist, if the link is dodgy that must be because I mistyped it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bouncebackability (<a href="../../../b/o/u/User_talk%7EBouncebackability_f98b.html" title="User talk:Bouncebackability">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bouncebackability_f000.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bouncebackability">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>also, the only reason labadia was chosen is because it was the only word we could have used which wasnt already used.</p>

<li><i>Delete</i> While the station that the show airs on might be as notable as any other similar organization (we do have student run newspapers on here), a self-admittedly small group of hardcore fans doesn't seem to fit any criteria for notability. If the show is considered notable (there seems to be no real reason for that assumption as there are no doubt many shows with a similar format) then this article should be merged with a article on the program.

The song lyrics and topic have apparently influenced a lot of other places, and so its chart notoriety is not the only deciding factor. Apparently it is used in discussions of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satanism.html" title="Satanism">satanism</a> and other areas. Not to mention that a band was formed by the same name in honour of the song - usually a good hint that its important. Also rename article to Mandatory Suicide (song) to avoid confusion with the term that has been in somewhat widespread use as a result of the song, and also to avoid confusion with the almost-notable-enough-for-wikipedia band by the same name. And disambig "mandatory suicide" as well. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 23:46, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Per nom; info covered at main album article. Also, a Dutch band took the name, so the number of google hits is actually 25,000, which I grant is a lot. As to the above point, the 808 unique hits (I get [<a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22Mandatory+Suicide%22+Slayer&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=830&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22Mandatory+Suicide%22+Slayer&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=830&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">831</a>] is from the Google sample of 1000.

If this was advertisement there would have been things for signs up and stuff. You're going to delete my hard work because you didn't read the entire article apparently and only the first paragraph. This is supposed to be an article about the game not an advertisement. It explains how the game works and it's features. Just because one person worked on it so far doesn't give any reason for you to delete it. Next time, please don't jump to conculsions on something that hasn't even been up for a day. Also, it's still being worked on. Give it a chance. Gokusan 22:30, 6 December 2005 (UTC).</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> So if it's hard to make a certain list, we shouldn't try?

Does anyone envision us ever making a list of, not cults, but even <i>purported</i> cults, that everyone is going to agree on, especially members of the groups listed? Should we just remove 'negative' words from the language, since those described by them disagree with those words being applied to them? In any case, I don't think it is a violation of NPOV to state that a certain source has declared a certain group to be a cult, it's just a fact. Whether the original source is NPOV or not is a different question for a much different day. We shouldn't avoid hard subjects just because we're always going to have bitching and moaning.

<dd>Those are good questions but not applicable here, IMO. There where proposals made that could have resolved the dispute that you, amongst others, chose to ignore and continued editing the article without attempting to find a resolution. I find your characterization of "bitching and moaning", unacceptable as it assumes bad faith on the part of <b>many</b> editors that have attempted constructively to resolve the dispute. Status quo is <b>not</b> an option, not when a disputed tag is on the page for several months. We either find a solution that gains consensus, or this article will remain in disputed land and will end up on AFD again and again. Note that the issue is not that is not NPOV to say that the Guardian referred to People's Temple as a cult. The issue is that to have NPOV, all conflicting views needs to be presented, and that is not the case here. One small mention in a periodical is enough for inclusion, a <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_drop_rule.html" title="One drop rule">one drop rule</a> that is unacceptable in such a controversial article. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossifresco_e1f8.html" title="User:Jossifresco">≈ jossi fresco ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossifresco_e06c.html" title="User talk:Jossifresco">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossifresco_7c01.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossifresco">@</a></small> 22:55, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please don't go around falsely accusing people of crap. I only recently made my first edit to that page (a couple of weeks or so ago, I would guess), and I haven't seen any grand proposals for fixing it; in fact, when I asked a question, I never got a response from anyone. It's undoubtedly easier to make up false accusations against people, but please don't. As to the Jehovah's Witness that keeps messing up the article, he hasn't presented any solutions to fix the article, he's just trying like hell to put his group in the most favorable light possible by making up all-new 'non-unanimous' categories pretty much just for his group, while apparently being unaware that his proposed category is exactly the way the present categories work (and that there are a lot of groups on there that have a lot less sources next to them than his). Are you saying that if I want an article to change, I just have to slap a disputed tag on there, and leave it "for several months" until I get whatever it is I want? Members of these groups are going to dispute the article no matter what we do. I do not foresee all such members coming to a consensus that they are in fact cult members. In such a case, the decisions have to be made without them, whether everyone is happy or not. How do you propose presenting their side of this, posting statements next to each source where each group declares 'we say that we're not a cult?'<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommstein_671e.html" title="User:Tommstein">Tommstein</a> 07:23, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my not so humble opinion, citing sources <i>can be</i> original research. This is not only a serious problem in the cult articles, but in the pseudoscience category as well. There are zillions of primary sources for all sort of positions. Selecting and weighting these, instead of relying on secondary sources (academic studies of the topic, review articles) <i>is</i> original research. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 07:41, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, that doesn't make something original research, unless we outlaw primary sources as being against the original research policy.

<dd>A proposal was made to name the article List of groups referred to as cults in the media but was not accepted. If it was accepted, this AfD, would have been redundant. Such a name for the article would made it clear that the groups included may or may not be cults, only that they were referred as such in the media. Why do you think it was not accepted?

<p>The logical conclusion to this list is to have 12 lists, one for each sign, which combine to include every single person who has a page on wikipedia. My personal feeling is that this is a bit exessive, the lists will grow way out of control, and that a list like this isn't really necesarry anyway. Keep in mind that birthdates are already covered under dates. For example, <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">February 7</a> mentions that <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Dickens_e77a.html" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> was born that day, so there's no need to aggregate all of these people intro astrological signs. --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBachrach44_302c.html" title="User:Bachrach44">Bachrach44</a> 17:14, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>if you don t like sports, delete it, if you don t like music, delete it - the counterargument to this in its extreme is as foolish too. my point was different (i admit unexplained). if these lists are in category form, people will say they are not important enough to warrant cats since the cat name would appear on every person page and that is far less ignorable. people without interest in this topic don t have to visit these pages, and in that way they are ignorable. whatever - the matter does boil down to if people consider these cats encyclopedic or not, as you mention as well. i think they are, every other user to vote here thus far feels they are not (more by gut reaction (this is non-science, superstition) than logical argument (this is of passing interest to many - has a worldwide audience as interesting trivia; and it isn t vanity). encyclopedicness is in drawing a line in the grey zone importance - what s important to any of us will vary). -<a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMayumashu_b61f.html" title="User:Mayumashu">Mayumashu</a> 05:09, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I looked at some of these pages and they have very few entries so they are not usable as they stand. If the creator wishes to compile more comprehensive lists before submitting them, they <i>might</i> be considered useful for those researchers who want to compare character traits, as I am not aware of any other way of finding lists of people by birthdate on Wikipedia (though I'm sure there will be something similar somewhere on the Web, in which case why go to the trouble of duplicating it?). The Astrological Association certainly has data of this sort. Actually, lists of people by <b>birthdate</b> <i>would</i> be more useful and more manageable than by sun sign. In any case, if someone is born around the 18th-22nd of the month, it is impossible to be sure of their sun sign without some complicated calculations, and knowing their time of birth as well.

<li>It's extra work for people (like me) categorizing bio articles to look that up. Especially since, unlike birth-death-nationality it's not apparent. You have to go look up the sun sign based on the date.</li>
<li>It's trivia.</li>
<li>Even if you believe in Astrology, a person's sun sign tells you nothing useful. You have to run a chart.</li>
<li>It would be basically only the <i>fourth</i> category that would apply to <i>everyone</i> (after birth-death-nationality). It's just a huge amount of data and work. Maybe a bot could do the work, I don't know. But still.</li>

<p>OK, I am NOT connected to the Praeon Network in any way, shape, or form...but I was made aware of this only a bit ago... very simply put... any deletion of anything from a site like this, is flat out simple censorship!</p>
<p>Also, to whomever started this bit of censorship, you are a tool, what business is it of yours to attack a simple community site with your unjustified opinions? I'm going to guess &amp; say that your probally all for the complete shutdown of the internet's freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Anyway, I highly suggest you Don't delete anything, it will only begin a downspiral of things that i'm sure are beyond the scope of things that this site would want to deal with...</p>

<li>Excuse me, but I Strongly disagree.. Before Praeon Network, Uplink 2k Network was a STRONG Influence for a lot of people. Praeon Network is not a Gaming Web Site, it's a free community hosting site that has brought a lot of people hope in reaching out to the internet. One site in particular, is darkguilds. That community reaches out to those in struggling need for someone to talk to. If Praeon Network's and Allandor RP is deleted, you are refusing to accept entries of history. You DON'T want to do that. As for Google and Alexa Rank.. since when has this been a popularity score? You are no better off than "The Register" if you delete these listings. Praedon 04:46, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>What needs to be done TO The article, to make it "Acceptable" with Wikipedia? Praedon 04:46, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What exactly is it's violation. It doesn't seem to be point of view intensive, and while I can almost see it as a violation under vanity pages, it does seem to earnestly attempt to be an actual catalogue of a project. 218.101.50.66 04:44, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Unless you can show me each and every line of violation that these sites have done on Wikipedia and they fit these violations to a t. Praedon 04:46, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I see no argument for the deletion of Praeon.net from the Wikipedia site. It is a piece of internet history. More than that it is a violation of cival liberties and free speech to delete said site. It also shows quite a bit of flagrant favoritism in business practices. Praeon Network hosts Allandor.Com, which I freely admit is a gaming site, however Yahoo hosts thousands of gaming sites on it's name servers. Praeon does not claim to control the content of the sites it hosts, it simply claims to host with much better services. Allandor Rpg was hosted through Yahoo in it's conception it grew, and joined Praeon Network and since has had much better support, and much better service. The point is this. How can a site host a page on a business that hosts Thousands of gaming sites, and gaming comunities Which can be found at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo%21" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo%21" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo%21</a> and delete Praeon network on the basis it has one, gaming site hosted on it's Name servers?-Christion from Allandor Rp</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Also if you Type Allandor RP into the Google search bar it returns 721 links.-Christion From Allandor Rp</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Furthermore. As Mr.Praedon mentioned earlier praeon network hosts quite a different bit of sites. Several I can name, Redmages.Praeon.net is an internet graphic art site. Darkguild.Org which is also hosted via Praeon Network's nameservers is an online support group for victims of horrible tragedies in their lives. The Suggestion for deletion of this entry, obviously comes from someone who has not done their homework on the entry they wish to have deleted. If this stands, I will advise the owner of Praeon Network to seek legal advise for a law suit dealing with the violation of free speech and cival liberties.-Storm From Darkguild.org</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I'd like to see specified Praeon.net's exact violation of Wikipedia policy. Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I see no reason to delete this article</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I also see no reason to delete this article. Praeon has done nothing to warrent such a childish attack on it. Praeon is anything but a Gaming Site. Someone really should have done their research before trying to have such a wonderful site deleted for no reason.</li>

<p>I realize you are upset about having your article removed, but please consider that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia which documents things that have been deemed noteworthy by the world at large. Here are the reasons why the article is being nominated for deletion. Please read the content at the links I've provided carefully and if you can prove that the site meets the criteria for inclusion, then by all means I will be happy to withdraw my deletion nomination.</p>
<ul>
<li>Article does not <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite its sources</a> and is therefore <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">not verifiable</a> (this is <i>Wikipedia policy</i>). In other words, there is no evidence that Praeon has had any influence on the world at large or even within the gaming community.</li>
<li>www.praeon.net does not meet the guidelines set in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.
<ol>
<li>It has an <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.praeon.net" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.praeon.net" rel="nofollow">Alexa rank</a> of &gt; 400,000.</li>
<li>There are no links to the site <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=cay&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=link%3Awww.praeon.net&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=cay&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=link%3Awww.praeon.net&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">according to Google</a>.</li>
<li>There are only 13 members registered with the site when I checked (00:16, 14 December 2005 (UTC)), not even close to the minimum 5,000 that we ask for.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>There are only <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=Eay&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=praeon+network+-site%3Apraeon.net+-gambling&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=Eay&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=praeon+network+-site%3Apraeon.net+-gambling&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">30 unique Google hits</a> for the site, excluding the praeon.net domain and the word "gambling" (apparently, praeon.com used to be a gambling site), which indicates a lack of web presence.</li>
<li><a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">WP:ISNOT</a> a propaganda machine, nor is it an indiscriminate collection of information.</li>
<li>"Allandor RP" gets a total of 705 Google hits, however if you page through the results, you'll see that there are only <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Allandor+RP&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=30&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=Allandor+RP&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=30&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">38 relevant results</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the discussion of free speech and whatnot, first all, making <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_legal_threats_370c.html" title="Wikipedia:No legal threats">legal threats</a> gets you nowhere. Secondly, the First Amendment applies only to the government and not private entities such as the Wikimedia Foundation (otherwise, the Boy Scouts of America wouldn't have been able to ban gays), so that point is entirely moot.</p>
<p>To claim that I have not done my homework before nominating the articles for deletion shows that you have little or no knowledge of Wikipedia policies. I suggest you become familiar with the requirements for inclusion before making any further such statements.</p>
<p>Additionally, please note that votes by <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html#Meatpuppets" title="WP:SOCK">meatpuppets</a> are almost always discounted, despite your best intentions.</p>
<p>I would certainly like to wish Praeon Networks the best of luck so that in time the site becomes worthy enough for an article. --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-weight: bold; color: #33C;">howcheng</span></a> <small>[ <a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Howcheng_7e82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Howcheng">c</a> • <a href="http://www.howcheng.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.howcheng.com/" rel="nofollow">w</a> • <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><i><b><span style="color:#0C0">e</span></b></i></a> ]</small> 00:16, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>There's a huge difference. Yahoo is one of the oldest web companies and the largest, as well as one of the most popular destinations on the web. In 100 years, when people discuss the history of the Internet, Yahoo will certainly be a big part of that discussion. It's possible that Praeon may become that, but it's not now. When and if it ever does get to the point where it occupies a similar position, or at least gets some news coverage to make it reputable, <i>then</i> it gets the article. <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-weight: bold; color: #33C;">howcheng</span></a> <small>[ <a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Howcheng_7e82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Howcheng">c</a> • <a href="http://www.howcheng.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.howcheng.com/" rel="nofollow">w</a> • <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><i><b><span style="color:#0C0">e</span></b></i></a> ]</small> 07:39, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Additionally, yes it is discrimination.

<li>Im tired of fighting for something that isn't worth it anymore. If you want to delete it, fine... But do so by wiping ALL Evidence of Praeon Network from Wikipedia, instead of saying that it once did exist, but was deleted because it wasn't famous enough.. do me that favor Administrators... Do me that favor.... Praedon 19:58, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As far as Allandor Rp is concerned, Please remove any and all references to it, from Wikipedia as well. Since we are not worthy. Storm Redhawk</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I will post one more thing in my defense... How DARE you declare Praeon to be a gambling site... I previously owned praeon.com years ago when I had uplink 2k Network... Praeon.com got bought under me cause I was a few days late in renewing it... I regret it every day, but I have no control over praeon.com anymore, and it has stupid gambling links on it, which makes me upset to no end.. but do NOT Declare it a gambling site.. you guys LOVE making speculation without getting all the facts.. Just delete and remove everything relating to Praeon Network and Allandor. You have approximately 5 days to do so, cause I am revoking all rights Wikipedia has to post and have anything Praeon related. You have blasted the good name of Praeon to No end, and I will not tollerate it. Pull everything that has the word Praeon, and I will not flex my rights under the GFDL and GNU to have this site exposed for violation. Thank you. Once all sites have been removed, I will then ask that the Username Praedon, and Praeon be banned from being used as well for future reference of anything relating to Praeon Network, Praeon Technologies, and all other things related to Praeon Network and its communities, including Allandor. Praedon 21:43, 14 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I never said that Praeon Network is a gambling site. I said that praeon.com appears to be one. It's an easy inference to make. Here's the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=praeon+network+-site:praeon.net&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=Flz&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=praeon+network+-site:praeon.net&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=Flz&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">Google search</a> I used when researching your site. Are you going to tell me that you wouldn't have thought that praeon.com was related to gambling? <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-weight: bold; color: #33C;">howcheng</span></a> <small>[ <a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Howcheng_7e82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Howcheng">c</a> • <a href="http://www.howcheng.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.howcheng.com/" rel="nofollow">w</a> • <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><i><b><span style="color:#0C0">e</span></b></i></a> ]</small> 23:08, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ok first off, have you been to praeon.com? Typed it in just recently? It is FAR From a Gambling site.... In fact.. its a parked domain for someone right now.. It actually says it is expired, yet somehow someone picked it up again.. I am going to be investigating the possibility to acquire it, but in the mean time I want all of this wiped out from Wikipedia.. You have done a lot of damage to me, and I am tired of fighting back and forth... Wikipedia isn't worth my time anymore.. Why should I fight for an entry, when you could care less if it is here or not, but much rather see it gone, cause it what, takes up every bit of maybe 14kb of space with image and all? So save me the trouble and heart ache.. and delete all known reference of Praeon Network If you declare it in violation, and unpopular enough to be on a free site... So I can move on from this, and not be blasted by it anymore.... Praedon 00:16, 15 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I did, and I saw that it was a parked domain. Let me quote what I wrote above: "apparently, praeon.com used to be a gambling site." There was no way for me to know that you were the previous owner of praeon.com, so when I saw all the references to gambling and the fact that it was a parked domain, it was the logical inference to make. Regardless, I'm sorry that you've taken this AfD nomination so personally. Please note that the deletion of the articles in no way belittles the quality of your site or the Allandor RPG, just that <i>at this point in time</i>, it's not encyclopedic. I wish you the best of luck on expanding and growing your site so that in the future you'll deserve to have an article written about you. <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-weight: bold; color: #33C;">howcheng</span></a> <small>[ <a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Howcheng_7e82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Howcheng">c</a> • <a href="http://www.howcheng.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.howcheng.com/" rel="nofollow">w</a> • <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><i><b><span style="color:#0C0">e</span></b></i></a> ]</small> 07:45, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Fair enough, when can I count this entire article, debate, and any reference to Praeon Network wiped from wikipedia? I REALLY don't need this kept around, and would love to see all of this wiped away for good... At least let me know by just wiping it all away, so when I view it next time, It will give me a 404 error, or tell me it doesn't exist. That will make me happy.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There are four reasons why this article must be kept.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Thomas F. Breslin was locally famous within the island of Cebu in the Philippines including having a street named after him there.</li>
<li>There are few written records on any subject in this era from <a href="../../../c/e/b/Cebu.html" title="Cebu">Cebu</a> specifically and the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> in general. It is unreasonable to expect that there would be many references to him given the rural nature of Cebu. Deleting this record would delete one of the few records from this region in that era that does exist.</li>
<li>Deleting this article would run directly counter to the goals of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias</a>, skewing the Wikipedia more towards North American subjects than it is currently with this article.</li>
<li>This article provides a significant individual story to an important historical event, the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bataan_Death_March_01eb.html" title="Bataan Death March">Bataan Death March</a>. As part of adding this article, I added a category for <a href="../../../b/a/t/Category%7EBataan_Death_March_prisoners_6aad.html" title="Category:Bataan Death March prisoners">Category:Bataan Death March prisoners</a> and went through the "What links here" method to add the persons whose articles indicated that they were on that brutal march. I found only four other persons to add to the category. A person trying to learn about the Death March would definitely want to read about the life stories of individuals that were on the march. Thomas F. Breslin's story is a valuable addition to the historical record of the Bataan Death March.</li>
</ol>
<p>For these four reasons, this article must be kept. <a href="../../../b/r/h/User%7EBrholden_e08b.html" title="User:Brholden">Brholden</a> 19:27, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: As it's written, there's nothing to indicate that Breslin was anything more than a soldier who died during the death march. Notice the other people that you placed in the category: a deputy director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, president of the Philippines, and an army chief of staff. <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bataan_Death_March_01eb.html" title="Bataan Death March">Bataan Death March</a> has great historical significance. Thomas Breslin does not. "Countering systemic bias" is a <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_herring.html" title="Red herring">red herring</a> argument here. <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-weight: bold; color: #33C;">howcheng</span></a> <small>[ <a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Howcheng_7e82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Howcheng">c</a> • <a href="http://www.howcheng.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.howcheng.com/" rel="nofollow">w</a> • <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><i><b><span style="color:#0C0">e</span></b></i></a> ]</small> 20:01, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Response 1</b>: The "Countering systemic bias" argument is far from a red herring. Had he lived in the United States instead of the rural, agricultural society of Cebu, his life would be far more documented than it is and would have enabled me to write an article that was twice as long, and filled with numerous external links that would have been unimaginable to mark for deletion. Had he lived in the United States, the article would have been full of compelling detail and cross-reference as to the importance of this person. How can there be a more clear-cut case of systemic bias? <a href="../../../b/r/h/User%7EBrholden_e08b.html" title="User:Brholden">Brholden</a> 23:40, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's a red herring because I didn't nominate this article for deletion because Breslin didn't live in the US or because I feel he's not of interest to Americans or whatnot. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> is Wikipedia <i>policy</i>.

<li><b>Response 2</b>: I have spoken to people who knew this man, and he was a big guy in that society. Clearly he wasn't the Army Chief of Staff, but his engineering work there was significant. I have to ask his son, but I think he surveyed the entire island of Cebu. That alone would seem to qualify him for inclusion. Being the first surveyor of a place where 3.5 Million people live is fairly significant stuff, not to mention the Death March. (I hope to improve the article over time.) Would the first surveyor of Baltimore, Maryland qualify to be in the Wikipedia? I think so. As to your comment about Thomas being a soldier, he was not a soldier, but instead was a leading civilian that was swept up by the invasion. This article adds a valuable individual story about a large and interesting life lived in a distant land and its brutal end in a significant military event. There is no way that this article should be deleted. <a href="../../../b/r/h/User%7EBrholden_e08b.html" title="User:Brholden">Brholden</a> 23:40, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That sounds great. Provide verifiable sources and the article stays. Remember they don't have to be online sources if there aren't any, but books or newspaper citations, or something reputable to indicate that you just didn't make him up. Heck, it doesn't even have to be in English. Also note that when I added the AfD notice, there was no mention of him having surveyed the island, so there was no way of me knowing that. You have five days before the discussion closes. If you feel you can't accomplish it within that time span, you should create it as a subpage of your user page (User:Brholden/Thomas F. Breslin) and then move it back when you're ready to go. <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-weight: bold; color: #33C;">howcheng</span></a> <small>[ <a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Howcheng_7e82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Howcheng">c</a> • <a href="http://www.howcheng.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.howcheng.com/" rel="nofollow">w</a> • <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><i><b><span style="color:#0C0">e</span></b></i></a> ]</small> 00:25, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>This article was prepared by a series of careful oral interviews conducted by me with two of his elderly children. I have the email thread from the fact-checking session with his daughter. I would be happy to forward you that thread. As I said, because he lived in a rural agricultural society that generated few written records about anything, there is no written record, nor will there ever be for Thomas or for many other significant people from the Philippines and other less developed societies. How else do we capture the knowledge that does exist about events and individuals in less-developed societies than by this method? Are the persons underlying oral records inherently less valuable than those that have a long written record. Aren't our records of many of our treasured mythylogical/historical figures like <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achilles.html" title="Achilles">Achilles</a> the result of oral records that were written down hundreds of years after the fact. Do we strike their articles away because they weren't written down contemporaneously? What I will do is add a specific description in the article as to who said what and how the information was collected. I still firmly believe that this article should be kept. <a href="../../../b/r/h/User%7EBrholden_e08b.html" title="User:Brholden">Brholden</a> 01:37, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article at the time of your AfD notice said "survey portions of Cebu". I do remember his son (who lives in Manila) indicating that it was very extensive. I wanted to be conservative, so I just kept the original article to that. I have added the word "large" to capture this sense. <a href="../../../b/r/h/User%7EBrholden_e08b.html" title="User:Brholden">Brholden</a> 01:37, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>I found some references and did a major update.</b> I found some references that his son, Robert Breslin has. Notably, a circa 1944 obituary from the Summit Hill, PA newspaper as well as a short bio. It is not public domain since it is post 1923, but I will be happy to email a JPEG of it that I have to you. I posted several other photos from Robert's materials on the page as well as made some quotes from the obit and the bio on the page. It turns out that he had been pinned a Colonel during the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Philippines_a6e6.html" title="Battle of the Philippines">Battle of the Philippines</a>. I actually had a few details wrong in my orginal article, especially w.r.t. being bayonetted - take a look. <a href="../../../b/r/h/User%7EBrholden_e08b.html" title="User:Brholden">Brholden</a> 08:35, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Brholden. Reasonably notable in the Philippines, and verifiable. Not quite sure whether the oral sources are valid (unfortunately), but an obituary from a newspaper surely must be enough. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 13:25, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, oral histories are not valid as a reference (because they are a primary source), but the newspaper obituary does count. The nomination is now withdrawn.

<li>here's a quote from the article: "As a word of advice to all women in the workplace, using your sexuality to attempt to get ahead in your profession is not a good idea. It will get you nowhere in your professional life and you will just lose respect in turn." it doesn't sound very encyclopedic to me, no matter how many sources it cites.--<a href="../../../a/l/h/User%7EAlhutch_2589.html" title="User:Alhutch">Alhutch</a> 01:46, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I repeat: Non-neutrality is not a reason for deletion when there is an abundance of sources to work from.

<li>Despite the fact that this has sources, I think it qualifies as original research because it synthesizes these sources into a new idea, which is not generally agreed upon. This is from <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>: something is original research if "it introduces a theory or method of solution; or it introduces original ideas." I think that the idea that women are using their sexuality to get ahead in the workplace is POV first of all, and that it is original research because it is a "new idea".

<ul>
<li>Rubbish. It doesn't synthesize the sources into a new idea at all. It presents the sources almost in their very own words. <i>Read what the sources say</i> and compare them with the article. This isn't a novel synthesis, nor, given the fact that the sources said it before the Wikipedia article, is it a new idea. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:36, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> UncleG's comments are way off line. This is patently original research. And quoting other OR doesn't make it any less so. You can't just throw down some footnotes and pretend they somehow make an idea objective. Oh, it's also unencyclopedic <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 07:45, 8 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, rubbish. If it's "quoting other OR", in this case 6 different reliable sources that are independent of one another, it clearly cannot be original research. If you think that something is original research because it merely isn't objective, then you don't understand what <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> is. It has nothing to do with objectivity. Please read the policy and refresh your memory of what original research is. Indeed, if you think that the way to deal with a copiously sourced article that isn't neutral is to delete it, then you should read <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">some of our other policies</a>, too. Deletion isn't the only tool in <a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia%7ECleanup_resources_f8d0.html" title="Wikipedia:Cleanup resources">the toolbox</a>, and this article is not a nail. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:36, 8 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not really. The fact is that providing sources and references to help readers decide whether your claims can be substantiated does not relieve it of the burdens of OR. If this was simply the pat repetition of what those articles said, it would only be OR once removed. But the sources it provides are by way of backing up an argument. Which is POV and OR. How is this hard to see?? <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 15:46, 8 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, you don't understand what original research actually is. <i>Please</i> read the policy and refresh your memory, as I asked before. If there are reliable sources demonstrating that the concept has gained traction, as is indisputably the case here (There are 6 reliable and mutually independent sources — journal articles, newspaper features, AP articles — dating back to 1997.) it isn't original research. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:39, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Reluctant <b>Keep</b>. This is a horrible article, biased, tendentious and badly written, but I reluctantly have to agree with Uncle G that it has some real sources (though it abuses them) and that we should try the other tools before deletion. Unless someone has the energy to do the research, however, it will remain in this NPOV state and may merit deletion somewhere down the road. Possibly rename to "Sexuality in the Workplace", which is an active research area and seems to have plenty of worthwhile discussions (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Sexuality+in+the+workplace+%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Sexuality+in+the+workplace+%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> ). <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 14:04, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>P.S. UncleG is right, by the way. Being biased is not the same thing as original research. If someone comes along and says "women are all sluts in the workplace", then it's original research. If, instead they say, "women are sluts in the workplace, according to SOMEVALIDSOURCEGOESHERE", then it's probably biased, but not original research. -- <a href="../../../d/p/a/User%7EDpark_3481.html" title="User:Dpark">Dpark</a> 23:37, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article seems like nothing but an advertisment for Domino's. Prior to nominating this for deletion I suggested that it be merged with the article on Domino's Pizza.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Cheesy Bread seems to be a quite common food with nearly 40,000 Google hits see <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Cheesy+Bread%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Cheesy+Bread%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>.

<li>It's still just taking hold in the blogosphere where some popular bloggers have begun to use it seasonally in lieu of other greetings. A neologism, yes, but new words and ideas have to begin somewhere and I would think a progressive media such as Wikipedia would have a small bit of room for something which may, over the course of time, become something known. I know it's not as important as the history of obscure rabbis, but everything has its place. If you based everything here on google searches, you'd have quite a few deletions of subjects which are important to one or two people in the world...<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by MercuryX23 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MercuryX23_502b.html" title="Special:Contributions/MercuryX23">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>The requirement for notability in an article is a <i>proposed</i> policy, which is quite contentious. In particular, there is no consensus that lack of notability is ever a basis for deletion. Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia with the associated resource constraints. Creating a stub on a topic for others to expand on later is standard Wiki.

<li>Which is actually something I would like to say some more about. Just 3 minutes after I had posted the initial stub the article was tagged for speedy deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b> I beleive the article could be expanded, but not based on google-searches.

<li><b>Comment</b>: PCOE was not insignificant. At the time of transition it was a major group which opposed Santiago Carrillo's leadership in PCE.

Also, deleting a list because one does not wish to start a revolution of ethnic battling on wikipedia with List of German inventors, List of Chinese inventors, and List of Native Inuit Eskimo inventors and because a category is clearly the appropriate usage here is in no way a <i>rotten reason</i>. It is surely more "rotten" to just vote keep on all lists you may have a preference for regardless of others attempts to improve (I mentioned before I will make as many stubs as I can for these) or revise (move to a category) them. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 20:24, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Lists certainly do have usefulness. Categories are limited to the number of people that can be shown on one page, whereas lists can be scanned easily. Lists allow you to see names in context with descriptions and explanation, categories do not. I hardly see how your "ethnic battling" argument holds ground when you yourself recently created <a href="../../../s/l/o/Category%7ESlovak_inventors_6b98.html" title="Category:Slovak inventors">Category:Slovak inventors</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Category%7ESerbian_inventors_9e67.html" title="Category:Serbian inventors">Category:Serbian inventors</a>.

<dl>
<dd>I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't make the categories. Besides, I said before that I AGREE with categories - they are helpful - and I will gladly make one for that list for deletion. What I meant by ethnic battling is that LISTS of this specific nature do not have a basis for existing since they are all separate articles - made to explicitly highlight themselves. Categories on the other hand are PART of a larger category. You don't expect that if a list of Jewish inventors survives the Germans, the English, the Catholics won't want to make their own lists and TONS of other peoples with specific adherences?! THAT indeed is a creation-war on ethnic lines (and other lines, like sexual preference). It will spark <i>listmania</i> which many users here don't appreciate or like much. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 21:04, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>A category is not the only appropriate answer here. First, you only attempted to make stubs because the list existed, which is somewhat ironic, considering you want it deleted. Second, how are anons, now banned from creating new pages, supposed to add new people to categories? -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 20:37, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I thought the anon ban was only temporary. But anyway, there are many things anons can't do but we're not flipping Wikipedia upside down just to give them more priveleges. I don't think many people are complaining anons can't upload images. Also, there exist lists for these people. They are called lists by country and Jews have plenty of them. All that is needed is to place a red name in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_Americans_450a.html" title="List of Jewish Americans">List of Jewish Americans</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_British_Jews_c846.html" title="List of British Jews">List of British Jews</a> and it will get the same treatment as here.

<li>Well, it's helping you to make stubs. That's one good reason. That's called improving the information available at wikipedia. Your second reason is false. If I want to add a Jewish inventor to a list, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_Americans_450a.html" title="List of Jewish Americans">List of Jewish Americans</a> points me to other lists, namely this list that you want to delete. There are no names in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_Americans_450a.html" title="List of Jewish Americans">List of Jewish Americans</a>, which I believe is one of the results of your reform process.

<dd>Maybe you misinterpreted me. My point was that nationaltiy articles already exist for red names for Jewish people, so there's really no point of having this list. You can easily add these names to the sublists of Jewish Americans or to all the other Jewish country lists. As a matter of fact, they will probably be made faster on those. BUT if you DO want a separate area just for Jewish inventors (which ok..theres no problem there) then what's wrong with a category? Everyone else does it. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 21:40, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I created this page; however I <b>abstain</b> from the AFD vote. I agree we should fairly treat Wikipedia critics. OTOH--compared to some critics of WP (who are at least informed), this site appears to be a collection of random insults, whacky conspiracy theories (in cahoots with <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> <i>and</i> <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>?), unsupported allegations of misconduct against <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a> and other WP admins, admissions (and encouragement) of vandalism against WP, and other assorted insignificance. Many of the regulars there appear to be folks who were booted off of WP for one reason or another, and are now grinding axes against WP. As far as Wikipedia critics go, this site isn't very notable--I wouldn't expect to find any serious critics of WP rolling around in this particular mudhole.
