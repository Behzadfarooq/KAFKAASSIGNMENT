<li>I never said that something involving film theory can't be encyclopedic. Please stop making things up. Clearly, film theory is an encyclopedic topic; however, Wikipedia editors should not be the ones theorizing.

<li>You're missing the point. Whether or not the age difference is significant to the plot is not the point of contention. The point of contention is that the listed movies have nothing in common with each other beyond the inclusion of a relationship with a difference in ages, and that the article contains no information to suggest why the difference in ages is significant or what standard is used to determine whether an age difference is wide enough to warrant inclusion. Is a relationship between a 60 year old and a 40 year old likely to be met with the same societal reaction as a relationship between a 35 year old and a 15 year old? If not, then what do films involving such age gaps have in common with each other that warrants listing them together? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 17:11, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> significance to the plot is of every importance.

<dd>Yes, for example, when the film's plot is based around that societal dissaproval. The criteria are defined <b>very well</b> in the article itself, especially in the criteria excluding many early films made in the era when such age gaps were considered normal if the female was the younger of the pair. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 05:21, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The criterion is <i>not</i> defined, very well or otherwise, in the article. The only thing that passes for a definition is what I posted above. An age difference that "risks societal disapproval." How big a difference is that? And, by the way, where is the sourcing that attests to the age difference in the film, the significance to the plot of that age difference or the "societal disapproval" that the couple "risks" being subjected to? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 19:48, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't need to give you a specific age gap, any more than I need to give you a specific number of minutes that basketball must be played in a film in order for it to qualify as a basketball film. Nor do the exact consequences need to be precisely defined, since it should be obvious within the context of the film whether the characters feel that they may face disapproval.

Some random person who watches a movie and pops on to Wikipedia to add it?

If <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_%28film%29.html" title="Maurice (film)">Maurice</a> and his gamekeeper lover were found out in Edwardian England, the first level of societal disapproval would likely be because they are same-sex, second would be because of the class difference.

<li>Take a look at some of the articles for <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroes_%28TV_series%29_e274.html" title="Heroes (TV series)">Heroes</a> episodes and then tell me again about how it's so "totally obvious" that editors watching TV shows or films can conclude what happened simply from watching. Two people watching the same exact film or TV episode can come to diametrically opposite conclusions about what happened and what it means when it's a question of supposed pure fact. I am flummoxed that you would suggest that on a matter of subjective interpretation that editors observing the primary source and concluding that the source illustrates a "May-December romance" can be done across the board without involving POV judgment calls. I've already offered one such example (which you have not answered), the film Maurice. Someone added it to the list based on the supposed (unsourced) age difference between Maurice and Alec; however, I don't recall a single suggestion from the book or the film that either the characters or the author thought that anyone outside the relationship would look at it and disapprove because of the age difference. What one editor decides that in her mind is "totally obvious" is not necessarily so "totally obvious" to another editor, and including something in an article with the source of "totally obvious" can't be anything but POV and OR. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 21:54, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What you are saying isn't what I meant. "Totally obvious" plot points are ones that don't start edit wars. Furthermore, those controversies on the <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroes_%28TV_series%29_e274.html" title="Heroes (TV series)">Heroes</a> episodes all involve interpreted elements such as whether <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Mendez_2543.html" title="Isaac Mendez">Isaac Mendez</a> truly needed heroin in order to paint the future, not obvious plot points such as <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Parkman_907a.html" title="Matt Parkman">Matt Parkman</a> being a police officer. If it provokes a lot of argument, then it isn't obvious. If it doesn't provoke much argument, then it is obvious. Disputes can and do arise when books are being interpreted instead of cited too, but that doesn't mean that books aren't suitable sources on articles about themselves. Fixing problems with an article can and should be done instead of deletion. On these many film lists you've nominated, I'm tired of hearing that the film list can never be verified because you found a few errors in it. By that reasoning, every article in Wikipedia that gets vandalized should immediately be put in AfD. Please try to argue according to the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia deletion policy</a>. When so many people think your reasoning is flawed on about three-fourths of these AfDs you've started, mainly its because you tend to bring up all sorts of small flaws and nitpicky issues that are editing concerns more than deletion concerns. It would really help if you read <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia deletion policy</a> and applied it when you argue in AfDs. More people would likely see your points that way, and also you'd recognize more easily when an AfD nomination would get seen as frivolous, and avoid all this arguing. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 00:29, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well actually, one of the recent edit wars that broke out was over whether Peter used TK to stop a taser dart or whether he slowed time. Right there on the screen and both sides believed that their interpretation was "totally obvious." And of course books can be cited for factual answers from the text. They can't be cited to support an editor's <i>interpretation</i> of the text. Saying that "it's totally obvious" that an age gap in a film is likely to risk societal disapproval by citing the film itself rather than a reliable secondary source is POV and OR and is not allowed. I'm sorry to hear that you're tired of hearing that the film list can't be verified, but since that has not been my argument I can't imagine where you've been hearing it. You might do better to criticise things that I've <i>actually</i> said rather than making things up and decrying me for them. Your claim that I am not citing Wikipedia policy is a lie. I have cited policy. And it's not really my problem if you or some other editor decide to look upon this as a frivolous nomination, and it's not really my problem if you decide to dismiss <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and other policies and guidelines as "nitpicky." I see your responses to my arguments as frivolous, not to mention patronizing, and perhaps motivated by something other than a desire to discuss the actual issues, but then I suppose that's not your problem either. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 04:44, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The first sentence in your above statement doesn't prove your point, because it is a debatable issue. That the dart was stopped is an obvious plot point, but how it was stopped (unless a narrator or character actually says how) is inherently open to interpretation. Furthermore, I'm not claiming that you never cite Wikipedia policy. You usually have some sort of nod to policy in the canned phrase that you typically used on most of these mass AfD nominations, but then (except on those articles where the policy concern cited really applied) you typically have a flood of editors who agree that the policy you've cited simply doesn't apply to that article, at which point you tend to bring up every little flaw the article has or could have in the future, flaws that are not deletion criteria themselves, and then you try to argue that the article should be deleted on the basis of those flaws. The most obvious point raised in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia deletion policy</a> is that normal editing concerns are not deletion criteria. That's why I keep telling you to stick to deletion criteria and use <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia deletion policy</a> instead of your personal dislikes. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 18:10, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>You know, you can <i>say</i> that I'm not quoting policy as many times as you want, and it doesn't become any more true for saying it. As for the dart stoppage, that it was stopped is observable. <i>How</i> it was stopped (absent a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>) is POV and OR. Similarly, that an age gap exists may be (although is not always) observable. The <i>risk of societal disapproval</i> of the couple because of that age gap, absent a reliable source, is POV and OR. And in any number of cases the age gap is itself a matter of POV or OR. Very few films give ages for their characters. Deciding that the creators of the film intended an age gap absent a reliable source may itself constitute POV or OR. As for your misrepresentation of my actions during these nominations, well, I've already advised you of the regard in ahich I hold your distortions so there's not much need to repeat that here. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 20:07, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>In this case, though, I think Mermaid is speaking in terms of the movies in which ages <i>are</i> given, and the gap is brought into question or at least mentioned. In this case, it's neither POV nor OR, since it's a part of the plot. Just saying that it's rare doesn't say to me that it's negligible. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Zeal_c0bd.html" title="User:King Zeal">King Zeal</a> 20:19, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If the age gap is never mentioned in the film, and the risk of societal disapproval is never mentioned, then it's not going to be obvious and my point about cases in which it was obvious wouldn't apply, of course. If it's a matter of any controversy, then people will be required to introduce citations from movie reviews and film theory books, or their additions will get deleted. That process is called cleanup, and it happens with nearly every Wikipedia article. Arguing that normal types of cleanup may be required is still not deletion criteria, no matter how many times <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> acts as if it should be treated like a critical issue in an AfD debate. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 01:44, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
