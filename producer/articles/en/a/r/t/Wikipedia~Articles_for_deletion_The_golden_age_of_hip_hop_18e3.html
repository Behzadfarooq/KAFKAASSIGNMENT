<p>The reason why I'm nomming this for deletion as opposed to a mere cleanup is because this article is nothing more than an essay of one person's opinion of what the golden age WAS (hence no research a-TALL). This isn't like charting say, grunge rock. This "golden age" simply does not EXIST. And if it does 1) it sure as heck wasn't in New York and 2) it sure as heck wasn't from 1986-1993. If anything, the age STARTED in '92 and ended around '96. But you see where I'm going? We'd be here all day. This has no place here at Wikipedia. Next thing we know, we'll be charting the golden age of rock. PennyGWoods 22:34, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Support</b> - there are no references at all here, and the 'golden age' seems to be quite arbitraly defined by whoever wrote the article. The whole timeline section of hip-hop seems to have been divided in such a fashion. References to all these pages would be good, especially for the criteria for 'golden age'. I think that this falls more under 'original research' than anything else. - <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Of_Ninja_e6ab.html" title="User:Master Of Ninja">Master Of Ninja</a> 00:59, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Against</b> - I disagree, I think the article needs to be worked on a bit more but there's definitely an era in the rap history that is called the golden age. It started when rap became more popular with the emergence of Run-DMC and the creation of the Def Jam records label. ref: <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=77:12014" class="external free" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=77:12014" rel="nofollow">http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=77:12014</a> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.203.185.52 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.203.185.52_5d3c.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.203.185.52">contribs</a>) <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_20.html" title="May 20">05-20</a>.</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I wonder whether an article on <i>Hip hop in the late '80s/'86-'93/whenever</i> belongs on Wikipedia. If so, renaming of this article should be considered. Perhaps it could say "[notable hip hopper] refers to [the 'golden age'] as the 'golden age'." <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Ivorson_b56d.html" title="User:Tim Ivorson">Tim Ivorson</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_20.html" title="May 20">05-20</a></li>

<ul>
<li><b>STRONG KEEP.</b> Golden age hip hop is not an original research conception. It's recognized by the music press<a href="http://news.google.co.uk/news?sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tab=gn&amp;q=%22golden+age%22+%22hip+hop%22&amp;btnG=Search+News" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.co.uk/news?sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tab=gn&amp;q=%22golden+age%22+%22hip+hop%22&amp;btnG=Search+News" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and the hip hop culture itself as a distinct era in the music and the culture, which had certain characteristics such as a harder sound, along with experimentation, and a political/socially-conscious current throughout. Allmusic.com, the largest music site on the internet, even has a subgenre directly under hip hop called "golden age."<a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;&amp;sql=73:1" class="external autonumber" title="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;&amp;sql=73:1" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> As can be clearly seen, this isn't original research. Thus, because it is verifiably not original research, it is therefore not contrary with any wikipedia policy except perhaps NPOV-- a policy, you should note, which isn't a reasonable grounds for deletion. For any doubters that still remain, consider these articles which also refer to established eras in various movements, cultures, and hobbies:</li>

<dd>The golden age of comic books is because there is a Golden, Silver and Bronze era, noted by TIMELINE, not by "the best era EVA!!!111", which is what this article is trying to claim. I can't comment on the other two because I don't know about them, but 1) just because they're here on Wiki doesn't mean they SHOULD be, and 2) from what I'm reading, these "golden ages" seem to be agreed up by NUMEROUS scholars. All you've linked to is one or two articles saying "rap's golden age", none of which state your timeline. As for AllMusic being the biggest music site online...so what? What if Rolling Stone disagrees with AM? Or Spin, or XXL, or Vibe? I DO think it would be cool to break up hip-hop by era, maybe, or decades, or 1/2 decades. But to try to label a "golden era" is just bunk. It can't be done, but a couple of nose-in-the-air so-called "hip hop purists" will ALWAYS try.</dd>

<dd>1) NPOV IS a significant reason for deletion - in fact, it's one of the MAIN reasons! So you're ADMITTING it's NPOV, but saying that's not important? Bad move.</dd>

<dl>

<dd>2) It IS significant that you wrote the article. That's why the rules state that is you're the primary author, you have to make that known in your vote.</dd>

<dd>3) What a surprise! NOT ONE of those links verify your timeline! And the thought that you might actually have to SOURCE what you write is a waste of time? Isn't that the point of this whole place? Thanks for this morning's laugh. And double points for digging like hell to find a vague mention to an even vaguer "golden era". The rule here is that it has to follow "Google" law, and even with the Google link YOU provided, it doesn't!

<dd>This isn't as big of a deal to me as it is to you - obviously you're passionate about your little essay and you're using Wiki as web space to publish said essays. (I can refer you to a wonderful, cheap web host, by the way.) But it's stil OR, and OR has no place here. By your own admission, you state that NPOV isn't a problem. But since it looks like enough people don't even care enough to vote (unless you want to drum up some sock puppets), it looks like your little Ode to Hip Hop is going to stand. Kudos, you've lowered the quality of Wikipedia. (tips hat) PennyGWoods 15:28, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to say the main problem with this article is the lack of references, and the lack of any other articles giving a timeline. If we had such references there would be no such problem. The links from Vibe, Rolling Stone and XXL give no specific agreed timeline to the 'golden age'. The XXL link especially is pretty poor in this regard, where there are comments of a 'golden age' but no specific timeframe or agreement what it meant. The other two links only have one mention of the 'golden age' again in a non-specific manner. Better references are needed for this. Doing a google search itself brings out similar links where there is a general reference to a golden age but no specific agreeement to what it is. I found one article (<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5430999/" class="external free" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5430999/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5430999/</a>) stating the golden age was the 80s but no timeframe as put in the article in question itself. Here is another article that does state the timeline (<a href="http://www.daytondailynews.com/music/content/life/daily/0428life25cdshiphop.html" class="external free" title="http://www.daytondailynews.com/music/content/life/daily/0428life25cdshiphop.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.daytondailynews.com/music/content/life/daily/0428life25cdshiphop.html</a>) but there is no indication of the exact source of the timeline, or when the article was written - was the information taken from wikipedia itself? This is why this article needs proper referencing and attribution. If you read it you have no idea where the information comes from, and once wikipedia distributes it, the article will tend to become copied across different sites, and then becomes "fact" due to massive "spamming" (for lack of a better word) of search results. Even doing a google search there seems to be no real consensus when this 'golden age' was. Even then <b>who</b> made such a period the golden age? Where is the research behind it? Even if the article is not deleted, it needs a <b>major</b> rewrite, with proper referencing, to actually be any good. (PS Seeing the comments above people need to chill a bit). - <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Of_Ninja_e6ab.html" title="User:Master Of Ninja">Master Of Ninja</a> 19:05, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I think more emphasis should be made to explain that this article summarizes those years. I think this article should definetely be kept for that reason and maybe renamed to something like Hip hop music (1986 - 1993) to please delete supporters. The term "golden age" can be mentioned in the lead to satisfy the keep supporters like myself.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: A name change isnt necessary but it would avoid the problem of POV accusations. An encyclopedia is ment to give both sides of the story despite public opinion on the subject. Now since this period is really considered <i>Golden Age</i> by the mass public there still might be people who would disagree with this. Therefore when they come here, the article name implies that we are agreeing with the mass public. I'm not saying we should completely throw away of this period being called Golden Age, but maybe putting it in the name is a little too much. <a href="../../../t/u/t/User%7ETutmosis_35ea.html" title="User:Tutmosis"><small>- Tutmosis</small></a> 19:39, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have to agree with Chubdub. I think there should some mention in the article that claims that <i><b>some</b></i> people consider the 90s to be the golden age of hip hop (and this would have to be supported by a source/music critic).

<li><b>Unbelievably STRONG KEEP</b>. Are you serious? This has 4 million hits on google, a million more than the very real idea of "deep dish pizza." The Golden Age of hip-hop is a serious concept, 86 to 93, encompassing Afrocentric underground rap. There can be no name change, this isn't something you can rename. It's as real as religion.</li>

<dd>"This "golden age" simply does not EXIST. And if it does 1) it sure as heck wasn't in New York and 2) it sure as heck wasn't from 1986-1993. If anything, the age STARTED in '92 and ended around '96."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Are you for real? Not only did hip-hop <b>start</b> in New York (where ELSE would the golden age be? the golden age of Russia didn't happen in Vermont), but saying it ended around 96 (assuming you're alluding to Pac and Big deaths) is both a miscalculation and an injustice. The golden age is bookended by Run-DMC and Dr. Dre, the transition from New York domination to West Coast popularity. In this time period, countless important and groundbreaking artists were introduced to the genre, hence why it's called the <b>golden age</b>, the age where there is most progress. Not only is your claim paper-thin, it's false in more ways than I can even think of. The golden age of rock doesn't "exist" because it hasn't been discussed as much and becase (arguably) rock hasn't made any giant strides in any particular time period, being as it is a slower-evolving genre and it's older than hip-hop. If you ask rock critics/fans, you can get a rough consensus on when the best rock and roll was coming out, but that's all it would be, an unofficial poll on a concept you're not sure about. The golden age of hip-hop is obvious, your point isn't. <a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModulatum_dd33.html" title="User:Modulatum"><font size="1" face="verdana" color="#00A7EE">MOD</font></a> 22:11, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>giggling* Okay, then when was the golden age of hip-hop? Yup, that's what I thought. Hon, you and your little b-boys are going to keep your little toy, so what are you crying about? The article is terrible - just about everyone here agrees with that - and the only reason why it's going to stay is because PONY and a couple of others went and rallied up their friends and said "HEY! COME VOTE!" (as evidenced by the user pages). I could do the same, but it's really not all that crucial. The article is going to have to be re-written. Hell, let it stand. We have articles about unicorns and sirens - why not about another myth? That God my worth isn't determined by my projects on Wiki-frickin'-Pedia. My name isn't on the project, so my creditbility isn't compromised, and that's all that matters to me (that, and the piece of dreck gets a serious re-write.) You win. Good show. And?

<dd>The golden age of hip hop was the time from the popularity of RUN-DMC to the popularity of gangsta rap(specifically the chronic). Every sourced timeline will be within a year or so of this(and this bluriness can be addressed in the article itself). PONY didn't do any "rallying", they merely informed the hip hop wikiproject of this afd-- they used proper etiquette, and didn't voice their opinion on talk pages. god forbid a wikiproject actually be informed on the deletion of a notable subject. This wasn't about winning-- instead of putting it up for AFD you could have slapped an NPOV tag on it.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Any time a term like "golden age" or "classic" is used it's always subjective.

And yeah, PennyGWoods there is a genre called "<a href="../../../c/l/a/Classic_rock.html" title="Classic rock">classic rock</a>" and you can find on your local radio station. What plays on your local station may differ slightly than what plays on my local station. But generally the same songs are played on such stations all over.

If you ask three different people when the "Golden age of hip-hop" was, you will get three different answers (I myself can give you at least four: 1972 - 1979; 1979 - 1986; 1986 - 1992; 1992 - 1996. It all depends on who you ask, and the context). I've been in hip-hop clubs, helped organize shows, and produced records, and I've <i>never</i> heard the words "golden age of hip-hop" come out of anyone's mouth (not even a rapper's; though I suspect someone, somewhere has said something). There is definitely <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_school_hip_hop.html" title="Old school hip hop">old school hip hop</a>, which most agree stopped cold in about 1992, and I could see "Golden age of hip hop" being used as a synonym for that era. However, there is <i>no</i> solid consensus on a "Golden Age of hip-hop", and no referencing of such in the article. You could suggest that the article be about the lack of consensus over the term, but that leads to original research. On top of all of that..."golden age of hip hop" is very vague. Golden age of hip hop <i>what</i>, exact? The article seems to be focused on the music, so the title should state such. If this article is to be kept as it is, it should be moved to either Golden age of New York hip hop music, Golden age of East Coast hip hop music, or History of hip hop music (1986 - 1993). Hip hop's timeline is really too fractured and factioned to agree on a definitive golden age that would please all people and be historically accurate. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 02:16, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

I can't even be verifiably certain that a "Golden age of New York hip hop music" would actually begin in 1986. Why not in '82 with "The Message", or in '83 with "It's Like That"? It's probably best to simply move the article to History of hip hop music (1986 - 1993), for the sake of verifiability. What P.O.N.Y. did was still not a good move; one announcement on the WikiProject talk page would have sufficed. Notifying a group of his immediate peers on the project, whom he knows are going to vote "his" way, is indeed fishing for votes.
