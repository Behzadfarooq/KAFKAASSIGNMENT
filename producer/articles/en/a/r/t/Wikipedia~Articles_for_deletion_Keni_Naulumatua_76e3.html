<li><b>Comment</b> I would doubt that this is truly original research, but rather it is at this point undocumented research. The establishment of notability and the task of providing references are subtly different, although the latter seems to accomplish the former in many cases. Unfortuantely our standards may be biased against a culture which does not have a large repository of online information. We may want to look to the spirit of the guidelines and consider the assumption of good faith. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 12:07, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>do not delete the</b> its of importance to the people of LOMALOMA TIKINA TO WHO THIS HISTORY BELONGS please also note my entry on the Turaga Na Rasau "Ai Cavuti vaka tikina" lists the "Turaga na Ravunisa" wrongly as when it was written there was a period between when Ratu Viliam Fonolahi died and then when Ratu Keni was then nominated by the Vanua of LOMALOMA THE LAU PROVINCIAL COUNCIL AND THE FIJIAN AFFAIRS BOARD WHO HAVE RECORDS AND WILL CONFIRM THIS, THIS IS A LONG ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS AND REQUIRES THE SIGNTURES OF ALL THE CHIEFLY FAMILY OF VALELEVU OF LOMALOMA TIKINA this process has already been completed. and the traditional installation would have taken place this year but current political events have changed this and next year looks like a more likely period. there are also early records that are kept by the Fijian affairs board also records in the "Au vola ni kawa bula" (the book holds all the records of titles and title holders and villages and their various families) at the Fijian affairs board which will confirm the soverenty of the "Turaga Na Rasau" please contact them direct before considering this and related articles for deletion. Actually all titles and articles on Fiji should be confirmed by the FAB (Fijian Affairs Board) and the variuos provincial councils to which they belong. many people entering information regarding Fijian traditional titles and history on wikipedia do not have expressed permission of the provinicial councils and the Fijian affairs board and therefore should all be re-considered and reviewed pending the endorsement of the respective councils and Tikinas to which this history and information belongs and it should be endorsed by the Great Council of Chiefs not just of one or two books written by individuals or one or two independant sources. I have the endorsemnet of the reigning Turaga Na Rasau who has the endorsement of the Lau Provincial council and the Fijian affairs board but I am yet to table this before the GCC which will eventually be done by the reigning Turaga na Rasau who represents Lomaloma Tikina and the people of that Tikina who endorsed his instillation he has access to their records with regard to Lomaloma Tikina.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I have a pretty good amount of expertise on the Pacific. The Turaga Na Rasau is to Fijians roughly as the Queen of England is to Brits. Deletion is thus pretty ethnocentric. However, the article needs sourcing and it could perhaps be merged into Turaga Na Rasau. And I am sure good sources exist that could be cited, even if some of them need to be primary. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 01:53, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>i'm sorry but thats just utter bollocks. At best this is a minor village title and at worst it exists only in the fertile mind of the author. There are three major titles in Fiji: <a href="../../../v/u/n/Vunivalu_of_Bau_3c8b.html" title="Vunivalu of Bau">Vunivalu of Bau</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/k/Roko_Tui_Dreketi_1bc4.html" title="Roko Tui Dreketi">Roko Tui Dreketi</a>, and <a href="../../../t/u/i/Tui_Cakau_7c83.html" title="Tui Cakau">Tui Cakau</a> - please go and read up at <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Chiefs_%28Fiji%29_fbb1.html" title="House of Chiefs (Fiji)">House of Chiefs (Fiji)</a> --<a href="../../../x/o/r/User%7EXorkl000_020b.html" title="User:Xorkl000">Xorkl000</a> 03:14, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, the analogy is indeed roughly accurate, although I should have been more precise to stipulate Fijian inhabitants <i>of Vanuabalavu</i>. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 03:56, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Just a minute</b> Correction today the three confedarices are adminitrative introductions of the British Fiji never had paramount chiefs of Confedaricies but rather regional chieftans today the Turaga Na Tui Kaba Na Vunivalu of the confedaracy of Kubuna, currently the Marama Na Roko Tui Dreketi of Burebasaga and Lalagavesi na Turaga na Tui Cakau na i Sokula of the Tovata Confedarcy, the Turaga Na Rasau was formerly in old history part of Kubuna and in modern history Paramount Cheif only of Lomaloma Tikina, by the way the GCC still considers the Queen of England as Fiji's highest Cheif since session of 1874 Malo Maikeli

<p>I do not want to interfere in this debate in which I would not be able to say if the information is the truth or not, but this is an interesting question. We all know how oral tradition is important in all South Pacific and how it can vary from one narrator to another. We could have the same debate about New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna, Cook Islands... The question is, should Wikipedia tolerate informations when there are no written sources&#160;? I think it should, if the author of the article explains where and how he had the information and if the tribe concerned or the clan, or any legitime owner of the story is agreed to reveal it. If I well understood, the author of those articles is himself involved in it. So what is the problem&#160;?</p>
<dl>
<dd>i think in this case we should let someone outside our community document this information and publish it (where it will get peer reviewed by other experts in the field). Otherwise what you are asking is for us (the wikipedia community) to judge the quality of the author's research methods in collecting oral histories and the quality of his synthesis and conclusion. We should not be doing this - we are simply not qualified. This one reason why we ban <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> here - so that such issues are dealt with outside the community, and the information comes to us reliably and <a href="../../../w/p/_/WP_84ae.html" title="WP">verified</a>. --<a href="../../../x/o/r/User%7EXorkl000_020b.html" title="User:Xorkl000">Xorkl000</a> 01:08, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would add, that I really appreciate the articles (from all contributors) about fidji in the english wikipedia. It helps me a lot in my modest constributions in the french one and reminds me a great trip in fidji more than ten years ago. Vinaka and keep on the good job&#160;!</p>
