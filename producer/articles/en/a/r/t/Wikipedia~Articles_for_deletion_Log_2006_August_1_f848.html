<li><b>Delete</b> Seems an interesting enough guy, but I don't see notability based on what's here. He started a few nn websites. He <i>recorded</i> an album, which is a very different thing from <i>released</i> an album, and is recording another. No record company listed. A book that is supposed to be available in the future, but no way to verify that, or if it will sell when published.

<li><b>Delete</b> - even the article itself suggests that the subject is "...<i>becoming emergently known</i>..." - logically, one may conclude that the subject itself is not notable at this time.

<li><b>Keep</b>I don't see what the big problem is with keeping the article up. It's informative,he's a great guy, and it's definitely not hurting anyone. We want new people in the world, we want to learn more.. the mysteries in this world is great, the ones that actually delve deep within society and the unknown are the only ones even attempting to help those that wish to know more.. are very few. Oh, wait, no.. there's quite a few, but they gain no attention from anything, due to things like this. People bust them down and make them disappear just like some notable artists and novelists in this world. How else is a person to get a contract or a publishing contact without being known? What kind of publisher would want to take on a person not known by -anyone- with something that some publishers have no idea about? Take that into concideration, you may very well be putting a wet blanket upon a firey new novelist or even a new, and actually, interesting, real life show.<b>Becki Daniels, CEO Gamers Guild</b><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 74.134.23.25 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.134.23.25_80a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.134.23.25">contribs</a>).</small> 17:54, 2 August 2006 <small><b>Note: First edit from this user</b></small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> So far I am in agreement with everything said by others who voted 'keep.' Troy is truly a great guy, lovable, entertaining, passionate, dedicated, talented, and still on his way up. Not only does he have a huge following, but he is still on the rise, which is more than impressive, and he has done more than most of us could ever hope to accomplish. As his book shall be out soon, I also see no harm in having his page here meanwhile. I would rather this site be ahead of the times than months behind them. -M.

<li><b>Keep</b> Who is it hurting? We should be supportive of up and coming talent, not trying to crush it. We're talking about a field that is already extremely hard to break into, without our comdemning or judging. It's very simple really, do unto others as you would have done to you. I learned that before I was five, and I'm a better person for following such a policy.--Kaboob22 18:11, 2 August 2006 (UTC) <small><b>Note: First edit from this user</b></small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I don't see why this article needs to be deleted. Are those proposing deletion jealous that Troy gets a Wikipedia entry? What the heck? The article is informative and well written, and if being "non-n" (whatever that means) is reason enough to delete an article, I say that this article is "un-non-n" and should be kept. We need a venue to inform ourselves on new talents, and Troy certainly qualifies as such. Isn't Wikipedia about getting away from the bulls**t that the general media provides, and providing information that is given and revised by the internet community. Instead of knocking emerging artist down because they don't fit the popular culture definition of being reference-worthy, the Wikipedia community should embrace the opportunity to inform and educate on matters or artists that are otherwise ignored by other mediums. And those who don't like this idea should go eonline.com to feast on the commericial media chuck wagon, I'm sure you're eager to find out when Ashley Simpson's book of poetry is out. -Anjie <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.120.233.158 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.120.233.158_ede1.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.120.233.158">contribs</a>).</small> 19:59, 2 August 2006 <small><b>Note: First edit from this user</b></small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>* I'm the first creator of this page and new to Wikipedia, so there is my bias. In Vancouver there are 2 places where people go to remember the War dead, our local park and Canadian Memorial Church. There will be a Merchant Marine service on Sept 3, 2006 and the three Nov 11th services attract about 1,000 people annually (I didn't add those facts to the article, as that would be self promotion). The Memorial Church was opened with senior political figures from Federal, Provincial and City governments (I thought it was of low interest now 75 years later, so didn't post those facts). In June 2006 22 different multi-faith events at the World Peace forum were held at the Centre for Peace. The Vancouver Historic Society included Canadian Memorial Church in their 2004 tour of historic churches. As far as verification, the federal goverment's website confirms most of the key facts <a href="http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/general/sub.cfm?source=history/koreawar/pilgrimage/church" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/general/sub.cfm?source=history/koreawar/pilgrimage/church" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.

<li>I do not dispute that Remembrance Day services occur at the Centre and do not intend to argue verifiability; however, there are more than two places in Vancouver where memorial services are held (not counting the numerous memorials held in various locations in all the municipalities of Greater Vancouver. In addition to the Cenotaph at Victory Square and the Centre, memorial services are held at the Japanese Memorial at Stanley Park, Grandview Park Cenotaph, the Chinese cenotaph (Keefer Square), Memorial Park South (41st and Prince Albert) and (if you count UBC as part of Vancouver), the memorial at War Memorial Gym. If there is a basis for which this facility is encyclopedic, then fine, but it shouldn't be considered encyclopedic on the incorrect statement that it's only one of two places where war memorials are held. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 20:29, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I meant no disrespect to the other places of memorial, and thank you for bringing them to mind. I was thinking of the places with large attendance. The Japanese Memorial in Stanley Park for example would be an excellent subject for an article, even if it attracts only a small gathering, because of its uniqueness and social commentary. I appreciate your comment that you do not argue verifiability, as that seems to be progress from your comment at the top of the page ("Much of the article is unverified...").Canadianmemorial 17:42, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>this question of notable is very interesting. You have authored a number of articles on somewhat obscure musicians, but those are notable. Another of the commentators above has authored articles on reality TV shows concerning housecleaning, and that is notable. I stopped by the Centre for Peace today, and they were hosting a meeting of about 15 teenagers brought from Palestine along with about 15 teenagers brought from Israel, along with teens from the Vancouver area, to talk about "peace-ing it together" (see <a href="http://www.creativepeacenetwork.ca/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.creativepeacenetwork.ca/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>), and I think what that place is doing is notable. Perhaps to Americans, you don't realize the effect 60,000 war dead had on a very small nation of Canada in WWI, but it was a critical point in our journey as a nation, and school kids want to look such things up, and they want to know where this story is told in their community. In Canada we struggle with our mission as peacekeepers, their deaths, and the conflict between armed interventions and traditional peacekeeping - and here is a place dealing with those issues. It is notable.Canadianmemorial 03:52, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

I'm not saying the place is unimportant, but it's no more significant than any other parish church in Vancouver. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 08:57, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, I respect that we can have different opinions; I wanted to express that the standard set for notability here seemed to be higher than applied to your own works, and that does not disparage your works. There are indeed aspects of the Church and Centre for Peace that is no different than most other churches in Vancouver (those aspects are properly not included in the article - and I would welcome editing help if there are elements remaining that offend this). The fact that it was build by National (and American) subscription as a War Memorial is notable; the fact that it has an ongoing role as a place of remembrance for those who died in war that extends well beyond its church membership is notable; and the fact that it has a Centre that actively supports peace projects far beyond the bounds of the church membership is notable.Canadianmemorial 19:21, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Doing a quick web search, there appear to be several reasonable candidates for sources. The article is certainly verifi<i>able</i>. It wouldn't be a big deal for someone to add the sources to the article; maybe I'll do that tomorrow. Having said that, AfD is not cleanup. Giving an article a five-day deadline to become top-quality isn't always fair to the people who are interested in the article; some things take time. Oh, and <b>keep</b> (although a merge is okay with me too if anyone wants to propose one). <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 02:27, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In the event that sources are found and added, we're back to the same old school debate. I have to disagree about cleanup versus AfD. When there are no sources cited in the article at all and the article has been around for over 2 months, peril of deletion only seems appropriate. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 02:31, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Why would you use Wikipedia to find out about schools? Any useful information other than location and the colour of the school mascot would likely be POV.

<li>I don't think there's anything inherently POV about explaining the history and makeup of the school and any notable events connected with it. Wikipedia is more accessible than a school guide which is only available in the neighbourhood. Frankly I have almost no interest in US schools, but I would like to be able to read about schools in various other countries without having to actually visit the location (or speak the language). <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 20:24, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Three comments:
<ol>
<li>WP:CORP isn't an applicable notability standard, even for private schools. Schools are not important because of the amount of money they make, but because hundreds of people spend huge amounts of time at them at a pivotal time of their lives.</li>
<li>Almost all schools meet WP:CORP anyway. Even ignoring the references already in the article, I'm sure that this place, like almost every other school, has had significant local media coverage.</li>
<li>Lack of notability isn't a reason for deletion except in narrowly defined circumstances. It can be a reason for merging though, which I'd personally be okay with.</li>

<dd>Why isn't <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> applicable? It is a business, and while #2 and #3 of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> aren't likely to be relevant, #1 (the existence of media coverage) is relevant. Traditionally, it's on the author of an article to assert that their article on a <i>private business</i> serves some encyclopedic purpose and that it can be expanded into an encyclopedic article, and isn't vanity or advertisement or just an unexpandable demographic stub.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - --and allow the school to expand as suggested above. It is a new entry and can improve. Just because it is a small school should not be a reason to keep it out. Small schools can be notable. When you say the "inmates" wrote it, you must mean the students. That is looking down on the students who are trying to work on their page because they don't have all the technical people public schools have. When the School Project wants a school to be kept, then they fix up a stub to keep it from being deleted. Is it only public schools that they will work on so they can be notable?

<li>I don't think they're up on that level, but I think they're comparable to other similar major cultural music prizes, for sure. This award in particular is nominated by major figures, and gets plenty of attention. <a href="http://www.nammys.com/mediaroom.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nammys.com/mediaroom.cfm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>--<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:30, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't know, amongst the other pieces of information gleaned from that website ar the fact that "tickets are on-sale now through www.tickets.com and will be priced at $25.00, $50.00", an average of 127 Native American Music Recordings were released per year from 1998-2001 and a quote from USA Today suggesting "Maybe it's time to start taking Native American music seriously." These don't suggest a major, widely recognised award to me. That being said there's no guideline in <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> as to what constitutes a major award, and the talk page and archives aren't much help either.

<li><b>Delete</b>: I'm not in favor of userfying vanity articles, as we're not a web host. As for the caustic responses, I was the live music director at WREK, once upon a time. Note the "once upon a time." College radio stations go through masses of DJ's, directors, prize winners, etc. Further, WRAS is neither the most powerful nor most popular college radio station in the nation. KCRA and the Fordham stations whomp it pretty convincingly. Yes, it is good that there are scholars here who have some standards, and it is even better when idle scribblings are exiled to the outer darkness. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:32, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Your WREK background explains your arrogance. You <b>are</b> wrong about WRAS not being the most powerful college station in the country however. The most "popular" entity is impossible to ascertain because such a measure is completely subjective. I'd rather just delete the article because it has become unbearably irritating to deal with. I am a new user to Wikipedia and yes, I did make a mistake by violating A7 (excuse me). What you have done is made me not want to come back ever again (maybe thats what you want?).

<li><b>Reply</b>: Man, <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbitron.html" title="Arbitron">Arbitron</a> determines popularity, and Arbitron measures college radio stations. Among public stations, the highest rated is WNYC (no surprise). Among college stations, KCRA is near the top. As for "important" and influential, that can be assessed by <i>CMJ</i> and other trade magazines. WRAS is a college pop station. It has a good listenership, and it focuses on being accessible and college radio. &lt;shrug&gt; WREK was/is (for those interested in this apparent regionalism) user-hostile, a college radio station that revelled in the fact that it existed merely to be a working lab for electrical engineers. It is elitist and indifferent to the listeners, somewhat, but no one would claim that it was powerful or popular. If the author wishes to add unsourced and hyperbolic claims to the WRAS article, he would do well to read up on our procedures a bit. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:51, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wait wait wait wait... 66,000 (with 550 of the first 1000 being unique) Google hits is low, and 7,379 is a poor Alexa rank?

<li>Another problem with the Ghit count is that it excludes hits that refer to the site as one word, fuckedcompany. That gets well over <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22fuckedcompany%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22fuckedcompany%22" rel="nofollow">150,000 hits</a>. It also excludes sites that refer to the site as "f@ed" or some other "polite" variation. The total on all terms gets a quarter-million Ghits. And the Alexa rank is impressive, especially considering that the dot-com bust, when the site was really hot, has passed. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice">Groggy Dice</a> 14:38, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, 7379 is a pretty low number.

<li>That's not how alexa works. The lower the website's rank number, the more frequently visited it is. An Alexa of 1 is the most visited site in Alexa's database, while a rank of 5,000,000 would be a poorly visited site.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is almost, but not quite, a spurious nomination.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think you're taking this a bit too seriously, Anthony. If you've ever watched a Twins broadcast, which I suspect you haven't, you'd see that Blyleven makes these comments surprisingly often. According to Wikipedia, <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EListcruft_170b.html" title="Wikipedia:Listcruft">"listcruft"</a> is a list that is "indiscriminate, or of interest only to a very restricted number of people." This is neither, despite your presumptuous statement that it is "obvious" that it is. First, it is not indiscriminate, as it deals with a very specific subject. Second, baseball isn't exactly something with only a cult following. Millions of people watch Major League Baseball and teams like the Twins. Lots of people enjoy Twins broadcasts, and lots of people would find it entertaining to read a list of Blyleven's inappropriate comments assembled into one place. Just because something is amusing does not mean it is listcruft or unencyclopedic. I was only able to think of a few examples offhand, but this list will grow as long as Blyleven is in the broadcast booth. Also, I wasn't citing sources to legitimize the article -- the article is already legitimate -- but because I was trying to follow proper Wikipedia protocol. (Although I suppose it may have been in the back of my mind that somebody like you would have a hair trigger on the delete button.) And, <a href="../../../p/o/p/User%7EPopcorn2008_8263.html" title="User:Popcorn2008">Popcorn2008</a>, I don't think this would work as part of Blyleven's article. This list could get quite long, and as such, it would overwhelm the Blyleven article. It is a discrete subset of info on Blyleven, and seems worthy of a separate page -- and particularly well-suited to be a list page. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkyfry_2cab.html" title="User:Sparkyfry">Sparkyfry</a> 04:40, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Precisely because he makes these comments so often, it is indiscriminate, which here is close to meaning "large". The tag does not apply to the subject of the list, but to its content. See <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, under "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information". Also, "very restricted" tends to mean that this is interesting only to people intensely interested in the specific subject. "Lots of people enjoy Twins broadcasts," but the vast majority of them are probably not interested in whatever Blyleven has said in the past. I should add to the deletion rationale that the title is POV and applies a POV to the items on the list, and the article is very close to a db-attack.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I see no citations of news coverage indicating that these comments were called into question in the Minneapolis-area media. As it is, it's inherently subjective.

<li><b>Nodding approvingly at article</b> Just to respond to a couple points. First: "Inappropriate" may seem like a subjective word, but I think the examples I've cited are pretty clearly objectively inappropriate. Is anybody really arguing that jokes about anal sex and public masturbation are appropriate for broadcasts of the supposedly family-friendly sport of baseball? "Inappropriate" seemed like the best word to title this article. Reasonable people should agree on what's inappropriate. Second: how would you guys suggest sourcing this material? Other commenters and I remember the comments clearly, but there isn't exactly a permanent record of it out there. The Paula Abdul comment made the local newspaper, but that is now gone unless you pay for Lexis-Nexis. Sports blogs seemed like the next best thing, and only publicly available place referring to the comments. Plus, Deadspin is a relatively reliable, well-read blog. I can't think of any other place to cite. Suggestions? <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkyfry_2cab.html" title="User:Sparkyfry">Sparkyfry</a> 03:38, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Our policy is fairly clear on this that unless they make the news they're not WP material. (I added the Strib source to the Paula Abdul episode. That's good enough as it is.) I don't have much of a problem with the word "inappropriate" if it is used by various sources, but I'm also not sure why this should be a stand-alone article. The BB article is short enough as it is, and we routinely include a "Controversy" section in bio articles where the subject has been the target of criticism in the media. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 17:40, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Apparently, someone redirected the article that everyone above me was voting on, and then someone else overwrote the redirect. Because of this, I cannot speedy delete the vandalized new mess. Apparently, the votes above refer to <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth_Ministry_%28Evangelical%29_9960.html" title="Youth Ministry (Evangelical)">Youth Ministry (Evangelical)</a>. This is why <b>you should not do the redirect while an article is under AfD consideration</b> because someone else is likely to screw it up. Also note that the new title violates the naming conventions. Ugh. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:20, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Major rewrite</b> would be necessary at the new title, including a change of name. The article is highly POV, and I don't mean the point of view of "evangelicals." First, that particular term has been hijacked in the last 30 years or so, so what this article is about is a single tradition of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregationalism.html" title="Congregationalism">Congregationalism</a>, which is not all of the evangelical churches. There is not nearly enough objectivity in the present article. That said, it is not a deletion policy violation <i>at a proper title.</i> Note that "proper title" means "Youth ministry (Evangelical)" (miniscule second term). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:25, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree with Geogre that the text of the article should not have been moved while under AfD, particularly to <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth_Ministry_%28Evangelical%29_9960.html" title="Youth Ministry (Evangelical)">Youth Ministry (Evangelical)</a> which is not even capitalized correctly ("ministry" should be in lower case). I would prefer that the content be restored to what it was before, then if the AfD ends with a keep result, add information about non-evangelical youth ministry to the main article, breaking out the evangelical content to a separate article only when the article gets too big. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 14:32, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is a major headache, but the move should probably stay as it is, other than the naming conventions. I specifically noted to HellaNorCal that it shouldn't be moved during AfD, anyway. I would be in favor of renaming the article to match naming conventions for now. In the long run, the two articles should probably be merged and the POV content of the current one deleted.

<li>Hello UU! I probably did generalize a <i>bit</i> too much there with "inherently", but the term is overwhelmingly Christian in application.

However, <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth_ministry.html" title="Youth ministry">Youth ministry</a> is a much broader concept than just an aspect of christianity.

<li>Quick review: Previously speedy deleted as a db-empty. However, the rationales in the deletion debate leading up to that referred to notability. Notability is still an issue with this version.

<li><b>Delete</b>: There are multiple schools by this title, so, first, the article should not stay at this name unless it so completely whomps all the others in fame as to be a national term. it doesn't and isn't.

The school <i>may</i> have a quality that makes it truly remarkable, but there is absolutely <i>nothing in the article</i> that suggests it.

<p>This is a commercial company offering a commercially available product that they claim is based on a new mixture of hydrogen/oxygen. Whether or not the central claims of the company are true or false, having an article serves to inform interested parties that there is a debate regarding it's validity. On that basis alone the article should remain. Those who claim it is based on pseudo-science have the same opportunity to refute the claims as those who believe in the validity of the claims. Deleting this article serves no purpose whatsoever. Having an article allows disagreement to exist. Funny how a book burning always involves bringing someone else's books to the bonfire.</p>
<p>Additional thought: those who feel the claims are invalid have the opportunity to have the products tested independently in a lab of their choice. Contact the manufacturer for details. If you feel the product does not do what it claims, then your beef at least in the USA is with the Federal Trade Commission. www.ftc.gov</p>

<li><b>KEEP</b> I am just reporting information here people! Thats all!! So why dont you just delete the article if you are so offended by the scientific information.. Fact is, the US Army and CREDIBLE Sources are looking into the technology. You can view a video produced by FOX news and CNN and other news sources on the Website. Its not pseudoscience. It is a scientific fact that you can verify by contacting Hydrogen Technology Application Inc. They are based in Clearwater Florida.

<li><b>Delete</b> - there are many well sourced articles in Wikipedia on the use of alternative fuels and hydrogen fuel that explain all this very clearly. There are a lot of companyies trying to cash in on people's desire to believe there is an alternative to fossil fuel. Jacks 13:17, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> People still don't seem to be grasping the content of this article. Regardless of your individual view on alternative energy. Whether you agree or disagree with the concept of hydrogen technology, alternative fuels or its implications, you are neglecting the fact that the gas is a real substance, which has already been created by Hydrogen Technology Applications Inc. and tested by governmental agencies. This is a new gas containing both H2 and O2, as cited by a scientific journal. For individuals to be "voting" on whether or not this article is a fake, is to deny the completely factual information presented in the article. You can verify this information via the US Patent Office. Patent application number is: 20060075683. You can also consult the various media sources outlined in the section of Sources used for the article. For verification of the information I suggest you call the media who reported on the story including CNN, FOX news and NBC. But for people to be Blindly suggesting that the article be deleted because the haven't heard of the technology or they dont agree with the technology is obsurd and wrong. That would be like saying we should delete an article on abortion because people are offended by it. Do some research on the topic prior to suggesting an article be deleted.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It is not the province of the self-appointed Wikipedia deletion militia to decide the truth or falseness of new developments in science and technology, only to decide if the article has a noteworthy subject and verifiable documentation. Leaading scientists of the day look really stupid now for scoffing at demonstrations of Hertzian wave production by Thomas Edison and David Hughes in the 1870's, and leading newspapers scoffed at Robert Goddard's ideas of rockets in space, and the electrical transformer was derided as a perpetual motion machine by the patent office. When the promotors of the device publish all details, science, being self correcting, will or will not replicate their findings. Subjectively, it seems unlikely to me that this is a newn energy source. A new energy source using water as its raw ingredient is certainly newsworthy, but a feature on tv is not a very well refereed verifiable source. Nor is "being looked at by the government." Local stations will run any absurdity to perk up ratings. No Wall Street Journal or New York Times article? Nothing in a book from a reputable publisher, or a refereed scientific journal like Nature? A gas that FreeRepublic said appears to be Brown's gas or water vapor? Come back when you have references to other than your own press releases, your own web sites, and "patent pending" claims. Of course there are several well known scientific errors, frauds, and hoaxes in Wikipedia, labelled as such. See <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polywater.html" title="Polywater">polywater</a>, <a href="../../../n/_/r/N_ray.html" title="N ray">n ray</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_fusion.html" title="Cold fusion">cold fusion</a><a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Experiment_3d3d.html" title="Philadelphia Experiment">Philadelphia Experiment</a>,<a href="../../../p/e/r/Perpetual_motion.html" title="Perpetual motion">Perpetual motion</a> (including several patented "free energy motors'"). So this product being water vapor or Brown's gas does not prevent it having a Wikipedia article, but not one at this early stage which can be cited for promotion purposes.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 17:18, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Firstly, I am not promoting anything. I just heard about this story on the news, and I looked it up on wikipedia to find out more information. When no wiki article was found, I decided to do some research and create an article on the topic. I had no idea it would create such a unwarranted controversy. I am not affiliated in any way with Hydrogen Technology Applications, so I reject the notion that I am trying to promote them. I simply want to be objective and report the truth as it is currently known. I dont understand why people believe that this article should be deleted when the information in the article is factually based. I have outlined the sources of the information. I am reporting on what I have found in the news articles and on the scientific journal which I posted above. Regardless of the positions of others on the scientific data, I have done all the things that are required for the article. I have fully researched the topic, I have posted the scientific data, I have cited all my sources of that data, and I have included links to credible media sources. I dont know what else I can do to prove that this is not something I just up and decided to make up to fool people. It seems to me that the people who are recommeding deletion have some sort of unknown agenda to keep this information from being viewed on wikipedia. If there are other reasons to delete this article I would love to hear them, otherwise, I think that Edison is right, people are just acting as "self-appointed Wikipedia deletion militia to decide the truth or falseness of new developments in science and technology". <a href="../../../b/o/y/User%7EBoyohio02_eaa1.html" title="User:Boyohio02">boyohio02</a> 18:02, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, if I'm a allowed a vote as the relister. This is just way, way too detailed information for an encyclopedia. There's a point where you have to say, if a really serious researcher needs minutae about a particular subject they'll have to find it off this Wiki, and we should provide <i>links</i> to that material. We can't swallow the entire world wide web. (As to copyvio, you'd think this would have come from NASA and thus be public domain, but a quick string search does indeed bring back only the private site [<a href="http://www.unexplainable.net/artman/publish/article_1571.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.unexplainable.net/artman/publish/article_1571.shtml" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>, so I don't know what's up with that.) <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 05:58, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Recommend merge</b> into a single timeline. Monthly breakdowns aren't needed. Copyvio issues need to be taken care of. I do not recommend a delete, however, unless we can preserve the basic facts somewhere for the creation of a master timeline. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 23:35, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - the work in doing this is going to be enormous. Checking down the text for copyvios will take long enough. Unless someone is happy to undertake this I stll think that deletion followed by the creation of a single timeline article, if anyone wants to do this, is the cleanest solution. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 01:53, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - seriously, guy, you need to go and read what Wikipedia is actually about. It's not a webhost for your "private article" and stuff you "need to make a flash series". It's an <b>encyclopaedia</b>, every page of which is accessible to millions of people who come here looking for information. A page such as this is, I'm sorry to say, a complete waste of Wikipedia server space and an abuse of what the facilities exist for. If you want to host all that stuff online somewhere as a reference point for yourself and your friends, there are countless places you can do it - Wikipedia most certainly <i>isn't</i> one of them. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 11:06, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yup, I'm new to trying to write an article for Wikipedia, and I am operating in good faith. I don't know the proper rules to follow, but I'd like to try to make this right. I believe that EverythingCU.com is indeed notable under guideline 1 of WP:WEB in that EverythingCU.com has been featured in several non-trivial published works that are completely independent. These sources include several articles about EverythingCU.com and its brand event published in <a href="http://www.cutimes.com/contacts/default.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.cutimes.com/contacts/default.asp" rel="nofollow">CU Times</a>, a weekly magazine based out of Fairfield CT, as well as the Massachusetts Credit Union League's <a href="http://www.cucenter.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.cucenter.org/" rel="nofollow">monthly newsletter</a>, and the <a href="http://www.pcua.coop/communications/Keystone_Extra/2006/KE_feb17.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.pcua.coop/communications/Keystone_Extra/2006/KE_feb17.htm" rel="nofollow">Pennsylvania Credit Union Association's</a> web site. --<a href="../../../m/m/p/User%7EMmpartee_bbf8.html" title="User:Mmpartee">Mmpartee</a> 07:12, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Thanks for the nice response. Typically non-trivial published works would be things like the NY Times, Washington Post, Times of London, etc. I understand that this might be notable amongst credit professionals, but my feeling is that it does not meet Wikipedia inclusion standards (also see <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>). I'm sorry that this is your first experience with Wikipedia. It's pretty rough to have an article proposed for deletion. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:DodgerBlue;font-size:95%;"><b>alpha</b></span><span style="color:black; font-size:105%;"><b>Chimp</b></span></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b>laudare</b></a></sup> 07:37, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Neutral</b> (for now) - I do think this group is known among CU professionals, but I'm not sure. I do recall hearing of them in a couple of the volunteer activities I did with a CU a few months back. However generally a CEO doesn't create an article about their own organization. In any case, sources such as the Palo Alto Weekly are used as examples that establish notability in other (<a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>) guidelines. Also, I'm turned off that a marketing and branding expert has their first WP article about their organization. I'd ask that the article address why having 4k+ members or whatever makes them influential in substantial ways. I've been to a CU related workshop, and not every organization that puts such workshops together and has a large mailing list is notable. <a href="../../../s/m/m/User%7ESmmurphy_e3bb.html" title="User:Smmurphy">Smmurphy</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/m/User_talk%7ESmmurphy_5e09.html" title="User talk:Smmurphy">Talk</a>)</sup> 07:45, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> This is a wonderful and fascinating exchange, and I would like to thank all of the editors of wikipedia for being kind, thoughtful, energetic, and rigorous with this and all other WP articles. Yes, I am guilty as charged for being the creator of this particular online community/web site/business, so I must announce and make public my bias here. I also want to state that I very much respect WP, and even more now that I have learned (first hand!) about the standards for inclusion. I am reading the discourse on the notability guidelines and find it extremely fascinating. I see the arguments on both sides. Because I respect WP so much, my first contribution was a very gentle toe in the water; I added an acronym to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_company_name_etymologies.html" title="List of company name etymologies">list of company name etymologies</a>. I also want to thank the editors for being kind to a newbie. I have read some WP literature on <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">being kind to newbies</a>, and the importance of that to encourage more participation. I am heavily biased in regards to EverythingCU.com's place in the world, so please bear with me as I make an attempt to illuminate this corner of the financial world. Certainly <a href="../../../c/r/e/Credit_unions.html" title="Credit unions">credit unions</a> deserve their article, and each of the 9000 credit unions in the U.S. probably do not each deserve their own article. However there is a large system and network that supports credit unions in the U.S., such as the government agency <a href="../../../n/c/u/NCUA_e15b.html" title="NCUA">NCUA</a>, which is the credit union equivalent of the <a href="../../../f/d/i/FDIC_4189.html" title="FDIC">FDIC</a>. Also important is the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Credit_Union_National_Association_d2fc.html" title="Credit Union National Association">Credit Union National Association</a> (CUNA), and most states have a credit union league or association. There remain a handful of Corporate Credit Unions (i.e. a credit union's credit union) , and each of them are most likely worthy of inclusion. I would assert that each state's CU League is worthy of inclusion; every one of them is unique and offers significant benefits to their credit union constituents and therefore millions of people who benefit from credit union membership. Credit Union Executives Society (CUES) and the National Association of Federal Credit Unions (NAFCU) are two more very significant organizations devoted to the cause of helping credit unions and the professionals that run them. The credit union movement is also a worldwide movement, and credit unions are significant in many countries such as Canada, Ireland, Australia, and in many developing countries and economies. The World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU) based in Madison WI furthers the industry throughout the world. While I would like to argue that EverythingCU.com is of equal significance to the credit union industry as these other institutions, it would be inappropriate of me to do so since my bias is clear. But I would be happy to address specific concerns in this matter when asked, so I will attempt to do that with as little bias as possible. I will end this comment with two further thoughts: I will not take personal offense if it is decided that the EverythingCU.com article should be deleted (thank you again to everyone for being kind in the deletion opinions). I also see that there is much additional information on credit unions that ought to be added (such as articles about CUNA Mutual Group, CUES, NAFCU, WOCCU, Edward Filene, Dora Maxwell, Louise McCarren Herring, more history of credit unions), and I will do what I can to insure that appropriate material is added and edited for this particular industry in general. Thank you! --<a href="../../../m/m/p/User%7EMmpartee_bbf8.html" title="User:Mmpartee">Mmpartee</a> 14:38, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I think in this case, this entry needs to be weighed for its significance in the industry it serves. If there are indeed 9000 credit unions in the US, then this site serves almost half of them. I think that is significant and notable. --<font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 18:17, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: The arguments put forth here (and, incidentally, why are the claims here and not in the article?) are unmoving. Small towns have histories, and what is now a dot on the map was once a major battlefield or rail line. Games, on the other hand, have recent histories and ongoing development. When the game reaches ubiquity and is driving comment in other (off-line) sources, it will be time to explain it to the world in an encyclopedia.

This particular AfD as well as the referenced <a href="../../../b/a/t/BattleMaster_2436.html" title="BattleMaster">BattleMaster</a> AfD are part of a recent effort to tar any and every browser-based strategy game with the "non-notable" brush, mainly by a severely misguided attempt to apply <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. I urge editors trumpeting "non-notable" to <a href="../../../u/c/s/WP%7EUCS_6cee.html" title="WP:UCS">use common sense</a> and to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_experiment_in_rule_making" title="WP:NOT">consider the spirit of the law</a> in these cases. The reasoning and spirit behind the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guideline is to keep Wikipedia from being flooded with vanity pages, random fan sites and the like. This reasoning is sound and can be put quite simply: Anyone can create a vanity web page. Anyone with a copy of MS Paint can create a web comic. Very few can create a successful browser-based game.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The creation of the sort of sites against which <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> attempts to guard is a trivial matter. However, there is nothing trivial about creating a robust, multi-player game such as those in question. Creating such a game that manages to attract a user-base outside your own small group of friends is a feat in and of itself. Creating a game that actually attracts thousands of players and has hundreds online at any given time should be considererd <i>extremely</i> notable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please note that I'm not arguing for the inclusion of any and every online game that comes down the pipe, but each of the games that I've seen proposed for deletion in the last few days has a substantial user base. If the editors in favor of deletion honestly believe that these games are as dime-a-dozen as the vanity pages and such that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is actually designed for, then perhaps they'd care to point me to the thousands of browser-based games that I'm apparently missing. Better yet, perhaps they can whip up a robust multi-player browser-based game as an example of the trivial and "non-notable" nature of these games (bonus points if it attracts any measure of user base outside their own circle of friends). In the time it takes them to do that, I'll be over here churning out hundreds of vanity pages, a few <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">"Lost"</a> fansites, and a webcomic or 50. --<a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrummerx_ef6b.html" title="User:Grummerx">grummerx</a> 23:34, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: That's a valid question and warrants further discussion by the community at large. One of the points I've been trying to make is that in the absence of a clear line, it's up to editors to use common sense in assessing the merit of a particular article. It should also be noted that without a clear line, it's far better to err on the side of leniency rather than rashly deleting legitimate information from Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrummerx_ef6b.html" title="User:Grummerx">grummerx</a> 01:32, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well actually they are well known by some of the top tiers in the gaming industry. You cant go higher than major nelson and yet they seem to be best friends with him. Also this is not an advertisment but merely the posting of the current and past state of gamerandy. Tell me what other pages dont seem like advertisement.

<li>I would also like to weigh in. I find this strange that I get notified for advertising, when <a href="../../../v/g/n/VGN_Radio_565c.html" title="VGN Radio">VGN Radio</a> is filled with advertising and doesn't contain an NPOV in a lot of what it says, especially with the last sentence in the Synopsis, and that one doesn't get any notices. There are numerous other too. I don't mean for this to sound like some childish "well if he can do it, why can't I?" type of thing. If I can't do it, then I accept it, but I feel that it would be a tad unbalanced and unfair to do it for one article and not for another. I don't mean this to sound like I'm attacking Wikipedia, but I don't understand why this site has different ways of dealing with articles for committing the same offense. The notability thing I'm working on, so don't delete it. I and other Wikipedians have been working on that. Just be sure not to delete it and I swear that I will try my hardest to bring it up to Wikipedian standards. I'm trying my best here. Tyeman64 is right about the notibility. Scoring an interview with Major Nelson is a noteworthy thing. He's also right about another thing. What on Wikipedia isn't advertising? I see links to celebrity web pages and even porn sites on Wikipedia, but that isn't advertising? I fail to see how the Gamerandy.com entry is any worse than those. I and other Wiki people will try our best to bring this article up to proper standards, but please do not delete. Just give me a chance. <a href="../../../v/g/a/User%7EVgamer101_8c41.html" title="User:Vgamer101">Vgamer101</a> 04:26, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>True, I could do that, but I don't want to get trouble started and have someone get irritated at me. I'll just leave a comment in their discussion section telling them to fix it otherwise I won't have much choice but to nominate it for deletion. Anyways, I'm currently trying to drum up some support to build up the entry as you can already see in it's page history with others such as Tyeman64, GamerAndy Fan, and MrD86. I'll try my best to bring this article up to it's absolute best potential, I just am having trouble at the moment coming up with and collecting the right info, although I am doing well in trying to find it. I'm currently collecting info for it. I would like for this article to stay up so I can make it better. I'm hoping I can, but you'd need to keep the article up for me to do that. <a href="../../../v/g/a/User%7EVgamer101_8c41.html" title="User:Vgamer101">Vgamer101</a> 05:15, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>PROD is <i>meant</i> to be removed. Griping about it in AfD nominations only encourages the perception that it cannot be removed by the General Public (a misconception that has already caused a lot of unnecessary stress when it was plaguing CSD). Also, since <i>AfD is not a vote</i>, you really don't need to add that big bold thingy at the end there before your signature. Nominations often set the tone of an AfD discussion, and a poor nomination is just <i>asking</i> for the ensuing discussion to be equally worthless. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 12:03, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Not bad, I agree, but the article is advertising, which is a deletion guideline failure, and the company isn't so astonishingly successful that I feel moved to motion for it to go to cleanup. If we had gotten our first article on Expedia and it had been an ad, we could have confidence that any volunteer at Clean Up would have a strong enough idea to neutralize it. I think this sort of article, on the other hand, languishes or just gets wikifying at Cleanup, and that's not good enough. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:31, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was the author of this article. I will admit that it needs clean up. I will admit that I made typos. Rjensen is correct, I did mean after the revolution. Geogre is also correct in saying that this article may be poorly named and titled. I will abstain from making a vote upon whether it should be kept, I have an obvious bias. But, I would like to say this. Most of references given to refute this article are based upon the interpretations of facts by authors. I have yet to see any <b>factual</b> evidence to refute the article. I'll admit that some statements were said from a point of view that was than neutral, but isn't this what Wikipedia is for? I contribute some, with good intentions, and somebody aids in the repairing of my mistakes, with good intentions. I'll make some changes, obviously I've already found two that should have been done different and BusterD said that he was willing to help. Honestly, I'm a freshly graduated high school student trying to add to a resource I appreciate. Am I looking for sympathy from that to be projected on my article? No. I'm simply saying I have stuff to learn, and the article has things to change. I don't see why it should be deleted instead of repaired without solid evidence that refutes the references that I have given.--67.142.130.29 04:27, 2 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> I yield to wisdom gained through years of experience in what BusterD said, you may choose to let it be deleted. These attacks on either my competence or my intentions are definately not worth this. This article is just not worth the work, nor the defense of it, against such a cynical and over-defensive community. While I will still contribute, I will say this. You know why <b>most</b> of you end up doing <b>most</b> of the work? Because you'd rather have a 'competent' friend create an article than repair an article created by an 'incompetent' new-comer. I advocate for immediate deletion of this article.</li>

<li>I believe this article should be repaired, not deleted. While some users may rant wildly, I'm not convinced the original author hasn't something meaningful to bring to the discussion.

<dd>The article is full of howlers (opening sentence: "After the American Civil War, Britain was left with an ambition to again unite the colonies and Europe under British rule dubbed 'The United States of Europe'." -- he means after the Revolution and the sentence is wholly false. Scholars since 1919 have known the "alliance" was a myth (see multiple citations on TALK page from English and Russian scholarly journals). Author is unaware of any scholarship but pads the bibliography with rare books and archival sources that it is unlikely he used--thus trying to fake it for unaware readers.

<li><b>Delete</b>: It doesn't justify deletion? Well, how about the fact that it's "personal pronoun + adjective + noun?" Us? We are in alliance? We are in alliance with "russian" something? This thing would need to be moved to US/Russian alliance. Secondly, it would need to be cleaned up. Third, it would need to be researched. Fourth, it would need to be cited. Just how much work are you folks willing to defer to "somebody else, some time, some where" just to avoid the very obvious conclusion that this article does not satisfy any of our criteria. Finally, did any of you actually <i>look through the Wikipedia</i> to see whether we already discuss this topic? We do, you know. Several places. Several times.

<p>I'm sorry. I normally trust AfD voters, but when an AfD is this low in the list and I see habitual "keep everything oh my gosh please don't be mean with just enough work it could one day be great" as the only votes, it's time to act. This is a hoax article, and it is duplicate material. If a real argument for keeping appears by the time the nomination is 48 hr old, I'll stay my hand. Otherwise, I'm just going to delete and close it. <i>If you don't read the article, don't vote on its AfD.</i> <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:45, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I will give it a weak benefit of the doubt and say that those portions which can be sourced can be kept, but <i>if and only if</i> that happens before this AfD closes and it's not duplicated elsewhere on Wikipedia. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 02:41, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Initial reading suggests that this isn't so much an outright hoax as it is some amateur historian's original research (the talk page comment <i>I have as many references supporting the informal alliance as you have refuting them</i> tells me that the author doesn't quite understand the <a href="../../../n/o/_/WP%7ENo_original_research_1420.html" title="WP:No original research">WP:No original research</a> policy. And a long bibliography, while impressive-looking, doesn't mean much unless the references are connected to specific points (how the hell <i>do</i> John Quincy Adams's memoirs connect to a so-called alliance thirteen years after his death?). --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 04:21, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as cranky original research or hoaxness.

<li><b>Delete</b> Lots of people thought there was an alliance until scholars in 1919 proved otherwise.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: You're right, Karwynn, it <i>could</i> have been ignorance, and I should not have been so definitive in calling it a hoax. This topic is a ripe one for hoaxes, however, and I was frustrated by the low-activity AfD listings beyond #50 on a list that can be decided by a single vote. I thought this was a particularly egregious example of an obvious delete and may have been biting the author when I meant merely to generate some folks to read it skeptically and not have us host more misinformation than we already do. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:46, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Title is malformed. Should be <b>List of illegal weapons in professional wrestling</b>.</li>
<li>Title is borderline insulting, as anyone who knows anything about wrestling knows that the only thing that's actually illegal in wrestling is breaking character during a show. The term the creator is looking for is "foreign objects".</li>
<li>Article is heavily biased towards turn-of-the-millennium wrestling and WWE wrestlers (where's Ric Flair's roll of dimes, made famous while he was well outside the WWE?). The foreign object tradition of wrestling goes deep, to long before the era of broken kayfabe.</li>
<li>List is pointless -- as pointed out by prodder, literally anything can be used as a foreign object in wrestling.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. While this term may be relatively new, this is not a new concept. The article is about a power play that has been attempted throughout history, with only a few notable successes. In grade 11 economics, my class discussed similar strategies for macroeconomics, but I havent been able to find a more common term for the concept; if there is an exiting politics article for the same, I wouldnt mind if this article should be merged into another. Personally I think that this page would be a good list of possibly unverifiable attempts of any government to attempt this type of thing. The article currently focuses on current, more questionable attempts, but that can be corrected by expanding the list into earlier centuries, and by including more failures to balance the POV. IMO this doesn't classify as original research in entirety: the term isnt coined by the contributor; for most of the examples, there is external opinion that this strategy was employed (of course it is un-cited in many cases but that doesnt mean it was original research); while it may be a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologisms</a>, it is worth including in Wikipedia as a record of either peoples perceptions or reality -- a rename or merge would solve this aspect of the problem. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">Jayvdb</a> 14:34, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. An article about such a controversial subject area should <i>report</i> opinions but not <i>adopt</i> them. This article meets that test.

<dd>Reliable sources for non-mainstream topics exist all the time. For example, one can easily find articles in the New York Times that discuss creationism. One can find a few articles that mention the 9/11 conspiracy theories and full articles discussing the claim that the previous US presidential election was rigged. David Ickes himself has been reported in multiple major newspapers.

<li><b>Keep</b> ... unless you need the space for more relevant articles. This <i>is</i> a concept which is out there and a page detailing it <i>does</i> give an overview of the concept. Simply because the concept fails to hold to <i>any</i> Popperian sensibility, does not mean that people will not need to be briefed on the concept. It is better defined here, where neutral and contrary people can get to it and make comment on it, than leaving it for people to read a bunch of conspiracy theorists when all they may want is the gist of the concept. It works the same way that it might be more helpful for people to get a rundown of the <i>Elders of Zion</i> than to read the thing. There is a large difference between the representation of a concept and claiming it is factual. <i>Elders</i> is not reputed to be factual, nor for that matter is considered well-researched or any of those other criteria people are claiming this needs to have. And yet, I would bet you have it here. Not because it is <i>factual</i> but because you are detailing the thing itself: a book or concept. As long as the article doesn't look like Icke and Jones could have written it, it really shouldn't be a problem. Otherwise I echo Sertrel and a couple others. Spoon!!</li>

<dd>Another one just spaming links and hoping some will pass. Wikipedia NOR does not stop any other representations of minority views, and there are only opinions stated in the article, an all the sources are used to show who holds the opinions. There is <b>still</b> no one that has explained with a <b>good arguement</b> why RS is relevant to quoting a <b>opinion</b> from the opinion holder. Is there anyone <i>doubting</i> that the people quoted hold those opinions? No? Then i gues there is no unreliablity in the sources. As simple as that. This is nothing more than the majority bashing a minority view. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 10:55, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Further, who cares who holds the opinions, this article is about a <b>term</b>, and the people voting has not even addressed why the term is unencyclopedic. It is not a neologism if it was used PROMINENTLY in a University in 1999, and is growingly used now in 2006. Notability is not in question, so there is nothing more that people not liking the content of the article using the afd as a source of venting their disslike, instead of actually doing some edits. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 10:58, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bro, if you view there is "some level of notability but the article may be an attempt to spread a meme" isnt the prefered solution to edit the article to fix whatever problem there is, instead of leting it get deleted? Afd's is not the way to correct content disputes. You just cited it being used in 1998 by somebody else than Icke, this totaly demolishes the neology claim.

<li><b>Keep</b> as notable conspiracy terminology, found in conspiracy sources. If anyone hasn't noticed, the term conspiracy theory is being used in the media more and more every day, the NYTimes, Chicago Tribune, CSPAN, on every right-winger soap box trying to trash them, etc. While many may want to make CTs go away, they are instead growing more popular by the second, and like it or not, Alex Jones is also growing in popularity by the instant. The question one may ask is why. But if we are denied the info to do proper research about who they are and what they are saying and why, at places like wikipedia, we won't be making the CTs go away, we just will understand them less. I don't agree with anything from Icke and don't especially adore Jones, but there is a massive gravitating towards CTs for a reason. Is it because the public knows they are being lied to, as the Pentagon just showed us? Or is something else going on. Pretending that these people are non-notable because they aren't the subjects of Newsweek and the WSJ isn't going to make them go away. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBov_3265.html" title="User:Bov">bov</a> 18:12, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am not trying to discredit anyone here: remember that, in my nomination, I stated clearly that this isn't a vote. I was merely pointing out that this isn't a bad faith nomination, and that previous AfDs didn't have "keep" results, but "no consensus", rather. I have no problem with that either: I was merely clarifying my own motivations, which I am entitled to do, am I not?</dd>
<dd>And "circumspect" means <i>exactly</i> what I think it means, thankyouverymuch (said Humpty Dumpty to Alice). Maybe "dictionary.com" doesn't think so, but I just looked it up in a <i>real</i> dictionary (you know, with pages?), and am satisfied that I used it correctly.

<li><b><strike>Neutral</strike></b> - It's worth noting that the standards used by <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> would lead us to delete 95% of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_multiplayer_browser_games.html" title="List of multiplayer browser games">List of multiplayer browser games</a> since very few assert notability outside of the number of players they have (which doesn't qualify). Although, looking through the list, about 95% are listed for deletion. A shame if you ask me, because there are a number of people who have put in a <i>lot</i> of effort creating these fairly detailed entries. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatty_j_b6d2.html" title="User:Matty j">Matty j</a> 05:37, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - After reviewing the standards set out in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and taking note of <a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">Peephole</a>'s obvious vendetta against articles related to this genre of game, I've changed my mind. The only real standard of notability relevant to these games is the number of players (a non-accepted standard according to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>), and some of these games are very notable in that regard. This game, for instance, has had rounds of tens of thousands of players, as I recall (my brother used to play it). These articles should still fall under the verifiability criteria, but that's a different concern. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatty_j_b6d2.html" title="User:Matty j">Matty j</a> 17:07, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>. I agree on Matty j, I understand the rules and know they are needed. However, everybody knows Wikipedia will always be subject to subjectivity and therefor cannot be considered a reliable source. Therefore I see no reason why articles that are usefull to a reasonable community should be deleted onlyk because they can not be verified and or are common knowledge.

<li><b>Comment</b> Verifiability (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) is an official wikipedia policy... --<a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">Peephole</a> 14:21, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Most of the information is verifiable via the official Dominion website which is listed at the top of the 'links' section. From there, past round-winners can be obtained through two searches of valhalla, first a search of each round, looking for the top dominion, then a search of nickname, which can match the nickname to the dominion. For example the largest dominion in round 30 was Vrijheid. If you search for "Blackreign" then Vrijheid will be shown as his dominion in round 30. Hence round winners can be verified this way. The acronyms/terms &amp; definitions are the dominion communitys short-handed way of spelling many commonly used saying from the "rules" (aka "scribes") which are accessible via the main dominion page. These abbreviations can be seen in use on the messageboards. They are effectively a form of 'dominion language'. Asking for this wikipedia page to be verified by a journal article is ridiculous. Could peephole offer a proper explanation of how this could be resolved instead of just attempting to cause unneeded trouble? Deranged 03:27, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> All those lists are pure fancruft and don't belong in an encyclopedic article. If you want to improve the article, delete those and find reliable sources reporting on the game so we can verify its notability and decide if its notable enough to be kept on wikipedia. --<a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">Peephole</a> 15:08, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

The citation for such a use is one chapter, which is by a distinguished historian, but this does not constitute notability. "Neo-abolitionist" is itself a neologism, not recognized by the OED.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The term is indeed in current use--numerous examples cited below from recent scholarly and popular journals. Alas Wiki has some neo-confederates who hate and belittle the abolitionists but that is not good reason for removing an article that talks about the revival of abolitionist sentiment in the 1960s. It was Howard Zinn for example who wrote a famous book about the Civil Rights movement that identified them as "new abolitionists". ( <i>SNCC: The New Abolitionists</i> by Howard Zinn (1st ed 1964, new ed 2002). The term has been regularly used by scholars of slavery/Civil War/reconstruction for some 40 years. The question of who are the "new abolitionists" is discussed for example (June 2006) in the forum for historians, "Cliopatria" at HNN. It is used by librarians <a href="http://marklogic.lib.uchicago.edu:8002/subject-browse.xqy?c=n" class="external autonumber" title="http://marklogic.lib.uchicago.edu:8002/subject-browse.xqy?c=n" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>; it is used in the civil rights community <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1264/is_10_30/ai_59210925/pg_3" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1264/is_10_30/ai_59210925/pg_3" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>, The magazines use the term, as "This general perspective on the sectional conflict is already well represented by the Neoabolitionist school of Early American historians, and informs important works by scholars such as Paul Finkelman, Leonard Richards, Donald Robinson, and William Wiecek. Wills lacks the deep understanding of the issues that has made these authors' work indispensable; his book is therefore a major disappointment." from <i>National Review</i> Dec 2003 at <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_24_55/ai_n13606723" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_24_55/ai_n13606723" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> The scholarly journals use it: <i>The American Historical Review</i> (Feb 2005) p 215 ("the iconoclastic historian Stanley M.

<li>Pmanderson has a vague complaint. His opening sentence says it's "infrequently used" --but a quick check of JSTOR shows it is in current use by the major history journals. It is also used in high-brow popular journals (such as <i>National Review.</i>) The second sentence (The citation for such a use is one chapter) is false--the article gives numerous cites in context. It's a weak complaint to say "Neo-abolitionist" is itself a neologism"--well yes it was a variiation of a slogan invented arounf 1910 by the NAACP. In reference to historians it has been used by established scholars (like Pulitzer prize winners) for 40 years. The sentence "Most of the article is a miscellaneous collection of information" is false-the article goes in some depth into the historiography of slavery and reconstruction, and keeps its focus on the main issues. The sentence "many of them pre-dating the 1960's" is false" (there are two cites pre 1960--when the NAACP use is discussed and when Vann Woodward said (in 1974) "by the 1950s a neoabolitionist mood prevailed among historians of slavery" <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 19:10, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Some recent usage examples from leading journals: 1) "Because Hummel also places slavery front and center in the approach to war, his early chapters resemble a standard (and well-crafted) neo-abolitionist account." [Reviews in American History 32.2 (2004) 184-195]; 2) "the hints of modern humanistic sensibilities sensed by neo-abolitionist Anglophone commentators" Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History 5:3 2004 by Joseph C. Miller; 3) "longstanding scholarly precedents buttress Goodman's claims, set in the 1960s by James McPherson, Howard Zinn, Martin Duberman and other neo-abolitionist historians when first picturing the abolitionists as racial egalitarians." [Reviews in American History 27.3 (1999) 397-405 by James Stewart] 4) "The problem is not that Carry Me Back is generically neo-abolitionist but, rather, that it swallows too uncritically the abolitionists' worldview. The book has a tendency to coast on abolitionist logic, rather than striking out in new interpretive directions."

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. This is a close one - while Mangojuice certainly has the weight of words, his main argument was not left unaddressed and, as the only other opinion to follow it was 'delete', I don't believe it was persuasive enough to turn the consensus here into a mere majority.</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Sorry, but merely asserting that individual cards are non-notable doesn't make it so. Force of Will is a card of <i>major</i> importance, probably more important to the game than Black Lotus is. Black Lotus was merged into the power nine article because that is a group of cards that can be covered together, so a merge is sensible. There's a lot to say about this card, and plenty of sources to back it up. Check out <a href="http://www.magicdeckvortex.com/mdvarticle0113.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.magicdeckvortex.com/mdvarticle0113.htm" rel="nofollow">this article</a>, written <i>10 years</i> after the release of this card.

The card is on the <i>cover</i> of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1560251565/103-4421829-0905469?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1560251565/103-4421829-0905469?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">Magic - The Gathering: Official Deckbuilders' Guide</a>.

<li>Even if it were the most famous and amazing Magic card in existence, would that really be enough? It's still nothing more than an individual Magic card. Keeping even one article on a single card would set a bad precedent, I think. Fortunately, like Black Lotus and the Power Nine as you mention, there <i>is</i> a group of cards that can be covered together with Force of Will, namely the expansion <a href="../../../t/h/e/Alliances_%28Magic%7E_The_Gathering%29_9700.html" title="Alliances (Magic: The Gathering)">Alliances (Magic: The Gathering)</a>, which is really where any interesting information on FoW (like the helpful links you have provided) might best belong. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 17:35, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, it would be enough. We have articles on individual Pokemon. We have articles on individual Family Guy episodes. <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a> is clearly the basis of any deletion argument here... but what about <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper?</a> An article can be written only on a select few magic cards that doesn't run afoul of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and Force of Will is one of them. Okay, the current level of material in the article doesn't reflect this, but if I start compiling the info I found in those sources, it's going to need its own article, and it would deserve one. It doesn't make any sense to have a whole 3-4 paragraph section in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Alliances_%28Magic%7E_The_Gathering%29_9700.html" title="Alliances (Magic: The Gathering)">Alliances (Magic: The Gathering)</a> on one card: it's off topic, and would need to be spun off to its own article. But it's valid encyclopedia material. There's no reason we <i>couldn't</i> have an article just on the Black Lotus, it's just somewhat unnecessary because <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_Nine_b3c8.html" title="Power Nine">Power Nine</a> covers it. But go look at that article, and look at how the topic of Black Lotus is covered. I just can't see the argment that other comparably important cards don't deserve comparable coverage, but it doesn't make sense to merge them. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 18:12, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Let me put this another way. There's no point having an argument on the basis of our opinions, which is why <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> is not even an official guideline, and <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a> is just an essay. The core policies of the encyclopedia are <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information, but it doesn't take much of an argument to describe a topic as "discriminate." If we can have an article on Force of Will that abides by the key policies, why shouldn't we? <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 18:16, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't see how AGW is a different article than GW; <i>unless you presume that present warming is not anthropogenic.</i> However to make such a presumption is inherently pov.

<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>Merge</b>: I vote for deletion too, at least with regard to the "how to" section listing the features. As for the timeline of site modifications, I think some of the events on the timeline are relevant (for example, the fact that the introduction of groups and, later, photos, significantly changed the way people used the facebook). I had added a few of these things to the original article, and as people added more and more events to this list, it at some point split off into this separate article. Most of the timeline is really of questionable significance though, so I think the bulk of it can be safely scrapped. <a href="../../../n/b/s/User%7ENBS525_922c.html" title="User:NBS525">NBS525</a> 20:41, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Perhaps this article could be renamed Timeline of Facebook.com Modifications and the "FAQ"/"how to" section of it could be deleted.

<p>This article is a highbrow, but fairly transparent, hoax. Aside from the wildly unverifiable nature of the claims, we have the misuse of the word 'antecedent' and the fact that 'little about the purpose of the group is known'. The spelling of 'accompany' as 'accompanie' cited in an alleged early 19th-century document would have been staggeringly dated by that stage, too.

<li>This page is about the numbers in Genesis 5, not the creation myth. My Genesis 5 page is based on Chapter 7 in "Noah's Ark and the Ziusudra Epic" by Robert M. Best, published in 1999. Greensburger 16:26, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I have looked at the Amazon summary of the Robert Best book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0966784014/102-2036868-9492137?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0966784014/102-2036868-9492137?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>, and it seems like this may not be original research after all. If so, the article needs to be edited to make clear (at the beginning!) that this is reporting on someone else's theory. (No comment at this point on whether the theory is notable or not.) Also, the title of the article should be changed to make clear that the article is about Best's theory, not about Genesis 5 itself. <a href="../../../n/a/w/User%7ENawlinWiki_2ff5.html" title="User:NawlinWiki">NawlinWiki</a> 16:37, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm not sure what to say about this. Outright deletion seems too extreme a solution, as the topic of the ages of people mentioned in the Bible is something that has received verifiable treatment, and is a notable topic for younge earth creationists, many evolutionists and Bible scholars. If the article represents the particular views of certain researchers, this ought to be acknowledged in the text.

<li>In response to Scorpiondollprincess who wants facts, it is a fact that people do not live to be 969 years and father children when they are more than a century old. It is also a fact that people do father children in their late teens and early twenties and live to be 36, 75, and 93. It is also a fact there was a river flood in southern Iraq around 2900 BC that interrupted the Jemdet Nasr period in ancient <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumer.html" title="Sumer">Sumer</a> and resulted in a series of flood myths including <a href="../../../a/t/r/Atrahasis.html" title="Atrahasis">Atrahasis</a>, <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilgamesh_flood_myth.html" title="Gilgamesh flood myth">Gilgamesh flood myth</a>, <a href="../../../z/i/u/Ziusudra.html" title="Ziusudra">Ziusudra</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah.html" title="Noah">Noah</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - this is one of those articles where the writer seems to have wanted it to be deleted. I certainly don't blame any of "delete" nominators for seeing a hoax or nonsense here, in either the original version or the current stub. My two cents: First, the article is currently eminently deletable; second, I'd put the writer on notice I think there's a notable and worthy topic here, but it needs to be written ASAP. I've verifiied some of the awards on a national level <a href="http://www.aic.edu/files/133.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.aic.edu/files/133.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> (warning: PDF file), so per <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> I'm satisfied as to notability. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 10:54, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment (Do Not Delete)</b>. This game has a cult-like following. Those 4000+ players are insanely devoted to this game. I know this because I play Hyperiums, and have been playing it for +5 years and unless the game is shut down I don't forsee a time in which I'm not playing it. I contributed the bulk of this article and maintain it aswell. Everything on it is relevant to the explaination of the game.--ButtCheeks 7:02, 2 August 2006</li>
<li><b>Comment (Undecided)</b>. According to their website, they have around 4,300 active players. This one is too close to call for me. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorne_N._Melcher_ba8b.html" title="User:Thorne N. Melcher">Thorne N. Melcher</a> 22:48, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment (Do Not Delete)</b>. I have played this game for several years; the community has been large and active throughout this time. It has a fair amount of reputation in the online gaming community and attracts much more attention than many wikipedia entries.--Rhythmythyc 1:55, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment (Do Not Delete But Clean Up)</b>. Hyperiums is referenced in various only game directories like www.mpogd.com There has also been articles about it in magazines specialised in video games. Perhaps this artilce should be made shorter to only include a brief description of the game and it's main features. I will not argue whether the game is notable or not but accroding to <a href="../../../n/n/o/WP%7ENNOT_83a0.html" title="WP:NNOT">WP:NNOT</a> notability should not be a criteria for inclusion in wikipedida. And anyway as it can be seen here [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Search_engine_test#Alexa_test" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Search_engine_test#Alexa_test" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>] "Alexa rankings are not a part of the notability guidelines for web sites". So according to me the notability argument does not stand and part of the article is in accordance with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Therefore this artilce needs clean up but it should not be deleted. RajivShah 10:34, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: A recent reference of the game was in a french game magazine called "Jeux Video Magazine spéciale été" I do not have the URL of the website of the magazine yet (but I am working on getting it).

<li><b>Comment</b>: Peephole, even if all my web sources are not good I still have the french video game magazine called: "Jeux Vidéo Magazine hors-series été 2006".

<li>I only count a little over 4000 players (according to the ranking page). Appearantly, Hyperiums is a dying game. Appearantly people do not find the game *that* interesting anymore. Should we have articles about dying games on wikipedia? --86.84.19.107 10:39, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hyperiums is not a dying game. Because of the game play of Hyperiums there will points in time where there are a lot of players and others where there will be less players (like at the moment). In a month or two SC12 will spawn (those of you who play the game will know what I am talking about) and many players who left the game will come back (as this event will give them a better opportunity to restart).

</li>
<li><b>Not Sure</b>, I checked the pages referenced by this article, and these pages give much more information about this game than this wikipedia page actually does.

<li><b>General issue with gaming entries</b> - I took some time browsing Wikipedia's library of video/computer game entries and a lot, if not all of them are in violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, especially the spoilers and plot details as well as game character analysis in parts or as a whole. See for instance <a href="../../../i/r/e/Irenicus.html" title="Irenicus">Irenicus</a>, an article based 100% on original research and conjecture by the author - if any of this information is found somewhere on the 'net or in printed form (game reviews do not go into such detail), it comes from non-notable sources like fanpages or inofficial walkthroughs. What exactly makes top-selling games more equal than apparently less successful ones?
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, that particular article on <a href="../../../i/r/e/Irenicus.html" title="Irenicus">Irenicus</a> is indeed pretty awful. But there is an explanation for why a character like <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%28character%29_deef.html" title="Sonic the Hedgehog (character)">Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(character)</a>, for example, warrants his own article. It's because the characters of highly well-known video games are notable in and of themselves, independent of their games. Check out the 48 references on that article. Exactly where to draw the line is certainly a controversial issue, but top-selling games <i>are</i> more equal than others on wikipedia, because it is easier for them to satisfy the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> requirements.

<li>Contrary to the nomination, wrestling physics are <i>also</i> talked about elsewhere, as a little research would have shown. I encourage all of the above editors to <i>do the research</i> rather than to merely look at an article and think that it <i>might</i> be original research without making <i>any attempt whatsoever to check that</i>. It wasn't hard to find at least two sources discussing wrestling physics (in far more detail than this article does — indicating that this article can be significantly expanded) and I have no doubt (given that I didn't even get to the end of the first page of Google Web search results) that there are more to be found. The article needs significant improvement and cited sources. But deletion is not the way to do that. Ordinary editing is. There is the source material available to work from. <b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:28, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I dug into those Google results and found 65 actual pages returned (excluding the Wikipedia article), many of which used the phrase in the context of sentences like "nugget casino University of phoenix Rpg Musician Sony Bahamas Butterfly Wrestling Physics Columbia house Internet casino gambling File replication Power"<a href="http://ikea.parking.008.net/goto.home/Ikea/Ikea.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://ikea.parking.008.net/goto.home/Ikea/Ikea.html" rel="nofollow">[58]</a>; "free wife slut story strike committee If teenage girl + lard Those amateur wrestling physics That amateur nude woman&#160;? broad For adult cartoon joke wind" <a href="http://yayagirls.com/man-spanking-woman/anime-lyric-porn.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://yayagirls.com/man-spanking-woman/anime-lyric-porn.html" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>; and "street map electronic hearimg protection horny house wivs drug infoemation topamax free picture enema professional wrestling physics bikini cameron diaz" <a href="http://wwwalaipauthycom.page2u.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://wwwalaipauthycom.page2u.com/" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>. The ONE page that I found that is actually about the kind of wrestling physics discussed in the article is <a href="http://www.onlineonslaught.com/columns/swift/20030605.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.onlineonslaught.com/columns/swift/20030605.shtml" rel="nofollow">A Primer in Wrestling Physics</a>, which is quite clearly a joke article making assertions to the effect that the wrestler bounced off the ropes is propelled back to the hurler by the combined gravity of their massive bodies, centered in their noses, and that "10 head shots into the turnbuckle achieves a sort of harmonic vibration around the brain causing extreme disorientation". Yeah, it's funny, but that, along with a few blogs or forum posts that refer back to it, is just not a basis for an encyclopedia article.

<li>How did you manage to find only one page when the article itself links to two? ☺ If it is a concern that the source that you found is written tongue-in-cheek, then the same concern applies to the self-styled <a href="http://funnies.paco.to/cartoon.html" class="external text" title="http://funnies.paco.to/cartoon.html" rel="nofollow">Funny Page</a> on the laws of cartoon physics that is linked to from <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartoon_physics.html" title="Cartoon physics">cartoon physics</a>.

<p>this is somewhat of a “test” case. I am providing a couple of representative samples of this type of article. I originally tagged List of British Actors with a {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}, with the notice, "<i>unnecessary and redundant list; there is already <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBritish_actors_fe2a.html" title="Category:British actors">Category:British actors</a> that serves the purpose this list would provide. No article "</i>British actors<i>" (or similar) for this list to support.</i>" Since posting that template, I discovered these other articles (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_actors_by_nationality_a65f.html" title="Category:Lists of actors by nationality">Category: Lists of actors by nationality</a>). From my review (checking talk pages, but not the entire edit history), it does not appear that any discussion has been conducted regarding whether or not these lists are encyclopedic. I believe that all of these articles are redundant as that is what categories are for. Furthermore, some lists provide an ostensible criteria for inclusion, but others do not. I suggest reviewing these representative samples for AfD review. If they are deleted, I’ll nominate the balance. If they are not, I’ll leave well enough alone. In this nomination, I also include:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>List of Austrian actors</li>
<li>List of Canadian actors</li>
<li>List of Indian movie actors<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>This group represents various varieties of these articles and various different parts of the world, but any of the other articles at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_actors_by_nationality_a65f.html" title="Category:Lists of actors by nationality">Category: Lists of actors by nationality</a> could be discussed here as well, either to support or refute deletion. Please do not take into consideration the “empty” nature of the <i>List of British Actors</i>. I’ve added a few names to the list just so it can be considered on its merits than its being incomplete. I’d rather have a consensus on this before the original editor spends a lot of time adding names only to have it deleted. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 19:14, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Lists don't seem to have any explanatory text that make them useful in a manner not filled by the categories. If all a list does is list similar, existing article alphabetically, there isn't much need for them, as that's exactly what categories do. Especially in this case, where almost all the names <i>have</i> articles (in cases where many links don't, it can be helpful since those can't be in categories). -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">‽‽‽</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">⁂</a> 19:35, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Wikipedia is not a census, but this focuses more around the ranking than the population totals, and I would hardly describe this as being part of an "indiscriminate collection of information."

<dd>I apologize if I have offended anyone by placing the "possible single use account" tag after their posts. I did not know that it would cause so much consternation. Please take my apologies in this matter. And, even though I mention that I am in 7th grade, it is completely irrelevant to this AfD discussion. If needed to come up with an appropriate retort, I may say that I am already attending college as a biology major, so I would think that if the comment that one is in 7th grade enters this conversation, it really simply supports me. Enough with that. I hope no one took offense at what I just put down.</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I am a member of the FLCE development team, and I would just like to clear up a few misconceptions. Firstly, this page was not created or maintained by us. It was made by a particularly devoted fan, hence the lack of a lot of formal information. We are currently giving it a major overhaul to bring it up to the wikipedia quality control standards. Second, this is a mod for Microsoft Freelancer, not halo. And despite the fact that we are still in alpha stage, and have yet to make a public release, we currently have over 850 members, which makes us one of the largest freelancer mods in existence, and defianately not non-notable within that community. Our mod has also been featured in an article on www.4players.de, which according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28web%29#_note-6" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28web%29#_note-6" rel="nofollow">this</a> classifies it as notable. The relevant article can be found <a href="http://www.4players.de/4players.php/spielinfonews/PC-CDROM/8327/54494/Freelancer_Combat_Evolved.html" class="external text" title="http://www.4players.de/4players.php/spielinfonews/PC-CDROM/8327/54494/Freelancer_Combat_Evolved.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> --Nightrogue 17:54, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hello, Nightrogue. I believe that the issue here is not quality control. The issue in question here is that it is an advertisement. Although the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> community appreciates the time that one of your fans took to place this online, there are certain guidelines on Wikipedia that regard what articles are acceptable - <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What Wikipedia is Not</a>. In this case, the subdivision <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">Wikipedia: Notability (companies + corporations)</a> is also applicable. The followed is directly from Wikipedia:Notability - "Criteria for products and services</dd>
<dd>A product or service is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The product or service has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself.</dd>
<dd>This criterion excludes:</dd>
<dd>Media re-prints of press releases, other publications where the company or corporation talks about its products or services, and advertising for the product or service. Newspaper stories that do not credit a reporter or a news service and simply present company news in an uncritical or positive way may be treated as press releases unless there is evidence to the contrary. 1</dd>
<dd>Trivial coverage, such as simple price listings in product catalogues.</dd>
<dd>This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations. 7</dd>
<dd>The product or service is so well-known that its trademark has suffered from genericization."</dd>

<dd>Hello, Nightrogue! Cheers! In answer to the aforementioned article, I currently find little at fault. It does not say anything about how to play the game. <i>Halo</i> is a well-established product on Bungie Studios, and millions play it. No offense is intended, but I believe that FL:CE will never reach that popularity.

And as for the article saying who controls what faction, no it doesnt. The closest it comes to that is saying that they are player controlled, and giving some basic information about them. And saying it is like a game guide is even worse. Are there any ingame statistics? Any trade routes, combat guides, ship prices? There isnt any useful information whatsoever about how to play the game, apart from incredibly general statements that could apply to most any multiplayer game with a team component, and the basic rules of the game. Look up the article on Chess. Wow, thats a lot of information on rules, tactics and techniques. I dont see anybody objecting. Ah, but chess is an ancient and respected game, and FLCE is not.

This article is guilty of nothing that isnt mirrored by hundreds of other legitimate articles on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Ok, in this case the subdivision <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">Wikipedia: Notability (companies + corporations)</a> is NOT applicable. This is not a company, nor a corporation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Articles about mods are an accepted part of Wikipedia just look in the category Computer game mods. This article does require significant cleanup and work but this poject is noteworthy and merits inclusion here.</p>
<p>Wikipedia standards are meant to be applied universally and follow established and accepted policy precedent. As such I once again refer to category Computer game mods in defense of not deleting this article. If you are to have credibility in your arguement you would have to go and slap a deletion nomination on most of the articles in that category. The fact that has not happened (either by you or another) is further proof that your claims of the standard you wish to apply here to this article are not in fact applicable in that manner.</p>
<p>Given that this project has been featured by international press in a manner which no other Freelancer Modification has (as mentioned by Nightrouge) and which few mods of any game ever are. This is further evidence that not only does this article merit existence by virtue of accepted standards of articles of this subject manner with regards to being noteworthy, but that it exceeds them.</p>
<p>I do agree that this article should be deleted if it is not brought up to the standards all Wikipedia articles must meet (and the most recent edit by Nightrouge does not in my view accomplish that) specifically with regards to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. If that does not occur then it should be removed, as the only reason that has been outlined here in favor of deletion that actually is in line with Wikipedia policy is the arguement which can be made that this article serves more as an advertisement than an encyclopedia entry. That arguement specifically pertains to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. If this is rectified I really see no policy reason why this article should be removed.</p>
<p>Even if operating under the assumption that other policy standards apply with regards to the eveluation of the noteworhty level of this article, I would refer to when the discussion about the propossed deletion of Eon8 was going on. Due consideration was at least given in that the timer had not yet counted down. As such, judgement on whether that article was indeed noteworthy or not was reserved until the project timer concluded. This allowed for a more considered opinion to be formed as to how noteworthy it was. Since this is a project that is also still in development, I would think that the same logic and courtesy would be sensibly applied here. --Sully 19:20, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

You will see that is very clearly targeted and explained. FL:CE is not a comercial product nor is it a company nor is it a corporation. It really is as simple as that in that it does not apply.

<dd>Hello, Sully! Ok - FL:CE <i>is</i> a product. I will reread <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> soon to see if <i>commercial</i> matters or not. Anyway, parts of this article are like a game guide, telling what players must do or anything. It's also a vanity page, telling who controls what faction or everything. I sympathize with you, in that I've created or heavily contributed to articles, just do have an admin delete them. However, there are guidelines that <i>must</i> be respected.</dd>

<dd>Hello Relentless. You certainly are living up to your name. Look i can appreciate your enthusiasm here but admins have seen FL:CE's page before (because we had a problem with vandalism) and have never flagged this. I happen to be the leader of the FL:CE Development team and can tell you it is not a product, it is a project. There is a big difference in that terminology. Beside that difference in semantics the simple, VERY simple fact is it applies and I quote "This page gives some rough guidelines which Wikipedia editors use to decide if a company, corporation or other economic entity should have an article on Wikipedia." The details on criteria for products and services WITH REGARDS TO A "company, corporation or other economic entity." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Dl0ad (<a href="../../../d/l/0/User_talk%7EDl0ad_9be0.html" title="User talk:Dl0ad">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dl0ad_83ab.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dl0ad">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

But right now and especially with this rather insulting edit potting possible single purpose account in front of the sigs of this articles supporters and the fact that you created this whole discussion without even once posting on Freelancer: Combat Evolved discussion page really seems to me that you are the one with a single purpose here. I know you have attempted to become an admin here before and have overwhelmingly been voted down. This doesn't say anything about your character or if you are a good person as i am sure that you are. However, you really need to stop acting as if you are an admin and putting those "Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a>" tags in front of our names is really insulting and infuriating and I have now removed them. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Dl0ad (<a href="../../../d/l/0/User_talk%7EDl0ad_9be0.html" title="User talk:Dl0ad">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dl0ad_83ab.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dl0ad">contribs</a>).</small></b></dd>

<dd>Please don't take this as a flame or anything like that but I also understand from looking at your user page that you are in the seventh grade and so that is why I have repeated myself on the issue of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">Wikipedia: Notability (companies + corporations)</a> since the specific concept of particular policy may not be easy for you to grasp.

<dd>Frankly I think you have made your views on this article very clear as have I. I know I will not be posting anything else here in this discussion until after the article in question has been cleaned up which I hope to contibute in doing so later. I honestly have better things to do with my time than to sit here and be insulted by a frustrated seventh grader. Again, I am sure in your heart your intentions ar honorable, and it is understandable that you may not have yet developed certain social graces, but that is no excuse for this kind of behaviour towards other people. Respect, it goes a long way when having a discussion. --Sully 18:45, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're not supposed to remove the single purpose account tags yourself - it's considered vandalism. If you're not a single purpose account, bring it up with an admin. As for the game, it is not notable. It has not been the subject of non-trivial third-party coverage (HBO doesn't count), it is not well-known, and it is not widely played. Comparing the game to Halo itself or to other games does not work because this is a <i>mod</i> and not a stand-alone game. Only the most noteworthy mods are in the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7EComputer_game_mods_9259.html" title="Category:Computer game mods">Computer game mods</a> category. The ones that aren't probably shouldn't be there, but that's not a discussion for this AfD - the existence of one article is not a reason to keep another. --<b><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Core</a><font color="green">des</font><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">at</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoredesat_227a.html" title="User talk:Coredesat">talk. ^_^</a></small> 19:06, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dload, Sully, however you would like to be called. I "honestly" have far better things to do than to be a "frustrated seventh grader", like doing organic chemistry. It is possible I "have [not] yet developed certain social graces". My rather failed RfA when I had been editing Wikipedia for 2 months, and I admit I should not have started it. If you intention was to infuriate me, derogatively offend me, or another purpose which I can not fathom, it did not work. Anyway, I fail to see how it effects this argument. <i>Anyone</i> can add the "single-purpose user" tag. If you feel offended, then fine. My intention was to alert other contributors to this discussion about what I believe are your and Nightrogue's discussions. And, thanks for informing me that I'm living up to my username. I'm proud I chose it when I created an account.</p>

That industry doesn't get a lot of general press coverage (about the only industrial industry that does is the auto industry), but they seem to mee the WP:CORP guideline for press coverage.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> The site can definitely make claims to notability, but I just don't think they're enough to justify a WP article.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am a Denver resident and I have heard about this company a lot through friends and news casts and radio in town.

His contributions are already evident in the online game industry for being one of the pioneers of the <a href="../../../m/m/o/MMOSG_84a4.html" title="MMOSG">MMOSG</a> genre. His notability is likely to continue and increase with the popularity of his contributions. Google test: His in-game Furcadia pseudonym "Felorin" passes the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Felorin%22+-Wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Felorin%22+-Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Google test</a> at 10,000 results, in addition to however many results are attributed to him from searching <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Dr.+Cat%22+-Wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Dr.+Cat%22+-Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Dr. Cat</a>.

Autobiography: the article wasn't written by him or anyone closely involved with him. As the article's primary author, I don't know him personally, and my only relation to him was a single brief conversation with him in-game several months ago.

<li>How can someone become notable, if any information about them is deleted? This then prohibits people learning/finding out about that person or the promotion he works for (which is what I understood Wikipedia is all about, learning and finding out information). On a side note, the promotion <b>is</b> listed in the Wikipedia article about the British Wrestling Scene. It would seem unfair to delete one UK wrestlers article, while leaving another on the site. There are many other pages for wrestlers that are stubs, containing nothing of any detail about that person, yet they are allowed to remain, even though they have little to no value to them. I'd have the article left as it is. HDC7777</li>

<li>How many US wrestlers are featured on the site, yet have little to no general media coverage? I can understand non-UK residents not knowing/caring about UK wrestlers or promotions, but not to the point of deleting this article, while allowing articles on US wrestlers that feature very little or no information. Some of them have the name of the person and that they are wrestlers, and that is all. How can that be more viable than this entry, when it tells the person next to nothing about them? There must be lots of articles about wrestlers (UK and non-UK) that are less worthy (either through content, notability or general coverage of the subject) than this article, yet they remain on the site with no problems or discussions in regards to them. Why is this article different to them? On a side note, surely the link to the LWL homepage can verify the accuracy of the details in that part of the article. The matches and subsequent results are all there, as is Draven Cage's LWL profile, moves and upcoming matches. To me, this is verification of authenticity in regards to that section. And I've added a link to an interview from Wrestling101 that has Red Lightning (another UK wrestler) discussing his early days, and he states in the interview details that verify the parts in the article about CSF, Colin McKay, the WILD promotion and that Draven helped train the students. I would assume that comes under independent sources for information.HDC7777</li>

<p>And that is just a few that I found in about ten minutes of searching. So I would assume that there are a lot more articles on pro-wrestlers that are like that. What makes those articles more worthy than this one?</p>
<ul>
<li>I went through that list posted, and I knew most of the names. Most of the names you listed are people that use to work for WWF, WCW and/or ECW. People know them. Just because they have small articles, doesn't make them less notable. Draven isn't that notable or known, so it should be deleted. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 13:41, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I understand that they worked for mainstream organisations, but the articles for those wrestlers tell the reader very little if nothing about the wrestler featured. I can't understand what purpose those articles serve that this one doesn't. A mainstream wrestling fan would be hard pushed to recognise any of the wrestlers listed, especially in non-US countries. To be fair, RobJ1981, you run a website called Pro Wrestling Addicts, which, to me, means you would know more than the average person. So for YOU to say you know/recognise most of the names on there isn't a fair comparison, especially if you are not a follower of the whole UK independent wrestling scene. Not all UK wrestlers work for 1PW, and that seems to be (along with 3CW) the only UK wrestlers on the site. There are countless UK wrestlers who don't wrestle for these companies, but that doesn't mean that they are worthless.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>As a side note to the above comment, I would assume, RobJ1981, that Draven Cage is now a <i>little</i> more notable, now that people would have read about him, checked the links, sources, etc. Some of the names listed above have no links or sources applied to the article about them, so I don't see why they have more merit than this one. Draven Cage may not be well known in the US, and the UK scene is hard to actually make a name due to lack of TV exposure (which TWC has done a good job of rectifying). But I dare say, if you asked the average UK fan about those named, they would have no clue who you were referring to. I understand (and indeed respect) your desire to retain the integrity of Wikipedia, but I fail to see how this will undermine that in the first place. It is obvious by the links provided that the article is based on facts from sources (the interview, the LWL homepage, etc) rather than just used for filler material. The article is information on a UK wrestler, that lets anyone who pops onto it know who he is and what he does. The links verify this, so that fullfils certain criteria. The only one that I can see standing is the notability one. And as I said, that is something that can be addressed in time. Especially as you, RobJ1981, know about him and can add him to your website as another wrestler from the UK.</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> I have voted before, but am now registered. I have worked with Magee on and off for over ten years and I can think of no other hack more deserving of a wiki entry for his contributions to online journalism at both the Register and the Inquirer. I worked with him at the Reg and the Inq and against him as a PR for Intel and Cadence. He is a one off. At one of the UK's top PR agencies, his biog reads simply: 'Mike is a grizzled veteran with a fearsome reputation'. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctor_Spinola_98f5.html" title="User:Doctor Spinola">Doctor Spinola</a> 17:39, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There seems to be such a big opposition to the making of a page for the well known site for gay themed movies, About Gay Movies. Appearantly it is still a big taboo to write anything that is about a gay issue. Even in this day and age there is still a lot of homophobia. Especially in the USA. Unfortunatly this is inbedded in the culture of the USA. It is supposed to be the land of the free, but everytime it is proven not to be the case for gay people.
<ul>
<li>I do not want to have to deal with this kind of biggotry, therefore I have decided that the page should be deleted. As the creator of this page I should be able to do this. But unfortunatly this is not an option, therefore I would like to request one of the editors of Wikipedia do this for me. Discussion closed. Lordmarchmain 20:41, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
