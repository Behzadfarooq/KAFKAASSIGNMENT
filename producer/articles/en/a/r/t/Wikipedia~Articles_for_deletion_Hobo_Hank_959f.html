<p>Came across this page while reading somebody's talk page, although apparently he is related (in that they are both wrestling promoters) to Mosh Pit Mike who I have also nominated. Much of the information in this bio is similar to the info in that bio. This person doesn't seem to be inherently notability althuogh if notability can be established then cheers, but right now the only "sources" are Hobo Hank's own web site. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrstroeebski_7f9b.html" title="User:Orstroeebski">Orstroeebski</a> 07:24, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>: no sources. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 17:42, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>No Comment</b>: Again, I don't feel it would be right for me to chime in with an opinion here, as I created both of the articles in question. The source given is AmarilloPWF.com, which is a webpage that is only editable by the webmaster, who is employed by the WTWL. I feel the nominator was misleading in identifying the only source as "Hobo Hank's own web site". Also, as I stated with Mosh Pit Mike, Hobo Hank is listed on the West Texas Wrestling Legends (WTWL) page. This is the only reason I created an article for him, I figured if he was mentioned in a wikipedia article, he deserved to have an article of his own. Burquelo 20:05, 11 January 2007 (UTC)Oh man! Here I go again, continuing with the long windedness. I also feel that user Orstrobeeski has a personal grudge against me. If he were to be putting deletion notices in all wrestler pages, I would accept it as a substantial challenge. But look at CJ Summers. This page cites no sources whatsoever, except for the wrestler's personal website. There are no federation websites which suggest he even exists, yet Orstrobeeski simply removed links instead of nominating the article for deletion. Personal attacks are fine, I'm a big boy, but I think it's unfair when it impacts a wiki.
<ul>
<li><i>I figured if he was mentioned in a wikipedia article, he deserved to have an article of his own.</i> — That is not the case. The criteria that we employ for who warrants articles of their own are our <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>. Please <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a> to demonstrate that this person satisfies one or more of those criteria. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:07, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do NOT Delete</b>: The nomination for deletion on this wiki page is an outrage. "Hobo" Hank is a professional wrestler that I have seen with my own eyes perform for West Texas Wrestling Legends in Amarillo, TX. The AmarilloPWF.com website is not ran by anyone other than WTWL Management and The WTWL Webmaster. While "Hobo" Hank is on The WTWL roster, he is not the promoter and has no access to editing AmarilloPWF.com in anyway. Being apart of The WTWL, I know that the information on Hanks' wikipedia page is 100% accurate and I can say that "Hobo" Hank has performed at every WTWL show since I've been associated with it in June of 2006. This page belongs on wiki just as much as any other wrestlers page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Brett420x (<a href="../../../b/r/e/User_talk%7EBrett420x_8c1e.html" title="User talk:Brett420x">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brett420x_bafe.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brett420x">contribs</a>) 22:10, 11 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

<li><b>Delete</b> per above, unless some sources are found.

<li>Just a note, as the relisting admin, the only reason I am relisting is that the nominator for this AFD removed the tag off of the article, as the AFD has already attracted opinions, I thought it is best to go ahead and re-list this, so that people viewing the article have a chance to have their say.
