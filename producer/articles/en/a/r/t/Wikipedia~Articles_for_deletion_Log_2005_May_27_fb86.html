<p>This appears to be a fantasy biography. Jeff Gardiner is supposedly a U.N. peacekeeper, master juggler, recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, member of the Hosplitar Order of St. Johns, published poet, and CEO of an ISP. Yet, there's not a single source for any of it. A request for sources on the article's talk page resulted in the admission by an anon editor that it was all original research. I think "research" it the wrong word. <s>This is appears to be nonsense.</s> <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 21:00, May 27, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Abstain</b>. There appears to be some foundation for this article. I withdraw my (implied) vote to delete. If the article can be stripped down, cleaned up, and sourced over (quickly) then I might vote to keep. I'm not sure that this individual is notable for his verifiable information, and his moderately-successful military and business careers seem to have been uneventful. The article appears to be the product of vanity or sycophancy (such admirable qualities in other contexts). Are middle-aged IT professionals as notable as Pokemon characters? Well, in this case.....I abstain. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 06:29, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>

In short, all of the claims are reasonable, though I haven't been able (in a cursory Google search only, actual contact with Idologic, the Order of St. John, the UNDOF, any of the named universities, the Canadian Chamber of Contemporary Poetry might be able to turn up more) to find any verification that a specific person named Jeff Gardiner was connected with any of them. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> 02:47, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>I tried to verify him - I can't find a list of contributors to the anthology. Gardiner, according to this bio, was born in 1968, so it is possible that he was in the Canadian armed forces in 1988. Idologic do4es exist, but they don't mention Gardiner. Ditto for the other company. This guy would possibly be notable if any of this were verifiable. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 03:45, May 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Confirmed pg. 276 does contain a peom by a Jeff Gardiner. Recommend contacting Idologic.com via contact page. Was able to find brief Bio on Biomarkimaging.com "Contact Us" page. Megan1967 what deteremines "notable"? Phil Welch your comment is non-substantial and petty.

<li>Thanks for providing this bio. Unfortunately, it does not support all of the info in the article. Do you know the source for the other info? Is Gardiner himself invoved in this editing?

<li>Entries like this on, in the "births" section of <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_20.html" title="March 20">March 20</a>, make me wonder about the good faith of the editors involved in this article. "*<a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> - Jeff Gardiner, recipient of the <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_Peace_Prize_60fc.html" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a>".

<li>Another odd mention of Jeff Gardiner is in <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_rights.html" title="Gay rights">Gay rights</a>, where someone added this sentence: "In May 2005, Jeff Gardiner supported the same sex union act by starting a flame." No idea what that is supposed to mean, and a question on the talk page hasn't elicited any answers. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 23:10, May 30, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I checked Biomark Imaging's site and found no mention of Gardiner on their contacts page or elsewhere. I have no way of checking the poetry (or is that peotry?), but I wouldn't take this source's word for it. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 23:47, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just wanted to confirm that I can verify this: "Jeff CO-founded Idologic Inc. and currently holds the position of CEO of Idologic Inc. and Director of Information Technology at Biomark Imaging Inc." to be true. You can call the toll free number on the site idologic.com and there's contact information on biomarkimaging.com. Disclaimer, I am involved with both companies, but am not Jeff. "While employed with the Imaging Laboratories at Robarts Research Institute, a research Institute named after John Robarts" this is verifiable too at robarts.ca. Can't confirm any of the other things.
<ul>
<li>If we boil the article down to that bare minimum it's gonna be kinda dry. The company bio from Biomarkimaging.com appears to be a rewrite of his resume and neglects any details of his military career. The article seems as if it were written by a family member or employee. Has any newspaper ever done a profile of him, or otherwise reported on him? Thanks, -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 04:54, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>

Yes, it needs to be copyedited (so things don't go out of date, ie. is the prinicipal of *add in year here*, rather than "current principal"), but it seems good enough. The very act of its actions concerning Tiananmen while being in China is an interesting issue, as well. Keep, definitely.

<li><b>Must keep</b>: There are a lot of articles about schools in Wikipedia. If you want to delete this article, then does that mean we have to delete ALL of them? Besides that, this article is pretty long. It can be seen that the writers have paid a lot effort in it. Please respect the effort of the writers. I think all of us don't want other people to delete an article that we have spend a lot of effort to write. Also, Wikipedia should include all kinds of information, including information about schools. If you think this article is a "school promotion", then try to modify / clean up to make it a more contented article. But anyway, I truely believe that those people who started this article did not aim at having an advertisement for the school. This is a very predigious school in the area. I see no points for deleting this article just because it is school-related.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 169.231.1.231 (<a href="../../../1/6/9/User_talk%7E169.231.1.231.html" title="User talk:169.231.1.231">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__169.231.1.231_b44d.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 169.231.1.231">contribs</a>) 19:52, 10 Jun 2005.</small></li>

<li>People are heavily opposed to rambotting such things.

<li>My impression of this portion of the community was that it was biased toward people who enjoyed deleting these pages. I.e. people who enjoyed the <i>power of deletion</i> would tend to migrate here. That induced a bias that seemingly needed to be countered. I expect that when enough people saw their carefully constructed pages get flushed, they came here to balance things out.

<li>The very reason to keep these entries is that Wikipedia is an encyclopeda. A special kind of encyclopedia, one where we will never run out of paper. The fact that people of many nations are willing and able to work on the articles is good evidence of their notability--that is, verifiable, neutral information can be obtained on the subjects. Please do feel free to enter articles about the schools that are bigger and more notable, or leave us to those who want to do so. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:25, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>I have viewed the revision, and kudos to [[[User:BD2412/deletion debates|<font style="background: green" color="#FFC000">&#160;BD2412</font>]] <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="blue"><b>talk</b></font></sup></a>, but I can't change my vote. The reason is that it appears to be a term with no <i>stable</i> meaning or usage. The two citations appear to use the term in different senses entirely, and the head matter remains particularly vexatious and personal. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:56, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That may be true (although even Deism has had different meanings at different times). The <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Starr_Sered_f538.html" title="Susan Starr Sered">Sered</a> book is in my Univ library, I'm going over there to have a look at it this afternoon. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: green" color="#FFC000">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 15:04, 2005 Jun 1 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ok, I looked up Sered's book and determined that her use is indeed different - she basically uses the term as a broader reference to polytheism (even where there is no 'theism' involved). She's empirically wrong, of course, because deism is not a term used to encompass all forms of spirituality, so polydeism shouldn't have any such meaning either. Bowman's use is the one that makes sense in light of the established meaning of deism. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: green" color="#FFC000">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 17:09, 2005 Jun 1 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(Parenthetically, a comment: At least, before our contemporary times, Deism really only had two distinct meanings that surfaced a century or two apart. The search for the Universal religion and the search for the Natural religion are enough alike that the two Deisms are at least in communication with each other. Since our own day, however, folks have just been plain sloppy. They'll call anything Deism, anything theosophy, anything polytheism, and anything Sufism. That's why I was and remain opposed to this article. It seems to be another example of sloppy spiritual tourism to serve original research and Deep Thoughts.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:38, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I retort, sir, that your objection is actually best met by <i>keeping</i> this article, in order to prevent future misuses by providing the definitive argument for the term meaning what at least two scholars attribute it to mean - frankly, polydeism has only one etymologically logical meaning (a multiple-god form of classical deism), and other uses are clearly misguided (just as are recent misuses of deism), and contrariwise, polydeism is the only etymologically logical <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portmanteau.html" title="Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> to describe this concept, which apparently goes as far back as Hume (unless you want to throw around unweildy phrases like polytheistic deism or deistic polytheism). Wikipedia is not the place to create new terms - which this is not - but it certainly is a place to show up clearly wrongful uses for what they are! --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: green" color="#FFC000">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 15:40, 2005 Jun 2 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>If you were to rewrite the article to strike out the Deep Thoughts and simply explain that it is a portmanteau term licensed in the exception of Deism's arguments rather than in the execution of them, I would most likely feel that it <i>should</i> be kept. I don't like negative articles ("The word Herb is not pronounced with a vocal H in America, but is in RP England") ("There is no place called Tralfalmadore"), but since the term occurs (in the breach, as it were), a negative would be useful here to prevent mysticophilosophicomorphism. The 18th c. also had a search for the natural language, but we don't hear folks wanting to claim <i>that</i> heritage. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:09, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Materialism (illustrated by the Epicureans), represented today by atheism, skepticism, and Deism. The materialist may acknowledge superior beings, but they do not believe in a Supreme Being. Epicureanism was founded about 300 BC by Epicurus. Their world view might be called “polydeism”: there are many gods, but they are merely superhuman beings; they are remote, uninvolved in the world, posing no threat and offering no hope to human beings. Epicureans regarded traditional religion and idolatry as harmless enough as long as the gods were not feared or expected to do or say anything.</dd>

Imagine if someone controlled the Internet and decided to delete every page that was under construction. Over 50% of the Internet would be gone. The invalid and untrue logic of the above arguments almost makes me want to lose faith in the human race. We are intelligent beings. We can debate and analyize in an orderly fashion. Yet, there are those who chose to yell "The sky is falling" without even checking if it actually is. Question every thing, debate where applicable, and analyize! Guaranteed to make the human race a better, more advanced society. <small>(edit by 69.23.252.110)</small></p>

<dd>Small school and &lt;school&gt; in the same sentence. Funny!

<p><b>This page should be delted because the topic is non-notable.</b> Texas Media Watch claims to be a non-partisan watch group. However, the <i>Austin Chronicle</i>, a paper with cirulation of 88,000 <a href="http://www.ruxton.com/index.php?page=newspapers/austin&amp;nav=navigation_alt&amp;active=3" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ruxton.com/index.php?page=newspapers/austin&amp;nav=navigation_alt&amp;active=3" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and readership of over 250,000 <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/info/ads/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.austinchronicle.com/info/ads/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> points out that this so-called group appears to consiste of only a single person, Sherry Sylvester. This is supported by the fact that she is the only person ever mentioned as part of the group on their own pages or on any Google produced reference to the site. Speaking of Google, "Texas Media Watch" produces less than 2,000 hits. For a group focused on media and publicity, this is a paltry number of hits. Therefore, the fails a reasonable test for notability. The page was created by a user who wishes to add quotes from them into a NPOV section of <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Chronicle_fc13.html" title="Houston Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a> 03:23, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. First of all, the "organization" (well, website) appears to be defunct. The sole contributor "stepped down" shortly after the 2004 election,<a href="http://www.texasmediawatch.com/newsletter.asp?aID=510" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.texasmediawatch.com/newsletter.asp?aID=510" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and no further newsletters have been published since then. Its claims as an independent, unbiased source should be viewed skeptically, as it was funded by a major Republican operative in Texas (David Hartman). Other than the fact that the writer was a journalist, what makes it significantly different from a blog? --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 04:28, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> According to your link (which goes to a fully functioning website BTW), Sylvester wrote "I am stepping down as Director of Texas Media Watch on December 1, 2004, <b>but this project is slated to continue.</b>" (emphasis added).

<li><b>Comment</b>. Ah, TMW <i>said</i> it would continue. Well, I'm just looking at the fact that Sherry Sylvester is the only byline I found on any articles on the site, that she is no longer involved, and that what was once a weekly newsletter has not brought forth a single issue in the 6 months since her resignation. Clearly we'll just have to take TMW's word that it is a vibrant, functioning media criticism organization. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 04:46, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> the VFD process on this article was initiated with no discussion, no comment on the article itself, and only a few minutes after its creation. The editor who proposed this deletion is currently involved in a dispute over using Texas Media Watch (TMW) as a source on the <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Chronicle_fc13.html" title="Houston Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a> article and has inserted several POV comments to disparage TMW there. Based on these reasons, this VfD is IMO premature and inappropriately called. It should also be noted that the article cited by Johntex from the Austin Chronicle as a basis for his VfD (found here for anyone who wants to see it <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2004-04-02/pols_capitol.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2004-04-02/pols_capitol.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>) is a rabidly partisan rant replete with namecalling and attacks on the "hard rightist" columnists published by TMW's parent group, the Lone Star Foundation. It's highly questionable to me whether we should be evaluating the propriety of this article based solely on such a blatantly POV attack piece on the organization. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangerdude_981c.html" title="User:Rangerdude">Rangerdude</a> 04:20, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> From what I can tell, this organization is one person writing about what other people have written. Unless that person has had a great influence on the media or people's opinions (something which is not evidenced in the article), I don't see how it is notable enough to include in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../x/c/a/User%7EXcali_e28f.html" title="User:Xcali">Xcali</a> 04:43, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>'<b>Comment'</b> The latest posting I can find on their website is from November 2004 stating that Sylvester is stepping aside. The "upcoming events" section of the website is blank. She/They do not seem to be an active concern at the moment. Rangerdude, who created the TMW article, would like to claim this is an issue of bias of some sort, but it is really about a non-notable "group" he wishes to reference in his arguments because he agrees with their (her) point of view. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a> 04:47, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> rather than a lengthy explanation of the bias you have added to the <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Chronicle_fc13.html" title="Houston Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a> article - I will simply point out that your above staement has no bearing on whether <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Media_Watch_1119.html" title="Texas Media Watch">Texas Media Watch</a> is worthy of an article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a> 05:16, 27 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Your POV edits speak for themself, Johntex, as do my attempts to restore neutrality following them. Whether you believe so or not, they have direct bearing on this VfD process since your case for removing this article is premised entirely upon the same partisan rant from the Austin Chronicle that you were attempting to insert with POV commentary into the Houston Chronicle article. Furthermore, since I created and proposed the TMW article as an alternative for the placement of your and Katefan's passages about TMW and Sylvester, which did not belong in the middle of the Houston Chronicle article where you placed them, the dispute on <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Chronicle_fc13.html" title="Houston Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a> is a directly relevant reason in favor of retaining the TMW article. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangerdude_981c.html" title="User:Rangerdude">Rangerdude</a> 05:46, 27 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> You have produced zero evidence to counter the Austin Chronicle's claim that it was a "one-woman" shop. (Even liberal publications are right sometimes - and the Austin Chronicle appears to be right this time, as evidenced by the fact that no one but her has ever appeared in association with the website, and the fact that the website has not been updated once in the 6 months since her departure). Furthermore, you continue to ignore the compelling evidence that her web site gets low Google hits, as I pointed out in my VfD nomination. Do you have anything to say that is on topic here? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a> 05:58, 27 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> To the contrary. The fact that it is operated by the Lone Star Foundation indicates that it was more than a "one woman" shop. Nor did the Austin Chronicle ever establish that it was - they merely speculated that it was in a rabidly partisan editorial piece of suspect credibility in its own right. Nor is your <b>unscientific</b> google survey "compelling evidence" by any reasonable measure. Do you have anything to say that legitimately justifies this article's deletion beyond your own bias against what the group said about the Chronicle? <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangerdude_981c.html" title="User:Rangerdude">Rangerdude</a> 06:15, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> google hits are not a criterion for establishing or refuting significance. Circulation figures, however, are and the minimum threshold is 5,000. Sylvester was the political reporter at the San Antonio Express News - a major daily paper with circulation in the hundreds of thousands. That alone is sufficient. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangerdude_981c.html" title="User:Rangerdude">Rangerdude</a> 15:45, 27 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>That is incorrect. WP:BIO does not say google hits are not a criterion for establishing/refuting significance. To the contrary, WP:BIO specifically mentions checking Google as an alternative test. Please read the page you are citing. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a> 21:05, 27 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>From <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>: "Other tests for inclusion that have been <b>proposed</b> include...google test." This does not in any way espouse, establish, sanction, or give credibility to a google test. Following the google test link, one immediately finds that (1) unlike WP:BIO, it is NOT an official wikipedia guideline and (2) substantial reason exists to question its accuracy including a "google bias" that openly concedes its accuracy problems, issues pertaining to its validity, and notice that other search engines may be more accurate and have a wider sample of sites. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangerdude_981c.html" title="User:Rangerdude">Rangerdude</a> 21:23, 27 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>From WP:POL - the definition of a guideline is "informal rules of thumb that are generally accepted by consensus to apply in many cases". Simply put, you are elevating a Wikipedia guideline to a level of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canonical.html" title="Canonical">canon</a> that it simply does not enjoy. It is a fact that Google tests are allowed as an indication of notability. It is also a fact that no one is forced to use them. It is also a fact that you have to consider what you are Googling when interpreting the results. Common sense is that a topic relating to the media in the US would be expected to get a lot of media hits. Therefore, a low Google hit rate is relevant here, and allowed by Wikipedia. By the way, if Google searches are so bad, why have you (in just the past 24 hours) cited them several times when you felt they supported your view? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a> 21:56, 27 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wrong. I have repeatedly noted that WP:BIO is a <b>guideline</b>, albeit a formal wikipedia guideline. That may not be an official policy, but it is a step below an official policy and many steps above your silly "google test" which aren't official for anything and have multiple disclaimers of their own warning about the dangers of using them as a determinant. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangerdude_981c.html" title="User:Rangerdude">Rangerdude</a> 22:10, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Fascinating debate here, and one that raises a question for me. I've had a user account for about two weeks and been editing anonymously for about two months.

<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks. That is not <i>conclusive</i> evidence since we don't know how much of that is his show. Still, together with whatever the book has done, I agree it is likely he is reaching at least 5,000 people. I reiterate that what you quote above is a guideline, not a policy. I disagree with this guideline because I believe media people face a higher bar because they naturally reach a lot of people by virtue of their occupation.

<li><b>Comment</b> - use a little common sense. KSEV is a well known station in <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston%2C_Texas_c0fa.html" title="Houston, Texas">Houston, Texas</a> - one of the top 10 media broadcast markets in the country - and Patrick has the prime afternoon drive slot. Based on that alone it's safe to say that he gets well over 5,000 listeners. And even if he did not on radio, Patrick was also a newscaster on the evening broadcast of at least two different stations in the same media market - enough to gather him well over 5,000 viewers on any given night. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangerdude_981c.html" title="User:Rangerdude">Rangerdude</a> 15:36, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>KEEP</b> This article should most definitely stay, as there is a mass of important critical information about this religious group that pro-JWs refuse to even consider, or want the public to see on the main Jehovah's Witness page, and is highly relevant information about this religion. If the page is removed then the links and information on the critical page must go on the main <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_173f.html" title="Jehovah's Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> page, which will end up with World War 3 edits wars. Most regular JW posters on the main Jehovah's Witness page want this critical page to exist, but on a separate page as it now is, as they do not want critical information on the main Jehovah's Witness page. If you, <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> insist on creating trouble, you will end up trashing all the JW related pages, and creating chaos and edit wars that will never end. I can only see your personal motives as extreme trouble making, and meddling with your ego power games. I note you've made no contributions at all to anything on the main <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_173f.html" title="Jehovah's Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> page, so why are you now inciting trouble and edit wars? Most JWs who use the main Jehovah's Witness page, agree there should be a critical page that is separate. If you insist on causing anarchy and trouble, you must take responsibly for trashing the main page also, as that is what will happen over and over again, if critical information is not given a rightful place, especially as most pro-JW posters on the main Jehovah's Witness page refuse to allow critical links, books, or any real balance (note all the links are positive on the main JW page as an example). This links page, Critical Information on Jehovah's Witnesses, should definitely stay, and you should keep from making trouble and chaos on Wikipedia, especially where you've made zero contributions to the pages/subjects you are seeking to destroy/sabotage. I suggest you <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> should desistfrom your thoughtless and irresponsible trouble making.<a href="../../../e/y/e/User%7EEyesopen_6f9a.html" title="User:Eyesopen">Eyesopen</a> 27 May 2005</li>

Forgive me if I cause offense hear, but your reasoning makes as much sense as arguing that we need a "critical information on Jews" page to counteract edit wars with Nazis.

<li>Delete: The article is misnamed (capitalization is irregular), and what it implies is "Criticism of Jehovah's Witnesses." Well, such criticisms aren't hard to find. The 1967 <i>Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church,</i> for example, had an extremely short entry on the group, concluding that they are a "vile sect." A "criticisms" section in the JW article should eat most of this, but in an NPOV fashion.

<li>I have no questions about the page being set up for all the right reasons. However, I don't think there is any need to chronicle all the vandalism done by these users, and I certainly don't think there is any need for the long lists of sockpuppets that they have used.

<li><s><b>Neutral</b></s> I too have come to realize that these pages do little to manage the vandals. I made the page (WiC) simply because it was clogging up the long ternm alerts page.There have been times when one of the vandals struck repeatedly that this page was useful but I suppose short term alerts could serve that roll as well. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue"><b>B</b>roken</a><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrokenSegue_2c3b.html" title="User talk:BrokenSegue"><b>S</b>egue</a> 11:20, 27 May 2005 (UTC) I switch to <b>weak keep</b> after reading the below. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue"><b>B</b>roken</a><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrokenSegue_2c3b.html" title="User talk:BrokenSegue"><b>S</b>egue</a> 19:23, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. People who devote their time to vandal-patrolling have kept a painstaking record of this sort of thing in order to prevent it reoccurring (which in this case has been effective).

<li>This is <i>not</i> an attempt to brush aside the work of vandal hunters.

<li><b>Comment</b>, I think a better way to keep track of these vandals is with a template, like that it already put on WiC. The template should be listed with the long term alert, and applied to new pages, it can also be used to find the already banned socks. These tropy pages aren't really necessary if such a system was in place. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 14:48, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Refactor</b>. Willy on Wheels, Ass Pus/Pelican Shit/Bugger, and {{{SITENAME}}} is Communism (whom several have suspected to be all one single individual) are recurring pests. But what is equally tedious to deal with are the "There's a new vandal! HE MUST BE DEALT WITH!" screaming alerts that come up on the talk pages of the various projects' main pages, VIP pages, and sysop user pages. These pages, here and on other WikiMedia projects, are not just trophies. They are ways of informing well-meaning editors that this is <i>not</i> some massive immediate emergency that requires spamming of talk pages, but a regular, long-term, simmering, problem, that will be dealt with <i>this</i> time as it was dealt with the <i>last</i> umpteen times. (They have also been ways of editors venting their frustrations at the perceived inabilities or unwillingnesses of developers to deal with these problems.) Recording the modus operandi of this(these) vandal(s) is important, so that well-meaning editors can recognize <i>more of the same old vandalism from the same person</i> when they see it. I think that information about these vandals should be merged, however. {{{SITENAME}}} is Communism has appeared on Wikipedia, Wikibooks, and Wikinews to my knowledge. Willy on Wheels and Ass Pus has(have) appeared even on <i>non</i>-WikiMedia wikis, such as SwarmWiki. In many cases, an attack on one wiki is almost immediately followed by attacks on others <i>using the same user name</i>. There's <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Vandalism_reports" class="extiw" title="m:Vandalism_reports">an area on Meta</a> that is specifically devoted to cross-project vandalism. It should be employed to greater extent for this(these) vandal(s). <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:28, 2005 May 27 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> this is valuable information for vandal hunters. Unfortunately, they're always going to have some attention. Let's make it easier to track them down and ignore them as much as possible. Besides, it provides a central point to share info on them and stops info on them from spreading too much. (I'm not against an alternative for keeping info on these vandals, but such a system should be in place before deleting this info.) <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 20:30, May 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>

Please feel free to email me at WLSTIPE3@hotmail.com if you wish to receive a word doc. containing all 62 back issues of the ADU.--WLSTIPE</li>

<li>I originally listed this because I thought that a list of lists was a silly idea, not to mention that it is misnamed and only contains 5 lists. I think if this isn't deleted, it needs a lot of work; it should at least be renamed to "List of lists of artists by nationality" and contain more "less-obscure" nationalities. I mean, it seems that if Slovenian artists are listed, there should at least be French, Spanish, etc. artists as well. It's also inconsistent; Korean artists looks more like an article on Korean art types, while Canadian artists is a pure list of artists. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVircum_5167.html" title="User:Vircum">michael</a> 02:23, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>It exists now. Therefore, it takes a consensus to delete. Having reflex "keep" votes (a big, persistent criticism that "particular school particular vote" folks like me have) and then taunts that everyone must stop voting delete until the golden dawn really doesn't help. There is no consensus on keeping, none on deleting, but the delete folks, so far as I've seen, haven't been targeting other Wikipedians for abuse nor running pages to marshal -bot like votes. (And I figure that I would have been called if there were such a thing, since I vote delete on most schools because most anything isn't notable.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:53, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>:Schoolwatch is vote-neutral. It only tells you if a vote for deletion is on, and which article that vote is on. It doesn't tell you how to vote. "No consensus on keeping" is a straw man; outside speedies, no article needs consensus to keep. Actually a lot of people seem to think that schools are intrinsically encyclopedic (an opinion that I share), hence the consistency of recent school VfDs in opposing deletion of schools--indeed in most cases returning a majority vote for keep. The deletion of any school article seems to be becoming a minority position. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 15:20, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_4cc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch</a> states that it <i>[...] is a campaign to ensure that articles on schools are allowed to develop on Wikipedia</i>.

<li>Yes, in the manner in which it is executed, the Schoolwatch page is vote-neutral. Anybody can pop it onto his watchlist and vote according to his preferences. The fact that people interested in preserving schools from arbitrary deletion act as if this kind of publicity will attract more keep votes than delete votes suggests that they believe that in general school articles on Wikipedia are fairly popular. This belief seems to be born out by events; as schoolwatch has been used more so the proportion of people voting "keep" on school VfDs has grown, to the point where now it quite often exceeds those voting delete--an unusual event on VfD. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 15:56, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Some 64 school-related deletion listings started so far this month have been closed, and all the data was kept. A school playing field was merged with redirect to the associated school article, two listings were withdrawn by their nominators, and the remaining 61 articles were kept. Articles listed for deletion included three about middle schools and one about a primary school. The rest were presumably secondary or high schools. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:58, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> It appears to me that you've misunderstood what RickK was threatening. RickK was objecting to ME suggesting that people Google their nominations before nominating them, and threatening to remove my <i><b>comments</b></i> attached to my vote, <i><b>not the article itself</b></i>. Although I think RickK and I disagree about whether my suggestion of a quick Google before nomination is a personal attack worthy or removal on sight or not, I respect that he remained completely objective about leaving the article itself out of the disagreement. Unilateral removal of the article itself is not a valid option. "Unverifiable" in your comments suggests you haven't seen the photos of the place linked in the article itself, nor Googled it yourself to see that it is a major tourist attraction in Karachi. It is clearly verifiable. Notability? I can't decide that for you, but to me, it clearly is. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#000099">focused</font></a> 04:37, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I did not Google ahead and have not Googled now. What is unverifiable is "tallest." What we can't verify are the claims within the article that give the notability. I have no doubt it's a real place, and I have nothing against monuments being in Wikipedia, but we have to resist the tallest, biggest, oldest, busiest, emptiest, etc. for every town in the world. That's not our function, but rather a Guiness Book and Baedeker function. I agree with people using their keep votes to chide nominators. I've seen it over and over again. People go through saying, not just "keep," but "keep! you obviously know nothing about this" (suggesting that only experts may determine if they've learned about a topic from the article or not?) or "keep! deletionist trolls" (common in the school debates). Given that we've recently had an RfC launched because of someone nominating to VfD, I think it's important to clamp down hard here. Debate the article, not the person, as the person is generally not part of the matter. Also note that I personally always advocate voting on the article, not the topic. Because this is a Wiki, it's as easy to delete an article and wait for a knowledgeable person to recreate it as it is to preserve a misinforming thing and wait for a knowledgeable person to see it, not get disgusted with us, and fix it. That's why I would be willing to say delete to the whole article for the lack of significance in what is stated. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:00, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>If the problem is that you dispute the claim of tallest, then why not just change the article to "some claim it is the tallest" rather than vote to delete an article on a major, well known structure?</li>
<li>Also, we did <b>not</b> have a <i>Request for Comments</i> launched because of someone nominating VfD, we had an RfC launched because someone responded in a hostile manner to four different users making a good faith effort to communicate a concern to him. (Blanking four separate polite attempts to communicate without response, then proceeding to continue the action of concern.) The fact that it was VfD nominations that we wanted to talk about is merely a conincidental fact. The request was "Hey, this person won't communicate with us... is there something wrong here?" and is the first step in dispute resolution when someone rebuffs multiple good faith efforts to communicate. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#000099">focused</font></a> 16:27, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>60 employees or attorneys in a firm do not necessarily make it notable. The supermarket around the corner might well have more than 60 employees and most are not notable. The question should be "Has this law firm achieved anything particular, which makes it worth being integrated into an encyclopedia?"

<li><b>Comment</b>. Well 60-lawyer <i>litigation</i> firms aren't usually very big. This is a pretty lean firm, they don't do litigation. Their claim to fame, for me, is their ratings, which are high. They're definitely notable within their field of patent prosecution--dotting i's, crossing t's and pushing patent applications through for their clients. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 23:51, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>I maintain my position. Being rated number one in a specialized ranking is not an achievement in the context of an "encyclopedia". An encyclopedia is a compendium of synthetic knowledge susceptible to be useful in the context of education (παιδεια = "education"). The lawyers at the firm are probably doing a pretty good job, but they are just doing their job. The article does not indicate any significant achievement. A definitive no no. --<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdcolins_06ae.html" title="User:Edcolins">Edcolins</a> 15:49, May 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That is special pleading. We have grounds for inclusion and they emphatically do not include any educational requirement. Such grounds as do exist have been amply satisfied. You just made up the idea that there should be some educational function to including an item in the encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:21, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Please do not write as if you were representing the whole wikipedian community. As a wikipedian, I also claim to be part of the "we" you refer to. In the absence of any clear boundary between what should be part of wikipedia and what shouldn't, I find it reasonable to refer to the common meaning of "encyclopedia". From what I read from <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_02d7.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_vanity_press" title="Wikipedia:Vanity">Wikipedia is not a vanity press</a>, wikipedia policy especially refers to the origin of the word "encyclopedia" with a specific mention of the word "education". I do not find unreasonable to interpret this as "We have grounds for inclusion and they implicitly include an educational requirement (in the broad sense in which this term is used)." You will probably argue that the sentence "[Wikipedia] should contain only material that some definable group of people might want to know" follows. This is however a cyclical criterion since the verb "know" should be construed in view of the meaning of encyclopedia, otherwise tomorrow's weather, dictionary definitions and any information found in a business directory would fall within "material that some definable group of people might want to know". --<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdcolins_06ae.html" title="User:Edcolins">Edcolins</a> 17:12, May 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Interesting, but I'd like a little more information on who PatentRatings LLC are, apart from their connection to LexisNexis. There are thousands of organisations that rate companies for promotional purposes only. Anyway, if they're such a wonderful law firm, I'm sure they've done some very high profile cases. Can anyone find any of those? That would certainly convince me of their notability. --<a href="../../../w/e/y/User%7EWeyes_aab8.html" title="User:Weyes">W</a>(<a href="../../../w/e/y/User_talk%7EWeyes_0fbf.html" title="User talk:Weyes">t</a>) 00:35, 2005 May 28 (UTC)

<dd>They're not litigators, they just file claims with the patent office. I take your point about PatentRatings, but we don't evaluate sources in that way. I've given a reference in an IP trade journal that cites PatentRatings as a source, and clearly the firm <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schwegman%2C_Lundberg%2C_Woessner_%26_Kluth%2C_P.A._903e.html" title="Schwegman, Lundberg, Woessner &amp; Kluth, P.A.">Schwegman, Lundberg, Woessner &amp; Kluth, P.A.</a> is (rightly or wrongly) regarded as a major force in patent prosecution. That is all we can do as an encyclopedia. Let's not get dragged into OR just to establish whether the IP trade journals are being misled. The company is unequivocally notable because it has been noted by a relevant trade journal as a leader in the field. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 02:33, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia is not paper and it is not a traditional encyclopedia. Some people need to open their minds. If Wikipedia is to be the world's foremost compendium of knowledge, it goes without saying (but I'll blabber on anyway) that there will be articles on topics some people do not consider notable. But if there is any topic that anybody might just possibly perhaps someday somehow decide they might just be slightly somewhat kinda interested in, there should be an article here.

<li><b>Concurr</b> I'm getting so tired of VfD being used for emergency cleanup. VfD is about is the subject of an article is encyclopedic. A 60 person law firm that is considdered important in the world of patent litigation is notable, in a way that a 2 man personal injury firm is not. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 09:43, 31 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>So, given this support, we should start substubs for every possible law firm in the world that might be considered notable in some way! Largest five firms in any of 80 different kinds of law, for each city/state/country, biggest wins/losses in each type of law and in every court, oldest firms, newest firms, longest names, biggest salaries, biggest idiots, etc. Of course, because they are "notable", the articles will be immune from VfD. <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupinelawyer_3a03.html" title="User:Lupinelawyer">Lupinelawyer</a> 22:47, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Excuse Me, Rick and Megan, but I really don't think you should be talking when you don't know exactly what you're talking about. The project is not about *every* Mariah Carey song, it's about all her single releases. And Rick, It's a bit rude too to be insulting Everyking and his Ashlee Simpson articles too. And Freddy, I'll Be There is one of the bigger and more remembered hits of Mariah's career. I understand the points mentioned about songs usually being put together, but as mentioned above, it is a project that we have been working on for some while, and they help to maintain the flow the of the Mariah Carey single articles, and merging would really disrupt it. <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegaWikipedia_90c1.html" title="User:OmegaWikipedia">OmegaWikipedia</a> 06:34, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, these are a fantastic set of articles and are well written, leave them alone and stop putting them on votes for deletion.

<li>I didn't want the article deleted; I suggested a merge (essentially a copy-paste job with the removal of redundant information). I'm not trying to hurt anyone's feelings or undermine anyone's work.

<li>I understand your point of view, but if you read both articles you'll find they have little to do with each other due to their separate impact and the huge difference between both acts and also there is too much information for a merge to make sense. <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltimate_Star_Wars_Freak_7703.html" title="User:Ultimate Star Wars Freak">Ultimate Star Wars Freak</a> 19:47, 29 May 2005 (UTC)

<p>The pages in question are: <b>Table of Unicode characters, 128 to 999</b>, <b>Table of Unicode characters, 1000 to 1999</b>, <b>Table of Unicode characters, 32 to 9999</b>, <b>Table of Unicode precomposed characters</b>, <b>Unicode 1-50</b>, <b>Unicode 51-75</b>, <b>Unicode 76-100</b>, <b>Unicode 101-125</b>, <b>Unicode 126-150</b>, <b>Unicode 151-175</b>, <b>Unicode characters 0-31</b>, <b>Unicode characters 32-63</b>, <b>Unicode characters 64-95</b>, <b>Unicode characters 96-127</b>, <b>Unicode characters 160-191</b>, <b>Unicode characters for the Arabic alphabet</b>, and <b><a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Romanian_Unicode_characters_4d48.html" title="Special Romanian Unicode characters">Special Romanian Unicode characters</a></b>.</p>
<p>I think all of these belong in Wikisource because they are not encyclopedic (and probably mostly auto-generated anyway).

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Transwiki/Delete</b>. Also, at over 400 K, Table of Unicode characters, 32 to 9999 needs to be broken into managable chunks, first. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 17:16, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Possibly Keep</b> and reorganize (along the lines of the officially listed ranges in the standard), unless deletion or transwiki should be a precedent for all tables of encodings. (Examples: tables appearing in article <a href="../../../a/s/c/ASCII_d2cd.html" title="ASCII">ASCII</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/d/Code_page_437.html" title="Code page 437">Code page 437</a>, members of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Category%7ECharacter_sets_66c2.html" title="Category:Character sets">Category:Character sets</a>, etc.) Presumably Unicode tables are broken up because: (1) They are officially broken into ranges by the standard and (2) combining them into one page, especially including them all in the Unicode page, makes the page too large. I don't think Unicode is any less notable than, say, ASCII -- so are the encodings unencylopedic because of their number? How does it compare with pages like <a href="../../../t/a/b/Table_of_divisors.html" title="Table of divisors">Table of divisors</a> or <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Football_League_Tables%2C_1893-94_1cdf.html" title="Scottish Football League Tables, 1893-94">Scottish Football League Tables, 1893-94</a>?

<li><b>Comment:</b> If this article is attempting to describe Matt Wright's <code>FormMail.pl</code>, then it's likely that it <i>is</i> a moderately notable subject. FormMail.pl was the first widely-distributed CGI script to allow Web developers to add email-sending features to Web sites ... unfortunately, it also has a long, nasty history of security bugs allowing spammers to abuse any server with it installed, to send spam. If you ever got spam that started with the message "Below is the result of your feedback form", it was sent through an insecure FormMail.pl script. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 03:58, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I run <a href="http://pcking.ca/wikilyrics" class="external text" title="http://pcking.ca/wikilyrics" rel="nofollow">wikilyrics</a>, made this article, and added several external links on wikipedia articles of artists. Let's discuss this here - I'm interested in knowing what is wrong with the situation. Maybe I do not fully understand wikipedia's rules. In my understanding, I see nothing wrong with linking artists to their pages on wikilyrics. Each artist category in wikilyrics actually links back to the respective page on wikipedia and I had thought the interwiki linking would make content/metadata easy for users to access. I only see this as helping both wikipedia and wikilyrics. Now - I see what you are saying about linking to categories which don't have much actual content on wikilyrics. In such cases, wikipedia is getting nothing out of the links while wikilyrics is getting wikipedia's visitors. Is there wikipedia policy about this somewhere? Could we say that wikipedia should only link to wikilyrics categories with at least, say...20 song lyrics pages? Give me some more information to work with. The goal was not to anger fellow wikipedians and spam the database. The goal was to create a wiki which provided free-content song lyrics with no ads and I thought mutual linkage between the sites would benefit everyone. Maybe I am wrong. If you wish, feel free to discuss this in <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAnthony5429_c8af.html" title="User talk:Anthony5429">my user talk</a> as well. --<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony5429_7f52.html" title="User:Anthony5429">Anthony5429</a> 04:19, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes, there are certain guidelines for linking, see <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a>. I've posted that link to several anon users who were adding wikilyrics links and warned them but have always been ignored. Still, on the bright side, since you seem cooperative enough that probably means those anons were other people, which means wikilyrics must be taking off at least slightly. --<a href="../../../w/e/y/User%7EWeyes_aab8.html" title="User:Weyes">W</a>(<a href="../../../w/e/y/User_talk%7EWeyes_0fbf.html" title="User talk:Weyes">t</a>) 04:40, 2005 May 28 (UTC)</li>

Anyone is welcome to sign up and/or edit the database and if you take the time to look around, you will see that there are several users (44 right now) contributing to the site and it is not an outlet for self-promotion.

I can therefore not be accused of self-promotion. The site was made to be a public, free-content, online wiki community where people could find lyrics to songs without the annoying ads and spyware conventional lyrics sites are accustomed to.

Geez. Alexa rank down in the 800,000's, and even the article mentions the site was started not even two months ago.

<dd><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a>, how long should a site be up before it is considered notable or expressing longevity? If it needs to be a certain age, I can repost this article in a set amount of time. I am not familiar with the policy - please fill me in. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptoDerk_6aa9.html" title="User:CryptoDerk">CryptoDerk</a>, there are several stub articles on wikilyrics. There are, however, far more completed articles. You can look around if you wish. <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrius_3685.html" title="User:Cyrius">Cyrius</a>, what is wrong with asking the users to vote against deletion of this article? I don't see anything wrong with that and it is not self promotion because the site does not promote me. Also, many wikipedia articles already link to lyrics sites so the copyright issue should not be brought up unless the site is included as a wikimedia project - which it is not. Wikipedia's disclaimer specifically says that it claims no affiliation with its content. That includes external links. Am I wrong? Also, please fill me in on the lyrics.ch incident - I am not familiar with it. Wikilyrics has a disclaimer on every page which credits the lyrics to their writer. Is that enough? One other thing - I stopped encouraging the users to add links to Wikipedia since some people see this as spamming. Please let me know what it takes to make wikilyrics notable and worthy of being linked to in wikipedia. I looked through <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> but saw nothing definitive on the subject.

<li>Your "General disclaimer", to which you link above, is stunningly wrong-headed. You say you're not a lawyer. Neither am I. But I am capable of reading simple explanations of copyright law written for laymen. Aren't you capable too -- or do you just choose to not to read this stuff and instead to rely on wishful thinking? Nobody has said that your site needs more "notoriety" to get an article here. They have said that it needs to be notable. Of course, notability includes true notoriety -- murder one person and you're probably still a nobody, murder half a dozen and WP will write you up -- and large-scale copyright violation may eventually win your site notoriety. (My own guess is that it will wither away or be closed down first.) -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 04:46, 2005 May 29 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Wikilyrics is one of the most innovative and creative aspects I've seen here. It allows articles to be linked to lyrics, yet to keep up the theme of a Wikipedian style entry.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Wikilyrics is an open alternative resource to other commercial, advert-, error- and popup-full web sites, which make it a hard time for somebody looking for lyrics to find them; unlike them, wikilyrics allow any person interested in lyrics to find them quickly. If it is expanded and gets more popular, as we are expecting - it is not up for a long time yet -, it will allow us to create a directory of song lyrics, which can be very handy for open source multimedia software (imagine automated lyrics downloading using the built-in MediaWiki XML export, with, for instance, a plugin on XMMS). If we decide to delete the external links on song- and artist-related articles, at least I suggest that we kept the article about the website. --<a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyziz_5efb.html" title="User:Dionyziz">dionyziz</a> 09:34, May 29, 2005 (UTC).

<dd>Here's a proposition. Feel free to voice your opinions about it. Since I'm not getting definitive information about what it takes for WP to consider a site notable, how about we delete this article and I'll put it back up if and only if there are ever more than 5000 songs in the database and 100 users. If the site never reaches those goals or it is shut down because people believe it infringes on copyrights, I will not add the article back. If the goals are reached, I will add the article and instead of links which say <i>(artist) Lyrics @ Wikilyrics</i>, I will only add links which say <i>(artist) Lyrics</i> and furthermore, will instruct the wikilyrics users not to add the links if there is not substantial lyrics for the artist. Moreover, I will tell the users not to add the link if there is already a lyrics link on the article. I've seen that in several pages already where there are already external links to lyrics sites. Anyone is free to agree or disagree with this proposition. It's just a suggestion. Please tell me what you think. Again, I'm trying to be helpful. I'm not trying to spam WP. Interwiki linking should be beneficial to both sites. --<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony5429_7f52.html" title="User:Anthony5429">Anthony5429</a> 17:15, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>"They"? Are you not a Wikipedia editor? But, Anthony, let me ask you a question. What would you do if I came over to your Wikilyrics site and began creating articles about subjects which had nothing to do with lyrics? Would you delete them, or would you welcome me with open arms and tell me that I'm doing a great job and to do more? If we have to follow the rules set on your site, why don't you have to follow the rules we've set on our site? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 22:17, May 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>We can't really make deals, otherwise everybody and their brother would be trying for one. However, if the article is deleted and you come back some time in the future when your site is more than just an interesting idea, I think you'll get a better reception. Unfortunately, as I write this, you have taken Wikilyrics completely offline due to the copyright issue, which isn't going to help with having a Wikipedia article. -- <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrius_3685.html" title="User:Cyrius">Cyrius</a>|<a href="../../../c/y/r/User_talk%7ECyrius_ef50.html" title="User talk:Cyrius">✎</a> 22:22, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per DoubleBlue. If you don't have time, I'm not sure why you feel there's an urgent need to get articles on VfD right away.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Firstly it's not an album, it's a six track EP. I dont know why DoubleBlue qouted a press release from the band's website with "notable" - well I guess you can believe anything. Sorry but this release isnt that notable for inclusion. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 02:17, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>So what? The article for VfD is the EP not the band. Read what I said. I never said the band wasn't notable - the band isnt up for VfD. The article for VfD is the EP not the band. Please explain why this release is notable - not the band. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 03:34, 28 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's a professionally-produced EP by a band that meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and has been covered in plenty of mainstream music press. That's enough for notability to me. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 03:48, May 28, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While the band may meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, the band is not up for VfD, the EP is. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 04:54, 28 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps I haven't been clear enough. Here's my reasoning. 1) Band is notable per WP:MUSIC. 2) EPs by notable bands are notable. 3) Ergo, EP is notable. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 05:02, May 28, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Using that reasoning, every song by Death From Above 1979 should have its own article merely because Death From Above 1979 has some notability. Articles in wikipedia should stand on their own merits. So far I havent seen any reason why this particular EP is notable on its own. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 05:26, 28 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Information about individual songs, if there's anything to say about them beyond their titles and running times, can be kept in the EP's article. Could we merge a band's entire discography into the band's article? Sure, but for many bands, this would make the article too big, and precedent is set by the (guessing here) <i>thousands</i> of articles on individual albums and EPs. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 05:38, May 28, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I can't imagine Death From Above 1979 having an exceedingly large biography all things considered. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 05:49, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> real release by real band; as far as I know, the guiding policy for albums seems to be that if the band is notable enough to have an article, then their albums can have articles within the "albums" project. I don't buy the argument that individual songs are a comparable situation; it's easier to define what makes one song more notable than another (chart success, cultural context, etc.) than it is for albums, and song info merges into an album article much more easily than album info merges into a band bio. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 16:51, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
