Established in 1718 on the banks of the Black River in historic Georgetown, South Carolina, MANSFIELD PLANTATION is widely recognized as one of the most well-preserved antebellum rice plantations in the United States. Spanning nearly 1,000 acres of pine forest, rice fields and cypress swamps, and bordered by the Black River, Mansfield plantation was once one of the largest rice producing plantations in the country. Mansfield, along with adjacent rice plantations up and down the Black River, provided much of Europe with it's "Carolina Gold" rice during the late 1700's and early 1800's. Rice growing was made possible by 1) perfecting irrigation techniques using tidal water and manmade dykes; 2) experimentation with natural fertilizers; 3) and most notably, African-American slave labor. After the American Civil War, rice production became too expensive and soon the plantations fell into bankruptcy and were sold off to new owners.</p>
<p>Today, Mansfield Plantation is preserved as an anthentic rice plantation, complete with the original plantation home, winnowing barn, school house, live oak avenue ("oak alley"), slave village, chapel, guest house and plantation grounds. The entire plantation is undergoing a privately-funded, massive restoration project to keep their distinct history alive for generations to come. The plantation is also home to a luxurious, award-winning bed &amp; breakfast where guests can step back into time as they take in the history surrounding them.</p>
<p>Mansfield Plantation is also the only known plantation in the USA to be saved from development and reclaimed by a direct descendent of the original owners. Their efforts to preserve this slice of American history will be appreciated for generations to come.</p>

<p>Sowbre is part of the Pokemon franchise and appears as an relaxed sow with two blue crystals on it's forehead and chest. Although it bares simalarity to Spoink and Grumpig, it has no relations to Spoink, but with Grumpig it can breed either Spoink or Psyglet. Sowbre first appears in the Dark Islands games.</p>

<p>Strangely, Sowbre posseses the ability to hover and move about and is often called "Pig Buddha" as it's Japanese name <i>Bubuddha</i>. If a Sowbre and a Grumpig are left at the day care center, they will either breed a Spoink or Psyglet. The differance is to breed a Spoink, the Grumpig must have the Soy Bean item and vice-versa.</p>

<p>Neo means new and eclectic means diverse. (You may have heard of someone with eclectic tastes). Neo-eclecticism was what replaced the boring and anti-ornamental styles of Modernism. When one idea runs out of energy its replacement is quite often an opposite idea. This happened in the early 1980's.</p>
<p>A lot of neo-eclecticism doesn't really have much of a better reason for existing than to fill the void after Modernism. It doesn't stand for anything much except for being interesting and recycling older ornamentation in a fun way. It didn't matter where this ornamentation came from - it could be classical, gothic, renaissance, Aztec, or even Disneyland. This opposed the Modern notion that in order to build something new, you had to pull down the old. Neo-eclecticism basically said no, let's build the new using the old, and see what happens.</p>
<p>Neo eclecticism was very much attracted to the shapes from formal styles of architecture such as those from ancient Rome or Greece. We call these Classical. A formal style means one that has sets of rules and agreed meanings. Neo eclecticism took the shapes and left the rules out. This wasn't the first time Classical shapes had been re-used, there was in fact a revival called neo-classicism over one hundred years before. Some commentators call the Post-modern version neo-neo-classicism. This is what happens when you run out of words.</p>

<p>←<a href="http://www.memoryGreetings.com20" class="external free" title="http://www.memoryGreetings.com20" rel="nofollow">http://www.memoryGreetings.com20</a> Things that average person don't know. 1. It boasts how long it can stay up. Go to the Command Prompt in the Accessories menu from the All Programs start button option, and then type 'systeminfo'. The computer will produce a lot of useful info, including the uptime. If you want to keep these, type 'systeminfo &gt; info.txt'. This creates a file called info.txt you can look at later with Notepad. (Professional Edition only).</p>
<p>2. You can delete files immediately, without having them move to the Recycle Bin first. Go to the Start menu, select Run... and type 'gpedit.msc'; then select User Configuration, Administrative Templates, Windows Components, Windows Explorer and find the Do not move deleted files to the Recycle Bin setting. Set it. Poking around in gpedit will reveal a great many interface and system options, but take care -- some may stop your computer behaving as you wish. (Professional Edition only).</p>
<p>3. You can lock your XP workstation with two clicks of the mouse. Create a new shortcut on your desktop using a right mouse click, and enter 'rundll32.exe user32.dll,LockWorkStation' in the location field. Give the shortcut a name you like. That's it -- just double click on it and your computer will be locked. And if that's not easy enough, Windows key + L will do the same.</p>
<p>4. XP hides some system software you might want to remove, such as Windows Messenger, but you can make it show everything. Using Notepad or Edit, edit the text file /windows/inf/sysoc.inf, search for the word 'hide' and remove it. You can then go to the Add or Remove Programs in the Control Panel, select Add/Remove Windows Components and there will be the software and you can now uninstall it.</p>
<p>5. For those skilled in the art of DOS batch files, XP has a number of interesting new commands. These include 'eventcreate' and 'eventtriggers' for creating and watching system events, 'typeperf' for monitoring performance of various subsystems, and 'schtasks' for handling scheduled tasks. As usual, typing the command name followed by /? will give a list of options.</p>
<p>Anique Akhtar&#160;? 1/24/2007 6:47 AM 6. XP has IP version 6 support -- the next generation of IP. Unfortunately this is more than your ISP has, so you can only experiment with this on your LAN. Type 'ipv6 install' into Run... (it's OK, it won't ruin your existing network setup) and then 'ipv6 /?' at the command line to find out more. If you don't know what IPv6 is, don't worry.</p>
<p>7. You can at last get rid of tasks on the computer from the command line by using 'taskkill /pid' and the task number, or just 'tskill' and the process number. Find that out by typing 'tasklist', which will also tell you a lot about what's going on in your system.</p>
<p>8. XP will treat Zip files like folders, which is nice if you've got a fast machine. On slower machines, you can make XP leave zip files alone by typing 'regsvr32 /u zipfldr.dll' at the command line. If you change your mind later, you can change things back by typing 'regsvr32 zipfldr.dll'.</p>
<p>9. XP has ClearType -- Mic*ft's anti-aliasing font display technology -- but doesn't have it enabled by default. It's well worth trying, especially if you were there for DOS and all those years of staring at a screen have given you the eyes of an astigmatic bat. To enable ClearType, right click on the desktop, select Properties, Appearance, Effects, select ClearType from the second drop-down menu and enable the selection. Expect best results on laptop displays. If you want to use ClearType on the Welcome login screen as well, set the registry entry HKEY_USERS/.DEFAULT/Control Panel/Desktop/FontSmoothingType to 2.</p>
<p>10. You can use Remote Assistance to help a friend who's using network address translation (NAT) on a home network, but not automatically. Get your pal to email you a Remote Assistance invitation and edit the file. Under the RCTICKET attribute will be a NAT IP address, like 192.168.1.10. Replace this with your friend's real IP address -- they can find this out by going to www.whatismyip.com -- and get them to make sure that they've got port 3389 open on their firewall and forwarded to the errant computer.</p>
<p>Anique Akhtar&#160;? 1/24/2007 6:48 AM 11. You can run a program as a different user without logging out and back in again. Right click the icon, select Run As... and enter the user name and password you want to use. This only applies for that run. The trick is particularly useful if you need to have administrative permissions to install a program, which many require. Note that you can have some fun by running programs multiple times on the same system as different users, but this can have unforeseen effects.</p>
<p>12. Windows XP can be very insistent about you checking for auto updates, registering a Passport, using Windows Messenger and so on. After a while, the nagging goes away, but if you feel you might go insane before that point, run Regedit, go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Mic*ft/Windows/Current Version/Explorer/Advanced and create a DWORD value called EnableBalloonTips with a value of 0.</p>
<p>13. You can start up without needing to enter a user name or password. Select Run... from the start menu and type 'control userpasswords2', which will open the user accounts application. On the Users tab, clear the box for Users Must Enter A User Name And Password To Use This Computer, and click on OK. An Automatically Log On dialog box will appear; enter the user name and password for the account you want to use.</p>
<p>14. Internet Explorer 6 will automatically delete temporary files, but only if you tell it to. Start the browser, select Tools / Internet Options... and Advanced, go down to the Security area and check the box to Empty Temporary Internet Files folder when browser is closed.</p>
<p>15. XP comes with a free Network Activity Light, just in case you can't see the LEDs twinkle on your network card. Right click on My Network Places on the desktop, then select Properties. Right click on the description for your LAN or dial-up connection, select Properties, then check the Show icon in notification area when connected box. You'll now see a tiny network icon on the right of your task bar that glimmers nicely during network traffic.</p>
<p>Anique Akhtar&#160;? 1/24/2007 6:48 AM 16. The Start Menu can be leisurely when it decides to appear, but you can speed things along by changing the registry entry HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Control Panel/Desktop/MenuShowDelay from the default 400 to something a little snappier. Like 0.</p>
<p>17. You can rename loads of files at once in Windows Explorer. Highlight a set of files in a window, then right click on one and rename it. All the other files will be renamed to that name, with individual numbers in brackets to distinguish them. Also, in a folder you can arrange icons in alphabetised groups by View, Arrange Icon By... Show In Groups.</p>
<p>18. Windows Media Player will display the cover art for albums as it plays the tracks -- if it found the picture on the Internet when you copied the tracks from the CD. If it didn't, or if you have lots of pre-WMP music files, you can put your own copy of the cover art in the same directory as the tracks. Just call it folder.jpg and Windows Media Player will pick it up and display it.</p>
<p>19. Windows key + Break brings up the System Properties dialogue box; Windows key + D brings up the desktop; Windows key + Tab moves through the taskbar buttons.</p>
<p>20. Windows XP secretly KNOWS that the average user has no idea what they are doing. Therefore, it doesn't let you do really stupid things like deleting the windows directory (at least not without spending several hours convincing it that you REALLY want to do this). Oh yeah, and internet explorer kinda sucks.</p>

<p>What the hell is a Slapbak?!?! Is it violent, like a smack down of retaliation? Is it sexual, like the sting of one good love tap to the ass? Is it musical, like the nostril-flaring splank of bass string to fret board? Or is it rebellious, like a middle finger to The Establishment for trying to dictate that genres and creeds never mix? If you checked E - all of the above - then you just copped an all-access pass to the hickory-smoke hideout of the stank funkiest band in the land... Slapbak!</p>
<p>Slapbak is the brazenly category-defying love child of singer/songwriter Jara Harris, who also happens to play drums, bass, guitar and keyboards extremely well. He’s a Mission Viejo native who has painstakingly nurtured his rainbow-shaded band through the sunniest of times to the pitch-black bleakest. This racially and sexually mixed sextet of funk-rockin’ show-stoppers has morphed through several permutations of membership to arrive - in 2005 - with both the master plan and the master band. The result is Slapbak's latest album, The Key: 16 tracks of cranium crushing grooves twisted up from the best that soul, metal, hip hop and the elusive "other" have to offer.</p>
<p>Slapbak is lead singer/bassist Jara Harris, rapper/vocalist TJ Quake, co-lead singer Aleida, guitarist Jeff "J-Rok" Harris, drummer M.A.T.T. and turntablist DJ Ruffnek. Jamming in a circle with all members facing each other, they push each other to dizzying heights of intensity. Leader Jara rocks the center, concealed by a cap as he effortlessly sings and serves his bass a serious thumpin’. J-Rok wrings blistering runs and righteous rhythms from his axe. Aleida - eyes squeezed shut – gyrates and croons much `tude over the groove…lost in music. Ruffnek telegraphs beat back-up on a digital pad to his left while scratchin’ up a desert storm with his right. M.A.T.T. straight body slams his kit with a 2-n-4 you can set a Swiss watch to. And “The Quake” - with arm muscles flexing and throat veins bulging – stomps in and out of the circle spittin’ venomous hooks and verses. As an impenetrable cipher, Slapbak hammers out a funk fortified force field that’ll knock the uninitiated to its knees!</p>
<p>Speaking after hours from Slapbak's 2nd floor recording/rehearsal studio (a non-descript Santa Ana office space by day), Jara explains, "This band is the key to Slapbak eruptin' up from the underground to a whole `nother level. We're a powerful unit able to unlock the essence from several styles at once. That's why we call this CD The Key." But is the world ready? Jara insists it is. "Rawness - especially in hip hop - is what's happening now. And alternative rock has been flexing an extra funky pocket. So the industry is meeting Slapbak half way - and it's about time."</p>
<p>Another key to Slapbak's strength is that it is totally self-contained in all creative endeavors, including videos. "That paint on the wall isn't just an odd choice of decor," Aleida laughs. "It doubles as green screen for our video effects." This is a group used to doing for self and turning lemons into lemonade (spiked, of course). Yet Slapbak has embraced new technology that has, in turn, broadened their sound. "We still record live," Jara assures, "but with better mics, boards and the ability to save mixes, we tweaked thangs a lil' more." Evidence of this natural evolution can be heard in the Middle Eastern touches of the trance-inducing tunes "Too Much," "Down" and the title track "The Key."</p>
<p>Old-school ears will perk up like a pit bull's when they hear The Key’s first single: a funky flip of `70s soul legends WAR's iconic classic "Lowrider." Ironically, Earth Wind &amp; Fire bassist Verdine White - a huge Slapbak fan - was the one who suggested they try it. "I couldn't stop giving him the evil eye at first," Jara admits. “But one day while I was in my car, I got the idea to slow it down. I cut a quick demo and when Quake heard it, he was with it. Aleida added a ‘Cruisin’ down the streets / Checkin’ out the freaks’ hook and Ruffnek threw some tables on it. When we played it for Verdine and our manager Scott, they were beside themselves!" Slapbak also closes The Key with a cover of Sly &amp; The Family Stone’s “Thank You (Falletinme Be Mice Elf Agin),” a jam that has been in their show set list since day one.</p>
<p>Slapbak has another surprise in store on the rousing and sexy anthem "California Girls (Dipped in Chocolate)," featuring a guest appearance by new friend and brother-in-funk, Shock G of Digital Underground. The band had encountered "Digital" many times on the road, beginning in 1997 at the Belly Up club in San Diego. Seven years later, Shock G e-mailed Jara out of the blue and an alliance was formed. The first recorded documentation of this union is on "California Girls." "Shock recorded his vocal in the bathroom," Quake states, "and his rap was off the chain! Even the people in Shock's crew said they've never heard him flow quite like this." D.U.’s Shock G, Money B and Eli grace another song on The Key, too, titled “We Ain’t Playin’ Wid It.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Slapbak drops some libidinous new lingo in your ear on the Lurch-step joint "Trip Dip" (some slang that Quake gave to a dance move they first did back on an older song called "This Car is Fast"). Then there's an electrifying funk rocker featuring special guest Steve Salas on guitar titled "Cold Blooded Filla." The chorus chimes, "I'm a cold-blooded filla / All the guys want my girl but can't get her!" Jara schools, "That song says I'm handlin' my woman's thang so good that I don't have to worry `bout her creepin' on me...I can go to the bathroom at the club and not have to sweat what's happenin' when I get back!" No less than the late, great soul man Wilson Pickett woulda certified this one as 'wicked!’</p>
<p>With all that plus the dance jam "Break it Out" (based on one of J-Rok's patented guitar grooves), the sensual, smooved-out ballad "Make Room For Love," and much more funk on tap throughout The Key, Slapbak is standing on the verge of the hard-earned blow up they've been trip-dippin' towards for over a decade.</p>
<p>And it couldn't be happenin’ to a tighter, set-to-wreck Band of Gypsies.</p>

Lord Sir Joseph Dukes is the undisputed king of the underground baby punk scene in downtown Conroe. He is known for his outlandish stage antics which to date have included the consumption of human feces and public masturbation.</p>
<pre>
 The Early Years
 Lord Sir Joseph Dukes was not always known as "Lord Sir", in fact this was a title awarded to him by the king of punk couture.  The King of punk couture is said to have founded the baby punk scene in the early 2000's, and is known to have taken influences from bands such as Franz Ferdinand and Modest Mouse.  It is said that he received the title from the king of punk couture after administering a quite blistful handjob.

<p>Cast:</p>
<pre>
Graham Chapman, who in addition to playing King Arthur, was also the voice of God, one of the Giant's three heads and a guard of Swamp Castle with the hiccups.  (Thomson Gale “Monty Python’s the flying circus“.)
</pre>
<p>Terry Jones played Bedevere. He also played a peasant who bothers Arthur, another of the Giant's three heads and Prince Herbert. (Thomson Gale “Monty Python’s the flying circus“.)</p>
<p>John Cleese played Sir Lancelot. In addition, he played the Black Knight, a peasant who accuses a woman of being a witch and the insulting Frenchman. (Thomson Gale “The life of John. Cleese”)</p>
<p>Eric Idle plays Sir Robin. Idle also played a collector of the dead, a peasant who accuses a woman of being a witch, a guard who needs to be spoon fed instructions at Swamp Castle, Lancelot's servant named Concorde, a shrubbery maker, and a priest who is eaten by the Black Beast of Aaaaargh. (Thomson Gale “Monty Python’s the flying circus“.)</p>
<p>Michael Palin as Sir Galahad. Palin has the most roles in the film: a mud eater, Dennis the peasant who bothers Arthur and accuses of him of showing "the violence inherent in the system", another peasant who accuses a woman of being a witch, a head of the Giant, the Lord of Swamp Castle, the leader of the Knights who say "Ni!" and a priest who reads out the instructions of the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch. (Thomson Gale “The life of John. Cleese”)</p>
<p>Terry Gilliam plays himself as the animator who dies of a heart attack. He also played Patsy, Arthur's servant, who bangs coconuts together and calls Camelot "only a model". He also played the Green Knight who dies fighting the Black Knight, the Old Man from Scene 24 that pops up again as the Bridge keeper, Sir Bors (who cries out during the Camelot song "I have to push the pram a lot!") and is a gorilla hand turning pages of a book during the narration. (world Book Online refrence section page 3 “the holy grail.”)</p>
<p>Connie Booth as the woman accused of being a witch. (Thomson Gale “Monty Python’s the flying circus“.) On June 15, 2001, Monty Python and the Holy Grail was re-released on four North American screens. This version of the film was digitally restored and re mastered with a new stereo soundtrack. In addition, it restored 24 seconds of material to the Castle Anthrax scene that was not originally in the theatrical release (although had appeared on several video and DVD editions of the film).</p>
<p>In its opening weekend, it grossed a strong US$45,487 It played in limited release until December 2003, playing at 26 screens at its widest point and eventually grossing 2 million. USD during its re-release run. This version of the film still plays periodically at North American rep theatres</p>
<p>King Arthur is recruiting his Knights of the Round Table throughout England. Frustrated by anarchy peasants and his battle with the Black Knight, he meets up Sir Bedevere the Wise at an alleged witch's trial.</p>
<pre>
So Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Galahad called both the Chaste and the Pure, Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-As-Sir-Lancelot, and Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Film form together the Knights of the Round Table. After a  dance, the knights decide Camelot is a "far too silly" abode, and are told by an animated version of God  to find the Holy Grail. 
</pre>
<p>In the course of their travels, they encounter insulting Frenchmen in the castle. They try to gain entry by using a Trojan Rabbit, but forget to get inside it. The French immediately catapult it over the wall anyways. Forced to retreat, they kill a famous historian from the 1970s.</p>
<p>Splitting up, Sir Robin encounters a Three-Headed Giant, to which his minstrels sing songs of his cowardice. Galahad runs across the dangers of Castle Anthrax, which turn out to be occupied by nubile females between the ages of 16 and 19½ who crave to be spanked.</p>
<pre>
Sir Lancelot massacres the wedding at Swamp Castle between the Lord's gay son, Herbert, and Princess Lucky. Arthur and Bedevere encounter the dreaded Knights who say Ni (later known as the Knights Who Say "Ecky-Ecky-Ecky-Ecky-Pakang-Zoom-Ping! Goodem-zoo-owli-zhiv"), and after delivering them a shrubbery, discovers their weakness of the word "it". They meet up with the other knights and get stuck over winter eating Robin‘s singers.
</pre>
<p>They meet a enchanter called "Tim", who takes them to a cave, where they defeat the killer rabbit by means of the holy hand grenade. Hearing the explosion, the 1970s police come closer. Going into the Cave of Caerbannog .They are a chased by a gigantic cartoon monster, the Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh, and are saved when animator Terry Gilliam suffers a fatal heart attack.</p>
<p>They encounter the Bridge of Death, guarded by "the old man from Scene 24". Lancelot is successful in answering the question of his favorite color, which is blue. Robin is thrown over the bridge for not knowing the capital of Assyria, and Galahad mistakenly answers his favorite color as blue when it is yellow. Arthur and Bedivere trick the old man into not knowing what type of swallow he has inquired into regarding its speed velocity. On the other side, Lancelot has disappeared, because he has been arrested by the police, and they take a ship to the Castle Aaargh. They again encounter the taunting Frenchmen who throw a dead sheep and dung on them. The film ends when a group of police from the 1970s interrupt the climactic battle scene to arrest Bedivere and King Arthur for the murder of the " historian".(Thomson Gale “Monty Python’s the flying circus“.)</p>

<p>Johnson's "Swing Around the Circle" refers to a speaking campaign of President Andrew Johnson in which he tried to gain support of his mild Reconstruction policies. It was referred to as such due to the route that the campaign took: "Washington, D.C., to New York, west to Chicago, south to St. Louis, and east through the Ohio River valley back to the nation’s capital". The campiagn was a failure and Johnson lost more support than he gained as a result.<br /></p>
<p>One of Johnson's stops brought him to the Seward House during the summer of 1866.<br /></p>
<p>It is speculated that the president gave his speeches while drunk.<br /></p>

<p>Dilshad Mariwani, born on 28 March 1947, was abducted (in 1988) by the former ruling Baath Party in Iraq, tortured and murdered on the instructions of Jaffar Barzenji in Sulaimania on 13th of March 1989. Marwani left his widow and three daughters behind, Siva, Roza and Lona. Mariwani's body was never given back to his family. After the uprising when tons of papers captured in Iraqi regime's torture institutions, a piece of paper found revealing the “crimes” of Mariwani. It was stated that, as a teacher, he taught his students writing the Kurdish language in Latin scripts. For this he was executed with two bullets in his head.</p>
<p>Mariwani wrote a number of books, including poetry collections, in Kurdish and numerous articles in both Kurdish and Arabic language.</p>
