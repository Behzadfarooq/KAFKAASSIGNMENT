<p>The Single Index Model (SIM)is an asset pricing model commonly used in the finance industry to measure risk and return of a stock. Mathematically the SIM is expressed as:</p>
<p><span class="texhtml">(<i>r</i><i>i</i><i>t</i> − <i>r</i><i>f</i>) = <i>a</i><i>i</i> + <i>B</i><i>i</i>(<i>r</i><i>m</i><i>t</i> − <i>r</i><i>f</i>) + <i>E</i><i>i</i><i>t</i></span></p>
<p>Where: <span class="texhtml"><i>r</i><i>i</i><i>t</i> − <i>r</i><i>f</i></span> is the return on the stock <span class="texhtml"><i>a</i><i>i</i></span> is the company's alpha <span class="texhtml"><i>B</i><i>i</i></span> is the company's beta <span class="texhtml"><i>r</i><i>m</i><i>t</i> − <i>r</i><i>f</i></span> is the return on the market index <span class="texhtml"><i>E</i><i>i</i><i>t</i></span> is the residual return</p>
<p>The accuracy of the model is enhanced by the stock return's influence by market (beta) and firm-specific risk factors (alpha), unexpected returns (residual) and the relation to the performance of a market index (such as the All Ordinaries). Security analysts often use the SIM for such functions as computing stock betas, evaluating stock selection skills, and conducting event studies.</p>

<p>DaWayne Samuel better known as rapper/ business man John Wayne was born on January 16, 1981. John Wayne grew up on the north east side; one of the worst parts of Houston. He grew up in C.E. King were he quickly adapted to street life. John Wayne’s father left his mother with 3 kids, John Wayne being the youngest at 7years old. Coming from a back ground which seems to be the norm for black males; having no father, barely getting by, and a criminal surrounding caused him to grow up faster than the average 7 year old. At only 8 John Wayne was smoking, drinking and hanging out with local drug dealers. This how he begin to love hip hop music constantly listening to artist such as N.W.A., MC Breed, Spice 1, Street Military, Scarface, Ghetto Boys E.S.G., UGK, 8 Ball &amp; MJG….etc the list goes on and on. He even rapped to a Rap-a-lot Representative at 9 years old. He felt that was away to express how young black males was feeling and going through at that time. John Wayne’s mother noticed there environment and moved to the North side of Houston where he landed on Ella Blvd less than a half a mile away from Greens Point.</p>
<p>John Wayne has been on Ella Blvd. since he was 12 years old. He started working on his first Demo at 19 years old. That’s when he decided music was going to be his career. When his Demo was completed he realized Def Jam, Universal, Priority, and many other major record labels was not down the street. He quickly came to realize his career would not be an overnight success. He started to get more involved with the business side of music. At 22 he formed NRL (National Rap League) Records. He completed his First Underground in 2003 titled Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death, and he pressed, designed, and sold all 2,000 copies single handedly. This is how he meets 97.9 the box DJ Walter D. Walter D has a radio show called straight from the streets, and he played John Wayne’s Just Average on the air waves. John Wayne also was featured on local rap TV show Street flava Hosted by D Solo. Though his underground did ok for it to never see a store, it wasn’t enough, but unlike most rappers John Wayne didn’t wait for success, he started his own NRL marketing firm and in one year he cleared more then most college grads do there first year out of college, and with the money he earned he formed the Ella Mean Boyz. John Wayne hand picked the Ella Mean Boyz himself, which consisted of John Wayne, S.E.D., Young Pro, Bat, and Jay Gray. Once again pressing, and designing the mix tape himself; John Wayne and the Ella Mean boyz pushed well over 10,000 copies of Ella Mean Boyz Vol. 1 and 1.5. This gave him the buzz he needed. DJ S &amp; S, one of the biggest DJ’s from New York even cosigned John Wayne’s talent, and he showed how much he believed he will be the next best thing is Hip Hop by wearing his Ella Mean Boyz t-shirt on BET’s Rap City. This is how he meets Remogunz the CEO of Inner Circle Productions; who is now producing his first solo debut, which will be released under NRL Records. It has also been said by many he is one of the best lyricists to come out of Houston in a long time, and soon in the industry. That may be very true because he has a few majors looking his way.</p>
<p>Labeling John Wayne a Southern rapper would due hip hop a great injustice because his lyrical skills have not been match in Houston, TX underground scene. While most people would talk about John Wayne’s ability to make hits, his work ethic has not been matched. John Wayne knows he will have a place in history; not only as an artist but as a powerful business man. When asked about his first performance at the young age of 18 he had this to say “I’ am Hip Hop”. Working with a well rounded group of producers, Remogunz and The Inner Circle John Wayne will take the music industry by storm with his highly anticipated album “HIP HOP RETURNS”.</p>

<p>Kmskbhat 12:25, 11 September 2006 (UTC) Around 500 years back Royal family of Ballals use to live in a beautiful region of Kuntikana (Kuntal-a type of plant, Kana-Forrest) in a place called Manjakottage.Region is a Fertile plateau surrounded by a river Varada, paddy fields, coconut, areca nut and banana plantations with full of green and eye-catching hills and mountains with a excellent landscape. Around 500 yearsBallals of Manjakottage were suffering from various problems like disease, death and administration related troubles due to witchcraft and enemies. They were searching for a person who is capable of helping them to defend against these problems. They found one good-natured young priest Mr.ShankaraNarayana Sharma, Kumbhakonam (madras region) educated, living in place called Ananthashayana .Mr.ShankaranaNarayana was worshiping Sri Annapoorneshwari, and he is an expert in the fields of Veda, Shastras, mantras and tantrums. He helped Royal family of Ballals in sorting out their problems. Royal family was so happy and they handed over huge gifts and land .They requested him to settle in Kuntikanamata with his family.Mr Shankaranayana Sharma along with his Brother Mr Gangadhara Sharma settled in Kuntikanamata.They use to teach Veda and mantras to local people. With the motivation from godly affairs (daiva prerana) Mr.Shankaranarayana Sharma went to Kolyur Sri Shankara Narayana temple and performed a penance (tapasya).Lord Sri Shankara Narayana was pleased with the penance and he agreed to come and settle in Kuntikanamata.Later Mr Shankaranarayan Sharma built a temple and placed idol and invited god. After some time when Royal family was departing from Manjakottage they handed over all those Daivas (God) they were worshiping with the custody of Mr Shankaranarayana to continue worshiping. This is how In kuntikanamata temple Lord Shankaranarayana,SriAnnapoorneshwari,Poomani,Kinnimani,Dhoomavathi,Raktheshwari being worshiped and is very famous religious place.</p>
<p>Even today Kuntikanamata Family is living near to the temple in Taravadu (House of origin of a family) and looking after the developments with the help of Gramastharu (Villagers).Family members are living all over the world but still keeps coming to temple and helping in religious and developmental activities.

Sri Jagadguru Sri Shankaracharya of Sri Ramachandrapuramata whenever use to visit Kumble seeme will stay in Kuntikanamata which was a practise since centuries. Now the Present Sri Jagadguru Shankaracharya Sri Raghaveshwar Bharathi Swamiji is directing the temple developments. It is really an achievement of Good-hearted, Determined person the founder Mr Shankaranarayana Sharma to see his family and whole village is still continuing to worship in Kuntikanamata even after 500 years. It is all possible due to blessings from all the gods being worshipped in Kuntikanamata, blessings from our Guru which is really a protection.</p>

<p>Fumio Manaka, now Unsui-sensei to those in his organization the Jinenkan, was once the leading practitioner of the Bujinkan Dojo.</p>
<p>He began his studies of Budo when he was a teenager in mandatory Judo classes. It was through this he was introduced to Soke Masaaki Hatsumi who he was told was a ninja master. He went to Soke's home everyday for training, though for a year he was thrown around the dojo repeatedly. Finally as many of the other students drifted away he was the only one left and was eventually joined by many others who now train with Soke still.</p>
<p>In 1996 Manaka-sensei decided to leave the Bujinkan and start his own organization teaching his own interpretation of the Takamatsuden arts. Thus the Jinenkan was formed.</p>

<p>Boxie is a game that is similar to tug-of-war. However, there are a few differences. Boxie is played between two players, each standing on a box 4.5 inches tall and 18 by 18 inches wide. The players stand on the box positioned 8 feet apart from one another. Each player grabs ahold of the end of the rope that is 20 feet long. As soon as one of the players says go, each player grabs as much rope as possible. Then the players tug and release the rope until one player falls off of the box or loses their grip of the rope. The current boxie champion of the world is John.</p>
<p>The astonshing boxie game has a long and rich history. It all began back in the pioneer days. The game is still played by enthusiasts across the country.</p>
<p>The Variations of The Astonishing Boxie Game: Lasso - When a player loses and is a poor sport about it they then take the rope and attempt to lasso their opponent. Tie 'em to a pole - When a player loses the Astonishing Boxie Championship they then might take the rope and tie their opponent to a pole. This is only done by real losers.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-09-14_12e8.html" title="Edit section: Bulgarian hiphop scene">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bulgarian hiphop scene</span></h2>
<p>Bulgarian hip hop has been in effect for almost 20 years, primarily beginning after the fall of communism. B-boying came on the scene first taking Bulgaria by storm and continues to play a major influence in the hiphop landscape. Rap was next in line as Avi MC dropped the first Bulgarian hip hop record, Problemi i Ekologia (Problems and Ecology) in 1989. This was followed up by the group Rap Nacia who delivered the first full album, Ocelyavat Samo Silnite (Only the Strong Survive), in 1992. Graffiti soon followed as the bombing of trains, streets and legal walls commenced, leaving DJing as the least developed element due to the high cost of vinyl and turntables.</p>
<p>Over the years, the breakers developed their own community throwing jams for all the b-boys to travel to somewhere in the country every month. However, they still maintain ties to the other elements as they still invite rappers and writers to perform. Some of the best crews include the internationally known Electric Force, who also organize the biggest Bulgarian b-boy jam called B-Boys Breakdown, Diablo Crew, Soul Award, Eazy Snatch, Express Our Soul, and Sleep Walking among others.</p>
<p>Today, illegal mp3s and rampant downloading has made it difficult to participate in the Bulgarian music business. However, despite this problem Bulgaria’s scene continues to grow and gain acceptance into the mainstream. In 2005, Music Mania (MM), the biggest Bulgarian music TV network, recognized DRS (Dope Reach Squad) as they won the station’s “People’s Choice Award.” Misho Shamara (a.k.a. Misho the Slap), owner of one of the more famous labels in the country (R ‘n’ B Records) is also planning a hip hop TV show to promote Bulgarian hip hop. There’s also a growing pool of underground including artists from the two big labels from Plovdiv - Udarnata Grupa (Hit Squad) and Sunrise Project, and mainstays like DRS, X-Team, Spens, Horata Ot Getoto (People From the Ghetto).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-09-14_12e8.html" title="Edit section: Ande Parks">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ande Parks</span></h2>
<p>Ande Parks (born 0ctober 1, 1964) is a professional American comic book artist, known for his work as an inker and writer in the industry. His greatest notoriety has come from his stint with fellow artist Phil Hester on DC Comics’ Green Arrow series from 2001-2004 and writing the graphic novels Union Station and Capote in Kansas. He grew up in the suburbs of Kansas City and currently lives in Baldwin, Kansas with his wife and two children.</p>
<p>Parks began his professional career as an inker in comic books with Dark Horse Comics. He has worked at inking the penciled artwork of such titles as Wonder Woman, Catwoman, Superman, Daredevil, and Spider-Man. His artistic style has won him praise in the comic books industry, including an industry Harvey nomination as best inker. His idols and influences include Neal Adams, Klaus Janson, Jack Kirby, Dick Giordano, and Mike Grell. For characters from the comic books, Parks has stated he has most enjoyed Batman and Captain America as his favorite characters.</p>
<p>He is probably best known for his work on the relaunched Green Arrow comic book series beginning in 2001, which he inked over his frequent collaborator Phil Hester. On Green Arrow, Hester and Parks worked with writers Kevin Smith, Brad Meltzer, and Judd Winick over their approximate 40-issue run. The book has been collected into several volumes. The American Library Association called it one of the best books for young adults. Parks and Hester have also done work on DC Comics’ Nightwing with writer Devin Grayson, allowing Parks to work within the Batman family of characters, and both are currently working on a new project for Marvel Comics involving the super-hero Ant-Man.</p>
<p>Although better known for his artwork, Parks considers himself to be more of a writer than artist. He has contributed several articles in comic book trade magazines, such as Draw!, geared towards critiques of artwork and professional tips for inkers. Parks' combined his inking style with his fondness for writing when he created the superhero spoof Uncle Slam &amp; Fire Dog for Action Planet Comics, based largely on his love of Marvel Comics’ Captain America. Uncle Slam appeared in three issues of the Action Planet anthology book series, and in two issues of his own book in the early- to mid-1990’s. The character also appeared in a completely on-line comic book for Komicwerks.</p>
<p>For graphic novels, he has often turned to his neighboring region in the Midwest as source material for his writing projects. To date Parks has steered towards writing that is best classified as historical fiction. He has credited Alan Moore’s <i>From Hell</i> as being a large influence in his decision to pursue writing in the historical fiction genre. In 2004, Oni Press published Park's first original graphic novel, <i>Union Station</i>. The book dealt with the events surrounding Kansas City's Union Station massacre, which took place in 1933 in Kansas City, Missouri, and helped J. Edgar Hoover make the F.B.I. a powerful organization in law enforcement and government for decades to come. Eduardo Barreto provided the artwork, done in black-&amp;-white to give the piece more of a Depression-era period look.</p>
<p>In 2005 Parks returned to the genre of historical fiction with <i>Capote In Kansas</i>, drawn by Chris Samnee. The book details the time Truman Capote spent in Kansas while he worked on his literary masterpiece, <i>In Cold Blood</i>. He is currently developing his next writing projects, geared towards non-historical fiction.</p>

<p>Marlo Morgan is the author of the metaphysical classic "Mutant Message Down Under." Published in 1994, the book recounts the spiritual awakening that occured to her during a "walkabout" she undertook with a group of Aboriginal Australians. During their travels, the Aboriginies, (or Real People, as they prefer,) taught this strange white woman (or Mutant,) how to not only survive while on foot in the outback, but to treat each and every thing as part of a whole, including one's own self. Their seemingly primitive way of life lends to them powers unheard of in Western society, including telepathy, water finding skills, communication with animals and plants, vanishing into thin air (or seeming to), and making one person seem like ten, or a hundred.</p>

<p>The Helderberg Escarpment, located in the center of Albany County, New York, is the county’s signature landform. The most dramatic part of the Escarpment, with relief of over a thousand feet, stretches for about ten miles from Knox and Altamont to southern New Scotland, Westerlo and Coeymans. The view from the cliff top encompasses the Mohawk lowlands, the southern Adirondacks and the western mountain ranges of Vermont and Massachusetts. John Boyd Thacher State Park, established in 1914 on the edge of the Escarpment, draws over 250,000 visitors annually to admire the striking scenery from the cliff edge. Exposed layers of sedimentary rock contain a rich array of Devonian fossils that have made the Escarpment an important scientific and cultural resource.</p>

<p>Girl All The Bad Guys Want is a single by the comedic punk band Bowling For Soup, released around 2002. It talks about the protagonist, a guy who tries to be punk to impress the elusive Nona, a "rocker with a nose ring". Nona likes Godsmack and the protagonist likes Agent Orange. "Her CD changer's full of singers that are mad at their dads". She watches wrestling, beats on all the tough guys and listens to rap metal. Much to the protagonist's dismay, he has no "season pass", only tries to be a tough guy, and "all he got's a moped". Apparently, though, Nona still likes him, according to the line "8:00 Monday night and I'm waiting/to finally talk to a girl a little cooler than me". All these qualities make Nona the Girl All the Bad Guys Want.</p>

<p>B-RAD, aka Bradley Carson aka Im Never Wrong aka Amdoc's Slave, has the honor of being able to call himself the father of the Infamous Ronald. Hence the nickname, B-RAD has the amazing ability to only speak fact, never being incorrect in any judgment, opinion, or viewpoint he has. Many have challenged B-RAD on these grounds, but none have been able to find falsehood in any of his words (this may be because the more you challenge him, the angrier he gets, resulting in a more persuading arguement).</p>

<p>Inskip &amp; Jenkins Architects is a London based architectural practise set up in 1972 by Peter Inskip and Peter Jenkins.</p>
<p>The practice is organized in two divisions: one concerned with new buildings under Peter Jenkins and the other concerned with historic buildings and Scheduled Ancient Monument Conservation under Peter Inskip. The later is acknowledged for its work within the heritage environment following the restoration of the Albert Memorial and other properties for English Heritage and The National Trust. Their directors also lectures on philosophy and methodology of conservation, and have served on the historic buildings advisory committees of the National trust, English Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund.</p>
<p>The practise was also short listed for the Stirling prize on 1998 for the restoration of the Temple of Concord &amp; Victory, at Stowe Gardens.</p>

<p>Kinetic Degradation Fluxion (KDF) is a high-purity copper-zinc formulation that uses a basic chemical process known as redox (oxidation/reduction) to remove chlorine, lead, mercury, iron, and hydrogen sulfide from water supplies. The process also has a mild anti-bacterial, algaecitic, and fungicitic, effect and may reduce the accumulation of lime scale.</p>

<p><i>Din of Celestial Birds</i> is a short film created by Q6, an evolving collective of philosophers and artists. The film begins with the phrase "hello and welcome ... do not be afraid ... be comforted ... remember ... our origin..." and proceeds to depict the first violent formation of matter from nothingness. Then, after a hyper-accelerated trip through the evolution of life, the film culminates in the birth of an embryonic pseudo-humanoid being reaching towards the heavens.</p>
<p><br />
Q6 is currently composed of director E. Elias Merhige (<i>Begotten</i>, <i>Shadow of the Vampire</i>, and <i>Suspect Zero</i>), video artist David Wexler (<i>Phoenix Rising</i>, <i>Holographic Landscapes</i>, founder of www.nuopsys.com), musician and composer Ben Gillespie, visual philosopher Leigh J. McCloskey, visual artist and sculptor Ariana Tosatto, and psychophysicist Dr. Miguel P. Eckstein.</p>
<p><br />
Merhige approached McCloskey and Wexler, who had been collaborating on video projects for years, to help bring his initial concept to life on a very limited budget. He had recieved funding and distribution after he had been called upon by Turner Classic Movies to be one of six directors to produce short films for their Behind the Camera&#160;: the Shorts Circuit (a collection of classic shorts from directors like Kubrick, Truffaut, and Hitchcock, coupled with shorts from new directors like Merhige, Mario Van Peebles, and Peter Gilbert, that would be premiered on Turner Classic Movies, September 15th, 2006).</p>
<p><br />
Din of Celestial Birds was edited and assembled entirely on two Apple Laptops on Final Cut Pro and Apple's Motion software. Using footage shot by Merhige and Wexler on every concievable format, including 16mm, Super 8, and HDV, the film was created with a myriad of techniques from early cinema all the way up to modern day digital compositing and 3d effects. The sum of Gillespie and Wexlers' work was accomplished in Wexler's home studio over the course of just three months.</p>

<p>•video artist David Wexler is the son of sound mixer Jeff Wexler (<i>Bound for Glory</i>, <i>The Last Samurai</i>, '<i>Almost Famous</i>), and the grandson of cinematographer Haskell Wexler (<i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?</i>, <i>One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest,</i> <i>In the Heat of the Night</i>).</p>
<p>•with the exception of a few chords, Gillespie sung all the vocal parts.</p>
<p>•Tosatto is primarily a painter, not a sculptor. However, for the film, she managed to apply her creativity in the field of sculpting, model-making, and physical effects.</p>
<p>•Merhige considers the <i>Din of Celestial Birds</i> a prequel to his cult hit <i>Begotten</i>.</p>

<p><b>TETSUO</b></p>
<p>Tetsuo is a mysterious experimental rock act rumoured to feature former Roxy Music and solo singer Bryan Ferry. They have released two CDs so far – the “David Keenan Is My Dick” CD (a clear tribute to Japanese noise act The Gerogerigegege) and a split CD with Glasgow noise artist Kylie Minoise. Whether or not Ferry takes part in these recordings is a mystery, the main brunt of the sound being drums, guitar feedback and screaming. Tetsuo are also said to be behind the record label At War With False Noise, and are rumoured to invest all profits from said venture into starving the third world, giving parcels of food to poor racists, and sending money via Paypal to people in exchange for bizarre sexual favours.</p>

<p>When speaking of English as a world language, we are dealing with a widespread phenomenon: “English as a common language” means English used to communicate all over the world. Actually, it is namely spoken in the UK, the USA &amp; 103 other countries. English is the second most popular “first language” (native speakers), with around 402 million people in 2002 also it is the most widely used “second language” &amp; “learning language” in the world, &amp; as such, many linguists believe, it is no longer the exclusive cultural emblem of native English speakers, but rather a language that is absorbing aspects of cultures worldwide as it grows in use. As the 21st century begins, faster economic globalization is going hand in hand with the growing use of English. More and more people are being encouraged to use or send messages in English rather than in their own language. Many do not mind. They see this as part of the unavoidable trend towards worldwide uniformity and a means whereby a growing number of people can communicate directly with each other. From this point of view, the spread of English may be seen as a positive development which saves resources and makes cultural exchange easier. After all, it might be said, the advance of English is not aimed at killing off local languages but is simply a means of reaching a wider audience. British or American, the language is basically the same, and its global stature is backed up by massive English-language training programmes, an international business that in textbooks, language courses, tape cassettes, video programmes and computerized instruction — is worth hundreds of millions of pounds or dollars to the economies of the US and the UK. The English language is now one of Britain’s most reliable exports. In the ironic words of the novelist Malcolm Bradbury, it is an ideal British product, ‘needing no workers and no work, no assembly lines and no assembly, no spare parts and very little servicing, it is used for the most intimate and the most public services everywhere. We call it the English language ...‘Dr Robert Burchfield, former Chief Editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, has remarked that ‘any literate, educated person on the face of the globe is deprived if he does not know English’.</p>

<p>"In the late 1970s and the 1980s the CIA spent over $4 billion on a program called “Operation Cyclone.” This was our contribution to setting up training schools in Pakistan and elsewhere, including the U.S. itself, to teach “sabotage skills.” The purpose was to use these individuals in fighting our enemies in the Middle East, including the Soviets. ... It is estimated that over 12,000 fighters were trained in the camps we set up in Afghanistan. They were taught how to make bombs, carry out sabotage, and use guerilla war tactics...."</p>

<p>This clock is normally a quartz crystal that vibrates at a set speed.</p>
<p>Each vibration is called a clock pulse or clock cycle.</p>
<p>These pulses are the signals that allow data (i.e. data, instructions, signals) to move around the motherboard at a set speed. In this way the system clock regulates the speed of all activity on the motherboard.</p>
<p>The speed of the system clock is measured in Megahertz (MHz). 1 MHz means 1 million vibrations or clock pulses per second. 75 MHz means 75 million vibrations per second!</p>
<p>Currently most system clocks run at either 100 or 133 MHz.</p>

<p>Patrick Hudson was a brave man who once risked his life to save 50 plus members of a burning apartment. When firefighters deemed it impossible to get into the building, Patrick risked his life and stormed into the building. He searched the apartment for survivors and pulled them out, often 3 or more at a time. When everyone was safe Patrick knew his job was done. For this brave deed and bowling a perfect 300 he was honored with a metal and a key to the city.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-09-14_12e8.html" title="Edit section: Ramon Vilanova - The Ultimate Landscape Painter">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ramon Vilanova - The Ultimate Landscape Painter</span></h2>
<p>70.111.164.13 16:47, 12 September 2006 (UTC) Acclaimed by art critics and represented in prominent and distinguished collections throughout Europe, Ramon Vilanova is one of the great landscape painters living in Europe. His works have brought him more than 30 1st place prizes in major competitions and his work is in the permanent collection of many museums, a further testament to the credibility and importance of this extraordinary artist. Vilanova works exclusively "plein-air", at that time and place, giving his compositions a special sensitivity, an emotional experience of the scene he has chosen to commit to canvas. He needs fully to experience the environment in order to paint, not just view the scene... He must smell the flowers.., He must be caressed by the breezes… He must experience the light streaming and filtering through the foliage and against the backgrounds. The overall feel is critical to his ability to create his paintings. A photograph or remembrance will not suffice; only real life can fulfill the need. You notice weeds and errant branches and leaves in his paintings, because he paints only what he sees. Nature, like life, is imperfect and Ramon, in his work, shows us all of nature, not only perfect beauty. And yet this uncorrected beauty is captured perfectly, as the paintings are perfect in their representation of the scene as the artist has felt them that day, in that moment. Ramon was born and raised near Barcelona, Spain. He continues to live and to create in these idyllic surroundings in rural Catalonia to the north. His love of the landscape is deep and he senses instinctively how to capture its beauty, as he is thoroughly a part of it. His technique is at once complex and unusual, yet necessary, so that he can infuse the paintings with the sense of what he wishes to convey. He stains his canvases by generously spreading oil paints on with a spatula. Then, still using the spatula, he models and organizes the oils into his representation of the landscape before him. Occasionally, he will further utilize a "dripping and splattering" technique analogous and reminiscent of the works of abstract expressionism. Vilanova's drippings are more contained, but appear in the canvas as an integrating element. All of the artist's creations are complex and symphonic in nature. The artist has a remarkable, intuitive understanding of color. Several prominent European art critics have described Ramon as a "colorist" as his works contain a palette that by its subject matter demands the nuance and surprise of color so that we may properly interpret his sense of immediacy. Vilanova is an instinctive painter with need to paint, in tune with his environment, he is acutely aware of the tonalities and half tones that light creates with color. The world of landscape is what intrigues him... a farmhouse in a field, an island offshore, an urn overflowing with flowers in a private garden, a field of brilliant wildflowers, an errant weed. Vilanova is a self-taught artist, who, though new to the U.S. art market, has been exhibiting in Europe with great success since the early 1970s. He has continued to refine and further define his craft and interpretation to where he really has no contemporary peer in the visual and emotional interpretation of landscapes and seascapes. A book of his works entitled “Latidos” was published earlier this year.</p>

Mouse and Kelley also worked together from <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> as lead artists of Mouse Studios and the Monster Company, which produced album cover art and <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_music.html" title="Rock music">rock music</a> memorabilia respectively. Since <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> Mouse has been a painter working in the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Fe_dbaf.html" title="Santa Fe">Santa Fe, New Mexico</a> area.</p>
<p><br />
Born Stanley Miller in <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fresno%2C_California_418c.html" title="Fresno, California">Fresno, California</a> in 1940, he grew up in <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit%2C_Michigan_ae78.html" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit, Michigan</a> where he was given the nickname "Mouse" in high school. Expelled from school for <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandalism.html" title="Vandalism">vandalism</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> (he mischeviously repainted the facade of a popular teen hangout) "Stanley Mouse" completed his formal education at the Art School of the Society of Arts and Crafts in Detroit.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a> Mouse became fascinated by the "Weirdo <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Rod_2945.html" title="Hot Rod">Hot Rod</a> Art" movement that had begun in California a decade before. Having developed skills using an <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbrush.html" title="Airbrush">airbrush</a> he began producing art t-shirts at <a href="../../../c/u/s/Custom_car.html" title="Custom car">custom car</a> shows. There he met and worked with <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Roth_d719.html" title="Ed Roth">Ed "Big Daddy" Roth</a>. Mouse was also particularly influenced by the art of Rick Griffin, with whom he would later collaborate on posters and album covers. In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a> Mouse and his family founded Mouse Studios, a <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mail-order.html" title="Mail-order">mail-order</a> company, which sold his products.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a> Mouse travelled to <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> with a group of art school friends. Settling initially in <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland.html" title="Oakland">Oakland</a>, Mouse met Alton Kelley. The following year the pair began working together to produce posters for The Family Dog, a group that promoted <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_music.html" title="Rock music">rock music</a> dances at the Avalon Ballroom. Later the pair also produced posters for promoter <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Graham_%28promoter%29_4953.html" title="Bill Graham (promoter)">Bill Graham</a> and for events in the psychedelic community.</p>
<p>The psychedelic posters Mouse and Kelley produced were heavily influenced by <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Nouveau_8edb.html" title="Art Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> graphics, particularly the work of <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alphonse_Mucha_ff9c.html" title="Alphonse Mucha">Alphonse Mucha</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> Family Dog promoter <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chet_Helms_e2f4.html" title="Chet Helms">Chet Helms</a> and Graham began turning to other artists for their poster work, and Mouse's career languished. After brief periods in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachussetts.html" title="Massachussetts">Massachussetts</a>, and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, Mouse returned to California to live in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marin_County_e01c.html" title="Marin County">Marin County</a> near Kelley. The pair resumed their partnership in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>, producing commercial artwork related to the Grateful Dead. The pair are credited with creating the skeleton and roses image that became the band's archetypal iconography. Mouse and Kelley continued to work together until <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>.</p>
<p>Mouse continued to produce album cover art and other music-related graphics through the 1980's.

<p>"Self-Defense For Modern Times" is an introduction to the realistic self-defense system of Wing Tsun Kung Fu. Wing Tsun (or Wing Chun) Kung Fu deals with the much neglected type of combat that occurs everywhere, thousands of times each year. It usually ends with many serious injuries. In this form of close combat, the typical martial artist almost always comes off second-best against the unscrupulous street thug. Weigel explains what makes the Wing Tsun system different and why more and more people rely on the skills and techniques from Wing Tsun.</p>
<p>Wing Tsun Kung Fu uses a highly sophisticated approach to close combat and realistic self-defense that is based on physics and body mechanics. Only this approach allows a "physically weaker" person to defend a much stronger and taller opponent.</p>

<p>David Jose Frias (born May 10, 1986)is a Filmmaker who became a published author of the book Estoline: The World and Beyond at the age of 17.</p>
<p>Frias' body of work and films are based around hard times and situations that everyday lower middle-class society goes through. He has received numerous business awards throughout his career. David is considered one of the most significant and influential filmmaker amongst friends and family. He is striving to become a successful Producer through making his own films and working on other production houses 35mm films.</p>
<p>David J. Frias was born in Harlem, New York, USA raised in Brooklyn, New York, USA and came from a working class Dominican-American family; his father, Jose Richiez, and mother, Zoila Frias, both worked in New York factories and low end jobs. A motivated child, he spent much of his time writing at home and working on various ideas. The stage in his life in which he developed his passion for cinema was after high school and realizing he enjoyed painting a picture for his writings. His initial desire to become a writer was forsaken for cinema; his creativity and menality for writing never was really traded for Full Sail Academy, where he received his B.A. in Film and Entertainment Business in 2006 it was only enhanced and adapted to screenplay writting.</p>

<p>Wage is part of the ugly doll collection. Wage is a hard worker, just like you! He works at the local Super Mart and wears his apron to serve his customers best. Does Super Mart know that Wage works there? Nope. But Wage doesn't mind. He likes to put things in bags, especially snacks. Wage is best friends with Babo, but there is always room for one more (you). The two of them can often be found on the sidewalk trying to make friends with fire hydrants, phone booths, and other lonely creatures. Wage hates for anyone to be lonely! What's with that look? Is Wage happy? Sure he is! He smiles on the inside. The next time you go grocery shopping remember to take Wage along on your adventures.</p>

<b>Web Influence Zone (WIZ):</b> A <i>web influence zone</i> or <i>WIZ</i> is a basic measurement of an individual’s or organization’s presence on the World Wide Web. A simple way to obtain a <i>WIZ rating</i> on an organization or a particular individual is to insert there name into a Web search engine and see how many organic, or non-sponsored, results show up. Therefore, the more organic results, the greater that organization’s or person’s web influence zone.</p>
<p>Though many use the term <i>web influence zone</i> each day, its origin actually traces back to two young copywriters, Hayden Bond and Anthony Cohn. These two journalists coined the term during an impromptu brain storming session in 2005. While generating ideas to help explain the phenomenon of a person’s or organization’s presence on the World Wide Web (WWW), Cohn began to recall an old electronics store commercial with the tag line “Nobody Beats the WIZ!” He then decided to yell out that particular tag line during the brain storming session for no apparent reason. Cohn’s random utterance sparked Bond’s creativity and he then shouted out the following: “W.I.Z., Web Influence Zone!” Thus, the term <i>web influence zone</i> or <i>WIZ</i> was coined by Bond and Cohn to mean the following:</p>

<p>From the Roman times till the Belgian independence</p>
<p>Following the conquest of Gaul (from 57 B.C till 52 A.D), Rome re-organised the new territories. Northern Gaul became the province BELGICA with Reims (F) as it’s capital city. This province was further divided into ‘civitates’. The area that would later become Luttre belonged to civitas Tungrorum with Tongeren (B) as the capital city, and was near civitas Nerviorum with Tournai (B) as capital.</p>
<p>The new rulers quickly developed a good road infrastructure (partly based on existing links). A ‘service station’ (roman baths, taverns, stables….) has been discovered by archaeologists at Liberchies (a village located 3 kms from Luttre) along the road “Bavai (F) – Tongeren (B) – Köln (D)”.</p>
<p>The first document mentioning the name of Luttre dates back to the end of the XIIIth century. It was an agreement between the seignior of Rêves (also seignior of Luttre) and the Monastery controlling the church of Celles (which would become Pont-à-Celles at the end of the XVIIIth century). The agreement was signed in 1289 and, from that time on, the priest of Celles would come thrice a week to hold services in a newly built chapel in Luttre.</p>
<p>It is generally agreed that the name of Luttre comes from an old German word “lutere” which means “pure, transparent, limpid water”.</p>
<p>Luttre was in the duchy of Brabant, extending from Nivelles (B) till St Hertogenbosch (NL) with Leuven (B) as the capital city. Luttre depended on Nivelles – duchy of Brabant – for administrative duties (taxes, justice) while the birth, marriage and death registers were kept by the priest of Celles which depended on Thuin (B), and thus to the principality of Liège (B). The church kept such registers at that time.</p>
<p>Luttre being a tax-free zone, the inhabitants were exempted from paying taxes on consumer goods. It also meant that people from the neighbouring villages were coming to Luttre for alcohol, wine or beer. We can also imagine a number of inns and pubs for travellers as the Roman highway was quite near.</p>
<p>The area suffered a lot because of continuous wars throughout the centuries. Nevertheless, a traveller in 1615 going from Tournai (B) to Liège (B) wrote about the crystal clear water of the “Piéton”, the stream crossing Luttre, and the beauty of the landscape (green hills, forests and surrounding prairies).</p>
<p>Because of the new ideas following the French revolution in 1789, the Austrian Emperor (who was governing present day Belgian territories) wanted to impose reforms. It was followed by a period of unrest that ended with the French invasion in 1794. The old regime (rights of the seigniors, the power of the monasteries, the church keeping official registers, …) was abolished.</p>
<p>A new system based on municipalities was established in 1795. The municipality of Pont-à-Celles was created from 6 former seigniories (including Luttre). At the same time, the invaded territories were divided in 9 departments. Some municipalities, including that of the new Pont-à-Celles, were withdrawn from Nivelles (which went to the Dyle department, which became the province of Brabant in 1815) and have become part of the Jemappes (named after a French victory in 1792) department.</p>
<p>After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, present day Belgian territories were united to those of the Netherlands. The Jemappes department became the province of Hainaut, which still exists today.</p>

<p>Sankofa is a 1993 idependent film directed, written and produced by Ethiopian film director Haile Gerima. A self-absorbed Black American fashion model on a photo shoot in Africa is spiritually transported back to a plantation in the West Indies where she experiences first-hand the physical and psychic horrors of chattel slavery, and eventually the redemptive power of community and rebellion as she becomes a member of a freedom-seeking Maroon colony.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Synopsis Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.</p>
<p>Sankofa begins in Africa, in Cape Coast Castle in Ghana, where there is an interplay between a tour group and a photo shoot of Mona, an African American model. In the middle of the shoot, a mysterious man appears, claiming to be the guardian of the castle, he tells the tour group to go away, and Mona to go back to her past. He claims that his people were stolen from Africa through this very location. Mona then wanders through the dungeon following the tour and finds Africans shackled in the dungeons of the castle. She tries to flea but is soon taken captive by people of European descent as she cries in vain that she is an American, not an African.</p>
<p>Thus, her story as Shola begins. These scenes take place in a sugarcane plantation in Louisiana. Shola is a house slave, who does her duties as a slave and does not partake in anything that she deems evil or wrong. She professes her love for Shango, a West Indian slave who tries to change her timid views. Next, a group is shown talking about Nunu, a woman who kills her master just by staring at him. (Click here to hear this story.) Shola, who during this story, recalls being raped by her master, wishes for these powers. The next scene includes a dramatic whipping, where two men, Joe and Noble Ali are depicted, respectively, as a half white headman slave who strives to adopt the white’s ways and a headman slave who appears to be having issues with his role and duties as a headman. Both partake in the whipping of other slaves. When Kutu, one of the slaves who is pregnant, dies after being whipped, Nunu comes and performs a Caesarian to save the child.</p>
<p>Talk of rebellion is soon introduced to the film. Apparently, certain slaves meet secretly with free blacks from the hills to discuss upcoming rebellions. After one unsuccessful rebellion, several slaves are left in cages suspended from trees to die and Nunu is sold. Slowly, Shola starts to learn the importance of resisting. This is primarily because she is repeatedly raped by one of the master even though she prays to the white man’s God. In fact she feels the more she prays to the white man's God the more she is raped. When she is beaten and whipped severely after an unsuccessful escape, she is consoled by Shango and given a Sankofa bird. This act, she claims, turns her into a rebel and she finally realizes the importance of resisting.</p>
<p>The story then shifts to Joe, who has been almost poisoned by another slave. Nunu, his mother, tries to save him, but instead he kills her because he has been convinced by Father Rafael, the priest, that Nunu is the devil. Joe brings his mother's corpse to the church where he finally realizes his betrayal of his people and his own mother, and then he kills Father Rafael. After this escapade, rebellion starts brewing again. This time, Shola kills her rapist, and the rebellion is successful in that many of the slaves realize the importance of resistance and several of the headmasters and slave holders are killed. However, all of the rebelling slaves are chased down by dogs and eventually caught and killed. Shola feels herself lifted up and carried by buzzards who bring her spirit home. The story shifts back to the present, where Shola, or Mona at this time, ignores the photographer and goes to listen to an African chant being performed by Sankofa, a chant which she now has an appreciation for due to her new awareness of her rich African background.</p>

<p>A low budget film short created in the noir style of the 1940's - 1950's. This piece was done as an homage to the great italian/french filmmakers that embraced that genre. While its surreal plot line lost some of its potential audience, its visual style is an excellent example of noir film. Jagged angles, harsh contrasts, and a femme fatal, are all present in this modern film classic.</p>

<p>74.12.56.119 22:57, 12 September 2006 (UTC) NecroJehovah is a death metal band from Whitby, Ontario. It is said to be spearheading the underground metal revival scene in the Durham Region. The band is known to be based on a classic metal sound comparable to bands like Slayer, Anthrax, and DRI but also incorporating influences from newer, and often extreme, metal from Children of Bodom to Pantera.</p>

<p>NecroJehovah found its roots in Matt Allman, Bryce Blackmore, and Mike Gibbs after they felt compelled to write "the most extreme songs ever written" on a rainy day in September, 2006. The band subsequently recorded an EP entitled HTAED! mostly inspired by boredom, but surprisingly groundbreaking. The songs Necrophisizisiac, Nail Crusher, and Pain were all performed impromptu, with only one run-through before recording the final take.</p>

<p>The Cat and the Coffee Drinkers is a short story about a kindergarten run by an older woman after the Great Depression. Miss Effie enstills in her pupils knowledge practical for this era: sweeping floors, buying groceries, basic housekeeping, handling of cats, etc. The most controversial part of this story is when Miss Effie's cat takes a turn for the worse when he is badly beaten up by a dog. He is in pain and near death when Miss Effie finds him. She actually shows the children the proper procedure for putting a cat to sleep with the use of chloroform.</p>

<p>A Cascaded Integrator-Comb (CIC) is a highly efficient digital filter typically used in digital signal processing where interpolation or decimation are required. As the name implies, the filter consists of several integrators and several comb sections. In the case of a decimating CIC (i.e. a filter which accepts data at a high sampling rate then filters and decimates down to a slower output rate), the filter consists of one or more cascaded integrators feeding a decimator and ends in one or more comb sections (equal in number to the number of integrators). An integrating CIC is simply the reverse of this architecture.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-09-14_12e8.html" title="Edit section: Comparison With FIR Filters">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Comparison With FIR Filters</span></h3>
<p>A CIC has both advantages and disadvantages compared to FIR filters. In cases where only a small amount of interpolation or decimation are needed, FIR filters generally have the advantage. However, when rates change by a factor of 10 or more, achieving a useful FIR filter anti-aliasing stop band requires exponentially increasing numbers of FIR taps.</p>
<p>For large rate changes, a CIC has a significant advantage over a FIR filter with respect to architectural and computational efficiency. Additionally, CIC filters can typically be reconfigured for different rates by changing nothing more than the decimation/interpolation section assuming the bit width of the integrators and comb sections meets certain mathematical criteria based on the maximum possible rate change.</p>
<p>Whereas a FIR filter can use fixed or floating point math, a CIC filter uses only fixed point math. This is necessary so that the integrator and comb sections perform complementary discrete mathematical operations. While the reasons are less than intuitive, an inherent characteristic of the CIC architecture is that if fixed bit length overflows occur in the integrators, they are corrected in the comb sections.</p>
<p>The range of filter shapes and responses available from a CIC filter is somewhat limited. Larger amounts of stopband rejection can be achieved by increasing the number of poles. However, doing so requires an increase in bit width in the integrator and comb sections which increases filter complexity. The shape of the filter response provides even fewer degrees of design freedom. For this reason, most real-world filtering requirements cannot be met by a CIC filter alone. However, a CIC filter followed by a short to moderate length FIR proves highly applicable. Additionally, the FIR filter shape is normalized relative to the CIC's sampling rate at the FIR/CIC interface so one set of FIR coefficients can be used over a large range of CIC interpolation and decimation rates.</p>
<p>An excellent in depth tutorial on CIC filters written by Matthew Donadio including mathematical formulas can be found at <a href="http://www.dspguru.com/info/tutor/cic.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dspguru.com/info/tutor/cic.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. An alternate name for the CIC filter is the Hogenauer filter in honor of its inventor. This seminal paper is referenced below, but due to its highly academic nature, it is recomended only for the most mathematically oriented reader:</p>

<p>NOWADAYS, it is common see an exodus of college graduates to big cities. They view their provincial homes as a collection of old paradigms, of folk beliefs, where the best option to get a job is for a worker to retire. They describe slow pace life akin to "slim opportunities" and "stagnant growth".</p>
<p><br />
Though Manila is puffed up with black fumes, dusty roads, and hellish traffic only an angel can bear, it is a head start for job seekers to draw up illusions of a perfect career.</p>
<p>Moving to Manila was an inspiration, a challenge, I had waited. My eagerness to unleash my potentials in the corporate ladder led me to devout my Sunday mornings flipping classified sections for job opportunities. I tried to win from employers the hot seat of a new comer. I did everything, only to find the endpoint of rejection and my aggressive determination for job hunting a failure.</p>
<p>Reality seeped in, presenting a grim image of scarce jobs available in our country with so many of us fresh graduates fighting for the competitive market share--all in a flock heading for the same dream.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I say life is not fair. We spend so much for education, for high learning only to fight for a few jobs.</p>
<p>My search for job took me another six months. By that time, I was nearly broke, felt like going back home. But my pride...I am ashamed to be labeled a loser, prodded me on. I could not imagine going back to a small town to face an inquiring crowd.</p>
<p>My first job assignment was a mismatch to my profession. Nonetheless I accepted my fate. My work was a routine, which at times left me pondering about what to do next. To motivate, enlighten my spirit, I eyed a writing position, hoping that one day, the job that I should be doing would be in my grasp. After months of playing spy and waiting for the moment to come, I earned the writer's job.</p>
<p><br />
In achieving dreams, it is a let go relationship. Sometimes by not pursuing it, it comes right at your doorstep. Yet there are benefits when you chart your future. For today, we are following a different career path, everyone so engross in the nursing profession.</p>
<p>If Dr. Jose Rizal were alive today, his words, "the youth is the hope of our nation," may turn out a paradox, a twisted tale of the 20th century, since the Filipino youth has become the hope of other nations. The young Filipinos today are a bandwagon of skilled migrants, entice by a promising future outside our shores and difficult to ever refuse.</p>
<p>But regardless of the Filipino exodus, they can never ignore their birth country nor can they forget happy thoughts from friends and neighbors: the drinking spree, endless chatting, they never have in the west. So in secrecy, they watch badoy movies reminding their identities. Hoping to lessen the loneliness they carry along and make them feel closer to home.</p>
<p>We are a race with caring hands, securing our families with monthly remittances. We are popular for sending balikbayan boxes, which the white people find it strange. In every travel, check-in counters in the San Francisco terminal will always be loaded, making the flying time longer as we stop for refuel.</p>
<p>Though, some things in life call for long explanation, there are realities we must face.</p>
<p>Regardless the kind of jobs that bring us to foreign shores, to Metro Manila, or in our provincial homes, there are consequences we pay to find comfort in life, to earn a good education and a happy family.</p>
<p>These are the dreams of every Filipino.</p>

<p>A Uterus transplant is a very difficult task becouse of complex blood vessels that supply the lifeline of a uterus, it was done in 2002 in Saudi Arabia and after two monthly cycles it clotted and the organ had to be removed.</p>
<p>Current studies include; one in the UK and one in Sweden, Dr. Hammersmith in the UK predicted a human trial within 2 years and DR Brannstorm from Sweden predicted long ago 2 years and did not produce much.</p>
<p>Immune Supressor would have to be used and studies on kidney and liver transplant patients suggest that the risk did not increase dramaticaly.</p>
<p>there are people that where born without a uterus and do not trust surrogacy (smoking drinking by the surrogate mother) or cannot have one due to religion, their only hope will be some sort of a transplant, once more common it may be a better chouse than surrogacy for bonding mother and child.</p>

<p>Michael Lindine, an internet entrepreneur, marketing mastermind, and SEO guru graced the internet with his presence in late 2002 when he and partner, Scott Prybylko, created the website oddcrap.net. Oddcrap was sold in early 2004 and Mike proceeded to work on other projects.</p>
<p>It is rumored Michael Lindine and Prybylko are no longer affiliated as of June 2006.</p>
<p>Mikes current projects include the infamous XMS Hosting (Xtreme Media Solutions) website, Passarena, Puregamingnews, as well as a wide variety of websites.</p>
<p>Mike is most notably remembered for the spread of the alleged Ashlee Simpson sex tape rumors in January 2006 via oddcrap.net. Legal action stopped Lindine, and his company at the time, OC LLC., from further use of Ashlee’s name for any commercial purposes.</p>
<p>It is also rumored that Lindine and the oddcrap.net organization have had legal dealings with a wide variety of other websites.</p>

<p>The Talisman Chronicles are five dark fantasy novels detailing the adventures of Jack Kenney and his brother Jeremy, as they face a host of dangers from both this world and another one that exists in a parallel reality. The series spans 30 years across North and South America, beginning in 1999 in rural Alabama and culminating in an American civil war in the mid-west region of what is left of the United States in the year 2029. The continual political strife of the peoples living in both continents, who must also face the challenges wrought by an unfriendly supernatural realm and the coming earth changes prophesied centuries ago, sets the backdrop for the novels.</p>
<p>Book I, "The Golden Talisman", is scheduled for release in the fall of 2006, while Book II "The Blood Star of Karachi" is scheduled for release in spring 2007. Both books will be available through Mundania Press. The author is presently in the early stages of writing the third installment of the series.</p>

<p>Eric V. Kennedy was born December 21st, 1965 in Tampa, Florida. Coming from a long line of Tampa pioneers, a descendant of Thomas P. Kennedy who was a US Marshall assigned by General William J. Worth to Tampa in the late 1830’s.</p>
<p>Eric started his career in publishing at the age of 19 when he joined the duPont REGISTRY in 1985. A top producing advertising account executive, Eric helped lead the company into the information age and was appointed executive vice president when he was 27 years old. From that post he served concurrent roles as editor-in-chief, president of dupontregistry.com and new titles he also served on the companies board of directors. He was instrumental in structuring a deal to include super business man, H. Wayne Huizenga, founder of Waste Management and Blockbuster Video, as a principal investor in the launch of dupontregistry.com.</p>
<p>Under Eric's guidance as editor-in-chief, duPont REGISTRY launched their Gallery of Fine Homes which was recognized in 1995 as one of the 50 most noteworthy launches by Hearst Magazine Enterprises and notable journalism prefessor, Samir Husni. There were nearly 900 titles launched that year.</p>
<p>After over 16 years of mingling with the rich and famous at the duPont REGISTRY, he moved on at the age of 35 to launch Atlantis Magazine, “A Sea Dweller's Guide to Living," where he serves in the role of publisher/owner. Eric spends much of his time now searching the globe for exciting places to cover as travel features in Atlantis Magazine. On a personal mission to stop Global Warming, he also donates much of his personal and corporate resources to support charitable organizations like Big Brothers Big Sisters, The Nature Conservancy, Earth Share and small villages like Tukae in Africa. Atlantis Magazine's digital studios donated in 1996 the television production for a regional campaign for Big Brothers Big Sisters. The spot features famed NFL player Mike Alstott who invites viewers to explore becoming a Big Brother or a Big Sister.</p>
<p>Eric is also a principal partner and co-founder of the MOJO Guide which recently launched in Tampa Bay, Florida, Sydney, Australia, Sarasota, FL and Washington, DC and consults with clients in magazine and dotcom startups on an International level.</p>

<p>Billy Lawson was born and raised in the Muscle Shoals area of Northwest Alabama. His next door neighbor was studio musician, Junior Lowe, who played on some of the early R&amp;B classics by artists such as Percy Sledge, Wilson Pickett, Clarence Carter and Aretha Franklin. When Billy was nine or ten years old, Junior would let him sit in and sing with his band at the Ponderosa Club on the Alabama-Tennessee state line. This club was owned by W.R. Morris, the author of a biography on the legendary Tennessee Sheriff Buford Pusser, which was later made into a motion picture titled “Walking Tall.” W.R. still likes to brag about being the first person to “discover” Billy’s talent.</p>
<p>Another friend of the family who influenced Billy was Carl Montgomery, the co-author of the truck driver hit “Six Days On The Road.” Carl was the brother of Earl “Peanut” Montgomery, writer of 38 singles by George Jones, and Melba Montgomery, star of the Grand Ole Opry.</p>
<p>Billy knew three chords on his Silvertone and could sing along with Charley Pride, Buck Owens and Merle Haggard by the time he entered grade school. Wherever there was live music, that’s where you could find Billy soaking it all up like a hungry sponge.</p>
<p>After high school Billy started working the Alabama-Tennessee state line club and dance hall circuit with his band. One night a CBS representative came to a Muscle Shoals Club and signed Billy “on the spot” to an album deal on Epic records. The legendary Sam Phillips was there that night to put in a good word. But, as luck would have it, Billy’s key man at Epic was moved to the West Coast and put in charge of the Pop and Rock division of the label. Along with several other acts, Billy was lost in the shuffle. Meanwhile, Orion Pictures was holding auditions in Selma, AL, for an up-coming movie staring Jessica Lange, Tommy Lee Jones and Powers Boothe. Billy and his band got the part and Jessica Lange got an Oscar for best actress in “Blue Sky.”</p>
<p>During all of these experiences,Billy continued to write songs--songs that were good enough to get the attention of Sony/Tree publisher and producer, Don Cook. Don signed him one week and by the next week, Billy had cuts on three major artists. Within a little over a year Billy had two ..1 hits...”Learning As you Go” by Rick Trevino and “I Left Something Turned On At Home” by Trace Adkins also “Irresistible You” A ..20 by Ty England.</p>
<p>The following is a list of some of the other artists that have recorded Billy's songs:</p>
<p>T.G. Sheppard Chalee Tennison Mel McDaniel John Anderson Lonestar Daryle Singletary Lee Ann Womack Daron Norwood Shenandoah Delbert McClinton Confederate Railroad George Strait Sammy Kershaw Lori Morgan Tim McGraw Travis Tritt Ken Mellons Gretchen Wilson Ty England Charley Pride Bryan White Oak Ridge Boys Ronnie Milsap Rick Trevino Trace Adkins</p>

<p>MATRIX ESSAYS</p>
<p>Red Pill, Blue Pill “You take the blue pill and the story ends. You wake in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill and you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes. Remember -- all I am offering is the truth, nothing more.” This conversation takes place in the Matrix. Morpheus, the father figure in the movie, is telling Neo, the protagonist in the movie, to choose from two pills that will decide his destiny.</p>
<p>To the robots in the Matrix, humans are valued as energy and are otherwise worthless. The pills offered to Neo were used as a choice to either stay in or go out of the Matrix where the robots would get the energy. Neo finds this out later in the movie but must first decide which pill is the right one or the one that he wants to take - the pill to get you out of the Matrix or the pill where you will stay in.</p>
<p>The allusion to Alice and Wonderland is repeated many times in the movie. One is where Morpheus gives Neo the pills. This is effective as it is repeated so people can relate to it and Alice and Wonderland is a very well known story in today which is also effective. It also makes people remember about the pills choice and how it leads Neo out of the Matrix.</p>
<p>The pills may seem simple but they are a complex subject. The notion of the pills is displaying a choice. The movie is a lot about choice and the pills are a visual form of it. The pills are an intelligent way to show choice. They are a major part of the movie and decide the fate of Neo. The colours of the pills also stand out in an effective way to make the viewers more interested. Red and blue were chosen as the colours for the pills.</p>
<p>Red is a complex colour. It can mean action, confidence, courage and vitality. It can also mean some form of danger. Neo needs to have confidence with his choice. When he is out of the Matrix he needs courage. He will then have a real life and will be energised.</p>
<p>If you want some red in your life you want increased enthusiasm and interest, more energy action and confidence to go after your dreams.</p>
<p>The colour blue symbolises truth. This is a contradiction in the Matrix. It is what you think is the truth but really isn’t. The truth can be dangerous and blue does not give an essence of this. It is a very relaxing colour.</p>
<p>When you want some blue in your life you want calm and relaxation to counteract chaos or agitation, to open the flow of communication, solitude and peace.</p>
<p>If Neo had taken the blue pill he would have woken up in his bed and would have continued his life as prior to the experience. He would have thought it was a dream just like many experiences of his.</p>
<p>He chose the red pill. It was a hard decision to leave the loved ones we assume he had without saying goodbye. He left all he ‘had’ and all he worked for to go somewhere that was not so perfect in itself. It could potentially ruin his life.</p>
<p>Many humans want to gain more knowledge. Many are always looking for new ways to gain it. Neo is a computer hacker meaning he knows a lot but many humans want to know more. Most people would take the red pill as they want knowledge. Morpheus warns Neo "Remember, all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more." The truth is not always wanted information. Choosing the red pill and the life after it is what Aristotle called the examined life. This means that you are the one making the choices. It is the life that you have considered and chosen to lead.</p>
<p>Neo is told that the red pill will help him find truth. But he doesn’t know what this means. It symbolises risk and doubt. However Morpheus does not lie but doesn’t give all information. Many would have turned away but the information given is not substantial. Morpheus also tempts him. Morpheus says to Neo "You have to understand that many people are not ready to be unplugged, and many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it.” This is a form of temptation. It is to lure people in.</p>
<p>There is an advantage to both the pills. Most people believe they are in control of their life. In the Matrix however, people are deceived. They think they are in control of their lives but they are not.</p>
<p>When you are out of the Matrix you are absolutely positive that you are in control. Even though this might not be the case, humans are provoked and like to feel in control. It is almost human instinct to feel this way. Most species would like to feel in control but humans are and believe they can be in control of many. Morpheus with the crowd of people in the second movie is an example of this. This is interpretered because he looks confident. He also looks as if he feels dominant. This is another example of control.</p>
<p>Morpheus says “There is no turning back.” This can be misleading. It puts pressure on the choice maker. They are pressured to make the correct choice. There is no incorrect choice with the pills. Whichever you take you may after think was the incorrect choice but it cannot be changed. On a certain level the choice wouldn’t matter if you had taken the blue pill because you would have woken up and wouldn’t know anything about what happened except it was a dream (or you thought it was.) You wouldn’t think about the right and wrong choice in this circumstance. However it does matter to others that then know you are in ignorance. You don’t know that you are in unawareness of the real world but others do.</p>
<p>In this instance is not just about the pills, but what they stand for in this circumstance. The question is asking us whether reality or truth, is worth following. The blue pill would leave Neo as he is, in a life consisting of what he has have already done, and what we he believes he knows. He is happy and does not need the truth to live. This is what Cipher implies. He says “Ignorance is bliss.” Is all this necessarily true? The life in the Matrix seems perfect without the hassle of the robots and all the other issues but there are still issues in the Matrix. Ignorance can be bliss is terms of the Matrix. By accepting what the inhabitants are told and experiencing life can be easier. There is the social pressure to 'fit in', which is immeasurably strong in most cultures. If Neo is in the Matrix when he is choosing the pills then did he make the choice? If humans do not make choices in the Matrix then who made the choice? Was it Neo or the robots? Is this a problem with the film or did the robots want Neo out of the Matrix? They do not as at the beginning of the movie they are trying to keep Neo away from Morpheus. This is one of the examples of a philosophical question in the movie. They are everywhere and are frequently being asked by the viewers and the characters. They are designed to make you think. Another philosophical debate is what if the red pill leads to an imaginary world. There is no proof to confirm that this is wrong. How do you know what is real and what is not? It could even be a dream. There is no evidence and information is scarce so we do not know. A major theme of the movie is choice. The world can thrive and deteriorate with choice. The choices made in a lifetime choose your outcome.</p>
<p>A theme relating to this is how much does the individual and how much does society contribute to choice? In the Matrix you don’t control choice, however in the real world you may. There could be another dimension to the inhabitants of the real world that is outside the Matrix. No one knows if there is more to the world that they live in. These are all very interesting philosophical questions. The world is confusing and can be misleading but if we do make our own choices then we should try to make them good quality.</p>
<p>The choice of pills is only one of the decisions Neo has to make. Another very important choice is whether he or Morpheus dies. Neo is not the only one making choices. Many of the other characters are as well. It seems more choices are made with the world out of the Matrix. The pills are the first important choice in the movie for Neo. This shows how choices you make are not always necessarily the right ones but you have to live with the consequences. Better choices can lead to better circumstances.</p>
<p>You make millions of choices in your life and your life is based around them. They help guide and build a structure for your wellbeing and can add and extra dimension in your life. They can be good and same are bad but they occur nearly every minute and cannot be avoided. I made a choice to use this topic and I believe it was the right one for me. An unexamined life is not worth living. Or is it?</p>

<p>The burger dog is an oblong form of ground beef designed to fit the same bread bun of the traditional hot dog. It was first publically served in Franklin, TN in 2005 at the yearly community Fall harvest festival. The inventor/designer of the burger dog, Jack Sloan, was attempting to streamline his small food booth operation by eliminating having to purchase and store several different buns in the limited space of the serving booth. Therefore, he experimented at home with the design to get the exact size and weight of oblong ground beef which when cooked properly would fit and slightly hang off a standard hot dog bun. The burger dog can be complimented with the standard amenities of lettuce, tomato, onions, and cheese, as well as, any other additional items the connoisseur may desire. The burger dog was an instant hit at the event and actually out sold the tradition hot dog 2 to 1. It was priced just $.50 more than the hot dog and Sloan provided the same compliments of onions, relish, shredded cheese, mustard, and ketchup for the two items at this first outing of the burger dog to further assist with the streamlining of the food product line and to conserve space. Due to the success of the burger dog during the summer of 2005, he went on in 2006 to trademark the product and design a special 'burger dog' meat press to form the ground beef faster than having to hand press each one.</p>

<p>Indian Coffee House is a restaurant chain in India, which is run by cooperatives. It is famous for its pure, delicious menu and for its unique history.</p>
<p>In India Coffee Houses were started under the Coffee Board in early fortees under the British Rule. Later in mid fifties the Board closed down the Coffee Houses, pointing out huge loss. And the last grade workers of the Coffee Houses were thrown out to the streets mercilessly.</p>
<p>Then these semi literate, poor workers took over the Coffee Houses through cooperatives under the leadership of India's legendary communist leader A.K. Gopalan. And through painful struggle of the workers the Coffee Houses became profitable. Thus they proved that there is no need of elite bureaucracy to make a business success.</p>
<p>Now we can see ICHs in all important towns of India. It is owned by the workers. And it is also managed by ordinary workers. It is the speciality of ICHs.</p>
<p>This history is available as a book in Malayalam, Kofi Housinte Katha by Nadakkal Parameswaran Pillai. It is published by the Current Books, Thrissur.</p>

<p>Poshlust is a term borrowed by author, Vladimir Nabokov, from the Russian word <i>poshlost</i>. It's meaning is considered by some to be untranslatable in English, but is closely related to the English component words that make it up, posh and lust. It is often translated as banal, tacky or trashy, but it also implies pretentions to a greatness that is lacking. It represents the idea of a false truth or value in something.</p>

<p>Lester Eugene Pipkin was born in 1917? in Omaha, Nebraska, but grew up in Denver, Colorado, the son of a laborer and his wife with roots in Madison County, Missouri. After graduating from Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, he pastored in Minnesota, Kentucky and again in Minnesota before moving to West Virginia in 1950 to found, with co-founder Robert Guelich, a fundamentalist pastor, the Appalachian Bible Institute, later College. Pipkin did graduate studies at Bemidji State Teachers College and Bethel Theological Seminary? and, in 1967, received an honorary doctorate degree from Bob Jones University, Greenville, South Carolina. Pipkin was an early ally of Dr. Henry Morris in the recovery of the young-earth creationist movement as Biblically-correct and scientifically supportable and promoted Dr. Morris and his seminal work on the Genesis Flood. Dr. Morris became affiliated with the school. Other notables who played a role in the small college's development were former West Virginia governor Okey L. Patterson and U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd.</p>
<p>Pipkin received the Moody Alumnus of the Year Award in 196? and was a featured speaker at a Moody's Founder's Week.</p>
<p>Pipkin served as President and chief architect of the Bible college from its inception to 1983, when he became Chancellor, serving in that capacity until his death from prostate cancer in 2001?</p>

<p>I,m doing this article about my pet budgies. Their names are Bluey and Pepper. We got them about 2-3 years ago. They come from a pet store but are originally from Australia and aren't used to the cold. We got them for my sister's birthday when she was 9. Her budgies poo a lot and live in a big cage. They are intelligent creatures. They always figure a way out of their cage. They like chewing our little houses we give them! Over all They ARE PROBABLY THE BEST PET WE HAVE HAD!!!!!</p>

<p>The Hadamard variance is a 3-sample variance, with binomially-weighted coefficients that is similar to the 2-sample Allan variance. It considers the 2nd difference of the fractional frequencies, the 3rd difference of the phase variations. The Hadamard variance, HVAR or s²H(t), converges for the Flicker Walk FM (a = -3) and Random Run FM (a = -4) power-law noise types. It is also unaffected by linear frequency drift.</p>
<p>Like the Allan variance, also the Hadamard variance is usually expressed as its square-root.</p>

<p>The Andover Thrashers are a 2 year old team who joined The <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_American_Football_League_5b1a.html" title="British American Football League">British American Football League</a> (BAFL)in 2005. The team plays and practices at Harrow Way School, Andover, SP10 3HR <a href="http://www.harrowway.hants.sch.uk" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.harrowway.hants.sch.uk" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> The Head Coach and QB is Andy Mountain who was also instramental in the foundation of the team.</p>

<p>The 2005 season was not a good one for the Thrashers. They had a small roster and players with little experience playing both sides of the ball for the whole game. Inevitably fatigue took its toll, they lost every game and recorded a 0-10-0 season. However it was not in vain they fought hard and learned a lot from their first senior year. In fact that year Phill Price the Thrasher's Line Backer won the BAFL Rookie Of The Year Award for a sensational season. <a href="http://www.bafl.org.uk" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bafl.org.uk" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>

<p>After training hard over the winter The 2006 Season was exceptional for the Thrashers. They boasted a 5 week winning streak, held 2nd place on the table for a couple of weeks and almost mantained a shut-out against the experienced Plymouth Admirals. These are feats are unheard of for a 2 year old team. The Thrashers also had a hopes of making the playoffs if they beat <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Wales_Warriors_62b3.html" title="South Wales Warriors">South Wales Warriors</a> in the last game of the season. However they where crushed when they had a touch down called back in the last minute of the game for a Lineman down field. Andover eventually finished 3rd in the Division 2 South Conference. <a href="http://www.gridironuk.co.uk/standings.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gridironuk.co.uk/standings.php" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-09-14_12e8.html" title="Edit section: Kent Crusaders Basketball Club">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Kent Crusaders Basketball Club</span></h2>
<p>The Kent Crusaders Basketball Club are based at Body &amp; Mind in Canterbury, they compete in the EBL National League Division 2.</p>
<p>The roots of the Kent Crusaders began in the early 1990s when Kevin and Christine Paice, Dave Hooper and Hill Lingham began developing junior basketball at Canterbury College. Through their work, the Canterbury Jazz and CK Heat were born. As the club gathered momentum, the College became the place to be for basketball in East Kent. Trevor Acres and Kevin Maloney joined the coaching staff and numerous boys were given the opportunity to play National League and the club won numerous Kent cups.</p>
<p>In 2000, ex-player and young coach Jay Gifford took over the club. He was joined a year later by Canadian Jesse Sazant. Coach Sazant took the team to new heights, including a National Under 16 quarterfinal in his first season. At this point the club was relaunched as the East Kent Crusaders.</p>
<p>After losing older players to London for years, the club decided to launch a men's Division 3 team in 2004. In their first season the club finished third in Division 3 South East. The initial season saw a number of the club's former junior players return to the Crusaders to be joined by a number of local players. In their second season, the team quickly progressed, winning Division 3 South East and making the finals of the National Shield. The club also signed their first foreign player (Walter Moyse) and foreign coach (assistant Mads Olesen).</p>
<p>The Crusaders have now been promoted to Division 2 and renamed the Body &amp; Mind Kent Crusaders.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-09-14_12e8.html" title="Edit section: Hawayo Takata">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hawayo Takata</span></h2>
<p>Hawayo Takata</p>
<p>Reiki comes to the West. Hawayo Takata was born at dawn on December 24th, 1900, on the island of Kauai, Hawaii. Her parents were Japanese immigrants and her father worked in the sugar cane fields. She worked very hard as she was growing up. She eventually married the bookkeeper of the plantation where she was employed. His name was Saichi Takata and they had two daughters. In October of 1930, Saichi died at the age of thirty-four leaving Mrs. Takata to raise their two children. In order to provide for her family, she had to work very hard with little rest. After five years she developed severe abdominal pain, a lung condition and had a nervous breakdown.</p>
<p>Soon after this, one of her sisters died and it was the responsibility of Hawayo to travel to Japan where her parents had moved to deliver the news. She also felt she could receive help for her health in Japan.</p>
<p>She took a steamship and was accompanied by her sister-in-law. After informing her parents of the death of her sister, she entered a hospital. It was found that she had a tumor, gallstones and appendicitis. After resting several weeks, she was ready for the needed operation.</p>
<p>On the operating table, just before the surgery was to begin, Hawayo heard a voice. The voice said, "The operation is not necessary. The operation is not necessary." She had never heard a voice speak to her like this before. She wondered what it meant. The voice repeated the message a third time even louder. She knew she was wide awake and had not imagined the voice. It was so unusual, yet so compelling that she decided to ask the doctor. She got off the operating table, wrapped a sheet around herself and asked to speak to the doctor.</p>
<p>When the doctor finally came, she asked if he knew of any other way that her problems could be helped. The doctor knew of Dr. Hayashi's Reiki clinic and told Hawayo about it. This was something she wanted to try.</p>
<p>At the Reiki clinic, she began receiving treatments. She had never heard of Reiki before and did not know what it was. Using their Reiki hands the practitioners could sense what was wrong with Mrs. Takata. Their diagnosis very closely matched the doctor's at the hospital. This impressed her and gave her confidence in what they were doing.</p>
<p>Two Reiki practitioners would treat her each day. The heat from their hands was so strong that she thought they were using some kind of equipment. She looked around, but saw none. Seeing the large sleeves of the Japanese kimono one of the practitioners was wearing, she thought she had found the location of the equipment. She grabbed the sleeves, but found nothing. The startled practitioner wanted to know what she was doing and when she explained, he began to laugh. Then he told her about Reiki and how it worked.</p>
<p>Mrs. Takata received daily treatments and got progressively better. In four months, she was completely healed. Impressed with the results, she wanted to learn Reiki. However, it was explained that Reiki was Japanese and that it was intended to stay in Japan. It could not be taught to an outsider.</p>
<p>Mrs. Takata talked to the surgeon at the hospital and convinced him to ask Dr. Hayashi to allow her to learn Reiki. Since Dr. Hayashi wanted to teach Reiki to another woman besides his wife, and since Mrs. Takata was so persistent, he decided that she should be the one. In the Spring of 1936, Mrs. Takata received First Degree Reiki. She worked with Dr. Hayashi for one year and then received Second Degree Reiki.</p>
<p>Mrs. Takata returned to Hawaii in 1937. She was soon followed by Dr. Hayashi and his daughter who came to help establish Reiki in Hawaii. In the Winter of 1938, Dr. Hayashi initiated Hawayo Takata as a Reiki Master. She was the thirteenth and last Reiki Master Dr. Hayashi initiated.</p>
<p>Between 1970 and her transition on December 11, 1980, Mrs. Takata initiated twenty-two Reiki Masters. Below is a list of the Reiki Masters she initiated. This is the list she gave to her sister before she passed through transition.</p>
<p>George Araki / Barbara McCullough / Beth Grey / Ursula Baylow / Paul Mitchell / Iris Ishikura (deceased) / Fran Brown / Barbara Weber Ray / Ethel Lombardi / Wanja Twan / Virginia Samdahl / Phyllis Lei Furumoto / Dorothy Baba (deceased) / Mary McFaden / John Gray / Rick Bockner / Bethel Phaigh (deceased) / Harry Kuboi / Patricia Ewing / Shinobu Saito / Kay Yamashita (Takata's Sister) / Barbara Brown /</p>
<p>The original twenty-two teachers have taught others. In the decade since Mrs. Takata experienced transition, Reiki has spread rapidly in the West. It is now practiced throughout North and South America, Europe, New Zealand, Australia and other parts of the world. There are now an estimated 50,000 Reiki Masters with as many as 1,000,000 people practicing Reiki throughout the world.</p>

<p>On the operating table, just before the surgery was to begin, Hawayo heard a voice. The voice said, "The operation is not necessary. The operation is not necessary." She had never heard a voice speak to her like this before. She wondered what it meant. The voice repeated the message a third time even louder. She knew she was wide awake and had not imagined the voice. It was so unusual, yet so compelling that she decided to ask the doctor. She got off the operating table, wrapped a sheet around herself and asked to speak to the doctor.</p>
<p>When the doctor finally came, she asked if he knew of any other way that her problems could be helped. The doctor knew of Dr. Hayashi's Reiki clinic and told Hawayo about it. This was something she wanted to try.</p>
<p>At the Reiki clinic, she began receiving treatments. She had never heard of Reiki before and did not know what it was. Using their Reiki hands the practitioners could sense what was wrong with Mrs. Takata. Their diagnosis very closely matched the doctor's at the hospital. This impressed her and gave her confidence in what they were doing.</p>
<p>Two Reiki practitioners would treat her each day. The heat from their hands was so strong that she thought they were using some kind of equipment. She looked around, but saw none. Seeing the large sleeves of the Japanese kimono one of the practitioners was wearing, she thought she had found the location of the equipment. She grabbed the sleeves, but found nothing. The startled practitioner wanted to know what she was doing and when she explained, he began to laugh. Then he told her about Reiki and how it worked.</p>
<p>Mrs. Takata received daily treatments and got progressively better. In four months, she was completely healed. Impressed with the results, she wanted to learn Reiki. However, it was explained that Reiki was Japanese and that it was intended to stay in Japan. It could not be taught to an outsider.</p>
<p>Mrs. Takata talked to the surgeon at the hospital and convinced him to ask Dr. Hayashi to allow her to learn Reiki. Since Dr. Hayashi wanted to teach Reiki to another woman besides his wife, and since Mrs. Takata was so persistent, he decided that she should be the one. In the Spring of 1936, Mrs. Takata received First Degree Reiki. She worked with Dr. Hayashi for one year and then received Second Degree Reiki.</p>
<p>Mrs. Takata returned to Hawaii in 1937. She was soon followed by Dr. Hayashi and his daughter who came to help establish Reiki in Hawaii. In the Winter of 1938, Dr. Hayashi initiated Hawayo Takata as a Reiki Master. She was the thirteenth and last Reiki Master Dr. Hayashi initiated.</p>
<p>Between 1970 and her transition on December 11, 1980, Mrs. Takata initiated twenty-two Reiki Masters. Below is a list of the Reiki Masters she initiated. This is the list she gave to her sister before she passed through transition.</p>
<p>George Araki / Barbara McCullough / Beth Grey / Ursula Baylow / Paul Mitchell / Iris Ishikura (deceased) / Fran Brown / Barbara Weber Ray / Ethel Lombardi / Wanja Twan / Virginia Samdahl / Phyllis Lei Furumoto / Dorothy Baba (deceased) / Mary McFaden / John Gray / Rick Bockner / Bethel Phaigh (deceased) / Harry Kuboi / Patricia Ewing / Shinobu Saito / Kay Yamashita (Takata's Sister)/ Barbara Brown</p>
<p>The original twenty-two teachers have taught others. In the decade since Mrs. Takata experienced transition, Reiki has spread rapidly in the West. It is now practiced throughout North and South America, Europe, New Zealand, Australia and other parts of the world. There are now an estimated 50,000 Reiki Masters with as many as 1,000,000 people practicing Reiki throughout the world.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-09-14_12e8.html" title="Edit section: The Pyramid of Cool">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Pyramid of Cool</span></h2>
<p>The Pyramid of Cool was a visual concept devised by the reputable hipsters Roach, Davidson and Holdaway, while on a summer retreat in the Hamptons. It consists of three main categorised 'states' of Coolness: the <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executive.html" title="Executive">executive</a>, the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spastic.html" title="Spastic">spastic</a>, and the bargain-bin.</p>
<p><br />
<b>The Executive</b> is situated at the top of the pyramid, and is reserved only for those who display coolness in excessive amounts. Roach/Davidson/Holdaway (hereby shortened to RDH) wish to make the distinction between 'coolness' and mere 'popularity'. At the core of the 'cool' philosphy lies the concept of internal coolness, an intrinsic quality which cannot be derived from social factors like acceptance or fame. Popular-culture examples of 'Executive' include:</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Zappa_4e92.html" title="Frank Zappa">Frank Zappa</a></p>

<p><a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a></p>
<p><b>The Spastic</b> refers to the middle section of the pyramid, a place reserved for those who lack the subtle social artistry of an executive, but avoid the embrassing trappings of social ineptitude present in the lower tier of the pyramid. Spastic has often be associated with the term tryhard, and is central to the understanding of the 'spastic' objective - to assimilate into a higher strata of coolness. Such attempts at a coolness class-change are entirely futile, as the perception of effort on the part of the spastic voids all semblance of 'executive' nature in the subject. Such luminaries of the 'spastic' clique include:</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/l/a/Clayton_Bennett_1c50.html" title="Clayton Bennett">Clayton Bennett</a></p>

<p>The lowest level of the 'cool' pyramid, termed [[<b>bargain bin</b>]] by RDH, contains the portion of society that is foreign to the concept of cool. This includes the socially retarded; persons that may not even be aware of the damage caused when they engage in discourse with others. Bargain-bin members usually incur an element of uneasyness and pity in their peers, often inciting ridicule and public avoidance at all costs. Examples include:</p>

Sorry if this is the wrong format. I just noticed that the word highlighted in red ("baha") in the Christopher_McCandless entry probably is misspelled and should be "Baja," for which you do have an entry.</p>

<p>On September 13, 2006 a gunman or gunmen entered a Montrel college located west of Montreal's shopping and financial district. armed with a rifles. Though many people believe there was only one shooter, Police are on the look for more then two. One of them was dressed in a full black trenchcoat and silently the gunmen/man made way to the cafeteria.</p>
<p>Once inside the gunmen/man began to open fire on students. Witnesses report "random unfueled" killings as the gunmen/man shot anybody and everybody. They also report people shot in the leg, chest, and arms. After finishing the massacre in the cafeteria, the gunmen/man began to wander the halls and shoot on running students.</p>
<p>Reports of 20 gunshots were heard, and ceased when one of the shooters commited suicide. Reports say 16 or more injured, 3 in critical condition, and 4 dead. People are also debating a fourth gunmen.</p>
<p>Shooting started inside the Dawson College cafeteria shortly before 1 p.m., television networks reported. Witnesses said a tall, skinny man with a Mohawk haircut entered the school with a ``large <i>gun. Michel Boyer, a student at Dawson, told CBC television that he heard about 20 shots.</i></p>
<p>Police evacuated the students to a nearby store, and also evacuated the nearby Place Alexis-Nihon shopping center. Subway service between the McGill and Lionel-Groulx stations has been halted until further notice.</p>
<p>Ian Lafreniere, a spokesman for the Montreal Police department, told reporters police are still looking for ``one or more suspects. <i>- ``We heard there were four shooters,</i> Frem said in an interview. ``We heard there was a hostage. When we came down, we saw blood on the walls. There were lots of cops, lots of dogs and bloodstains.</p>
<p>The shooting may be the worst in Canada since 1989, when Marc Lepine shot 14 women to death at the Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal. Several others were injured before Lepine, 25, turned the gun on himself.</p>

<p>In Laser Physics, Pound-Drever-Hall Locking or PDH locking is a technique used to improve a laser's frequency stability.</p>
<p>It uses an external high-finesse cavity (i.e. a Fabry-Perot interferometer) as the reference, and an electronic servo to control the laser.</p>
<p>It was developed by Drever and Hall based on the Pound stabilizer, used to stabilize microwave cavities.</p>
<p>The laser is frequency modulated, either directly by the current input on a diode laser, or by using an Acousto-Optical Modulator. This introduces two side-bands onto the carrier frequency of the laser. The two side bands, <span class="texhtml"><i>f</i><sub><i>c</i></sub> − <i>f</i><sub><i>m</i></sub></span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>f</i><sub><i>c</i></sub> + <i>f</i><sub><i>m</i></sub></span> have a 180 degree phase relationship between them.</p>
<p>To be able to seperate the input signal from the return signal, an isolator is used, which makes use of the othongonalise polarisation to direct the input beam on a different path to the output beam. One simple system is to pass the beam into a Polarisation Beam Splitting Cube, e.g. a Thomson prism pair. This will pass horizontally polarised light into the cavity and reflect vertically polarised light to a fast-photodector. The reflected light is rotated by using a quater-wave-plate. However, good optical isolation is still required to prevent reflected light optically feedbacking into the laser, and creating oscillation.</p>
<p>A resonant cavity will have a maximum reflection when on resonance with the input source. A simple locking technique uses the reflected light of the cavity, using the side-of-fringe technique, which locks just off-resonant with the cavity's mode. This means that if the laser frequency increases (e.g. due to thermal drift) it will come closer to resonance with the cavity. The error signal will increase. If the laser frequency drops, it will move further away from resonance and the error signal will decrease. Therefore, the error signal can be fed to the laser and used to drive the laser back onto the lock-point. There are two problems with this scheme though. It is very easy for the laser to move so far from the lock point that it is on the otherside of the reflection peak, and the above situation is reversed. This is sometimes called "anti-lock" and the laser will be driven rapidly to another mode. The other problem is a side-of-fringe lock will respond to intensity noise, as well as frequency noise on the laser. This can be corrected for with intensity locking schemes, but is not ideal.</p>
<p><br />
The power of the PDH system is that is uses the reflected signal on resonance. However, to know whether the laser's frequency is higher or lower than the cavity's, it is neccessary to know the phase of the signal. That way the laser can be driven back to resonance.</p>
<p>The reflected beam from the cavity is made up of two parts. There is an immediantly reflected part, and a part that comes from the round trip in the cavity. We need to measure the phase of the reflected beam, as this will tell us whether our laser frequency is higher or lower than the the cavities.</p>
<p>On resonance, the carrier will be perfectly transmitted. By adding a high frequency modulation, which are much higher than the cavity's finesse, or width, both sidebands are almost totally reflected.</p>
<p>To measure the phase-difference of these reflected sidebands, we need to deliberately send in to the cavity two beams with a fixed phase relationship. FM sidebands provide exactly this. In a perfect FM case, the two sidebands will be 180 degrees apart. When these two interfere, on the ouput of the cavity, a beat signal is created, which is dependent on their phase difference. It is this beat frequency that is detected on the photodiode. This gives us a measure of phase difference as an intensity on the photodiode.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose our laser is just higher than resonance. The upper sideband will experience a positive phase-shift, whilst the lower sideband sees a negative phase shift. When these two signals are beat together, the beat frequency will be lower than the modulation frequency. The reverse is also true.</p>
<p>However, the beat frequency is still at the carrier frequency and therefore contains a high (typically MHz) conponent. To remove this and just leave a DC error signal, the signal from the photodiode is mixed with the original modulation frequency. So long as the phase difference between these two is zero, the resultant signal contains the difference between the beat signal and the modulation and 2f components. The 2f components are filtered out, leaving a DC signal which is positive when the phase-difference (and therefore the frequency difference between reference and laser) is positive, and vice-versa. The great thing about the PDH signal is it has both a wide capture range and a fast response. A typical signal looks like :</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Pdh.png">Image:Pdh.png</a></p>
<p>An ideal locking signal would be 1 when the laser frequency is too low (and thus would drive the frequency higher until it reached resonance) and -1 when laser frequency is too high. The change would occur very rapidly on resonance, with the error signal being zero when both frequencies match.</p>
<p>The PDH signal is good because is has a rapid transmission in the centre and two flatish plateaus at the top and bottom. If the laser jumps frequency it will be in one of the two plateaus and will find itself back to the centre. While it is in the centre, a small frequency shift will result in a large error signal change, rapidly driving back the laser to resonance.</p>
<p>The shape is determined by two things. The finesse of the cavity and the modulation frequency. The width of each peak is determined by the ratio of the two. However, the slope in the centre is determined by the finesse of the cavity. If the modulation frequency is too high the two "dips" in the curve increase. If these reach zero, the lock may be falled into locking to them instead of the centre. Therefore a careful choice of these two values is required.</p>

<p><b>Invasion</b> are a rock band from <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borl%C3%A4nge.html" title="Borlänge">Borlänge</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>.</p>
<p>The band's germination dates back to the late 90's, when singer/songwriter/guitarist <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gustaf_Jonsson_49b0.html" title="Gustaf Jonsson">Gustaf Jonsson</a> and bassist/singer Johan Hölbling were in a noise constellation called Metal Machine Music (after an infamous <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Reed_999a.html" title="Lou Reed">Lou Reed</a> album). When the group broke up, the pair continued playing. Meanwhile, Gustaf and class mate Clara Flygare formed a band together with guitarist Martin Ståhl of semi-famous indie sensation Looking for Nancy.</p>
<p>Eventually, the quartet decided to play together and in late 2003 they were known as Invasion. Some months later they released their first EP, blending Bacharach pop, mod, Stax soul, country and R&amp;B.</p>
<p>In 2005 they released their full-length debut album, "Invasion For Lovers", and the acclaim for the album and the unique peculiarity in the band's sound raised Invasion's profile considerably. Hailing from Borlänge, the same city <a href="../../../s/u/g/Sugarplum_Fairy_e541.html" title="Sugarplum Fairy">Sugarplum Fairy</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mando_Diao_5ebc.html" title="Mando Diao">Mando Diao</a> were raised in, they soon were called the next pop sensation from industrial community <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borl%C3%A4nge.html" title="Borlänge">Borlänge</a>.</p>
<p>Early in 2006 the band released their second album, called "Crazy dance". Here the band proved to have a even wider spectrum of influences and combined vintage country with the rhythms of slick disco. The band even recorded a cover of <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Jackson_f768.html" title="Chuck Jackson">Chuck Jackson</a> classic "Tell Him I'm Not Home" for the album.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-09-14_12e8.html" title="Edit section: Hazel R. Carter">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hazel R. Carter</span></h2>
<p>According to Coldwell Banker, Hazel R. Carter (b. 1938) was in the top four percent for sales of homes in Northern California during 2001-2004. She opened the Belvedere office in 1997. The disparity between Hazel's talent and her fame is of her own making. Abjuring the more-is-better syndrome that can overtake realtors with high volume aspirations, Hazel has limited the size of her successful 22-year practice to no more than 15 commissions a year, so that she can devote her undivided attention to providing the personal service that is missing when an agent undertakes more than that. Consequently, the experience of buying or selling property in Marin County is made pleasant instead of an ordeal.</p>
<p>Moreover, her relationship with her clients doesn't come to a halt when escrow closes. She can advise against unnecessary improvements, as well as suggest architects, contractors, and landscapers, moving companies or what have you. As a result, most of her relationships with clients ripen into close friendships. "Life's too short not to work with someone you like." The majority of her business comes by referral or is repeat business.</p>
<p>Known for her honest, practical advice and for showing property that realistically suits her clients’ budgets and desires, Hazel's constant support and commitment to excellence ensure you get the results you desire. Her skilled negotiating and aggressive marketing are complemented by her innovative ideas. She offers knowledgeable counsel, British efficiency and a comforting English sense of humor that have established her as one of the most trusted real estate persons in Marin County.</p>
<p>Hazel founded the Afternoon Academy, a successful after-school program on the Tiburon peninsula and is active in the Marin Association of Realtors. Hazel was educated at the University of London and the Royal Academy.</p>

<p>Whore's egg is a slang term, used by fishermen or lobstermen, for a sea urchin. The expression is common in New England and the Canadian Maritime provinces.</p>
<p>These spiny creatures have a habit of getting into lobster traps or fishing nets, and they are painfully sharp, earning them a salty and unflattering nickname from the people who have to handle them.</p>
<p>Later they became quite commercially valuable on the Asian market, so they were a little less despised.</p>
<p>"Son of a whore's egg!" is a colorful waterfront epithet.</p>

<p>Logan Senjov, was born in 1987 to a small family of ravenous wolves/men, similar in hirichial structure to the cave men of the early 1800's. As a yound child, Logan was interedted in a range of phsydo-sport like activities, by which we mean sex with a range of wildlife, both flora and fauna. Physicists theorise that the "Big Bang" and extention of the smarter dinosaus was a direct result of Logan touching himself at night (your mother touches herself at night). To this day, logan touches himself at night, and has since destroyed the world trade centres, and caused my lack of facial hair.</p>

Residing in <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva.html" title="Geneva">Geneva</a>, <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois.html" title="Illinois">Illinois</a>, he is well known throughout the tri-cities area for his insatiable appetite for women and <a href="../../../f/u/n/Funk.html" title="Funk">funk</a>. While his lovelife in a nonstop parade of luscious women, Patrick still finds time to play in a funk band, a jazz band, a marching band, and a volunteer church band, playing primarily sax with the occasional bass clarinet. He plays soccer at the varsity level, and when not writing self-serving third person narratives, Patrick Riordan stands as the monumental epitome of good looks and bold masculinity.</p>
