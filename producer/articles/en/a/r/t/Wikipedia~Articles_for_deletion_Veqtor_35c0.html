<p>This was speedied under another title, prodded, and the proposed deletion tag removed by the creator with discussion (see talk page). He is making a good faith effort to help here (removing external links for example), and I appreciate that... but I hope he can understand the objections by at least 3 editors to his article.

<p><font color="#DD0000"><b>UPDATE</b></font> <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 8885860044</a> does exist. I apologize for the misleading information above. However, it was published in 1987, and is only held by 3 libraries. It is in Italian, and the title is <i>Progettare un parco&#160;: alcune idee per un parco ricreativo-tematico "made in Italy"</i> . Its subject category is <i>Amusement parks -- Italy -- Designs and plans</i>. I don't know if this affects notability or verifiability. Curiously, the book's publisher has no other listings in Worldcat, Firstsearch or Books in Print. Lexis/Nexis has a single mention as a maker of LaserTag equipment in an article about a new LaserTag arena in Louisiana. Factiva finds that VEQTOR exhibited at the 2003 IAAPA trade show. ProQuest finds a 1996 article about a LaserTag installation in Iceland, and a 1998 press release about a LaserTag facility in New Delhi. (Those by the way are the <i>only</i> hits in Factiva and Proquest, not a selected subset.) Various other databases find nothing. I change my vote from delete to <b>No vote</b>.

<dd>You'll notice I didn't vote keep. One problem is that the online Global Books in Print obviously doesn't go back far enough in its out-of-print listings. Maybe other searches suffer similarly; if the company was bigger in the 80's and early 90's there might not be a lot in online sources. Certainly the lack of current information could mean they are no longer notable, and certainly hampers verifiability. Having made the mistake about the existence of the book, I wanted to be extra careful and make sure I didn't miss anything else, so I went farther in depth than I have before.<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 03:45, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Mike, what elements of the article would you like rewritten? Do you have any other known uses of VEQTOR as a definition of clarification? Most users of wikipeida understand that wikipedia is a compendium of facts and descriptions related to words and concepts, spanning millions of subjects, old new and even theoretical speculation - AND no matter how obscure! What FACTS within this article need to be changed, enhanced, clarified? What items contained within this article are 'SPAM'? Over time I guess that many people will seek to add accurate modifications to this article - interested parties describe there experiences and associations with the subjects this article contains. Mike not all subjects on wikipedia are of interest to you (nor to me) but that does not mean that they are not of interest to others. I hope all voters on this subject will present POSITIVE criticism like Bucketsofg has demonstrated - wikipedians must use an honorable approach suggesting positive actions, rather than unsupported bias. --VEQTOR 19:11, 15 March 2006 (UTC)----

<li><b>Delete</b> advert, unsuitable for wikipedia as it stands.

<dd>So 'OscartheCat', I believe wikipedia is to contain facts not assumptions or suppositions. Both of your comments are just that - factless. I am the author of this article and you have given me no guide as to what you want to see added or deleted to improve this article. Without your positive input the goal of wikipedia is dead. YES, I have e-mailed a few collegues around the world and introduced them to wikipedia - some have take the time to try and learn to use wikipedia and I commend them. The fact is that most people of the world and casual internet users do NOT use, or even know about, wikipedia. The fact is I am not faking the vote.--VEQTOR 08:38, 20 March 2006 (UTC)
