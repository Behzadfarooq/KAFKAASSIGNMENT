<li><b>Delete</b> Non-notability, probably self-promotion. Can't find any links to his music and suspect "rave reviews" don't exist. "Known to be associated with" relatively unknown people doesn't mean anything.

Not self promotion. This article wasn't written by the subject. The motivation is expansion on the Ceephax Acid Crew article (notable Acid house producer) as he has acted in movies by Phil Thompson.

<li>Philie T is known to the IDM community (WATMM is a good example). He worked with people like Squarepusher and Ceephax as a filmmaker, and other Chelmsford artists included Cassette Boy. He'll never be in the top 100 music chart, because he's an underground artist, and he gives his art away for free on www.philiet.co.uk I don't believe for a second that wikipedia's hard drives will crash and burn by adding an article about an underground artist who is well known in IDM circles. This article is an expansion from the Ceephax Acid Crew article. Had to mention his starring in Philie T's films, Philie T is well known to the IDM community. Why not add an article about him? Because he's not Britney Spears or AC/DC. Pff. <a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoyrex_1fab.html" title="User:Joyrex">Joyrex</a> 15:24, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>He made films with famous artists from Warp Records. This is notable to the IDM community. Of course you and your granny never heard of Aphex Twin. <a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoyrex_1fab.html" title="User:Joyrex">Joyrex</a> 14:11, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Philie T's short films are among the best I have seen in recent years, and his work with Cassette Boy was outstanding. A vital and respected member of the underground IDM scene, his popularity will only grow. Keep your eye on him for sure. chaosmachine 14:27, August 19, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> until more information about this guy appears. "Philie T"+"Aphex Twin" garners a few google hits, all from either wiki mirrors or newsgroup posts by "Philie T" himself. He may be mad awesome, but the information in the article is currently 100% unverifiable. If we include him as someone garnering shoutouts from Aphex Twin, we will also have to include "Gentle John, Cylob Industries, Grant and Jen, Mike D, ...???...

<li><b>Abstain</b> (I haven't a clue about this fellow) but <b>comment</b>. For those who don't know: the VfD procedure theoretically involves the WikiPedia community taking a look at a page which may be borderline (clear deletes are marked as "speedy"), and voting on whether it should remain in an encyclopædia or not. As such, the votes of anonymous users who happened to breeze in, or fans of the subject of an article recruited to WikiPedia <b>solely</b> so that they can vote against its deletion, are naturally not considered as important as those of regular 'pedians. Indeed, the practice of rounding up one's friends and getting them to cast a vote on a website that otherwise holds no interest for them is considered quite rude; it's called "sock puppeteering", a term that originated on USENET, associated with fraudulent or anti-social behaviour. <b>That</b> is why all y'all new users haven't been greeted in the warmest of terms. That said, um ... welcome! I hope you stick around and make a greater contribution to this encyclopædia than a single, discountable vote. If you do, believe me, your opinion will start to matter at last. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> 17:28, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I asked forum.watmm.com to come here and comment. Easterlingman uses Wikipedia since before, and is a genuine guy. Chaosmachine is a seperate guy, but still classed as sockpuppet. Apologies for ruding Wikipedia from me. Sorry about that. I edited the article now to make it a bit better. Can't improve it much more myself. Philie T's notability comes from his link to Ceephax (by making films with him) and his high up friends in British <a href="../../../i/d/m/IDM_787a.html" title="IDM">IDM</a>. He will never be in the top 100 pop chart, because his ethic is to give away music for free in mp3. There is too much about sockpuppets now to change anyone's mind, but I will try and make the article again in the future (coupled of months), because I think the present edit is not so bad as the original, and it shows Philie T's link to Ceephax Acid Crew, which is my motivation for writing the article (expanding knowledge of Ceephax's career, and noting things from the IDM community. Thanks, and sorry for the sockpuppet, it was wrong to do that. <a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoyrex_1fab.html" title="User:Joyrex">Joyrex</a> 11:24, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
