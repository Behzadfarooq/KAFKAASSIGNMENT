<li><b>Keep</b>. Will wonders never cease? An article that Everyking thinks should be deleted and which I think should be kept! I normally don't add "me-too" keep votes. (Believe it or not, if I did, there would be quite a few.) But I cannot resist. Blogging has become a very significant phenomenon on the Internet, and Kottke won the Bloggie Lifetime Achievement Award in, IIRC, 2002, which is about as notable as you can get as a blogger. You can quibble about the Bloggies, since sometimes the results seem kind of stacked (kind of like Wikipedia), and some types of blogs, such as political blogs, are under-represented and under-appreciated, though they have a wider significance than blogs that receive a lot of Bloggie votes. But that doesn't prevent the Bloggies from being used as a strong, although not exclusive, indicator of the notability of bloggers. Having said that, it can't be true that the quote about the Mac is his most "famous" quote. It's a dorky quote and it is hard to believe that he hasn't said anything more interesting than that to win the Bloggie. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 01:12, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As best I can tell, all this guy is "notable" for—and I have a very liberal interpretation of notability—is winning some award that sounds like an honor roughly equivalent to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Montgomery_Burns_Award_for_Outstanding_Achievement_in_the_Field_of_Excellence_6b82.html" title="The Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence">The Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence</a>, and he designed some font or some such thing. And some trolls quote him saying something incomprehensible. What? We delete articles less notable than that every other day. It actually seems like there's an exception being made here for "nerdcruft", which doesn't seem terribly fair to me. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:46, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>There is some similarity between the paniq case and this one, which I thought about when I voted. There is the hazard of narcisism for Wikipedia to have articles about Internet phenomena, I would agree. However, blogging is a much bigger Internet phenom than the demoscene, and Kottke has more clearly established himself as notable within it than paniq has within the demoscene. But I'm impressed that you are paying attention. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:48, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li>Since you spoke up again, Everyking: I'm dumbfounded. I hate to bring the Ashlee Simpson thing into this, but it's hard to ignore the hypocrisy of your statements. You're writing off the blog community as "nerdcruft". It's hard not to notice the similarities between your argument, and the mindset which you've railed against for wanting to scale down the Ashlee Simpson coverage. Kottke is without a doubt significant in the weblog community, and Simpson is an unquestionably notable in pop music. Well, you're accusing the blog community itself of being insignificant and using that as an excuse to delete an article about a notable blogger. Hey, does that type of closed-minded bias remind you of anything? Such as people who argue that pop singers are inherently less notable than classic rock acts? <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 21:16, Feb 8, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The difference, of course, is the number of people affected. How many people read this guy's blog, or consider his work significant? If it's more than a few thousand, I'll vote keep. But my suspicion is that the number is pretty damn small, and he's receiving magnified attention due to the general tendency of Wikipedia's contributors to be especially interested in topics relating to technology and computers. Ashlee and her music, on the other hand, are known and important to <i>millions</i>, so I see little grounds for comparison. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:48, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I can't find a more authoritative number, but his Alexa trafic rank is 23,502. This isn't some guy with a blog, it's some guy with a reallly popular blog. If it were any other sort of web site, people would be all over it with keep votes due to Alexa's number alone. -- <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrius_3685.html" title="User:Cyrius">Cyrius</a>|<a href="../../../c/y/r/User_talk%7ECyrius_ef50.html" title="User talk:Cyrius">✎</a> 13:21, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. As someone who formerly had root on his webserver, I can speak from experience about the levels of traffic reaching kottke.org. I'm not sure Jason would care for me divulging specifics, but his hit counts are into the millions per month and there are over 100k unique IPs hitting the site every month. I believe the blogging community is a significant modern sociological phenomenon and within that community Kottke is one of the major players. He carries something akin to celebrity status within the weblog community, and the intersection between Wikipedia usership and weblog audiences is significant. <a href="../../../m/o/u/User%7EMouser_e7c2.html" title="User:Mouser">Mouser</a> 18:27, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
