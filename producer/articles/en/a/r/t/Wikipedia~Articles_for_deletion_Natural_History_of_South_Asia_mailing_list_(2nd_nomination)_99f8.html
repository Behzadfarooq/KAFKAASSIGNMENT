<p>The result was <b>keep/no consensus</b> Opinion is certainly split. On the one hand, per trialsanderrors, there are claims of importance made, presented neutrally, and attributed. The counterargument to this seems to be failure to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. There are assertions made here that aren't well-countered that this is more than a mere mailing list, so <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> may not apply. I put "keep" first because I think the keep arguments are the stronger here, but there <i>certainly</i> is not a consensus strong enough to delete this article. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 17:15, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Addendum: The claim of notability isn't backed up. Per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, <i>Trivial coverage, such as (1) newspaper articles that simply report the internet address, (2) newspaper articles that simply report the times at which such content is updated or made available, (3) a brief summary of the nature of the content or the publication of internet addresses and site or (4) content descriptions in internet directories or online stores.</i>. So, mere mention of the mailing list or inclusion on a list of "things related to India" is not a justification of notability (most of the "references" to the mailing list seem to just mention this trivially). --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 23:17, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Has ANY academic publications made <b>non-trivial</b> mentions, discussions of this mailing list? Thousands of mailing lists are reported trivially in research papers -- those one-line mentions do not make them notable. The article claims it has been mentioned by academic journals - yet a look into those "references" show no more than a single line mention of the list, most likely under the "links" sections.</li>
<li>Several links/references in the article appear to be to fraudelent, pointing to nameless webservers rather than the organizations they are supposed to be. For example, a reference "Department of Entomology, American Museum of Natural History, New York, USA", points to a server hosted at 144.16.65.194 <a href="http://144.16.65.194/" class="external autonumber" title="http://144.16.65.194/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (which is an Indian organisation), the reference 9 therefore points to <a href="http://144.16.65.194/hpg/envis/doc97html/wwwnh.html" class="external text" title="http://144.16.65.194/hpg/envis/doc97html/wwwnh.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> rather than an actual website of the American Museum of Natural History. The page too seems to be a list of links from an email archive. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 23:28, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The "claim" that the Journal "Indian Birds" cite it is also dubious ... my search of the reference (8) shows a single link "NAT-HISTORY INDIA: vivek@ee.princeton.edu" (sic) to the name ... without even a one-liner mention!! --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 23:30, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>For those interested in the natural history of the Indian subcontinent (Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and other neighboring countries) there is a subscription electronic bulletin board called, "NATHISTORY-INDIA". This bulletin board contains information about happenings, crises, news events, information requests, etc. It is a must list to be on if you are working on the Indian subcontinent. To subscribe send a request to vivek@EE.Princeton.EDU and he will sign you up.</i></dd>
<dd>Such trivial mentions are made to thousands and thousands of mailing lists, but that isn't really a "cited by journal", and hence the claim is dubious. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 23:33, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Under the circumstances of this fake "citations"/"Evidence of notability", I request people who has been misled by this to reconsider their votes and check the claims themselves to decide whether this mailing list is at all as notable as it claims to be.

<li><b>RESTORE / DO NOT DELETE / KEEP:</b> This article is about something more then a mailing list, it is often referred to as the <b>"NATURAL HISTORY NETWORK"</b> of India or South Asia, it also serves as WILDERNESS TELEGRAM SYSTEM of sorts, the subject of this article has become an <a href="../../../n/g/o/NGO_9dc2.html" title="NGO">NGO</a> in itself helping its members many of whom are grassroots workers in the fields of Nature &amp; Wildlife Conservation, students, scientists, prominent members of other NGOs, many "News Makers" in these field report directly to the NETWORK, simultaneously or before commercial news channels report on the matter, discoveries, poaching, habitat encroachments, proposed government protected area notifications and the unfortunate de-notifications, illegal wildlife trade observed, wildlife trade seizures, Endangered Tiger &amp; Panther etc. etc. bone and skin seizures, proposed government policy changes affecting the environment before they come into effect, proposed dams which will submerge large chunks of the last remaining pristine forests etc are just a few things reported and debated by this NETWORK many a times bringing corrective action in time. This is a list dealing with issues faced by Indian Naturalists, conservationists, and NGOs who network on it thankfully, including members of related Government institutions, IT CAN ONLY BE COMPARED WITH OTHER LISTS OF THE REGION dealing with similar issues and it stands head and shoulders above the rest, most of the top people in the field in the region are subscribers or know of its reputability. It is a notable achievement in India in its field, please understand that before taking the argument around the world comparing ORANGES with APPLES i.e. with just other sundry mailing lists.

<li><strike><b>Keep</b></strike>: There really should be better defined policies and guidelines. The current notability criteria should, if interpreted fairly result in no email discussion group and only a few websites as articles. Books about websites are perhaps very few. This is also an example of systemic bias, since there are more Linux enthusiasts around than naturalists and this would ensure that the article on <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux_kernel_mailing_list.html" title="Linux kernel mailing list">Linux kernel mailing list</a> gets voted as popular and thereby "notable". The earlier deletion debate suggested <a href="../../../l/i/n/LinuxChix_c14c.html" title="LinuxChix">LinuxChix</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/y/FlyLady_29da.html" title="FlyLady">FlyLady</a> as notable because the founder/list was mentioned in a couple of magazines, while it has been argued that postings on this list have been cited in newspaper articles, but the list itself has not been the subject of any books/secondary sources. In the absence of a clear policy that takes the personal interpretations out and avoids systemic biases, I vote <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../s/h/y/User%7EShyamal_ed48.html" title="User:Shyamal">Shyamal</a> 01:39, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>We <i>have</i> clear guidelines that take the personal interpretations out and that avoid systemic biases. You're explicitly choosing to not follow them, for entirely fallacious reasons. If you want to learn the fallacy of "Books about websites are perhaps very few.", please visit a good quality bookshop, where you will find quite a few books that document web sites. Ironically, it is your argument above that exhibits bias and personal interpretation, boiling down as it does to "I doubt that sources exist for mailing lists and web sites, but I personally like this one and want to include it anyway.". I suggest that you actually base your arguments upon finding and citing sources, rather than your personal biases. (It's surprising what is documented. One simply has to pull one's finger out and look.) Sources are good arguments here at Wikipedia. "I like it." is not. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:05, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comments</b> nothing much to say and no longer interested in debating this in isolation. The debate has two parts (1) Mailing lists - can they ever be encylopaedia worthy&#160;? If that is so, then we need to re-look at (2) Notability criteria for mailing lists. As it stands from a basic reading - ALL items without exception in <a href="../../../m/a/i/Category%7EMailing_lists_cfaa.html" title="Category:Mailing lists">Category:Mailing lists</a> should be deleted. Software for running mailing lists should be under something like mailing list software or <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_software.html" title="Social software">Social software</a> or such like.

<li><b>Comment</b> I sympathize with your views on the notability of <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux_Kernel_Mailing_List_566e.html" title="Linux Kernel Mailing List">Linux Kernel Mailing List</a> and note that you have taken significant interest in protecting it from the AfD and finding "proof" of notability. I am unable to find any mention of a "book with a chapter about the mailing list". An amazon review merely adds a keyword. Many items of the article are merely making use of pointers to the Linux Kernel which <b>is</b> definitely notable. Other trivia such as the information about the logo of Linux being decided is questionable given that wired magazine has serious doubts about the author.<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,42209,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,42209,00.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> The Kernel Traffic newsletter is no longer maintained but that makes a "reliable secondary" source. To you the statement that the list is a "bazaar" makes it notable. If popularity and numbers make it notable, then so be it. But then admins cite the guidelines only when it is in your favour.

And someone lower down has exemplified systemic bias by pointing out that this is a narrow subject dealt with in one (unknown I suppose) country. I understand that the new breed of admins are trying to make wikipedia into another Encyclopaedia Brittanica. Remember that all these arguments would have ensured the absence of very useful articles of the <a href="../../../t/o/i/Toilets_in_Japan_7bbe.html" title="Toilets in Japan">kind</a> that set wikipedia apart. I understand that each admin has their own subject of special interest and knowledge, but that doesn't entitle anyone to belittle other topics. Remember also that unlike programmers, there are people in other disciplines who are not spending time blogging, making websites <i>etc.</i> and creating a whole load of google hits. I hope you understand that you are ultimately making a subjective decision. To make it you do need to have some feel for the subject in question. If it is truly objective, which is unlikely, then there should be no selective amnesia about WP:guidelines and policies. <a href="../../../s/h/y/User%7EShyamal_ed48.html" title="User:Shyamal">Shyamal</a> 01:49, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete and merge</b>&#160;: Since all this is leading to nothing constructive may I suggest here something that is hopefully a win-win situation. The information here can go into the article on history of conservation in India (yet to be created, but already proposed at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Protected_areas_of_India_Checklist_92cb.html#History_of_Conservation_in_India" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Protected areas of India/Checklist">WP:PAI</a>). The content here can come into a section on the role of the Internet in conservation. I suppose it is finally the information that matters, not the existence of the article in a particular form and hopefully a topic like the history of conservation in India will not be considered a non-encyclopaedic subject by the kind folks here.

<dd>Hi Atul, from what I can see the article on nathistory India cannot possibly ever make for encyclopaedic content. However there is a way to incorporate and highlight the role of the group and the ideal place would be to place it within the History of conservation in India article as a section on the contribution of the Internet era. Hope this is fine with you. Cheers. <a href="../../../s/h/y/User%7EShyamal_ed48.html" title="User:Shyamal">Shyamal</a> 11:11, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Hi Shyamal, You are welcome to change your Vote&#160;:), but it is only one vote, there is no need to panic, you might want to save a work copy of the article though in case it is deleted and hidden again. As for me I believe it is encyclopedic, I will like the article to stay as it is. But you have a very very good point, you can also always do what you propose above, great and a fitting idea in itself. So I suggest NO Delete And Merge, <b>Keep</b> the article as it is, yet have a section on the contribution of the list in other major conservation articles on India and elsewhere. Exactly as you say it should be also mentioned in the Contributions of the Internet Era to the Natural History and the Conservation of the region. As for me I firmly believe it is encyclopedic in itself to have a article on this <b>South Asian Natural History Network</b>.

The assertion that it's "something more then a mailing list", "Natural History Network of South Asia", "Wilderness Telegram System" is entirely based on perception of the editor (apparently, the creator of the mailing list mentions himself as "<a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=%22Vivek+Tiwari%2C+Coordinator%2C+South+Asian+Natural+History+Network%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=%22Vivek+Tiwari%2C+Coordinator%2C+South+Asian+Natural+History+Network%22" rel="nofollow">Co-oridinator, South Asian Natural History Network</a>" in endorsement of a book). <a href="../../../s/h/y/User%7EShyamal_ed48.html" title="User:Shyamal">Shyamal</a>'s assumption that the article on <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux_kernel_mailing_list.html" title="Linux kernel mailing list">LKML</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/n/LinuxChix_c14c.html" title="LinuxChix">LinuxChix</a> exist because of "systemic bias" or lobbying by Linux users is flawed.

<li><b>Comment</b> As pointed in comments above. If prediction of an earthquake on the list, report of a new species, references to the list on journals and newsletters and newspapers is not enough for notability, fine with me.

<li>Mailing lists of this sort are very important in the academic world generally. All small groups of scholars use them, and they have ben as important means of scientific communication since Usenet days. The size of a particular list is irrelevant--what is necessary is that the list be notable in its own field. Its own field is the study of the subject it covers. What is necessary is that it be a principle method of communication for the specialists in the subject.</li>
<li>This is demonstrated by the use made of it, and the references made to it.</li>
<li>It is time for WP to recognize the conventions of the medium which is the substrate for its own existence. The people who work find references to the (virtual) places at which they want to work on the web, They do not find them in printed books or journals; they do not even find them in on-line journals. They learn about them from their use by other comparable web places. The distinctive characteristics of most of these places is that their editorial control is relatively weak but not non-existent. Usually it's there. almost all serious mailing lists have a moderator (In this instance it's Vivek Tiwari. Most are published from a major academic institution. In this case it's Princeton. Usually the good one have established their reputation with time. This one has been going for 12 years now.</li>
<li>How do we judge whether they should have articles on WP? The same basic way as anything else, RSs, the presence of encyclopedic content, and some indicators of importance. The sort of indicators we use for other media are such things as number of books an author has published and where he has published them, number of recordings a musician has produced, and so on. We look for number of users--considering the size of the subject, the almost 1000 members is very respectable. We look for the importance of contributions to it (some have been demonstrated). We look for references and recommendations to it in other sources (some have been demonstrated). <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 20:49, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Like Shyamal has suggested, the article content can be incorporated in a new article (probably Natural History of South Asia).

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Two things. First, I would feel more comfortable if you maintained a user page. The idea of the red link to nowhere is disconcerting. Second, it is the Natural History of South Asia that is encyclopedic; not the mailing list addressing same.
