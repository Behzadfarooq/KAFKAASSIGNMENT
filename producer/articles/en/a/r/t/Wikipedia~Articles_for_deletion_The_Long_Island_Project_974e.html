<p>Only 183 google hits for "The Long Island Project" + film and only a few of those hits are about a film of that title.

<li><b>Comment:</b> The film is independently produced on a small budget. As with the producer's previous movies the film has failed to go mainstream, yet is important and highly revered in limited regions. The expectations for video sales and rentals are projected to surpass ticket sales. The film has yet to have its worldwide release, yet it is already coveted by fans of the director and actors and those who have been lucky enough to have an early screening. Modern cult classic is an oxymoron and is used to describe a movie's expectations rather than its current standing. Those who want to delete this movie's listing because they haven't heard of it are being bias. A majority of artists are not famous while they are creating their art; only mainstream blasé is. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadebro_9b9a.html" title="User:Cadebro">Cadebro</a> 10:36, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. This movie may become a cult classic loved by millions. It may land with a thud and be quickly forgotten by the few hundred who see it. No way to know. Wikipedia does not list people or things which <u>may</u> become popular. If in fact it does become notable, the article can be freely recreated at that time. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 14:21, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
