<p>This is a well-written article, but what damns it <i>prima facie</i> is the opening sentence: <b>The "Jesuit Ivy" is a nickname given to <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_ba3b.html" title="Boston College">Boston College</a> in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.</b> So, basically, this article is about an institution's nickname. Can you imagine anyone writing a "Penn State" article this size, just because it happes to be the nickname of <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania_State_University_be4e.html" title="Pennsylvania State University">Pennsylvania State University</a>? This smacks of academic boosterism (<a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_academic_boosterism_a43b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid academic boosterism">which is not welcome on Wikipedia</a>); surely no one's contributed a thing to this article aside from BC students and affiliates. What makes it an even graver crime than <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Ivies_3c38.html" title="Southern Ivies">Southern Ivies</a> or <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Ivies_e052.html" title="Public Ivies">Public Ivies</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Ivies_fe2e.html" title="Little Ivies">Little Ivies</a> or <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joke.html" title="Joke">Bakersfield, California-area Ivies</a> is that it's <b>just a nickname for an institution with a separate article on Wikipedia</b>. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarryEyes_74d0.html" title="User:StarryEyes"><font color="#FF0000">Starry</font></a><a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStarryEyes_a831.html" title="User talk:StarryEyes"><font color="#0000FF">Eyes</font></a> 02:53, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge usable content</b> per porges, but <b>no redirect</b>. I agree with everything you say, Starry, but there is <i>some</i> worthwhile and objective content here. We have to get rid of the "nickname page", though. This is like having separate articles for <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_DiMaggio_29be.html" title="Joe DiMaggio">Joe DiMaggio</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/l/Joltin%27_Joe_d06e.html" title="Joltin' Joe">Joltin' Joe</a>. And as for a redirect, it'd be lending credence to said boosters. After all, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22JESUIT+IVY%22+-wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22JESUIT+IVY%22+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">"Jesuit Ivy" -wikipedia</a> garners a whopping 111 hits on Google. <a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERaggaga_12ad.html" title="User:Raggaga">Raggaga</a> 03:12, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> anything useful with <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_ba3b.html" title="Boston College">Boston College</a>.

<ul>
<li>A note to the nom - probably would've been better to start a discussion on the talk page rather than propose scrapping the article in its entirety, as you said yourself it is a well-written article and I'd be hard-pressed to eliminate any of it when merged onto the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_ba3b.html" title="Boston College">Boston College</a> article, as there is no blantant academic boosterism, as you label it. Perhaps next time, try to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>. Plus, your Penn State comparison is a bit off, as there is a story behind the name "Jesuit Ivy". Had there been a separate article entitled "BC", your comparison would've been right on point. <font color="green">Hoopydink</font> 09:06, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There's a story behind lots of nicknames. We don't have separate articles for <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Manson_e590.html" title="Marilyn Manson">Marilyn Manson</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Warner_de66.html" title="Brian Warner">Brian Warner</a>, do we? No blatant boosterism? Calling youself <i>the X Ivy</i>, as the nom alludes to, is booster pratice number one. Also, while I'm not assuming bad faith, I do notice a predominance of Boston-related edits, Mr. H, particularly for a certain <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_High_School_9ac2.html" title="Boston College High School">Boston College High School</a>. <a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERaggaga_12ad.html" title="User:Raggaga">Raggaga</a> 18:51, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I believe that the proper comparison to BC being called a Jesuit Ivy would be <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_U_dd6b.html" title="The U">The U</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_University_of_Miami_a31b.html" title="The University of Miami">The University of Miami</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_U_dd6b.html" title="The U">The U</a> is a disambig page which leads to an article describing the story behind the nickname that has been conferred to the University of Miami. Since <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_ba3b.html" title="Boston College">Boston College</a> or the insular community did not create the name, but rather an outside source (<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_9798.html" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>), there is no boosterism. The article does provide reasoning behind the name. If there's a bias or err in judgement on my part being suggested, I'd refer you to the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_High_School_9ac2.html" title="Boston College High School">Boston College High School</a> article in question, as I'm probably the primary editor and take a look. You'll see that there are no <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html" title="Weasel words">weasel words</a> or boosterism. It's written in respects to the NPOV policy (much like the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesuit_Ivy_7d0c.html" title="Jesuit Ivy">Jesuit Ivy</a> article). Also, if you do check it out, why not stay a while and edit it a bit? <font color="green">Hoopydink</font> 04:05, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_ba3b.html" title="Boston College">Boston College</a>, keep it as a redirect. Its just a nickname of that place, what's the big deal? A mention in the main article is enough. --<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_Ong_4371.html" title="User:Terence Ong">Ter</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_Ong_4371.html" title="User:Terence Ong">nc</a><a href="../../../t/e/r/User_talk%7ETerence_Ong_215c.html" title="User talk:Terence Ong">e Ong</a> 11:36, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Aye, but it's not a <i>real</i> nickname. It's entirely self-styled. If someone wrote an article called The Best College in America and it was all about Boston College but it had some usable content, I would happily merge, but I'd be loath to redirect. Boosterism must not be countenanced. <a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERaggaga_12ad.html" title="User:Raggaga">Raggaga</a> 19:14, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It is not "self-styled" as you claim. This is pretty clearly stated in the article. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroitet_2326.html" title="User:Droitet">Droitet</a> 15:37, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> -Since this is not just a name for the college but of JFK's <i>actual speech</i>. I also think its significance goes further than BC, so it would be wrong to jsut merge it to the BC article. The Jesuit Ivy speech was an important turning point, addressing the status of Catholics in public life, Church-State politics (and Kennedy's own future as the first Catholic US president), the role of Catholic universities and their position relative to American higher education. Perhaps these issues, which are touched on in the present article, should be made more explicit. 216.236.252.235 18:09, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I think it should be kept as a separate article since it's the name of the speech itself. Also the nominator's objection that it's academic boosterism doesnt really hold here. It's not like BC woke up and decided to call *itself* the "Jesuit Ivy." Kennedy did. --<a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESader07_1261.html" title="User:Sader07">Sader07</a> 06:07, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I think the boosterism problem is not so much in the actual nickname, but with having that nickname as a separate entry. Redirecting it and mentioning Kennedy's speech in its proper historical context in the BC entry would be just fine. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 06:25, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and add more context here. Most of this article would be pretty tangential in an article about Boston College itself. 216.227.122.37 05:03, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> The <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_ba3b.html" title="Boston College">Boston College</a> article is already too long and should probably be broken down into sub articles. -136.167.255.119 03:11, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as per above... Also, adding a section in the BC article about specifically this nickname wouldn't really make sense in the main BC article. The speech is notable for BC and warrants a mention in the main article, but not as long of a mention as the Jesuit Ivy article is. The information in the Jesuit Ivy article is worthy to be kept in Wikipedia and doesn't belong in the main BC article; thus, it should be kept in a separate article. Moreover the article is very well written and it would be a shame to lose all that hard work. Also, many things would need to be removed such as the wikisource link and the excerpt from the actual speech. <a href="../../../p/s/a/User%7EPsantora_c464.html" title="User:Psantora">Paul</a><small><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Psantora_252c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Psantora">C</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../p/s/a/User_talk%7EPsantora_c626.html" title="User talk:Psantora">T</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Psantora&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Psantora&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">+</a></sub></small> 07:51, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> Doesn't warrant its own article. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 22:00, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This "nickname" doesn't have any significance outside of the conext of the speech, which in turn is too detailed/tangential for the necissary elaboration in the Boston college article. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvincoli_5bd2.html" title="User:Invincoli">Invincoli</a> 00:57, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The reasons for deleting this article (that it's just a nickname, that it's boosterism, and that it's self-styled) appear to have been misguided/misinformed. The reason for merging it (again that it's just a nickname) is inaccurate/inappropriate. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroitet_2326.html" title="User:Droitet">Droitet</a> 15:29, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per above. "Jesuit Ivy" has more historical legitimacy than <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Ivies_fe2e.html" title="Little Ivies">Little Ivies</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Ivies_3c38.html" title="Southern Ivies">Southern Ivies</a>, etc. and should be explained in its own article. 140.247.241.128 18:55, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
