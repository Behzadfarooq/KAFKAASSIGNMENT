<p>IP-removed Prod, based on the fallacious argument that simply by existing a school is an "acceptable article".

<li>The requirement for non-trivial independent sources is not addressed particularly well in that argument (which I must say beats the socks off any other school-inclusionist argument I've ever come across), and it remains an issue here. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 02:24, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>A even bolder argument has been asserted when needed, that all schools regardless of grade level are notable. . It is just barely possible that most high schools might be notable if serious effort went into developing an article and finding sources. But this is not one of them.</li>

<li>Precisely my point. Schools as an entire category always turn into semi-controversial deletions, so speedying them is never the best option. I wonder idly if the Speedy policy should actually be edited in order to say just that. Something along the lines of "If articles like this always generate debates when they're listed for deletion, don't put a CSD tag on it". <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 09:38, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Bsf is quite right - there is no consensus and the evidence adduced above - e.g. winning state championships - is an arbitrary measure of notability derived almost exclusively by people who think high schools are inherently notable anyway and thus have found whatever flimsy rationale they can as a means of justifying a position they would take regardless. That is not to say that those who wish to keep every high school article should not be able to justify their position, but it does mean that the raft of policy-waving that tends to accompany these discussions (I have showed you reliable, verifiable, etc... sources) is misplaced since, as with Alan's point above, it refers to events that do nothing to make a case for the notability of what is, after all, just a high school. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 09:38, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply:</b> Unfortunately, despite the rather long-winded diatribe above, all you are stating is that the school is <a href="../../../j/n/n/WP%7EJNN_e132.html" title="WP:JNN">just not notable</a>, a fairly basic argument to avoid in the AfD process. While I have made an effort to improve the article, you put yourself in a position of arbitrarily deciding thumbs down on this article. Not only do you not bother to reference any Wikipedia policy that would require deletion of the article, you actually criticize my efforts to address such policy issues as a "raft of policy-waving". Is there anything that will satisfy your standards? Do you have any? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 19:58, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Alan, it's very simple. All schools default to being non-notable and therefore do not deserve inclusion in an encyclopedia. Reaching for this or that reason to explain notability simply fails to convince me. Two years ago editors like Tony and Nicodemus were running around dragging up every notable alum in a desperate bid to do much the same as you are doing not to mention frothing on about policy this and policy that - so there's nothing new here, just a fundamental disagreement on what merits inclusion. I still say, despite dual freq's discovery of a newspaper article or two, delete this cruft and I recognise that you will disagree with me. So leave it at that. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 10:05, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is very simple. We have policies. When there are issues as to whether articles need to be deleted, we refer to these policies. With a lot of words, you are still stating that this article must be deleted, simply because you have arbitrarily decided that it's <a href="../../../j/n/n/WP%7EJNN_e132.html" title="WP:JNN">just not notable</a>. In your lengthy Wikipedia career, which consists almost exclusively of passing judgment on AfDs, you have used variations of the patently invalid <a href="../../../j/n/n/WP%7EJNN_e132.html" title="WP:JNN">just not notable</a> as an excuse to demand deletion of every single other school article AfD you have ever participated. If you want your vote to have any measure of validity, you need to start addressing specific articles and specifying why the specific article fails relevant Wikipedia policy. It's not that you disagree with me; the problem is that you refuse to follow Wikipedia policy as developed by our entire Wikipedia community. Until then, your vote is completely and utterly invalid. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 11:21, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

People go to high school to get a diploma to go on to college to get a degree and then, hopefully, become notable. =) And please, don't get me started on middle school articles. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetsFan76_ea64.html" title="User:MetsFan76">MetsFan76</a> 03:48, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Based on that argument, we should delete the college articles too. They are all just non-notable educational institutions. --<a href="../../../d/u/a/User%7EDual_Freq_ca05.html" title="User:Dual Freq">Dual Freq</a> 11:28, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not necessarily (and sorry to pre-empt MetsFan if this was precisely the argument s/he was going to make). Colleges/Universities can achieve notability by having important scholars working at them, having research institutions based at them and so forth. I wouldn't go as far as MetsFan by saying that <i>all</i> high schools are non-notable (I've defended ones in the past simply because they have notable alumni), but it's easier for a tertiary institution to be notable than it is for a secondary one to be so. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:57, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Dual Freq, most colleges are notable per the reason BigHaz has eloquently stated. My issue is that I'm not quite sure what makes a middle school/high school notable. Is it because a famous person attended there? If that's the case, and if that's the only thing the school has going for them, then how is it notable? Maybe I jumped the gun by saying all high/middle schools should be deleted as there are some that are indeed exemplary, but having articles are every school in America (I think I saw an elementary school article) is just too much. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetsFan76_ea64.html" title="User:MetsFan76">MetsFan76</a> 12:34, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b>, The artificial wetland portion seems to have been widely reported in 2001 as well, from Lexis Nexis I see transcripts of Milwaukee channel 6 news reports about it, several Milwaukee State Journal articles mentioning it and at least one dedicated to it ("School's experimental sewage treatment plant is a growing success", July 7, 2002, News page 01B, 953 words and another "Windmill to pump air into sewage", August 2, 2002, News page 03B, 406 words). There is also a July 30, 2001, 402 word Associated Press news wire report about the wetland the school was constructing. Apparently they are fairly rare in the northern USA and all are considered experimental with the state of Wisconsin gathering efficiency data on them for wider usage. Another MSJ article from 1996 prior to the artificial wetland, "Marsh madness: School makes land a living lab", October 17, 1995, 506 words and 3 photos about the adjacent Wisconsin DNR wetlands being used as an outdoor classroom. There is also an article about Staff Sgt. Timothy La Sage, a 1993 graduate, who was wounded in Iraq, but I suppose many schools could say that. Also a short blurb from, 1997 about a graduate named Dawn Plitzuweit, two-time NCAA Division II All-American at Michigan Tech, UW assistant basketball coach and mentioned in <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Valley_State_University_d16e.html" title="Grand Valley State University">Grand Valley State University</a>. That's pretty much it. --<a href="../../../d/u/a/User%7EDual_Freq_ca05.html" title="User:Dual Freq">Dual Freq</a> 23:35, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Those are all great things in regards to the school, however, I still fail to see why middle schools and high schools need articles. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetsFan76_ea64.html" title="User:MetsFan76">MetsFan76</a> 23:49, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I fail to see why fictional tv, comic book or movie characters from single episodes / issues need articles, but they are here. I see so much cruft here, but this is a real institution, real students, real teachers, real building, etc. I have no personal knowledge of this particular school, but I hesitant to delete one school when there are so many others listed and no clear policy for or against schools in general. --<a href="../../../d/u/a/User%7EDual_Freq_ca05.html" title="User:Dual Freq">Dual Freq</a> 23:56, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Oh don't get me wrong. I completely agree with you. There are tons of cruft on here that should definitely be deleted. My issue here is that I am always seeing school articles up for deletion almost every other day. There must be something there if that's the case. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetsFan76_ea64.html" title="User:MetsFan76">MetsFan76</a> 23:59, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is that it's not up to you. All we've heard so far as your justification for deletion is that you're "not quite sure what makes a middle school/high school notable". I can't speak for all the other "cruft" out there, but this article makes specific claims of notability and provides several <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources to support the claim. Unless you can offer us something other than your own arbitrary personal distaste for such articles, you don't seem to have much justification for deletion. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 00:15, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Alan, I don't really appreciate your tone. This has been a civil conversation between myself and Dual Freq. Obviously, you are more than welcome to join in, but please do it in a more mature fashion. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetsFan76_ea64.html" title="User:MetsFan76">MetsFan76</a> 00:20, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Your statement that this article should be deleted together "with the rest of the other entries for all other schools on here." is rather unproductive. This is simply not the place to address notability of every single middle school and high school article, nor is this a legitimate reason to support your delete vote. We still haven't heard any justification for your delete vote that addresses this specific article in any fashion. Again, what Wikipedia policy mandates deletion of this specific article? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 00:52, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It is my vote and I am entitled to it. You may not agree with it but you should respect it. After briefly going through your contributions, I noticed that whenever someone votes to delete a school article, you automatically get in their face. Who has the personal bias here? Considering that you are not far removed from a serious 3RR block, I would advise you to watch your tone. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetsFan76_ea64.html" title="User:MetsFan76">MetsFan76</a> 00:58, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As I look through my edit history, I see thousands of efforts aimed at improving school articles, adding the sources needed to further demonstrate notability for each and every one of these schools. You're entitled to vote as long as you provide a justification. So far, you haven't. Get past the idle threats and start referencing this article, pro or con. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 01:07, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Why do you find the need to provoke me? Like I said, I am entitled to my vote. Not everyone is going to agree with you. Get past your childish behavior and deal with it. I am done discussing this with you as it is neither productive nor mentally stimulating. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetsFan76_ea64.html" title="User:MetsFan76">MetsFan76</a> 01:11, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia operates by policies developed on the basis of consensus. You are entitled to a vote only if it comes with a valid explanation. I encourage you to review <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> and to reach an understanding of the obligation that comes with your vote to reference specific Wikipedia policies as they relate to the specific article.

<li><b>Keep.</b> It's really pointless to continue to try to delete High School articles on principle. High Schools are at least a local landmark, worthy of mention under their community article--<a href="../../../o/u/t/WP%7EOUTCOMES_7791.html" title="WP:OUTCOMES">all communities are notable</a>. In North America, <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_District_f005.html" title="School District">School Districts</a> are also notable as distinct geo-political divisions, and public High School articles can be merged to the school district article if there is insufficient content to establish notability. So what to do with the High School articles is an editorial decision based on content. Either way, the article remains, either with content, or as a redirect. As this school is a religious school, it should be treated similarly to public schools to avoid bias. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 00:02, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, the article firmly demonstrates the notability of the subject and meets our <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a> requirements as well. <a href="../../../b/b/x/User%7EBbx_da7b.html" title="User:Bbx">bbx</a> 05:03, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
