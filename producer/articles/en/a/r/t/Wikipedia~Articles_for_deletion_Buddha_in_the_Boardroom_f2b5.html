<li><b>Comment</b> the award that this book/the authors have received is from a fairly non-notable body, as far as I can tell, and even the ad/article doesn't claim that Eker was involved in writing the book, he just has some sort of hand in selling/marketing it. To accuse Fan of racism is just ridiculous.

<li><b>Comment</b> Although the author may be notable, it is arguable whether every single pieces of his work is notable by association.

<li><b>Comment</b> We seem to be losing focus here. If a heretofore undiscovered book by Buddha himself were presented as an advertising blurb as this one is, the article would have to be modified or deleted.

<li><b>Comments</b> Let's take a few points in order: (1) As far as "tens of thousands" of entries, I find <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=Buddha+in+the+Boardroom" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=Buddha+in+the+Boardroom" rel="nofollow">639 total, about 50 unique</a>. (2) I can't find any source that associates the book in any way with Robbins or Ziglar, so I have to wonder what that claim is based on. (3) It did not win "Book of the Year" as claimed. Writers Digest gave the book one of five <i>Honorable Mentions</i> in the category of self-published inspirational books. A book called <i>Letters to Luke</i> actually won in that category <a href="http://www.writersdigest.com/contests/self_pub_insp05.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.writersdigest.com/contests/self_pub_insp05.asp" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. (4) Of the other claims above, the only one I can verify is Hippo Press, a free weekly paper in Nashua. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 20:21, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Additional Comment</b> As I review this more It seems the people who want to delete argue "it's <b>only</b> listed at Barnes and Noble", It's <b>only</b> mentioned in this publication or that, It's <b>only</b> got 690 google references, it's <b>only</b> reviewed by this paper, the telegraph <b>only</b> mentions it for a writers signing at barnes and noble, it's <b>only</b> listed as a third party available on Amazon.. All these <b>onlys</b> add up to a pretty notable work. Far more notable than alot of entries on this site. You better carefully consider your actions as it is probable the next entry you add here will <b>only</b> be half as notable. It seems that the originator didn't realize the merit of this work but mistakes can be forgiven.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.61.91.82 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.61.91.82.html" title="User talk:24.61.91.82">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.61.91.82_7913.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.61.91.82">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> One of the attempts to alter existing comments last night came from 24.61.91.82, the same IP address as the above "Additional Comment". This sock puppet is clearly getting desperate. <a href="../../../g/m/c/User%7EGMcGath_2e3b.html" title="User:GMcGath">GMcGath</a> 10:05, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Realistically, it doesn't matter anyway. We have a vanity-published book, listed but not stocked by the major booksellers, no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sales, no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> reviews or significant attention from major press outlets. Even if no vandalism had ever occurred in this AFD, the results were inevitable from the beginning. The repeated vandalism just makes everyone involved feel better about deleting it. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 13:33, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>You know, that's exactly what Ken Lay needed: the cause of suffering is desire. Still think he would have done the same thing. This is garbled nutcase business management text that not even the most stonecold of yoga attenders in the Simi/Seemy Valley would pick up.
