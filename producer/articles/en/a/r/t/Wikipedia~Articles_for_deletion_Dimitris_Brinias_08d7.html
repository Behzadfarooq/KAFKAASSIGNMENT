<p><b>Delete</b> This player does not appear to come up to the level required to be on Wikipedia. I can find no trace of him on Soccerbase, nor can I find any reference to him playing at Bournemouth.</p>
<p>If he did play at Panathanikos, I guess this meets the required level, but is this verifiable? Are the Welsh and Irish clubs at the required level?</p>

<li>If he's really an Australian Under-17, the chances a first-team appearance with Pana are small at best.

<li>I can find no record of him having played for Panathanaikos or AFC Bournemouth (which is presumably what it's meant to say, rather than Bournemouth FC who are a non-league team) so the debate would hinge on whether having played for Galway would suffice (assuming it's true that he played in their match last Friday - their website has no report on the game) - personally I'd say no therefore <b>delete</b> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 15:04, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> The admittedly loose standard for athletes in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is "Competitors who have played in a fully professional league." The Welsh premiership qualifies, I think. I admit the article's a mess, and the Panathinaikos website doesn't have any record of him <a href="http://www.pao.gr/search.php?str_search_message=Dimitris+Brinias&amp;category_id=23&amp;Submit.x=0&amp;Submit.y=0&amp;Submit=submit" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pao.gr/search.php?str_search_message=Dimitris+Brinias&amp;category_id=23&amp;Submit.x=0&amp;Submit.y=0&amp;Submit=submit" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 15:59, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The players for at least some (probably most, maybe all, but definitely some) clubs are semi-professional i.e they have day jobs as well.

<li>Okay, good enough on Galway. The article cited has him as a reserve for AFC Bournemouth, which isn't enough for notability, and there's no evidence of a first-team appearance for Pana. We're down to whether the Galway appearance by itself is enough for notability. I'm not changing my&#160;!vote just yet, but I'm following with interest. -- <a href="../../../b/p/m/User%7EBpmullins_987c.html" title="User:Bpmullins">BPMullins</a> | <a href="../../../b/p/m/User_talk%7EBPmullins_8d1b.html" title="User talk:BPmullins">Talk</a> 19:18, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

He <a href="http://www.galwayunitedfc.ie/squad/brinias-signs.html" class="external text" title="http://www.galwayunitedfc.ie/squad/brinias-signs.html" rel="nofollow">signed with Galway</a> in January this year (the press release says he was "attached" to Pana). The Galway press release does, however, say he played for <a href="../../../a/2E/c/A.C._ChievoVerona_8cfc.html" title="A.C. ChievoVerona">A.C. ChievoVerona</a>, which is a <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serie_A_5ded.html" title="Serie A">Serie A</a> Italian team.

<dd>I've rewritten and wikified the article which was a bit of a mess, and added several references, but that doesn't really address the notability issue. For my money, an appearance for Galway United in the Irish Premier League <i>is</i> sufficiently notable. I guess that's the trouble with being a goalie - Brinias seems to have spent much of his career being third or fourth-choice goalkeeper and does not seem to have actually gone on the field for many matches. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 12:42, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Barely enough indeed, but I'll go with the apparent consensus on Galway. Note that the article is out of date: he <i>was</i> an Aussie U-17, but his dob is 2/3/1984 <a href="http://www.ex-canaries.co.uk/players/brinias.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ex-canaries.co.uk/players/brinias.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> so he's a bit long in the tooth for that team. -- <a href="../../../b/p/m/User%7EBpmullins_987c.html" title="User:Bpmullins">BPMullins</a> | <a href="../../../b/p/m/User_talk%7EBPmullins_8d1b.html" title="User talk:BPmullins">Talk</a> 13:36, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
