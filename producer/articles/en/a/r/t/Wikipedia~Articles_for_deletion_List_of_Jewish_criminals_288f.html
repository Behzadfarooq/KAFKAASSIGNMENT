<dd><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a>, your logic escapes me. In <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_songs_that_have_been_considered_among_the_worst_ever_5f90.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of songs that have been considered among the worst ever">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of songs that have been considered among the worst ever</a>, you argue strongly for linking the vote to such articles as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_that_have_been_considered_the_worst_ever.html" title="List of films that have been considered the worst ever">List of films that have been considered the worst ever</a>. You state&#160;: <i>Effectively, this vote is a vote on whether or not to delete the entire series of "X that have been considered the worst ever", since there's absolutely no significant difference I can see</i>. I felt the statement was sophistic because VfD is not the supreme court and its results do not create legally binding precedent. Nevertheless, there you felt that a delete vote would set a dangerous precedent for articles you clearly considered valid. Here you vote keep, even though you are opposed to the Gay criminal list. If we can’t remove the rubbish from our house all at once, must it all remain? I say delete the entire series of X criminals, gay, straight, Jewish or otherwise. I invite you to join me in setting a precedent. Let’s start getting the trash to the curb. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 17:11, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I did not vote "keep," I voted "<b>conditional keep if the 'LGBT criminals' category is deleted, conditional delete if the 'LGBT criminals' category is deleted</b>". I would have put all that in bold, but I didn't want to annoy anyone with overusing the bolding, and since the <i>current</i> consensus when I voted in LGBT was for "keep", "conditional keep" was my effective vote at the time; if the consensus for the LGBT criminals category changes to "delete", my effective vote here will then be "conditional delete". I voted "strong delete" on that list, incidentally, rather than "conditional delete", because unlike this vote, that one is just getting started, and there is plenty of time to debate and for people to change their minds and for a consensus to arise for either side. For this list, however, the consensus is very firmly already established as "delete", and there's limited time left for this category to exist; thus voting "conditional delete" would be meaningless, since there's almost no chance that the "condition" I require wouldn't be satisfied. My vote is conditional here because the "LGBT criminals" vote is much less decided (though leaning "keep").</li>
<li>I never implied that there was anything "legally binding" requiring us to vote remotely consistently (or, indeed, not to just flip a coin to decide how we vote); legality implies "must", whereas my arguments deal with "should", with the most rational course of action, the one that will benefit the most people and thus benefit Wikipedia most. Wikipedia not being the supreme court is irrelevant; "precedent" (like "delete this for the same reason that X was deleted") is still a very valid concept that is commonly used to justify VfDs and votes throughout Wikipedia. If one article is deleted for a certain reason, and the exact same reason applies equally well to another article, then either the other article should be deleted as well, or the first article's deletion should be overturned. If "list/category of Jewish criminals" is a bad list solely because it implies a connection between two types of people where no connection can be shown to exist, then a "list/category of LGBT criminals" should also be deleted unless either list/category, or both lists/categories, can be shown to <i>have</i> a valid connection between the two groups worthy of a list/category. Unless there's something especially offensive about <i>Jewish</i> criminals that makes it bad to have a list for them and OK to have a list for other minority ethnic or sexual groups, this list should be handled just like all other lists of the exact same nature, regardless of the specific groups being discussed. Likewise, if "list of songs that have been considered the worst ever" is bad because it is POVed, or because it is unmaintainable, or because it's standards aren't strict or organized enough, or for any number of other reasons, and those exact same reasons apply to "list of movies that have been considered the worst ever", then unless someone can somehow show that it's OK to have such a list for movies but not for songs (which no one has even attempted to do thus far, probably because such an argument would be ridiculous), either both lists should be deleted, or neither. And then we get a chain reaction: if "list of movies that have been considered the worst ever" should be deleted, so should "list of movies that have been considered the greatest ever" unless it can somehow be shown that having a "worst movies" page is completely unacceptable, while having a "best movies" page is just fine; and if "list of movies that have been considered the greatest ever" is unacceptable, then surely the same applies to "list of computer and video games that have been considered the greatest ever" unless some difference can be shown that would make "best movies" not OK and "best games" OK. Again, noone's succeeded in establishing a single significant (in terms of deletion/not deletion) difference between any of these four articles, thus a VfD for one of them is highly significant to all four pages. Arbitrarily deleting random articles does a disservice to Wikipedia, to its editors, and to its readers, by causing confusion and waste of resources and time through unnecessary inconsistency not merely in article style or format (which I tend to be OK with), but in our actual <i>inclusion standards</i>. Feel free to vote "delete" for Jewish criminals and "keep" for LGBT criminals (or vice versa) if you want to, but it would be highly advisable to eat least provide a possible <i>reason</i> to do so, as no one has done so yet, just as no one has yet provided a reason to delete "list of songs that have been called the worst by noteworthy souces" and not "list of movies that have been called the worst by noteworthy sources". Come on, give me some specific <i>counter-arguments</i> if you disagree with me! Don't just fight for inconsistency and arbitrary, chaotic, random voting for the hell of it. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 20:25, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> It is certainly valid to point out that Category:LGBT_criminals exists and that you do not believe that List of Jewish criminals should be deleted as long as the former remains.
