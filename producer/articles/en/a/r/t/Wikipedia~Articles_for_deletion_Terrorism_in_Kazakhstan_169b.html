<p>I think this article should be completely re-written, if it stays, it still refers to groups are terrorists in the narrative voice violating WP:WTA, and still refers to Hizb ut-Tahrir as a terrorist group, or memebrs as "terror cells".

<dd>Your possession of any degree is not convincing, especially since I have no way to verify that for myself. However, given that your claim is rather broad, and I can find reputable news sources that cover the subject...I would tend to doubt your claim. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:40, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, there are articles regarding terrorism in Kazakhstan? Again, this concern is not a deletion issue. It's a dispute resolution problem. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:39, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>No, there is none. That is what makes it a problem for an encyclopedic entry. Regarding the news sources, I have waited more than a month to see a single news article citing a terror case in Kazakhstan. <a href="../../../c/s/_/User%7ECs_49aa.html" title="User:Cs">cs</a> 22:51, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There doesn't have to a news article about a case of terrorism in Kazakhstan, the fact is, Terrorism and Kazakhstan are not unrelated concepts, and the subject does exist. It is not a concept without some information to be found. If you have differences regarding the current content, or even the article title, this is not the forum for it, and you need to work on it in a different way. <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> is what you want, not AfD.

<p><b>STRONG DELETE</b>I tend to agree with <b>delete</b> considering that there is not a single incident of terrorism in kazakhstan, so the whole article could be seen as a red-herring, or a sensationalisation of a phenomena that barely exists in this country.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 There has not been a single terrorist bombing in Kazakhstan</li>
<li>2 The title says terrorism <b>IN</b> Kazakhstan, assuming there is terrorism IN the country when there isn't any recorded incident of it</li>
<li>3 The article is so littered with use of the words "terrorist", "terror cell", and "terrorist literature" used in the narrative voice violating <a href="../../../w/t/a/WP%7EWTA_2564.html" title="WP:WTA">WP:WTA</a> it will be difficult to fix</li>
<li>4 The article assumes all groups that are banned by the government, are done so for terrorism, or accused of terrorism by the government, when actually the government itself in the source says that e.g. Hizb ut-tahrir is not banned for terrorism, but banned for <i>"extremism"</i>. This article is well beyond repair.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> this is an attempt to anger me by deleting an article I frequently edit.

<li><b>Delete</b>. KazakhPol does almost nothing on Wikipedia but push the POV that certain Islamic groups and political parties are terrorists, some of whom are not on the usual designated terrorist lists, which he has been told a thousand times. It seems that, for KazakhPol, if you're Islamic, you're <i>ipso facto</i> a terrorist. This article is an example of his extreme POV, and it will be very hard to fix it given the amount of work that would need to be done to find out which parts, if any, are accurately written up and cited. How many actual terrorist attacks have there been in Kazakhstan? Another editor has told me there have been none. It would be best to delete this and start from scratch with a new title and an entirely neutral approach. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:19, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nice attempt to cover up your incivility with a smiley face. Regretting your earlier post? Not surprising. I do not have to present proof of a terrorist act, I only have to present proof that is a valid, encyclopedia concept. The fact that has been discussed, that they arrest and deport suspects, that the government has been accused of sponsoring terrorism, makes this a valid entry as those all fall under the umbrella topic of terrorism in kazakhstan. This was already explained above by other users. <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazakhPol_c9da.html" title="User:KazakhPol">KazakhPol</a> 18:43, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
