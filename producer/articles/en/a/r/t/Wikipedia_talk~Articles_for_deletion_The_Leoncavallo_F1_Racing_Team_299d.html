<li><b>Comment</b> First of all, I would like to make this very clear, we put an article on Wikipedia to provide facts, not to promote ourselves; we want to show the world that this Team exists and that we are serious about meeting our goal. If there should be any content that might seem as promotional, please notify me and I will take the appropriate action to rectify it so that it comes out as a fact, I mean that is what Wikipedia is about after all.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Concerning proof, we have been in operation since 2003, we will register for the FIA 2014 Formula One World Championship in 2011 and in our three years in existance, we have been able to fill 25% of our Team, now, why would we do that if we were bluffing or if we were having fun. This is a serious project and no-one would have joined it if it wasn't.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We are currently assembling a Business Plan, which will be complete by the end of this year; we have put up a website <b>(www.leoncavallof1.com)</b> which outlines who we are and what our intentions are, we have completed a budget, a financial plan and are currently in negotiations to secure investors and have firm contacts for potential sponsors, including a contact for an engine supplier. Furthermore, we have conducted research and have started planning for our car, we have planned the building of a small scale prototype which will be tested in a wind-tunnel facility in the United Kingdom, we are conducting a massive marketing campaign to gather more people in our Team and we have already completed several other marketing projects. Last but not least, we are working and planning for the opening of a bar which is scheduled to be ready in time for the 2008 UEFA European Championships which will take place in Switzerland.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On a side note, we have contacted Peter SAUBER, who has replied to us and has expressed his blessings for the realization of this project and who would have been able to help us if he did not have other responsibilities with the BMW Sauber F1 Team.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If we were indeed not serious about our plans, then there would be no use for us to put an article on Wikipedia and in that case, I would agree with you to remove it. However, this is not the case and I will say it again, we are not bluffing, this is not a joke, this is a real project. If it wasn't real, this Team would not count 45 members, as it currently stands, we have just welcomed a new one very recently; we would not be spending our time working on a budget, since we would know that we would not need it and we would not be promoting ourselves through our marketing campaign, we would simply be waisting our time if we were stupid enough to provide all this work for something we would know from the start that we would not go through with.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To support our case and for further information, I will make myself available to answer any questions and I can send to anyone who would be interested in seeing it, our business outline and a copy of our budget/financial plan/salary plan. All you have to do, is send me an email at <b>president@leoncavallof1.com</b>; and I will be more than happy to show you who we are, how real we are and how determined we are.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>An encyclopedia is a document which is a collection of facts on a subject, I have provided facts about a project which is currently underway and which has a deadline, we are all working hard to meet. I will revise this article again and make sure that it provides the necessary facts, that they are worded in the appropriate manner and if there should be any content that could be seen under a form of promotion, I present to all the readers my apologies and will take the appropriate action to rectify it.</dd>

<li>Has your team been the subject of newspaper or magazine coverage? Are there any secondary sources about it? Does your company meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28companies_and_corporations%29_0e74.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)">Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)</a> (a guideline) and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> (a policy)? In short, we write articles about dreams come true, not about dreams that may come true: we have articles about teams that have participated in F1, not for companies that try to become a F1 team but that have not competed at any level yet and don't have a car. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a crystal ball is another policy that applies here.

<li><b>Comment</b> - It is one of the policies here at wikipedia to "assume good faith", but, Mr Leoncavallo, it is difficult for me to take your or your efforts seriously when you have acted so disrespectfully towards this project and its volunteers. You have vandalized by blanking this AfD six time, vandalized the article four times (by removing the AfD tag), first under your own user name, then when it was blocked, under several different anonymous IP addresses, and now this entry under an IP address but signed by you. As I said, good faith is normally assumed, but when there is so much evidence of blatant disrespect and deliberate vandalism, how do you expect us to take you, your project and your article seriously? <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 15:54, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> - This is all quite interesting, but this reply really caught me, i mean man this was really too much. I didn't quite follow what this whole thing was about vandalism, but as I understand the page was vandalised. Honnestly who would do that to his own site, especially when you're trying to promote something like this. Dear Akradecki, what planet are you from? What, you've never heard of an internet cafe where different users use the same IP number? As far as this thing is concerned, what I think about it would not make any difference and is none of your frickin' business.abroo1978</li>

<dd>This was this user's first edit... Abroo, have you ever heard of an internet caf√© where different users get the same IP address and then by some terrible coincidence go on to edit the same obscure article on Wikipedia? And the "vandalism" is the removing of all comments from this deletion discussion, and the link to it from the article page, thereby giving the impression that the article will not be deleted. This is a very logical vandalism to do to your own site.

An item called the "internet" and another item on the internet called "history", merge that together and you'll get where I am coming from and then add two words, such as "idiots" or "slackers" and the word "fun" and you'll understand what I mean. When you add all of that up, you'll get your degree for "idiots 101"...Don't worry about my last sentence, that's for "idiots 102". abroo1978</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I have serious problems with this project. There is absolutely no way that the team will be given a licence to compete. Every team needs a licence from its national motorsport authority. Even then, the team also needs a superlicence to compete in F1, which will almost certainly not be awarded due to a lack of experience of any kind in motorsport. Also, the drivers will need a superlicence to compete, for which the minimum requirement is winning a national <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formula_Three_7b45.html" title="Formula Three">Formula Three</a> championship. Of course there are exceptions, like <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kimi_Raikkonen_bd21.html" title="Kimi Raikkonen">Kimi Raikkonen</a>, but there is absolutely zero chance that a licence will be given to a driver who has done little more than drive go-karts. Then there's the issue of finance. To get a superlicence, teams have to deposit $48 million with the sport's governing body. The budget of several hundred million dollars cannot be raised per year by running a bar and restaurant. There will be no sponsors willing to take a risk on an outfit with no experience in motorsport, with drivers who have no experience. The entire thing is ridiculous, and obviously the specialist press feel the same way as there has been no coverage whatsoever. <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReadro_62c5.html" title="User:Readro">Readro</a> 16:18, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I, support this project, as the Team founder's brother, I believe in his capabilities and his project; I am not saying this as a brother, I am saying this as I have known him for years and how this project has evolved over the years since 1995.</li>

<dl>
<dd><b>Response</b>. With all do respect, I believe that you have just provided the lamest excuse..."very little evidense that anyone at the time of Galileo ever believed the world was flat". Are you kidding me! There is much evidence that show that people believed that at a certain point, ships would fall down from the Earth and you call that not flat. Galileo was put under house arrest by the Catholic Church which at the time had a very important influence on the people, and you call that very little influence. Jesus Christ call me Chelsea Clinton, lol. ileoncavallo
<dl>
<dd>People had sailed round the Earth at the time of Galileo, and the Church had divided the Earth in two halves. The dispute with Galileo was about turning, not about being round, which everyone with an ounce of brains knew at that time. All highly irrelevant here, but we shouldn't sprout anymore nonsense on this AfD. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 20:37, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Response</b>. Wow, Galileo was the one who said the Earth was round, it was Newton who with his discovery of Gravity prooved that the Earth spinned upon its own axis and was thus round. Galileo was put under House Arrest for making this statement as it undermined the Church and was later released when he recanted his statement. The part about the earth split in two, i really don't know where you got that from but i would like to ask you, did you ever go to school? By the way, I was refering to Galileo to make a statement and to set an example, I am going to refer to another user who made a comment further up, for which I could not have been any clearer, by saying, no offense dude, but that's your course overview for "idiot 103", lol ileoncavallo</dd>

<dd><b>Reply to Final reply to this nonsense</b> - I have read these articles and I have gone to school, I have had history classes and everyone who has done so, knows that Galileo is the one who stated that the Earth was round and that Newton proved that the Earth spun upon its own axis by discovering gravity, proving at the same time that the Earth was indeed round. You need to get your facts straight, I mean you've already pushed it with your non-sense about the Earth being split in two halves. Wikipedia is one source, the internet, history books and conventional encyclopedias are many sources. don't worry, that's your course outline for your postgraduate course "idiots 104", lol. ileoncavallo</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Reality check</b> - Let's not get distracted here. The point is, Wikipedia has rules, including "No origninal research" (<a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>) and "verifiability" (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). Without external references, this article simply doesn't fit in the encyclopedia. This is not a commentary on the team or the team's viability. This debate has drifted way off-subject. If ya'll want to debate the team itself, take it to the article's talk page. Here, we need to debate one thing and one thing only: does this article conform to Wikipedia's policies and guidelines? Clearly it does not. Wikipedia is, at its core, a summary of other articles and sources. This article clearly lacks that. I cannot find any mainstream F1 press that has provided this team any coverage, therefore there is nothing for this article to summarize. In the end, this article is original research, and therefore does not belong here. Beyond that, we strongly discourage people from writing about themselves, it's called "vanity". This article clearly violates that principle. We also strongly discourage people from signing up for accounts just so they can participate in these debates, and several contributors have clearly violated that principle as well. Finally, it is highly inappropriate to engage in flaming and name calling, another principle these new editors are violating. Let's get this debate back on track. It's simple folks, does this article meet WP policies and guidelines, or does it not? Any debate on the actual team is irrelevant. And lastly, for those distracted by Galileo, please keep in mind that he wouldn't have been allowed to write about his own theories here, either...again, that would have been considered "original research". <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 01:29, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b>. - With all do respect I believe that you are missing the point, it started when you attacked the idea of this Team and that was what the issue was about. I used Galileo to make a point and a statement which is relevant to this Team, so I am not getting sidetracked. ileoncavallo</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> - Unlike Galileo's opponents, this time the opposition is using facts to back up statements. I have provided a set of points as to why this team is not viable, which have yet to be countered. Instead you have spent your time attacking me over Galileo, so it would be easy to think you were getting distracted. Regardless, the article still fails <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> so therefore does not belong in the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReadro_62c5.html" title="User:Readro">Readro</a> 10:04, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Tell me something, how are the articles that one has edited or created, such as our good friend Fram relevant to this encyclopedia and how is one's personal record for articles suggested to be deleted supposed to be relevant to this encyclopedia. You are clearly missing the point...ileoncavallo</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b>. - I think that this debate has been getting out of hand and that some of you are indeed missing the point and have managed to confuse yourselves. This debate is on whether or not this article should be deleted, and the contents of the article itself is very relevant. I am surprised that some of you have managed to forget that.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am going to make this loud and clear, an encyclopedia is a collection of facts which is available to all people who should be looking for it. An article in the press is not what will make you real or not, The Leoncavallo F1 Racing Team is a young Team and has decided purposely not to contact the press as we feel it is too early in our development to do so. Furthermore, people like Julius Cesar and any other personality of ancient history did not have articles in the press written about them and yet they are suitable to be listed in an encyclopedia. Thus, your argument on not having been mentioned in the press is irrelevant.</p>
<p>As far as I understand, Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia available on the internet for everyone, meaning it does not belong to anyone, it belongs to everyone. I also understand that all contents on wikipedia are supposed to be own writing and I can tell you that I have seen other articles which talk about one's self. For example, Fram, you have an article which describes what you have contributed to wikipedia, meaning that it is an article promoting your own work and furthermore, there is a section which promotes all the article you have nominated for deletion and what I find even more interesting is that you mentioned your own record, which by definition makes you impartial.</p>
<p>In my last post, I gave you an opportunity to get in contact with me and a possibilty to provide material to you black on white, which proves that this Team is real. It has now been 24 hours since that post and I did not receive anything from any of you. You are making assumptions on basis you do not have proof for and thus we can even assume that some of you might want the deletion of this article for a personal benefit, which by my understanding is not part of the ideology of Wikipedia, now is it?</p>
<p>One of you stated that this Team would never make it to Formula One and even tried to impress all by throwing out a few facts, for which he did not have the proof to back it up. I am very well aware of the challenge that lies before this Team, I am aware of the costs it encounters and the regulations which must be respected in order to get into Formula One. In fact, we have already discussed these issues within the Team and have come with a planning to cover them. However, you made assumptions as if you were stating that we did not know what we were up against and once again, being that you never contacted me, you have no proof to show that would show that we would be unprepared or that we would not know what we are up against. You are the ones who have not even had the thought of informing yourselves intelligently and thus most of your arguments are simply an attempt to save your own skin.</p>
<p>Finally, this article provides the facts about this Team, I have reviewed it and can state that none of the content on the article in question is an attempt to by us to promote us. My brother said it well, if you want to get the promotion on this Team you would have to go to our website. Once again, for those who might not have understood it and for those who do not wish to understand it. <b>An encyclopedia is a collection of facts available for anyone who should research a certain topic</b>. The purpose of our article is to present the facts of this Team as they are, if people want to learn more about us, then they can visit our website.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - A friend of mine told me about this site and this Team and I just thought I should say something. I was a bit confused at the beginning, but now that I think about it, this seems like a serious thing and that planning ahead is a very smart move. A teacher once told me that "failing to plan is planning to fail" and that by getting an early start they are increasing their chances of success, so I think we should cut them some slack.</li>

<p>As far as this article is concerned, I think it should be maintained and that the defenders of this cause have been clear about their intentions and the prupose of this article.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Wikipedia belongs to the Wikimedia Foundation, not to the people. There are a set of rules as to which things are notable enough to have articles, and your team does not fit these criteria. Yes I threw out some facts.

<li><b>Comment</b> - For the record, I did not come here because I was asked to, I came here because I was told of this and out of my own will. Out of my own will I defend that this article should be maintained.</li>

<p>Nice try to cover your own ass though, you started out by criticizing this Team directly, this is partially what this debate is about. hazimmer</p>

<p>Dear Readro, I don't need your article and have already read it; once again I know what is in it, what costs this Team will need to invest and what regulations we will need to abide to.</p>
<p>This article has a place on Wikipedia as it provides facts and if I were to follow your logic than I would have to say that the articles about various users are also not suitable for Wikipedia, for those are an exercise of self-promotion and do not abide by the rules and regulations of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I have offered you an opportunity to provide the evidence by email, it is your responsibility to contact me for this information and I will make it clear that since one of the documents is confidential, and has a copyright, We cannot provide it freely. All I can say is that you missed your chance, deal with it.</p>
<p>Another point I would like to bring forth is that this Team is an ungoing project with a goal set for some years down the road. I have seen many articles on wikipedia which are related to events set in the future and which are not sure to happen either. Thus I do not understand why these articles should get to stay and that we would not be able to.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd like to correct some erroneous statemtns from Mr. Leoncavallo. First though, if you're going to race in F1, you have to know the rules. If you're going to participate in Wikipedia, you're going to have to know the rules, here. I'd suggest that you do this before making statments that degrade your position:
<ul>
<li>Mr. Leoncavallo wrote: "I am going to make this loud and clear, an encyclopedia is a collection of facts which is available to all people who should be looking for it." Please don't tell us what an encyclopedia is. This is stated quite clearly in places like <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>.</li>
<li>Mr. Leoncavallo wrote "An article in the press is not what will make you real or not, The Leoncavallo F1 Racing Team is a young Team and has decided purposely not to contact the press as we feel it is too early in our development to do so. Furthermore, people like Julius Cesar and any other personality of ancient history did not have articles in the press written about them and yet they are suitable to be listed in an encyclopedia. Thus, your argument on not having been mentioned in the press is irrelevant." Two of the rule of Wikipedia are verifiability <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and "no original research" <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. These rules make mention in the press exceptionally relevent. Independent third party sources/citations are one of the foundations of Wikipedia. If your article does not have these, it does not belong at Wikipedia. And, BTW, there is plenty of historical evidence on Caesar that is utilized in the article <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Caesar_5dfd.html" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>, including ancient historians. If your article had the kind of sourcing that Caesar's does, we wouldn't be having this debate.</li>
<li>Mr. Leoncavallo wrote: "For example, Fram, you have an article which describes what you have contributed to wikipedia...." That is not an article, it is part of Fram's user page. I have a similar listing on mine. There is a big difference between main space articles and user pages, and the fact that you <i>don't</i> know the difference tells me that, again, you need to learn how things work around here. That being said, your infomation <i>is</i> appropriate to be written on your userpage.</li>
<li>Mr. Leoncavallo wrote: "I have offered you an opportunity to provide the evidence by email, it is your responsibility to contact me for this information". No, it is <i>your</i> responsibility to provide this in the article. <b>Follow the rulse!</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally, this is all really simple, Mr. Leoncavallo: instead of long essays trying to tell us how this encyclopedia is supposed to be run when you're new around here, please channel your energy into actually fixing the problems with the article. Edit it, provide the sources that give it verifiability. It is <i>your</i> responsiblity to provide, not wait for people to write to you and ask for it. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 15:57, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>Let me begin by saying that The Leoncavallo F1 Racing Team is a serious project. These words have been written many times but since most of the readers fly over them without thinking about the meaning of these words, I repeated them one more time.</p>
<p>The reason why I am writing to you all, is because of this discussion on Wikipedia, concerning the deletion of this article. Most of the people against the entry used offensive arguments both against the President of this Team and all of its members.</p>
<p>Due to these offensive remarks, it is impossible to start a real debate on the subject of deletion. This ridiculous fight over deletion is drawing a bad light not only on the team, but also on the motivation of the team's members.</p>
<p>I will just repeat myself, a debate is worthless when debating with people who do not get the point and who are trying to get this article deleted for personal benefit, their reasons to do so are beyond my understanding and recognition.</p>
<p>My belief is that it is in the Team's best interest and for our motivation, to accept the deletion of the article and that we have much more important things to do then to go around in circles in this debate. The loss of this article is not a defeat for us and that we will walk away with our dignity intact.</p>
<p>Please take down this article in the shortest delay.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - you're still missing the point. It's not about how much money you have, it's about how many references you can cite for the article. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 13:54, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - All these costs are grossly underestimated. There is clearly no chance of this team ever making it to Formula One. The assumption that sponsors will give them the money is clearly what this project hinges on. If it was this easy to setup a team, I would have already done it. Without any initial investment, there will be nothing to show sponsors. Sponsors will not give money to a completely unproven group of people. If this project were to be successful, I would be ecstatic, but I would say there is less than a 0.01% chance of this ever happening. With no experience, you should try running a team at the lower levels first and working your way up. That way you'll gain a proven track record and money will be easier to come by. <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReadro_62c5.html" title="User:Readro">Readro</a> 15:41, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Statement</b>. - We are all very well aware that Formula One is currently undergoing a crisis and this Team believes that it may have one of the answers to solving it. We all know that all the current Teams are investing large sums of money into their development, of which a majority represents excessive costs. It has proven to have worked for some of them, others are less fortunate. The fact of the matter remains that it is these excessive sums that are partially bringing the sport down and this Team wishes to introduce a new Formula, in which budgets are dropped significantly and are capable with the assistance of annex activities to generate a profit, worth 1/3 of the orgiginal budget itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will of course invest a certain sum of money in the Team to form a starting capital and can assure you that this number is superior to CHF 3'000'000.-</p>
<p>What will make this Team attractive is the fact that it will operate on a low budget, cutting costs to a maximum and proving that a modern Formula One Team can survive without having to invest hundred of millions of US Dollars. On top of that, we will be able to present a dossier which will be solid, which will be attractive to potential sponsors as they will not have to invest enormous amounts of money and will have an-almost guaranteed return on investment. This is what Corporate investors are looking for; low costs, low investment, high return on investment; this is something we will eventually be able to provide.</p>
<p>Now, we have been in operation for three years, and do not get the impression that we have been praying on our chairs for this opportunity to come to us, we are working together to rise our way towards our goal and it is something we strongly believe in. We have a schedule, a list of deadlines and we are organized in our ideas.</p>
<p>Super Aguri Racing joined the F1 World Championship at the beginning of this year and we can assess that they are doing a reasonable job and that we can give them a thumbs-up. It took them one year, to get started, get some sponsors and an engine supplier. Perhaps in a few years they may even become competitive and rise themselves up to middle half of the field. By the time of our planned entry, we will have had 11 years of planning, learning about the business and from our mistakes and we still have a long way to go until we get there.</p>
<p>I have personally dedicated three years of my life to this Team and I have seen it evolve throughout all this time, watching a project take shape was like seeing my little brother grow. Three years ago, when we started, we started very small, with small objectives and doing everything by babysteps. We may not yet be ready for Formula One, that we know and that is why we haven't done certain things since we did not feel it was the right time to do so.</p>
<p>What we have is time on our side and the thought that if one works towards realizing their dreams, these dreams may eventually come true. There is a quote from Oscar Brown Jr. which says "I may not make it if I try, but I damn sure won't if I don't". You're saying that we have less than of a 1 percent chance to make it, I am not contesting at this time; all I would like to keep in mind is that we are not done, we haven't completed yet our research and planning; and that the point at which we stand at this moment will not be the same for ever. This Team will evolve, more people will learn about it and join it, there is nothing anyone can do to stop us.</p>
<p>As for reference, you have me as leader of this project, you have all the people who know about us, including Peter Sauber himself, you have the people who have supported us and you have the proof that this project is real. Further references will follow in the future and I can assure you that no matter what the end decision comes to, you will hear about us sooner or later. You hear about complete strangers in the press everyday, small people who change our world everyday and yet there is only one small article in the local paper which prove their existance.</p>
<p>I thank you in advance for your time and attention, and wish you all a pleasant evening wherever you may be.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p><b>Darius LEONCAVALLO; President, CEO &amp; Founder; The Leoncavallo F1 Racing Team</b></p>
