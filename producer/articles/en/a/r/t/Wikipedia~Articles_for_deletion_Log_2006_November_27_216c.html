<p>This was originally listed for speedy, but since I've actually heard of it and read it myself on occasion I'm not prepared to accept that assessment without a second opinion. But at the same time, I'm not wholly convinced that my familiarity with it automatically proves notability, either. Procedural nom, so <b>no vote</b> from me; I'd rather put it to discussion since it's of at least <i>borderline</i> notability. (Update: I'd also like to note that there were already a <i>large</i> number of links from album articles citing Cokemachineglow reviews <i>months</i> before this article was created.) <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:58, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Cokemachineglow is very frequently cited as an authoritative source for reviews on Wikipedia with no link referencing it back to the site, as was noted above. While most of the albums this site is cited are not of a mainstream bent (Cf. Oneida's <a href="../../../h/a/p/Happy_New_Year_%28album%29_3ed5.html" title="Happy New Year (album)">Happy New Year (album)</a>, or <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shut_Up_I_Am_Dreaming_5af0.html" title="Shut Up I Am Dreaming">Shut Up I Am Dreaming</a>), the site is elsewhere cited without linking to the Wikipedia page. I'm not sure how why Tiny Mix Tapes' article, for example, would be worth keeping, while CMG wouldn't. If one could convince me of good reasons for TMT being saved, but this one being deleted, I'd have no problem with such an end result. However, I don't work for CMG, nor am I at all involved with it, aside from reading it once a week. This article, though, is absolutely NOT spam, despite someone's speculation as to such. It's used by Metacritic as an authoritative source for reviews whenever a review is featured on the site. I'm checking on the issue of notability and will get back to y'all tomorrow. Edit(again): <a href="http://pulsetc.com/article.php?op=Print&amp;sid=2647&amp;PHPSESSID=bd68b1f274b6aec7a769e61ba99db0f5|" class="external text" title="http://pulsetc.com/article.php?op=Print&amp;sid=2647&amp;PHPSESSID=bd68b1f274b6aec7a769e61ba99db0f5|" rel="nofollow">Article which has a paragraph about CMG</a>. Edit (once more): I e-mailed Scott, the webmaster, and he said that there should be an article in <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wired.html" title="Wired">Wired</a> next month, as it should have been in print already, but was pushed back.

<li>The issue I have is not with people faking Native American heritage. They simply should not be in the list.

<li>Oh I see. I agree with that. The original list is a bit better than it once was, but yeah just avoiding having any fakes would be enough.

<p>It seems obvious to me that this article is a hoax, with the title being a play on <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paracetamol.html" title="Paracetamol">paracetamol</a> (acetaminophen). There are Google results for it, though, and I wasn't sure it fit into speedy or prod anyway. The Google results seem to be a few misspellings of paracetamol, and a few dozen Czech and Polish pages that I can't read but that seem to say that piracetamol is an alternate name for piracetam there... possibly, heh. <a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGalaxiaad_9067.html" title="User:Galaxiaad">Galaxiaad</a> 02:15, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Sorry, I'm not good at being clear. I don't actually think it's a legitimate drug that induces thoughts of piracy... however, CSD G1 specifically excludes hoaxes, and this is definitely a hoax and not incoherent. (Then again, I don't spend any time at AfD so maybe things like this are speedied anyway, and I just don't know.) Also, I was wondering if it is a legitimate alternate name for piracetam... I just noticed in the history that it redirected to <a href="../../../p/i/r/Piracetam.html" title="Piracetam">piracetam</a> briefly.

</ul>
<p>There were two issues in this debate:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the issue of notability, a majority of users were of the opinion that the subject was sufficiently notable to warrant keeping the article. Several users were satisfied the subject met the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guideline. Debate on this point was, on the whole, in favour of <b>keeping</b> the article.</li>
<li>On the issue of verifiability, several users raised concerns that the article was not based on truly independent, non-trivial sources. These concerns were not addressed by those in favour of keeping the article. Debate on this point was in favour of <b>deleting</b> the article.</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, the result of the debate was <b>no consensus</b>. Further, since the arguments about sources were not addressed, the article will be tagged with {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreliable_2bcc.html" title="Template:Unreliable">unreliable</a>}}. The application of this tag should be treated as part of the result of this debate and should not be removed until the concerns raised below have been addressed.</p>

<p>DM Ashura is a <a href="../../../b/e/m/Bemani.html" title="Bemani">Bemani</a> fan known for making remixes of songs. A few of his songs are now in DDR, but I don't think that makes him "notable". In any case, unless Konami included a short bio in the Ultramix 4 booklet, I don't think anything but the fact that he made these songs is verifiable. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">T</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SPUI_0b50.html" title="Special:Contributions/SPUI">C</a>) 02:17, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>'Fraid not, Bill, because it doesn't represent an independent (i.e. unconnected to the subject of the article) source. For more info on what would work, see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. The problem is, the only place your music is really mentioned in significant sources of any kind is just mentions that it's appeared in these two music games, which is not really enough for an article. (And to User:MarsPhoenix, the line in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> about appearing in multiple non-trivial published works is referring to being mentioned in something like a newspaper article, not having their own work released in a game or on an album). Unfortunately, I'm not sure if even the BroadJam piece qualifies, because as it stands I can't actually find much evidence for notability of BroadJam itself (it doesn't even have its own article yet, but I'm not dismissing the possibility that the notability is there but no-one's written the article yet). <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConMan_d21d.html" title="User:ConMan">Confusing Manifestation</a> 03:46, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>My argument as for the "major"ness of the music contest is that the winners were featured in what is possibly the most well-known and best-selling music game franchise in the world.

<li><b>comment</b> Third party sources indicating notability, in this case, need to be something other than your own creation (a personal website), a DDR official, or Konami feature.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Comparing this to other articles on Bemani artists, this one seems to have even more information than most, though more sources couldn't hurt. What keeps this from being a weak keep or neutral is the fact that this was put up on AfD very shortly after its creation leads me to question the faith of the nominator, who is a fairly well-known troll in the Bemani community, and has a very long history of bad faith actions here. As for the sources, the Broadjam page linked to on the article does refer to the song and the artist in question, and the artist is not a Konami employee, so the reference would be third-party. --<a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Core</a><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoredesat_227a.html" title="User talk:Coredesat"><font color="#6699FF">desat</font></a> 16:47, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. First, please bold your first word so everything is easier to read. Thanks.&#160;:) Now to answer your question: He's "notable" because, minus any Bemani connections, he is still a up and coming musician that is very well known (although mostly just throughout the Bemani community). His success <b>may</b> spread later so that he is well known thoughout any music community, but we can't tell the future, now can we? So are you saying let's not give him a page until he's "really really really" famous? And who decides when that is? <a href="../../../b/k/i/User%7EBkid_df17.html" title="User:Bkid">Bkid</a> 00:13, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm going into academic research, I could be really famous some day. Do I get an article? As for "who decides when he is": usually the measure is whether the press have said enough about someone to write a decent encyclopedia article about them. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockatume_ba19.html" title="User:Sockatume">Sockatume</a> 01:02, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But have you done any big research yet? DM Ashura has made plenty, and I mean PLENTY of songs already. His talent is pretty obvious to me. MarsPhoenix 03:20, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> A redirect here doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense, as others have noted. One, there aren't any other artists mentioned on the pages suggested to redirect to, and two, such a redirect seems out of place—I know it has been suggested in past AfDs for <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Levin_472a.html" title="Rob Levin">Rob Levin</a>, which was thought to be unreasonable by Jimbo and others. This isn't the same situation at all, but the point remains that a redirect doesn't seem to be a good solution. I think Coredesat and MarsPhoenix said everything else very well. In repsonse to SPUI, keeping in mind <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, creating another article "because <a href="../../../d/m/_/DM_Ashura_c994.html" title="DM Ashura">DM Ashura</a> exists" doesn't seem to be very sound reasoning.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> DMAshura recently contacted me to discuss his case. He's got some pertinent points to make, but felt uncomfortable adding them to the deletion debate on his own article, so I'll be summarising and presenting them on his behalf.<a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockatume_ba19.html" title="User:Sockatume">Sockatume</a> 19:21, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>1) This is a notability-based discussion. DMAshura asserts he has notability at least equal to Konami's in-house DDR composers, who have their own (significantly stubbier) biographies on the Wikipedia. Therefore, unless the AfD is expanded to encompass those articles, his own should not be deleted. As evidence: He is one of four artists to win a Konami-organised competition to have his work included in a DDR title.<a href="http://www.konami-digital-entertainment.com/production/ddr/contest.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.konami-digital-entertainment.com/production/ddr/contest.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="http://www.broadjam.com/submissions/details/contest/00_splash.asp?contest_id=73" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.broadjam.com/submissions/details/contest/00_splash.asp?contest_id=73" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="http://www.broadjam.com/mm/052506/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.broadjam.com/mm/052506/index.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. He is the only one of the four comissioned by Konami to provide additional material the game, beyond his competition entry. He is also the only one of the four to have his work included in Konami's "V-Rare" CDs, produced to promote upcoming DDR releases.<a href="http://www.orangeloungeradio.com/phpnuke/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=660" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.orangeloungeradio.com/phpnuke/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=660" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> <a href="http://www.bemanistyle.com/index.php?news_id=107" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bemanistyle.com/index.php?news_id=107" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) DMAshura's case for notability is not limited to his work on DDR, specifically he has provided music for <a href="../../../o/2/j/O2Jam_b651.html" title="O2Jam">O2Jam</a>. <a href="http://o2jam.e-games.com.my/artiste_bio01.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://o2jam.e-games.com.my/artiste_bio01.asp" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> The producers of O2Jam assert that he is notable in the "beat game" (music game) community. <a href="http://o2jam.e-games.com.my/announcement_content.asp?gsection=news&amp;id=1116" class="external autonumber" title="http://o2jam.e-games.com.my/announcement_content.asp?gsection=news&amp;id=1116" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - First of all, this isn't vanity, and I don't know how exactly it "reads like vanity". I'm not a member of the band, nor am I in any way associated with the band. As I've pointed out on the talk page, I find that this article meets number 7 under "Criteria for musicians and ensembles" on <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. All of the information in the article has been sourced. While I understand that they may be perceived as a small and unsigned band, and therefore causes some to believe that this is in fact a vanity page, this is not the case. I put a lot of work into this one. Hopefully it won't be deleted, but I'm afraid that it will be. --<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectrified_mocha_chinchilla_733a.html" title="User:Electrified mocha chinchilla"><font color="black"><b>em</b></font></a><a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectrified_mocha_chinchilla_Esperanza_9c9e.html" title="User:Electrified mocha chinchilla/Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>c</b></font></a><a href="../../../e/x/c/Exclamation_mark.html" title="Exclamation mark"><font color="black"><b>!</b></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster_3e86.html" title="Flying Spaghetti Monster"><i><font color="red">╬</font></i></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../e/l/e/User_talk%7EElectrified_mocha_chinchilla_05b7.html" title="User talk:Electrified mocha chinchilla"><font color="black">t a l k</font></a>)</sup> 21:45, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Deserves to stay</b> - Sorry about my growing pains trying to write this article, but as a regular reader of Wikipedia, I felt there should be an article for the 7 Shot Screamers.<br />
This band is notable through the 3 studio albums this band has released, all of which are around 40 minutes long. They have been reported in The Riverfront Times, The St. Louis Post Dispatch, and many others as seen on their bio on Big Muddy Records. They've won the award for best garage/rockabilly act of 2006 in the riverfront times. It's not a huge award, but it's something. This band has toured the United States twice, with a third one pending. They've received praise from notable musicians. They are <i>the</i> representative group of the St. Louis local music scene <i>hands down</i>. This sounds fanboyish, but their latest single "In Saint Lou" should be on the radio.<br />
The 7 Shot Screamers don't have nearly the recognition they deserve. I want an article on Wikipedia about them to document their history and be a source of information for people to discover them. Someday these guys may be stars, but even if they never are, they are an important part of rock and roll history. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../l/u/r/User%7ELurcho_3492.html" title="User:Lurcho">Lurcho</a> (<a href="../../../l/u/r/User_talk%7ELurcho_d23a.html" title="User talk:Lurcho">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lurcho_376b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lurcho">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>According to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, the 7 Shot Screamers are notable based on the following criteria:</p>
<p>3) Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country,[1] reported in notable and verifiable sources.[2] --They've toured the United States.</p>
<p>4) Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable). --They've released 3 studio albums. "Keep The Flame Alive" was released on Haunted Town Records, which distributes many Midwest punk bands' music. "7 Shot Screamers In Wonderland" was released on Big Muddy Records which, although young, is responsible for the music of the local St. Louis music scene.</p>
<p>5) Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (excludes things like school newspapers (although university newspapers are usually fine), personal blogs, etc.). --They've been featured in the Riverfront Times, the St. Louis Post Dispatch, and the Daily Eastern News</p>
<p>7) Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or of the local scene of a city; note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability. --Self-explanatory</p>
<p>8) Has won or placed in a major music competition. --Won best rockabilly/garage act of 2006 in the Riverfront Times. Not a huge award, but these "best of" awards recognize St. Louis culture's outstanding contributors.</p>
<p><br />
So that's five criteria out of twelve, and it needs only one. --<a href="../../../l/u/r/User%7ELurcho_3492.html" title="User:Lurcho">~Hasta luego</a> 16:11, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Part of why I put this article up for deletion is that there's nothing in Wikipedia to explain the hierarchy. The Newcastle Rugby League article does not explain its position in the hierarchy; I wound up guessing based on the Australian rugby league infobox at the bottom of the NRL article. Because the article did not assert the club's notability, the default is non-notability, and that's why I went to AfD with it. I couldn't find anything useful in a Google search, either. Also, with regard to UK football, note that the first 10 levels of the UK football system are <i>explicitly</i> defined as notable in <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMPANY_21af.html" title="WP:COMPANY">WP:COMPANY</a>, while no other leagues are so defined. —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 03:21, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. This side is probably equivalent to a second or third division side in the UK soccer competition. I will work on the article later. It recently had four players that played in a Newcastle representative side against Great Britain. Allan Thomson played for Lakes United in the 1960s while playing for NSW and Australia. The hierarchy is that it is part of the Newcastle rugby league which in turn is part of the Country Rugby League and the NSW Rugby League. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 05:16, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Thank you for putting the club into context! That is my point, that the article doesn't establish that kind of context about where the club fits in the ladder. I'm going to ask two more pointed questions: are most/all of the players on the club paid to play (professionals)? Does the winner of the Newcastle Rugby League go into a knock-out tournament which ultimately crowns the champion of the NSW Rugby League? If either of those statements are true, I'm willing to accept that the club is notable, equivalent to other clubs elsewhere in the globe, and should have an article in the Wikipedia. —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 02:35, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There are 94 articles in the category <a href="../../../p/r/i/Category%7EPrisoners_of_Oz_%28TV_series%29_8906.html" title="Category:Prisoners of Oz (TV series)">Category:Prisoners of Oz (TV series)</a>, and, additionally, the list <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_Oz_6c1e.html" title="Characters of Oz">Characters of Oz</a> (which should probably be renamed). Generally, the way Wikipedia handles TV shows is to allow and categorize separate articles for major characters, and to have a single article like List of minor characters in Oz. It's going to take a lot more than a single AfD to determine which articles should stand alone and which should be merged into the minor-character list. There doesn't seem to be a WikiProject set up for this show; <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Oz_d114.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Oz">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Oz</a> deals with the "Wizard of Oz" universe. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 07:16, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> into a list of characters or if that cannot be created, <b>delete</b>.

<li>Weak <b>merge</b> into minor character list - I was ready to opt for <i>keep</i> until I noticed that the article isn't linked from <a href="../../../o/z/_/Oz_%28TV_series%29_f2b2.html" title="Oz (TV series)">Oz (TV series)</a>. While minor characters in other series (like <i><a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_326f.html" title="South Park">South Park</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../e/a/s/EastEnders_4f21.html" title="EastEnders">EastEnders</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../2/4/_/24_%28TV_series%29_afb7.html" title="24 (TV series)">24</a></i>) often have their own articles, the process usually involves splitting the article off of a list when the list gets too unwieldy.

<p>This article has no significance, it is about a young person who is yet to become notabable. Based on things such as 'believes in the simpsons' (all in lower case) it is obvious that it lacks. Can we put the image up for deletion as well?

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. The Olympics are still crystal ballery, but the NorAm series of Ski Races appears to be notable (why else would a Paralympic Bronze medalist join the team?). I'm leaning towards a keep if sources can be tracked down. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 10:31, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>A bronze medalist joined the team meaning that the bronze medalist should be noted, not the others. If you take a look at the article's history, there was lot of nonsense content at the bottom which I removed. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mitchell_Gourley&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=90376288" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mitchell_Gourley&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=90376288" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>.

<li>My point was that if there's a bronze medalist in the team, then it's not your sports equivalent of a garage band. Sports people who join in notable sports events are notable themselves (even if they don't win). - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:13, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It'd have to be in Persian (although using Arabic script, of course}. Nothing in the article seems to point to the fact that <i>he'd</i> have more results in Persian - although his parents might, which is a different case.

<dd>I wasn't saying that his father was necessarily notable.

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> - Having read the previous AfD and DRV, it seems the most important argument for its notability is that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a> is using it, so I suggest we merge the most important information of this article into the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a> article and then redirect.

<ul>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> - I have previously argued vehemently for retaining the article and overstepped the line in several ways. Now that I've considered what others have told me, I've decided that consensus is the way to go, and that keeping the essential information but merging it into <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a> would achieve that. Later on, should GetWiki get to be used by other notable wikis, we could reconsider this. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 10:47, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have to ask, what exactly is the story behind "Elephant (wikipedia article)"? The AfD mentions something about Colbert, so did the article have something to do with elephants, or was there something else going on that we should know about?? Seriously. metaspheres 10:10, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Basically, it was this: Colbert vandalised Wikipedia on TV. Unluckily, patrollers were awake. Wikipedia reacted by doing usual countervandalism measures. Then, someone created an article <i>about</i> the Wikipedia article and the incident. I think the article was ultimately userfied, I don't know where.

<div class="messagebox"><b>Closer's rationale:</b> The volume of this debate requires me to filter out the sort of unhelpful opinions enumerated at <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>. Without these, a consensus to <i>not keep</i> the articles is apparent, but opinions differ as to whether deletions or mergers (as per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_Masts_167f.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Masts">Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Masts</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a>) are appropriate.
<p>Consequently, I'm withholding the <i>actual deletion</i> of the articles for one week as of this message, so that, in the interim:<br />
a) those interested in keeping the articles can either appeal to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>, if they feel this result is in violation of process (which will save us a great deal of deleting/restoring in case of an overturn), and<br />
b) those who want to merge and redirect the content to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">List of masts</a> or to somewhere else can do so (in this case please also add the {{<a href="../../../o/l/d/Template%7EOldafdfull_87e8.html" title="Template:Oldafdfull">oldafdfull</a>}} to the talk pages).<br />
Whatever isn't a redirect a week from now will be deleted. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 11:55, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm nominating a whole bunch of radio and TV towers that are less that fewer that 400 meters tall. None of the towers that I am nominating are noteable in any way whatsoever, as far as I can tell. Note that these articles constitute only a tiny percentage of the articles linked to on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">List of masts</a>. I tried to pick some of the least noteable entries. Also please note that <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_Masts_167f.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Masts">Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Masts</a> states "Mast articles should be merged and redirected with this list, unless they contain substantial additional information that does not fit in the list (for instance, Warsaw radio mast)." None of these articles have any substantial additional information.</p>

<li><b>comment</b>. I disagree with your assertion that they are badly grouped. All the articles are c&amp;p "[Towername] Tower is a [n] meters high guyed TV tower at [City, State, Country] at LONG°" N and LAT°" W. [Towername] Tower was built in [Year].". They are amongst the lowest structures listed in the page <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">List of masts</a>. Out of the list of a thousand, there are nearly 700 masts of under 400m in height. In most of the articles, there is not even the slightest assertion of notability, so this is pure cruft.

<li><b>Additional comments:</b>This article is a neologism of the neologism <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">Otherkin</a>. Therianthropy is a made up word by an internet group as stated in the body of the article: <i>In the early days of the Usenet group alt.horror.werewolves (around 1992), the members discussed fictional shapeshifters. Some users began to publicly claim that they considered themselves to be partially non-human animal. A number were only joking, but enough people were serious about it, and claimed this was their personal understanding and experience of themselves, that it became the subject of ongoing discussion Initially such people called themselves lycanthropes, but as that word more accurately describes wolf-people, therianthropes was chosen as a more general term.</i> At first glance the article seems very legit (the authors have done an excellent job of presentation) and the author even goes so far as to try and apply his neologism in a "Scholarly" context but once you begin to read it the fact that it is a vanity article created by a "community" of people attempting to create a scientific or legit sounding name to their...belief system is rather obvious. There are no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> claims of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>, it is written in a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> tone, and serves as nothing more than a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">soapbox</a>.

<li><b>Comment:</b> It was my understanding that the word was not made up by the Usenet furries, but rather just adopted by them. The beginning of the article seems to say that it is a more general term for animal people, encompassing werewolves and such. <s>I'm refraining from voting either keep or delete;</s> The term, subcultural use, and variations thereof are pretty popular on the internet, but I'm not sure how much of the subject would be reported on in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable sources</a>, even moreso considering Wikipedia's bias against things having to do with the internet. I agree that the article is in gross need of work and NPOVifying.

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, therianthropy is a combination of the greek words for beast and man.

<li>Hey, assume good faith please. It's disingenuous to declare in advance that if lots of people vote keep it's just because they're meatpuppets; the same sort of claim could just as easily be made about swarms of deletionists who hate interestingcruft to "explain away" large numbers of delete votes should they happen. Or, for that matter, dismissing a section of the article because "The section on "Scholarly use of the term" can only be there to try and help justify or help legitimize the "modern usage" section."

<li>You are of course correct, I should assume more good faith and I aplogize if I've offended you. As I'm sure you know if you spend enough time in AfD and you can get a little jaded and cynical about the process' abuse by conflicts of interest. In addition to my personal opinion of the author's motivations I have also justified all my actions through proper process per the guildlines and policy of an AfD nom. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 01:27, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm neutral on this article, but I am reasonably certain that I can scrape up an academic use of the term (at least in the derived form "therianthropic") referring to the animal-headed human depictions of Egyptian mythological deities. That aside, there look to be a couple of actual legitimately published books cited as reference (including a Penguin-published work cited regarding development of the term). Is there something I'm overlooking? ... 14 years is plenty of time for a term to stop being a neologism, especially if its seen print via Penguin. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 11:21, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The Penguin book is about werewolves and has nothing to do with the neologism labeled in the article. The only "reference" citing the article's POV is a fansite. Like I said the term Therianthrophy is a combo of the Greek words for beast and man so if you looked hard enough you can no doubt find it used <i>somewhere</i> outside the furry community but not in the way as defined by the article as a demographic or recognized academic term. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 11:29, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

An absolutely cursory look at the publisher looks like it might be one step above self-publication, but I'm unsure if this is sufficient to give <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> weight to the topic. I've got two articles I'm sandboxing at the moment to try to bring through DRV, so I really don't think I've got the time to see if this one's recoverable right now, but there's a start should someone be so inclined.... <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 12:59, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> of the sources that are cited, I've looked up two. <i>The Magic of Shapeshifting</i> by Rosalyn Greene is quite obviously describing the same subculture that is described for seven pages in "Werewolves" by Daniel Cohen. However, using the Amazon.com "search inside the book" feature yields only two uses of "therianthropy" and one use of "therianthrope" in <i>The Magic of Shapeshifting</i> (it mostly uses "shifter subculture" or "shifters" instead) and the Cohen book doesn't use "therianthropy" or "therianthrope" at all. Some further digging seems to indicate that the terms used by the subculture are wildly various: therian, shifter, were, polywere, therianthrope, theriomorph and so on. I think one difficulty is that "therianthrope" is not now the standard term used by the subculture, and never has been. That's one reason why I put a split template on <a href="../../../t/h/e/Therianthropy.html" title="Therianthropy">Therianthropy</a>. Separate the mythology from the subculture, and then let the rest sort itself out. Probably the subculture article will need to have a lot of material deleted if it can't be cited properly, but there's enough published material citing the subculture under some name or other that an article about the subculture could easily be supported, just perhaps not under the name "therianthropy."<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 21:10, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was thinking that the subculture is best termed "therian" and the main article on them might best be named that. But that begs the question of where they got that term at all? Likely derived from therianthropy (mythology) and now they are trying to reclaim the original term for their own. If they have succeeded in that aim then their article can be therianthropy; otherwise it should be therian with mention that the term therianthropy has acheived some limited usage in that sense. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 21:21, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'll admit as to being completely stumped as to which different name, if any, the article about the subculture should be under. All choices seem to have a problem, and I've yet to see a print reference for "therian," the current winner in terms of popularity. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 21:45, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The "neologism" is not <i>our</i> neologism, but rather a term that the therianthropes came up with for themselves.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree, it's a made up neologism. While not used only by those that identify them selves as furries that doesn't really have any bearing on wether or not this article meets wikipedia policy. If you really want to keep this article could you please provide these sources and do you have any way of rectifying the other fundemental violations of policy? <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 17:14, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You can't just list every policy under the sun and declare that it fails all of them without any further explanation. The only objections you've given any detail to are that the article's a "neologism" (which is only against policy if <i>we</i> invented the term, not if we're reporting on a neologism that <i>other people</i> recently came up with) and that there aren't reliable sources (the article already lists six published books as sources). Could you explain what the other supposed fundamental violations of policy are? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 17:22, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Have I not? I assumed most of the violations would be obvious. When I say it has no reliable sources that is because none of the citation's source material meets <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> per self-published sources. The few books sources don't really support the position maintained by the article or do so only through original research. All of the POVs that the article puts forth either fail under the aformentioned problems with sources or they have no sources at all, making them <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. The article puts forth a hypothesis about "therianthropy" based on the authors attempts to apply his understanding of the neologism in a "scholarly" context. Note that the actual term is not used, just the meaning of the neologism as he understands applied to that context. More violations of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. None of the sources in that section apply to the neologism or its use, just the concept as the author understands it: a violation of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> as well. This pattern repeats itself throughout the rest of the article except now the author is applying it to the "modern subculture". The author even contrasts his pet term to medically diagnoseable medical conditions such as clinical lycanthropy, multiple or split personality disorder and body dysmorphic disorder without citing any medical work or making any claim of having any expertise. Of course all this is written in a POV and very pro-therianthrophic stance. Zero sources and and violations of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. The author also makes unsourced and POV claims about "therian" groupings, belief structure, degrees of identification, variety of involved species and social struture all with little or, more often, no sources at all. See where I'm going with this? It's all original research to support a particular POV that is not sourced or verifiable. Also note that the def of a neologism per <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> is <i>words and terms that have recently been coined, generally do not appear in any dictionary, but may be used widely or within certain communities</i>. It doesn;t matter who came up with said neologism. Of course there is no verifiable <i>notability</i> put forth either and the entire thing is wrapped in a hard candy shell of <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLLOCKS_9aa6.html" title="WP:BOLLOCKS">WP:BOLLOCKS</a>.

<li>I would resolve a lot of these issues simply by trimming of the existing article, though. And I think you're being rather extreme in dismissing some of the sources; one of them's published by <i>Penguin</i>, that's rather far from a vanity press. The quality of much of the article is debatable but taking the position that there are absolutely <i>no</i> good sources in here is a bit over the top. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 05:45, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not arguing that the Penguin <i>werewolf</i> book is legit. I'm saying it is misused as the author of the essay is using to justify his POV and apply his term to it. It inclusion does not support the articles POV without <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Even is that were not the case that doesn't make the article salvagable and the author doesn't specificly justify its inclusion as a ref. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 10:52, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article cites the book in reference to a discussion on the origins of the term at AHWW. <i>If</i> the book actually cites the term, then we've got no problem; inclusion in a Penguin-published work is pretty much in gold standard category for "not just being a neologism". I'll try to find a copy in the next day or so, work permitting ... a page reference, or the lack of one, ought to put most of this discussion to rest. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 11:10, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>The Penguin book is not misused (since the information in the footnote is in the book and it does discuss the subculture for seven whole pages) but it does not support "therianthropy" as a term used by the subculture - in fact, it doesn't list any of the terms used by the subculture (which is probably just as well, since it is a book for children). So, it is a legimitate source for the article, but not a legitimate reason why the article should continue with the title "Therianthropy." <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 21:51, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Do not merge with Otherkin! Therianthropy and otherkin are entirely separate beliefs although there are people who share both (hence the 'overlap'). Otherkin hold beliefs (past lives, the existence of mythological creatures on an astral plane, et cetera) that most therianthropes do not have. In addition most therianthropes disparage or take offense to the term Otherkin, which they feel implies a rejection or denial of one's humanity. As for this article being a 'vanity' article, therianthropy is a belief, not a community. Therianthropy has no leaders, no central creed, and there is no main community. In describing a belief and not a community, the article stands as legitimate, since therianthopes are not a singular community and many do not even participate in online 'therian' websites. This article simply names and describes a belief held by people who may have little else in common. The term 'therianthropy' is also used by a significant number (in the thousands) of people worldwide. <small>— 24.230.61.31 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.230.61.31_739e.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.230.61.31">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> Neologism, but moderately popular in its niche and (in parts at least) well-written/referenced article. I'd hate to see the content lost so merge it with a more popular or general term for the subject (<a href="../../../s/h/a/Shapeshifting.html" title="Shapeshifting">shapeshifting</a> already opens with a big list of synonyms, and could really do with the references) and redirect. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockatume_ba19.html" title="User:Sockatume">Sockatume</a> 05:13, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I see this as a reasonable article in its own right, but if enough people disagree then a compromise I'd be comfortable with is merging it into Otherkin and turning "therianthropy" into a disambig pointing to there and to lycanthropy.

<li>Hope I'm doing this right, never edited wikipedia stuff before. In August 2003, The Learning Channel aired a program called 'Animal Imitators'. One of the people interviewed was Coyote Osborn, long-time administrator of the 'werelist' website linked to in the article. I don't know if this lends any weight, though. On one hand, the term wasn't actually used; on the other, Coyote is a prominent member of the community but doesn't otherwise put himself out in the public eye very much, yet he was found and sought out for interview by TLC. The video is available for download on various sites; his interview begins almost exactly 37min into the program if you are viewing it with commercials left in.</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> per Serpent's Choice's discovered sources. Cleanup (and probably a fair amount of rewrite) required, but topic appears verifiable even if not all of those sources pan out.

<li>For what its worth, I'm willing to do the heavy lifting needed for the cleanup and rewrite, but it would be another day or two until I'm done with my current article projects, and I've already been informed that some of the material I cited will require interlibrary loans. So, if someone has at least <i>some</i> sourcing they can put in place earlier than 1-2 weeks, I'd be appreciative.

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> A useful term with, as has been shown, applications in academia as well as the popular usage. The popular usage alone, which is different from that of 'otherkin', would render it a good topic. -<a href="../../../g/e/w/User%7EGEWilker_49bf.html" title="User:GEWilker">G.E.

<li><b>Pretty strong keep</b> per Serpent's Choice's sources. These folks have been referenced in a few books, and the online community is big enough to balance out the not-ideal amount of book sources. Original research is certainly a problem, but with these and other sources, the article is worth keeping. Needs rewrite immensely, but <i>POV-ness is not inherent to the subject</i>; I'm convinced that it can be covered with impartiality suitable for Wikipedia. And being POV is not a criteria for deletion, only significant revision. I don't feel that merge is appropriate, either, although my opinion on that is less strong. Otherkin and therianthropes often move in very different social and subcultural circles, as shown by the sources, which don't share a significant overlap with the <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">Otherkin</a> article. The history of how the subcultures of otherkin and therianthropy came to be is also quite different, as can be seen in their respective articles. (Incidentally, I'm pretty much Wikibreaking at the moment, so I won't be able to answer much query about my comments, but I did want to put in my word on this one.&#160;:P) <font face="trebuchet ms"><b><a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwitchercat_3998.html" title="User:Switchercat"><font color="darkblue">Switcher</font><font color="#000">cat</font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/w/i/User_talk%7ESwitchercat_a36d.html" title="User talk:Switchercat">talk</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Switchercat_81dc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Switchercat">cont</a></sub></font> 01:10, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

So the term is at least 91 years old.</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete.</b> The article itself does not seem to advance the base of knowledge too much, coming chiefly from sources which are suspect, not quoted in the text, or seemingly biased in their scope and application. A merge to Otherkin would add citeable sources, but the two don't seem sufficiently linked, to me, to warrant this. I vote for deletion if simply due to the fact that the article concerns what IS a neologism (if not in its original formation, then in the scope and application it has met within its usage in this article), and additionally... no one can deny that this article reads like a POV essay. References frequently aren't cited, it contains comments such as:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Stereotypically, it is said that furries view therianthropy as "taking it too far" or "too seriously", while therianthropes assert that furries are frivolous, juvenile, and/or don't respect or understand the true nature of animals."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>At least one key difference seems to be that most therians see this as being part of their own nature, rather than a dysfunction or psychological defence mechanism, thus it is often valued rather than hoped to be "cured".</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>These, and many others, are pretty broad statements to be made... has the article writer talked to most of those who identify with this group? Can they quote studies? How do they show this stereotypical history of the opinion of Furries, are they sure these are commonly and majorly held views by Furries? Can they prove it? MY digging through the sources (and I will immediately apologize for my assumptions if direct sources for some of the therefore seemingly POV statements are provided), has turned up nothing. Anyway. Even if the article cannot be entirely deleted, it should be cleaned up in a very huge way to remove some POV or utterly unverifiable/opinionated statements. Merging into Otherkin does not seem to me to be accurate, because it would necessitate defining one article as a subset of the other in some ways. Since the two things seem distinct, and only hazy evidence can really be found about either, I would say that this article should be deleted. As has previously been said, many things are interesting or noteworthy, yet not well enough documented to meet encyclopedic standards.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I was considering weakening my keep based on a <s>poor Google performance of therianthopy. Therianthropic does much better but also gets more into the existing unrelated scholarly usage.

<li><b>Comment</b> - There seems to be a large amount of confusion between therianthropy as psychological/spiritual phenomenon and therianthropy as subculture. 'Therianthropy as subculture' is not what I feel the article should be about, although I think a section on subcultures associated to the phenomenon is of some relevance. Arguments that 'Otherkin and therians are different subcultures' misunderstand the purpose of an encyclopedia (although the obsessive detail on some fan topics might lead people to think otherwise). Therianthropy, the belief that one has an animal soul, is a long-established phenomenon that plays an important role in understanding tribal cultures. The fact that this belief crops up even without cultural supports and in the face of societal sanctions (such as the 'clinical lycanthropy' diagnosis) is noteworthy. On the other hand, statements that "Otherkin think therians are far too serious" are pointless, and should be excised in favour of encyclopedic content. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickArgall_92e1.html" title="User:NickArgall">NickArgall</a> 05:42, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Distinct from lycanthropy, and with enough of a difference in conceptualisation to differentiate from otherkin.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Okay, I've now placed a split template on <a href="../../../t/h/e/Therianthropy.html" title="Therianthropy">Therianthropy</a> and I've reverted <a href="../../../t/h/e/Therianthropy_%28subculture%29.html" title="Therianthropy (subculture)">Therianthropy (subculture)</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Therianthropy_%28mythology%29.html" title="Therianthropy (mythology)">Therianthropy (mythology)</a> to their earliest clean versions (for easier viewing for those contemplating the split, so they don't have to go to the work of digging through the history).

<li><b>Comment</b> I noticed that all three <i>improperly-signed</i> opposition comments are from new anonymous users - one of which has vandal warnings. While not a problem in itself, it means that your votes <i>might not</i> be counted. Even so, there is no justification presented to keep the article. As you should know, the threat is created from the cumulation of individual articles which make Wikipedia harder to maintain - my case in point is <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defendant.html" title="Defendant">Defendant</a>, where a single person seems to think their garage rock band is notable. The information obtained from these types of page are unreliable at best, where the most reliable is a link to a myspace page. This Myspace page allows the owner of the page to share as much information as he wants to, thus not requiring any justification for notability.<br />

<li><b>Question: Why is it that you so-called wikipedia users lash out at pages you deem to be nonsense, whilst still having your own pages which contain far worse that that found in this article?</b> If you users believe that this article is taking up unwanted space, I believe that you should turn around and check out your own pages because they are much more of a waste than this article. For example, User:Markeer 's page contains something on Boxes and a picture from Star Trek. It seems to appear that this holds no possible information to the community at large and that it is helping no one furthering their knowledge. Since you believe in sharing useful information, the fact that you will be hypocrites and delete a perfectly good page, whilst sparing your useless ones. LB1, 13:26, 2 December 2006</li>

<dd>The appropriate procedure is to correct the issue by requesting deletion of content, not state that you need to keep content because "less-important" content is present. In case of User namepace pages, those are less likely to be deleted, since it gives a general guideline about the experience of the other user (i.e. he is more likely to know about Star Trek than others.) and that it has a linked talk page that permits Wikipedia-based communication. Likewise, if you believe the article has merit, the article needs to be written in that fashion, and not fall into known article patterns known to be deleted. Try taking a look at linked from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bands.html" title="List of bands">List of bands</a> to see plenty of articles that were not deleted, since they rely on solid content without looking like an <a href="../../../a/d/v/WP%7EADVERT_0952.html" title="WP:ADVERT">advert</a>. --<a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigma_7_b43b.html" title="User:Sigma 7">Sigma 7</a> 12:11, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Expired prod. The content is a bit extensive and seems to be well-referenced so I felt it deserved an AFD. Just listing here, <b>No Opinion</b> from me <a href="../../../s/r/i/User_talk%7ESrikeit_6c22.html" title="User talk:Srikeit">Srikeit</a> 10:25, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm concerned that while the vehicles themselves appear well-referenced the basis of the article, that <i>Prestige cars are vehicles that enjoy a high degree of esteem among the public, due to their high price and styling.</i>, appears to be <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">OR</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">POV</a>, with litle or no attempt to source the statement, define "high price" or mention which "public" this is. It's also geographically-biassed; a "prestige vehicle" in <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burkina_Faso_dfc4.html" title="Burkina Faso">Burkina Faso</a> (GDP per capita income, $1,300) is unlikely to be one of those listed on the page. I realise that POV and apparent geo-bias are not bases for deletion, but OR is. <b>Weak delete</b>. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> &#160;| <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywalton_f58c.html" title="User talk:Tonywalton">Talk</a></small> 12:09, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>On re-reading it does state <i>There is ..., no objective guideline as to what constitutes prestige on how to determine whether or not a veicle has prestige. The best indicators are press releases, the usage of the term luxury car, and the manner in which automobile manufacturers sell their cars</i>.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Well the article clearly states that there is no definition of high price. A vehicle might have prestige in the eyes of some, but not in the eyes of others- some consider a BMW 3-Series to have prestige-others don't. Everybody has a slightly different definition. We should not delete this article as prestige vehicles do exsist and the concept is quite prominent in western society. Prestige cars do exsist, thus an article making note of their exsistence isn't OR. The statements themselves aren't exactely OR either- they come from reviews and lifestyle columns in magazines such as Forbes. If you'd like I can add some in-line citations.

<dd>I beg to differ. The concept is not OR. Prestige cars do exsist. Why do you think people spent $52,000 on a Hummer? Because it has prestige. Perhaps the format of the article needs to be changed, but concept does undoubtely exsist. Yes, this is a subjective concept for which there are no objective guidelines and sources but only lifestyle columns to cite. Should we delete this article just becuase it isn't of scientific but highly subjective nature. Prestige cars play a big part in the day to day lives of millions of people around the globe (I admit mostly in developed countries); thus it is our obligation to make note of this phenomenon.

<dd>OK, but where are the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> of this concept of "prestige vehicles" as you've stated? Here are just a couple of the statements that I'd consider <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> because they are in no way sourced and appear to reflect "unpublished facts, arguments, concepts, statements, or theories, or any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position":
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Prestige cars are vehicles that enjoy a high degree of esteem among the public, due to their high price and styling." <i>Where is this definition from?</i></li>
<li>"The only attribute common among prestige vehicles are their relatively high price and often sophisticated quality as well as the high amount of esteem they enjoy and project upon the owner." <i>Again, where is any sourcing that states these attributes constitute a "prestige vehicle"?</i></li>
<li>"The best indicators are press releases, the usage of the term luxury car, and the manner in which automobile manufacturers sell their cars. Prestige vehicles will usually have marketing hinting at their esteemed position within the automobile market." <i>According to whom?</i></li>
<li>"Some vehicles carry high MSRPs as well as a high amount of esteem among the public, yet fail to meet the comfort requirements of a proper luxury vehicles. The cars tend to be performance or utility oriented." <i>Again, where is the source for this statement? Where is it defined that these vehicles are not "prestige"?</i></li>
<li>"The <a href="../../../h/u/m/Hummer_H1_f308.html" title="Hummer H1">Hummer H1</a> is another example of a non-luxury prestige vehicle.

<dd>I could go on, but the point is that most of this article is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. You could change the format of the article, but it wouldn't change the fact that this is an unsubstantiated essay on the concept of "prestige vehicles". You could removed all the unsourced statements, but as I stated above, you'd have no article... just a list of the vehicles at <a href="http://www.prestigecars.de/" class="external free" title="http://www.prestigecars.de/" rel="nofollow">http://www.prestigecars.de/</a>, which is the only thing that is sourced (though I'm not sure this would support an article as an absolutly <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>.

<dd>Well we could cut this article down to a mere paragraph and merge it into the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Status_symbol.html" title="Status symbol">status symbol</a> article. But we need to mention this concept. Do we also need a source for stating that on a sunny day the sun shines? The exsistance of prestige vehicles is obvious. That said, this article was written when referencing criteria were a bit more lax and thus much of it is lacking references. So we could trim this article down to a section and merge it into the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Status_symbol.html" title="Status symbol">Status symbol</a> article.

<dd>I'll take the sunny day question as rhetorical and simply state there is an obvious difference between your example and what is stated in this article. Nontheless, I don't have a problem with merging mention of this concept to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Status_symbol.html" title="Status symbol">Status symbol</a>, but any merged text should still include some sort of rudimentary <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sourcing</a> on the topic to, at the very least, establish what constitutes a "prestige vehicle". I don't think the concept is so obvious as to render sourcing unnecessary (as with your sunny day example).--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 21:13, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well then we need to agree to diagree on the sunny day example (Yes it was rhetorical). We all know that there's a difference in our apperance when we dicide to drive down Main street in a S500 versus a <a href="../../../k/i/a/Kia_Rio_ab0f.html" title="Kia Rio">Kia Rio</a>. The former one has prestige which is abvious to onlookers-but that aside. I think the source in the article currently are sufficient to support a small section in the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Status_symbol.html" title="Status symbol">Status symbol</a>. <b><a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendelSignature_e03b.html" title="User:BrendelSignature"><font face="Arial" color="#1F860E">Signature</font></a><font color="#20038A"><sup><a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendelSignature_e03b.html" title="User:BrendelSignature">brendel</a></sup></font></b><small><a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanksgiving.html" title="Thanksgiving">HAPPY HOLIDAYS</a></small> 21:17, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page has no clear focus, exists just to promote Opus Dei. There is no need for a page just to discuss the Opus Dei and civil leaders. There are 22 different Opus Dei subpages on Wikipedia, and the remaining pages are sufficient to cover Opus Dei's relationship with Civil Leaders.</p>

<li>Well, the Controversy article does need a total rewrite, but I don't think there are any thoughts here that aren't touched on by the main controversy article. That said-- I certainly wouldn't object to anyone keeping a private copy of the to-be-deleted pages article around in their userspace in order to guide us in future edits of the controversy page. I personally don't know that it will help, but if anyone thinks it will, that's cool.

<li><b>Strong keep all</b> - I think it's VERY pre-emptory, and quite ridiculous, to delete these articles straight after Australian Idol has finished. If earlier series are anything to go by, there are usually a couple of finalists that also become notable (in the case of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Callea_5daf.html" title="Anthony Callea">Anthony Callea</a>, possibly more notable than the Idol winner themselves!) - many of these earlier finalists have produced their own CDs and would easily now easily pass <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. You can't tell me that someone like <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Mauboy_6934.html" title="Jessica Mauboy">Jessica Mauboy</a> won't have a record contract and sell lots of CDs very soon (given that she had to record one in case she won the competition!) - record companies have usually snapped some of these people up, and they have sold well. And as a matter of fact, contra to what the nominator and <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMER-C_4926.html" title="User:MER-C">MER-C</a> claim, precedent for Idol finalists in other countries has KEPT most of them for some time, at least until it can be established that the person has become notable or not. For comparison, Season 1 of American Idol finalists all but one still have articles, and 6 of the top 12 on Season 1 of Australian Idol still have articles. I suggest we keep these for <b>one year</b>, and after that, if the people haven't appeared again or no longer notably fulfil <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, at least merge them into the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Idol_0416.html" title="Australian Idol">Australian Idol</a> article or an article as suggeested above by <a href="../../../c/c/o/User%7ECcool2ax_5c31.html" title="User:Ccool2ax">Chris</a>. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 21:47, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - what may be nonnotable in the United States is most certainly notable in Australia, keeping in mind that a national tour and/or single release on a major label is sufficient for <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> - and <i>Australian Idol</i> finalists do their tour, just as <i>American Idol</i> finalists do. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 00:02, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> for now. I would have a look at nominating these people after six months once we can see who has gone on to bigger things and who is on the way to being yesterday's hero.

<li><b>Comment</b> that's not the appropriate way to deal with it. We don't keep articles because the subjects might become famous or notable. We create articles <i>after</i> the subjects are famous or notable. At the moment, they all (except for maybe the top three) fail our inclusion criteria. In six months, if they have made more of themselves than a Warhol moment, then a proper article can be created. These articles should never have been created in the first place, and only now that the show is complete is there any real argument for keeping <i>any</i> of them! <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 15:04, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> for now as per <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a>. I think a blanket nomination is premature given that the contest concluded less than 48 hours ago, and at least 2 of the contestants (Mauboy and Geyer) are prominently in the news in Australia and recording contracts appear to be in the works. The others? Who knows? I would suggest looking at this again in 6 months, and merge anyone that's settled back into obscurity. That will be most of them, but for now they are reasonably high profile celebrities. Certainly they are <i>currently</i> higher profile celebrities than many people whose legitimacy is not being questioned. That'll change, and quickly, but I think we should wait until it does. The articles are crufty, and pretty dreadful, but that's another issue and not reason enough to delete. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 07:48, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep them</b>. They aren't really notable out of idol because idol 2006 only just finished! I mean, Dean Geyer has been signed with Sony BMG already apparently and Jessica Mauboy may be heard of after idol, seeing as she was runner up. Keep all of them I think, maybe if they don't have any notable things out of idol later on you should get rid of the ones that don't.

<li>Why are you going to delete a historical event like Australia Idol and the shows performers what really is the point. Australia is apart of the world.

(I'm trying to be helpful BTW.) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 21:44, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well people don't care about things unless they cost money, for the simple reason that there's always a catch, and costing money is usually it (hence lack of reviews). Therefore, most free games without a catch don't bring regular attention since it's the media's job (in America at least, the place I'm searching from) to show us the terrible and awful things about our world. In the case of video games, the game needs to be conterversal and a scapegoat of how awful video games are (to hit the target audiance of people who want videogames gone), a category which this game doesn't fit. In the case of PC game World, it is published media with a description of the game and I thought that would be enough. If that isn't enough, which to you it probably isn't, just go ahead and <s><b>delete</b></s> it. I'm tired of fighting a losing battle. But make no mistake, I'm not convinced and probably never will be that this should be deleted. I'll also hope that when you said "I'm trying to be helpful" you're not being "sarcastic or ironic in an AfD" since I usually assume some sort of good faith (you know what happens when you assume). Since "a topic is notable if it has been been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself." I'll wait until another published company has a writeup about it, and now the multiple published works part will be true. Until then, it will be deleted.

<ul>
<li>Easy, I honestly wasn't being sarcastic. I was just making a suggestion for what is really needed in the article. If something like I had suggested was found, I would be quite happy to change my stance. I understand what your saying, and I believe people are working on clarifying metters on games such as this, because like you say, free games get very little (if any) media coverage, but could well be notable. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 23:17, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> (was keep til I noticed the guideline said MULTIPLE) I've played this game for the past 5 years regularly. Lots of people know about it, but wikipedia is bureacracy and is about following the rules. See <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28computer_and_video_games%29_2db7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (computer and video games)">Wikipedia:Notability_(computer_and_video_games)</a>, does this article meet any of the criteria? Has the game has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the creator of the game: The underdogs is the only real review of the game, I suggest everyone actually read it if they voted on it. Has the game has won an award from a notable award-giving body independent of the game creators, sponsors, and publishers? No, but it has an underdogs award but is underdogs notable? Has the game been converted to other media? No. So it fails 2 of the 3 guidelines but the guidelines say you only need 1 of these. Thus is underdogs trustable? <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_of_the_Underdogs_b786.html" title="Home of the Underdogs">Home_of_the_Underdogs</a> seems to be notable enought to be included on Wikipedia but there are policies against using inclusion as an argument. <b>So the question is, is underdogs notable?</b> What are other sources which document free and old games are there any more notable than underdog? I think I'll side on keep just to be safe. --<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuirex_283a.html" title="User:Quirex">Quirex</a> 20:29, 30 November 2006 (UTC) Note I looked and the guidelines said multiple sources so no I'm changing my vote to <b>Weak Delete</b>.

<li>I agree - the Underdogs article was the only decent review I could find. If you look at the links provided by Clyde Miller, you'll also see two tiny reviews on PC World and About.com, both of which are clearly appropriate sources. As I said, the reviews themselves are so small (bordering on inconsequential) that I can't really quibble much with a delete vote. I'm on the fence myself, but I think that the cited sources arguably satisfy policy. So, I defaulted to a weak keep. -<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">ave</a>)</i> 23:52, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well the "<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28computer_and_video_games%29_2db7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (computer and video games)">policy</a>" you citied says "The following is a proposed Wikipedia policy, guideline, or process. The proposal may still be in development, under discussion, or in the process of gathering consensus for adoption. References or links to this page should not describe it as "policy"." Since that means that a source doesn't have to be a giant review, PC World (published) should be ok (that makes multiple sources). Also <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability</a> is under discussion, so I'm not sure how much we should trust that. Right now I'm not sure good how good of an idea it is to vote based on policys under discussion or proposed policys.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I went through and read all of the article's references. The PC World link is just a trivial description of the source which is so small it probably could've come from the README or the .lsm file itself. The PC World is trivial and thus it really has no bearing as a reliable link. Thus it still unfortunately lacks multiple non-trivial sources. Is there a PC World article which links to that PC World Article? --<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuirex_283a.html" title="User:Quirex">Quirex</a> 00:39, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I went through a lot of google hits, and I have to admit that I couldn't find any reviews that were clearly non-trivial (other than Underdogs). Every other mention of the game is of the 1-2 paragraph variety. Some of them do appear to be legitimate (albeit semi trivial) reviews rather than something coming from the developers <a href="http://www.gamezworld.de/showentry.php?ID=578&amp;lang=e" class="external text" title="http://www.gamezworld.de/showentry.php?ID=578&amp;lang=e" rel="nofollow">e.g.</a>. You almost got me to teeter over the line to a weak delete, but it's now an OK article as rewritten, so I'm sticking with my weak keep so long as there's a non-trivial rationale for notability. -<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">ave</a>)</i> 04:45, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Absolutely no Ghits for the word "majirism" (and I copy and pasted it because I figured it had to be wrong when I typed it since this article is so elaborate.

Further investigation shows that this is primarily a cut'n'paste from the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentacostalism.html" title="Pentacostalism">Pentacostalism</a> article with the work Majirism substituted in a few locations.

<p>Copyright violation issues have been raised on the page, so I will leave it blanked except for a couple of notices. But the copyright issue is not obvious enough, IMHO, to qualify the page for Speedy, so I'm tossing it up here instead. (I'm guessing that the copyright issues are about copyrights on the magic tricks themselves.) If you check out the previous version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Magic_Tricks_Revealed%21&amp;oldid=90007902" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Magic_Tricks_Revealed%21&amp;oldid=90007902" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> of the page, I still do not think we want it on the project. It's totally unencyclopedic. It's scattershot, in that it appears to pick several tricks at random to reveal. It also has external links prominent, all to one site, and so may ultimately be spam. So overall I do not beleive that this page benefits the project with it's continued existance, and actually has potential harm. <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 14:23, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> without prejudice to transwikification to Wikibooks. This was a how-to article, and as such unencyclopedic. Note, however, that the claims of copyright violation appear to be bogus: the text that used to be here does not duplicate the referenced websites.

He sounds like an interesting individual, but the article contains no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> which confirm his claimed notability. If some credible citations can be found, I may change my mind, but for now, I say there's not enough verifiable information here to justify keeping the article.

<li>When created, this title should have been designated "musical" rather than "play" according to the usual Wikipedia practice. Had it been, I would have discovered it and not created <i><a href="../../../b/r/e/Breakfast_at_Tiffany%27s_%28musical%29_c5ec.html" title="Breakfast at Tiffany's (musical)">Breakfast at Tiffany's</a></i>. As it stands now, the article I created is more complete, with a photo, song list, external link, and links to far more other articles. Therefore, I believe <i><a href="../../../b/r/e/Breakfast_at_Tiffany%27s_%28play%29_91d6.html" title="Breakfast at Tiffany's (play)">Breakfast at Tiffany's</a></i> should be deleted.

<p><b>Delete</b> - perhaps speedyable but a proper debate is never a bad thing. No assertions of notability - almost certainly not notable. No sources, much of the articles content is probably unverifiable (and there are major NPOV issues in any event). Recently pages on far more notable student societies have been deleted, e.g. Oxford Belles. <s>I also happen to know that the King Charles Club, mentioned in the first para is <i>not</i> the same as this club and still existed just five years ago in St John's College.</s> --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 15:06, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The article makes it quite clear that this society is not the same as that dining club of St. John's college. The sources for much of the material in this article are the archives of the Bodleian library in Oxford, more specifically the John Johnston collected of paper ethemeria. The website of the society is also a source. That the Oxford Belles, a women's singing group, could be compared with a society that has existed for more than a century is absurd. The Oxford Monarchists have many notable former members, not least Edward Heath, a former Prime Minster. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 163.1.90.229 (<a href="../../../1/6/3/User_talk%7E163.1.90.229.html" title="User talk:163.1.90.229">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_163.1.90.229_97af.html" title="Special:Contributions/163.1.90.229">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Quite. I happen to know for an absolute fact that this Society exists, which I think now has been proven sufficiently. It is an important socity,endorsed by many notable individuals and has included, in its membership many notables.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Verifiable but non-notable student society, like many thousands of others in Oxford and Cambridge alone. If it has members who went on to be notable, mention in their articles (if their membership was important to their careers). That some minor aristocrats attended its events does not make it notable. That the Bodleian catalogues its publications does not make it notable - Bodley, as a copyright library, receives and catalogues <i>everything published in the UK</i>. And as a final point, the article as it stands reads as an in-joke (consider the absurd frothing about Edward Heath) not an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Clark_9084.html" title="User:Sam Clark">Sam Clark</a> 18:56, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I hardly consider Royalty to be "minor aristocrats", they aren't aristocrats at all; they are Royalty. Nor do I consider aristocrats with writs of summons to be minor either for that matter. Your contempt clearly shows your PoV. A society which has existed for over one hundred years and can count politicians, a Prime Minister, no less, amongst its Presidents is not "non-notable".

<li><b>Keep</b> As Prefect of the OMs I can testify to the notability of the society both within and without the University of Oxford, a notability perhaps which would not be clear to people not of the University. Or women, who we do not permit to be members. That the society has existed since 1884 (see the website of the OMs and the papers in Bodley (NB: the actual archives not just the web-site detailing them (which is incorrect in its assertion that foundation was 1960)) is, by its own merit, reason enough for the OMs to be documented. As one of Oxford's oldest societies, visited by Kings, Princes, Lords and such personages we have been brought to international attention (just ask the King of Norway, the King of Tunisia or Archduke Otto von Habsburg - all of whom have attended events or who are in regular contact with the society). The record of Heath is an important contribution, from the minutes of our society, to the debate regarding the university career of the late Prime Minister. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 163.1.90.229 (<a href="../../../1/6/3/User_talk%7E163.1.90.229.html" title="User talk:163.1.90.229">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_163.1.90.229_97af.html" title="Special:Contributions/163.1.90.229">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Responding to various arguments:
<ul>
<li>Your testimony is irrelevant: what is required is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a> evidence of notability from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.</li>
<li>I am a member (as a graduate) of the University of Oxford, thanks, but in any case 'notability within the University of Oxford' is not notability for WP purposes.</li>
<li>What your comment about not admitting women has to do with the issue is beyond me.</li>
<li>I repeat: if their association with the club is an important part of the lives of the King of Norway etc., it can be recorded in their articles. I doubt that this is the case, but could certainly be wrong - if you disagree, <i>provide some reliable sources to support the claim</i>.</li>
<li>If the 'record of Heath is an important contribution ... to the debate regarding the university career of the late Prime Minister', it should go in his article. As it stands, it doesn't seem to be of much importance as a biographical fact about Heath, and it has no obvious relevance to an encyclopedia article on the society, even if that is to be kept.</li>
<li>I don't at all see why the (unverified) fact that the society has existed since 1884 makes it notable.</li>
<li>Nor do I see why the association with a former PM does so, unless it was important in shaping his career.</li>

<li><b>Response</b> Surely the references to Hansard and the OMs inter-web site are reliable sources. If not, would it be aceptable to note a source as 'Unpublished letter from HRIH Otto von Habsburg to N.'? I'm afraid that the King of norway doesn't publish articles so we can hardly reference them. With regard to the 1884 foundation (source: unpublished file on the Monarchist Society from the John Jonston collection, Department of Western Manuscripts, bodlein Library, Oxford) surely being one of the oldest societies of Oxford is a notable fact. For comparison please look at the <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_Newman_Society_fe6d.html" title="Oxford University Newman Society">Oxford University Newman Society</a> which claims many famed former members without giving a source. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 163.1.90.229 (<a href="../../../1/6/3/User_talk%7E163.1.90.229.html" title="User talk:163.1.90.229">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_163.1.90.229_97af.html" title="Special:Contributions/163.1.90.229">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Further comment</b>. Nobody is now denying that the club exists. What's wanted is evidence of notability, i.e. of its being significant enough to warrant an encyclopedia entry. The google test isn't always reliable, but a mere 5 hits is not a good sign. No, unpublished letters are not reliable sources. No, I don't think that 'being one of the oldest societies of Oxford is a notable fact' (although others may disagree) - but in any case, that fact has not been established.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. There are enormous numbers of student societies at Oxford of varying histories and degrees of notability. This society is not notable outside Oxford, would rarely be encountered by most students at Oxford, and has contributed nothing notable to the wider world. There is no significant source material to support this entry, and in any case what we look for is notability. If this were an article on Vincent's, the Assassins or the <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullingdon_Club_f50c.html" title="Bullingdon Club">Bullingdon Club</a> I would say keep, but we have nothing like the same level of notability here. If the most significant item that can be found in the club's minutes is a piece of undergraduate-ish fatuity like the one included, the organisation is not significant.

<p>This was a proposed deletion as "nn academic"" but I think it deserves AfD debate. The subject is a translator and poet with multiple published works, and at least one award for his translations.

<li><b>Delete</b> The article says he is famous but no independent sources are presented to verify this. A long list of poems and other works does not make a writer notable.

It seems that this AfD was closed and then re-opened by some non-admins. Regardless of the propriety of that or otherwise, the AfD has now been open for long enough to attract plenty of participation (following an initial nomination and a DRV; four-and-a-half days total open time) and it's time to close.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> is, sadly, a vote. There is no consensus for this - just a simple majority.

My arse is verifiable - independently and with citations, lucky me - but doesn't belong on Wikipedia by any stretch of the imagination.

<li>Well, Sir, may I congratulate you on having such a well-publicised hind quarter, and may it serve you well! However, this discussion deals with notability, and whether such claims of notability previously made are verifiable, which they are.

<li>Uh, yeah, but the above&#160;!votes aren't saying that. They're saying that there are <i>two</i> reasons to keep - notability <b>and</b> verifibility. Notability (if established in the article - you might like to edit it to make it clear as it isn't obvious to a lay reader as it stands) is, to a degree, subjective. Verifibility is, however, something that can be measured <b>but</b> is meaningless here. All manner of crap can be verified. All manner of nonsense can be verified. In the <i>Independent</i> UK newspaper last week, a picture had a caption that read "ASDFGHJKLASDFGHJKL ASDFGHJKL". Do we create an article called ASDFGHJKLASDFGHJKL ASDFGHJKL? Coz I can verify it immediately! As I say, I can provide independent, citable sources for my arse. That doesn't allow it to be given as a reason for keeping an article.

<li>Redvers, people went on and on in the DRV about how there were no independent sources, so I really don't see the harm of people pointing out that there now are sources. Besides, everyone has also used the word "notable" in some form, and that *is* a reason to keep. I'm going to just assume that WP:V is your pet peeve and you felt the need to rant. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 22:06, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Redvers, what are you going on about? I respect you and usually agree with you but I truly can't figure out what you mean here or why you commented. Notability has also been established and this isn't any less notable than articles on obscure Pokemon. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 21:41, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Notability and independent sources showing this have been established with the re-write of the article. "procedural relisting" is a bunch of crap considering the outcome of the DRV and the obviousness of the notability.

<li>See above (I edit conflicted with you on posting it). In short: people here are saying that this article should be kept because it is verifiable. That alone is not enough - as I say, my bum is verifiable, sadly. I have no issue on the notability of the subject (I haven't&#160;!voted here at all), I just have an issue with the <small>downright stupid</small> idea that verifibility is a reason (or an additional reason) to keep an article. I'll keep my bum, but I don't want Wikipedia to do so. Really. Really really. No, really.&#160;;o) And, yeah, you're right: so far we've never disagreed on an AfD and (including this one) we haven't. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 21:55, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ok I get your point. WP:V is a pet peeve of yours.&#160;:) It kind of sounded like you didn't realize that people were also mentioning notability, but ok since everyone ALSO used the word "notable" in some form, that is a reason to keep. What happened here is that on the DRV, one of the reasons people said it should stay deleted was lack of WP:V so forgive the comments here, they are only in reaction to the rant there. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 22:06, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That was the intention. One article cites trade papers like <i>Accountancy Age</i> and <i>Computer Partner</i>, the other doesn't. One product got the vendor an export award, and an <a href="http://www.zdnet.be/print.cfm?id=54024" class="external text" title="http://www.zdnet.be/print.cfm?id=54024" rel="nofollow">interview on ZDNet.be</a> with the co-founder, the other appears not to have. I think it's clear which is the more reported-on.

<li>I'll just repeat myself here then from the previous discussion, as the idea that OSNews.com is a reliable source doesn't seem to have established itself. First of all, their instructions for authors are just like those of peer-reviewed papers, which to me makes the case that their quality might be higher than that of "established journals", who have a set of editors who basically write what they feel writing about, and a set of authors, who need to satisfy the tastes of the editors. Secondly, the particular author writing that review has written 28 reviews for OSNews.com, so he is actually quite experienced. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a>&#160;<small>•</small>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 13:17, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>While the <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">software inclusion</a> guideline is only proposed at this stage, it is largely consistant with other notability guidelines, and requires non-trivial coverage.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b> I wish editors would not just rush around creating as many stubs like this as possible, but that they would instead take the time to put some info in the article. If it is a manmade lake, what river was dammed, and when, and why? How many miles of shoreline does it have? Is it important to recreation, flood control, transportation, or just drinking water?

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't have too much time for him personally, but even I have to admit that he is one of the world's leading specialists in <a href="../../../t/r/u/Trust_law.html" title="Trust law">trust law</a> (admittedly, not a subject that exactly quickens the pulse). And he is president of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_of_Trust_and_Estate_Practitioners_5f9d.html" title="Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners">STEP</a> which is the leading international body in the field. Through STEP he does wield quite a lot of influence in a number of countries in relation to legislative developments in this field - he has played quite a role in relation to the new EU regulations for the trust industry. Admittedly the article is not very good, and reads like an ego trip, but I'd suggest putting an appropriate tag on it and keeping it. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegis_951c.html" title="User:Legis">Legis</a> 08:52, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Article isn't very good and is unsourced, and seems to have been put here by someone spamming the firm (which article was quite rightly speedied). On the positive side he is notable in the industry and a major player in <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_of_Trust_and_Estate_Practitioners_5f9d.html" title="Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners">STEP</a>. I agree with Legis: tag it and let it stand. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyJones_d8f9.html" title="User:AndyJones">AndyJones</a> 09:00, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per above. As founding member and president of STEP, he appears to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> as having made widely recognized contributions that are part of the enduring historical record in his specific field. -<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">ave</a>)</i> 04:31, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Questionable on passing <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> in my view. If there was a bunch of reliable third-party coverage of him and his work, I'd tip over to keep.

<p>Neologism and dic-def. Article proto-cites one source - something said by someone once on a TV programme - but goes no further. A quick Google produces 10,000-odd links, but these are almost all for "<i>non</i>-linear media". Those that are not are for the scientific term to do with waveform dynamics (would that we had an article on that subject... anyone... please?). There could very well be a good article here on either the linear form of "non-linear media", whatever that is, or waveforms in non-linear media; but this, sadly, is neither of those. I advise we <b>delete</b> the article.

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>. The subject appears to enjoy only minor notability within the group he is affiliated with, and little to no mention outside the group; some of the external links are circular and self-referential, others appear less than scholarly; the entire Life section is unsourced (how do we know that events depicted in it took place?); no polemics involving the subject are cited. Essentially, we have little beyond <i>mentions</i> in the scholarship, that is, nothing specifically dedicated to the subject (such as an entry in a biographical dictionary). As well, I found no mention of him in Israeli scholarship and only one single mention in Hebrew at all (in a Messianic organization-hosted link). <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 17:20, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The following <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria is met for Isaac Lichtenstein: 1) The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the <i>enduring historical record</i> in their specific field (emphasis mine). 2) Name recognition.

<li>Ok, you'll have to forgive me but I would like explained what contribution he made that is part of the enduring historical record. Simply converting from one religion to another doesn't cut it. Name recognition is for "Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions" so I don't see how that's at all relevant. Finally the search engine test is listed under the alternative tests that have not gained consensus. Indeed, the fact that all the search results turn up just messianic webpages if anything would make a search engine test turn up negative. And he only gets 639 returns anyways.

<li>Hi Miri: Citing the Harvard library means that they have a record of something that goes under this name, it does not prove that the actual "Rabbi Isaac Lichtenstein" existed let alone that he was notable in any way, either to Judaism or Christianity. Sadly, many groups that have tried to undermine the Jews and Judaism over the millenia have created non-existant "<a href="../../../p/e/r/Personas.html" title="Personas">personas</a>" to suit their own nefarious ends, and this would be no exception. Another famous case in point is that of "<b><a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi_Emmanuel_Rabinovich_998a.html" title="Rabbi Emmanuel Rabinovich">Rabbi Emmanuel Rabinovich</a></b>" (See article: "Rabbi Emmanuel Rabinovich is a non-existent figure commonly cited in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">antisemitic</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a>. One such fake is a supposed speech by "Rabbi Rabinovich" entitled <i>Our Race Will Rule Undisputed Over The World</i> to the "Emergency Council of European Rabbis" in Budapest, Hungary on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_12.html" title="January 12">January 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a>. This forgery is taken as a "proof" of a Jewish plot against the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_people.html" title="White people">whites</a> in much the same way as another <a href="../../../h/o/a/Hoax.html" title="Hoax">hoax</a>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion_2073.html" title="The Protocols of the Elders of Zion">The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a>,</i> invoked in the Rabinovich speech, is used as "proof" of Jewish <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_conspiracy.html" title="Global conspiracy">global conspiracy</a>." It should be noted that the time in which the stories about "Rabbi Isaac Lichtenstein" were created in the 1880s was a time when the modern Christian evangelical movement was born targeting the Jews and received huge amounts of money to do so from their Church groups and came up with many sophisticated ploys, and by concocting that some never-heard-of "rabbi" had legitimated <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostasy.html#In_Judaism" title="Apostasy">apostasy (<i>shmad</i>)</a> by accepting Jesus on his death bed was a perfect tool for the new brand of zealous misionaries who salivated at the thought of converting even one Jew to Christianity. Proof that this person is a sham is that not a single Jewish source even mentions him, and it is not because anyone is trying to hide anything. The history of the Jews and Judaism is an open book (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_converts_to_Christianity_a6c7.html#From_Judaism" title="List of converts to Christianity">List of converts to Christianity from Judaism</a> as an example, also the true story of an Orthodox Rabbi <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Zolli_e7b2.html" title="Israel Zolli">Israel Zolli</a> who apostasised to Catholicism), but the enemies of the Jews and Judaism prey on ignorance and they have no guilt in claiming that falsehoods are "true" as they do in the cases of "Rabbis" Isaac Lichtenstein and Emmanuel Rabinovich. Finally, if people really are that hungry for a fake rabbi, why not stick with <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofski_66b2.html" title="Rabbi Hyman Krustofski">Rabbi Hyman Krustofski</a> from <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i> (and I will bet that there are people out there by now who are absolutely convince that "Rabbi" Krustofski is a real person too because he has "appeared" on The Simpsons so many times.) <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 13:03, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hi Miri: The problem is that this article is presenting him as a "real" person, and if he ever existed, he is not notable despite all the efforts to embelish his "resume" and his story. He is <i>not</i> presented in the article as a fake creation of the Messianics who have their own agenda. If the article would turn around and describe him as just another type of <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi_Emmanuel_Rabinovich_998a.html" title="Rabbi Emmanuel Rabinovich">Rabbi Emmanuel Rabinovich</a> or a <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofski_66b2.html" title="Rabbi Hyman Krustofski">Rabbi Hyman Krustofski</a> then fine, but that is not what the openly POV Messianics are attemting to do here, they want to over-dramatize and pad something that probabaly never even happened in order to foist their <i>real</i> agenda here which is to lure Jews into becoming Christians by creating this overblown image of some unknown "rabbi" easing the path to "follow" characters like this Isaac Lichtenstein, and thereby assuage their natural guilt of abandoning Judaism. This is all about <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/smoke_and_mirrors" class="extiw" title="wikt:smoke_and_mirrors">smoke and mirrors</a> and guile in order to deceive the gullible on their path to apostasising from Judaism. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 15:08, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hi Kendrick: Firstly, I am not saying that the Messianics made him up, I am pointing to the intensified efforts that various evangelical groups (mostly stemming from England) made starting from the mid to late 1800s to get Jews to apostasize, and that <i>they</i> created or embelished figures such as Isaac Lichtenstein. In Germany and Austria Jews sadly did this by themselves, many becoming Catholic several generations after becoming Reform Jews, which is a fact. Secondly, the name "Ignatz Lichtenstein" is totally unknown and meaningless to serious students of <i>any</i> Jewish history. Sure there were Jews who became Christians, but what kind of "rabbi" was this guy? Do you honestly think that <i>any</i> Orthodox rabbis could get away with such a thing? If anyone thinks that, they don't have a clue about how Orthodox Judaism and communities work. There was always a sprinkling of mostly simple people what were called "<i>meshumadim</i>" (apostates) but they were viewed as the town freaks and were outcasts and not heros to the Jews. For example, read the weird story of a true life rabbi who became an apostate, Rabbi <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Zolli_e7b2.html" title="Israel Zolli">Israel Zolli</a> of Rome, who was totally rejected by his community because of his association with the Catholics, which is very credible, and not like the puported case of Isaac/Ignatz Lichtenstein (and no-one, not even you, is sure if Isaac and Ignatz is the same person) who is painted as some sort of "hero" in this article, when, if at all true, at the time he would have been nothing but a total disgrace to his Jewish brethren who probably would have had him pilloried and run out of town at best, or perhaps even thrown into a local river. Could you imagine the fate of Jew who would have come into a devout Christian community or town in Central or Eastern Europe and preached to the gentiles to leave the "falsity of Christianity"? He would have become toast quicker than you could say "pass the fries, honey." Sad but true. 20:54, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>"when, if at all true, at the time he would have been nothing but a total disgrace to his Jewish brethren who probably would have had him pilloried and run out of town at best, or perhaps even thrown into a local river." I'm perplexed why this is any more tolerant than what Christians did. Granted Christians were worse because they/we had the power, but if either group responds by exiling or killing apostates I'm not sure where the difference lies. In any event <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_Bodo_4e6a.html" title="Bishop Bodo">Bishop Bodo</a> was not "made toast" as far as I can tell, although he did flee to Spain. Likewise <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_ben_Abraham_8f7b.html" title="Abraham ben Abraham">Abraham ben Abraham</a>'s story has inspired some doubt, but the difference is he's notable. This character being non-notable, and claims about him being untrue, is the most important thing. I'm worried many of you are getting into POV issues about whether Messianic Jews are bad or good and whether Jews must, or must never, feel "natural guit" at leaving. If this character is notable we should just present facts. Not opinions about how holy he was for "realizing the truth of Christianity" or how he was "a total disgrace and freak" for apostasizing.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li>That sound's reasonable; but that's exactly where the source material rings with veracity, which portrays the Rabbi as rejected by his fellow rabbis in Budapest but, by refusing to be baptized, confounding them. His charisma, were it really enough to sway his own fellow small-town villagers (who would have been imaginably less sophisticated, metropolitan, and battle-hardened than any collection of <i>Roman</i> Jews), may have confounded attempts to ostracize him further, as this would have just lost the whole lot of them from the Jewish faith. If you are going to make up a Christian-ic hero, you don't have them not baptized and thus, theologically, hell-bound. And there are plenty of historical examples of charismatic leaders convincing people of all sorts of strange beliefs; Jesus as messiah is a common one anyway, Jewish religious and cultural solidarity notwithstanding. As to Isaac/Ignatz, the Messianic-Judaic sources claim he wrote under the name "I. Lichtenstein" and is thus often confounded with a certain "J. Lichtenstein"; it seems Isaac is a misnomer as a result -- that's just my OR, but it's odd how the puzzle pieces fall into place. -- <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKendrick7_5630.html" title="User:Kendrick7">Kendrick7</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/n/User_talk%7EKendrick7_a50a.html" title="User talk:Kendrick7">talk</a></sup> 22:00, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If he kept his faith a secret, and then when he was found out he left his position, then there would seem to be no point to make a fuss, besides, just because there is a lack of English material on the subject from a non-pro perspective, and the fact I don't think we can fully appreciate the Jewish Hungarian perspective of his day, makes this argument irrelevant. <a href="../../../s/t/j/User%7EStjamie_0344.html" title="User:Stjamie">Jamie Guinn</a></li>

I also included on the discussion page information to the LCJE, a verifiable organization with numerous publications that can be referenced and checked. I also included the email of the main biographer. Check my sources, this man existed, and was who he was. Messianic Judaism may not be as notable as Greater Judaism or even Catholicism in numbers and therefore lack libraries worth of material. I also understand those of us in MJ are fighting an uphill battle with those with a hidden agenda of keeping us from making an contributions that would get noticed, including here on Wikipedia. I would ask the whoever makes the final decision would take into consideration the amount of tension that exists between MJ and Greater Judaism, and if need be, allowing this discussion to continue longer than normal so all avenues can be exhausted and the decider can get the proper NPOV perspective.

<li>'<b>Comment</b> A first and immediate problem is that this story is being presented as a biography of a person when there appears to be <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> evidence only of the existence of a belief by JfJ or some Messianics, independent corroboration of the story appearing to be lacking. There appears to be independent evidence of a person with the name, but not of the story about him as told. If this article was restructured as being about a belief, perhaps with a section on opinions on whether he was a real person, we could discuss <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> etc. under the appropriate category. But the article in its current incarnation presents him strictly as an historical person and vouches for his actual existence, so we have to review under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. And there simply simply seems to be very little independent evidence of his existence identified so far, not enough to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. If he were a figure in a Messianic religious text we could identify him as such and say things like "According to [Messianic religious text]...", just as we do with figures in the Bible and other religious texts.

<li>Daniel375, you are stating your own POV. The question of Jewish identity has not been fully satisfied even today. All major branches of Judaism are still fighting amongst themselves over Jewish identity as well as in Israeli politics. Messianic Jews are making inroads in Israel as being recognized to make Aliyah (those who identify themselves as such, others who claim Jewish heritage are still allowed to make Aliya. It is the orthodox who continue to fight the current definition.). Until the argument is fully settled among normative Judaism you cannot post here who is and who is not Jewish, this is purely POV. <a href="../../../s/t/j/User%7EStjamie_0344.html" title="User:Stjamie">Jamie Guinn</a> 10:03, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

Is he notable as an author? As a convert? I doubt both. The utter lack of sources not associated with either Christian missionaries or Messianic Jews is also highly suspect.

<li>The article currently claims his name isn't Isaac at all. It doesn't claim that Isaac is his first, middle, given, Hebrew, or whatever name, it claims that Isaac is an error based on a "misunderstanding of his pen name". So in effect it claims that all sources of the last 50 years, including the vast majority of the article's own sources, got his name wrong. Somehow that makes me doubt their reliability - or the article's. --<a href="../../../h/u/o/User%7EHuon_18c0.html" title="User:Huon">Huon</a> 09:58, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The term “corporeal reanimation” seems to have practically no existence other than the GNU net propagation of this poorly constructed article. The article has now existed for more than a year, and yet consists almost entirely of unreferenced statements and apparent personal research. How “corporeal reanimation”, if it even exists as a legitimate term in science or theology, is distinct from established concepts of resuscitation or resurrection is never made clear. The article is unencyclopedic, and should be deleted. Cryobiologist 20:33, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I can see your point, but it looks like you've just entered a slightly bigger world than you might current inhabit. Your <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">proposed deletion</a> suggested that a reason to delete would be that "<i>Also, it might be highly offensive to many people.</i>" - the suggestion itself being highly offensive to both Trebizond and me. Now, you might not have meant that line how it read - the internet is horrible for such things being misread! - but <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a> - a golden rule here. We never delete an article because soemone might be offended, mainly because we'd have to delete <b>all</b> our articles (I'm offended by religion, heterosexual procreational practices and capitalism - so that's about 60% of the encyclopedia gone straight away!). As I say, you might not come from a place where homosexuality is considered normal (it is <i>actually</i> normal, but it is often <i>considered</i> not normal, mistakenly). Even in such a place, 10% of the people you meet every day will be homosexual, even if you don't know it. And a percentage of the rest will be offended by material that even mentions that 10% of your community. But here, on the internet at large, and Wikipedia in microcosm, we don't tend to give that any time or energy. I hope this helps you and happy editing in future!

<li>Without straying off topic too much, where did you get that "10%" figure from? I know for a fact that, at most, maybe 1.5% of people are gay. How can you be offended by procreation? Anyway, this discussion isn't about percentage or procreation; it's about the deletion of a page full of made up information. The page contains NO references. I agree that some songs could be called "gay," but many of them are just there to irritate people, I'm sure of it.

These ideas come from Lipset, Bell, and others who went on to form the neoconservative movement in the US. Many sociologists who study right wing movements consider Centrist/Extremist Theory to have been thoroughly discredited, yet it remains the primary model for public discussions, and influences major human relations groups in the US.

<li>Oh, and by the way, almost forgot: this essay is not only original. but also false in several points of comarison. It looks like the author knows about Nazism and Communism from newspapers and movies. Especially corroborated by smartass tautological quotations like, "“Marxism has led to Fascism and National Socialism, because, in all essentials, it is fascism and National Socialism". `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 02:39, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think the term may not be a complete neologism, and I suspect that JP Faye is probably better known in France than in the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglosphere.html" title="Anglosphere">Anglosphere</a>. While I think there is undeniable truth in the term, and possibly some truth in many of the claims in the article, the claims remains OR. I have reduced the article to a stub and I can see arguments both for keeping and for deleting what remains. I suggest that those who have voted may want to view the trimmed article and either reafirm or change their votes as appropriate.

<dd>It appears he wrote a book called "Les Langages totalitaires" in which the idea may have been introduced.

<dd>I'm happy beyond reasonable doubt that what remains in the stub is true. I trust Le Figaro enough for this purpose, and I doubt that anyone would fake up a translation of it. So I could be happier, but I'm happy enough that it's accurate.
<ul>
<li>credited to Jean-Pierre Faye - the mention in the <i>Le Figaro</i> translation linked above.</li>
<li>maintains that the extreme left and the extreme right, ... closely resemble one another - same again.</li>
<li>much as the ends of a horseshoe approach each other. - strictly, the ends of a horse shoe don't get that close to each other, but as a metaphor, I think it conveys the desired information.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>That the extreme left and right are in some ways similar is a common observation, though I've never before seen anyone put a name to it. I just wish I wasn't quite so reliant on tertiary references, and that I could say more about <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Faye" class="external text" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Faye" rel="nofollow">JPF</a>] and what he had to say on the subject.

<li><b>Keep</b> There's scope for a good article to be written here about an international cultural phenomenon. It exists and it's verifiable.

<li><b>Comment</b> Identifying traits of a sub-culture is not unbiased, it's just a lot more feasible than doing so of the macroculture. Almost all love songs are heterosexual anthems.

<li><b>Delete</b>, per Bobby above. It doesn't seem like a particularly notable film anyway; on the "Official Movie Site" mentioned in the article, <a href="http://www.bellbookcamera.com/faq/faq.php?answer=11&amp;cat_name=Facing%20Sudan%20F.A.Q.&amp;category_id=1#11" class="external text" title="http://www.bellbookcamera.com/faq/faq.php?answer=11&amp;cat_name=Facing%20Sudan%20F.A.Q.&amp;category_id=1#11" rel="nofollow">one of the FAQ answers</a> states that the makers intend to enter it into film festivals. If it ever wins a notable award or something, that might change things, but it's all speculation right now. The article also reads like an advertisement, which may be connected to the possible COI. Finally, and least importantly, the article name's capitalisation is wrong anyway: that doesn't speak of care being lavished on an article! <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELoganberry_54ba.html" title="User talk:Loganberry">Talk</a>) 00:35, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> These are notable authors of published books, and leaders in the Messianic Movement. If an author has multiple books, and FFOZ is a publishing house, I believe it more than well fits the definition for notability and inclusion in a public encyclopedia. Also other wikipedia articles link to them; and the FFOZ and Boaz articles are the developing result and consensus of Wikiproject: Messianic Judaism, Messianic Jewish editors, and the general editing community that has worked hard to develop and expand information about Messianic Judaism. There is no <a href="../../../g/o/b/Gobbledygook.html" title="Gobbledygook">gobbledygook</a>, and the articles do not violate any rules in <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVanity_6666.html" title="WP:Vanity">WP:Vanity</a> - on the contrary, they are also notable, published subjects that have a near-majority following in Messianic Judaism. You'd be hard pressed not to find a Messianic who hasn't heard of Tim Hegg, Boaz Michael, or First Fruits of Zion and the One-Law Movement that is within scope of Messianic Judaism. Perhaps before you guys jump into deleting articles, that you might actually bother to post specifics as to EXACTLy what is wrong with them per Wikipedia policies, and how they are NOT notable according to other (and lesser known) publishers and authors that actually DO have Wikipedia articles. It would help if you stayed away from vague generalizations. In the meantime, I ask the admins to end this nonsensical request quickly, and keep the articles. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a> 01:10, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Inigmatus: Yeah right, it's not gobbledygook, it's full of lies and deceptions, from the get go. Bald-faced ones too: Like these: "First Fruits of Zion (FFOZ) is a Torah teaching ministry" now does that make <i>any</i> sense? What "Torah" are they teaching besides the Christian <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel.html" title="Gospel">Gospels</a>?, which are definitely not "Torah" (check out the term at the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a> article.) Would anyone believe a statement like "Yeshiva XYX teaches the New Testament"? there is no such creature on this planet because it is <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yeshiva.html" title="Yeshiva">yeshivas</a> that teach Torah while it is ministries that teach the Gospels, both being true statements, let's not get confused ok? Also these names "One Law movement" and "Grafted In movement" are complete <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoligism.html" title="Neoligism">neoligisms</a> if ever there were any, and saying that non-Jews somehow become "Jews" by accepting Jesus is total <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hokum" class="extiw" title="wikt:hokum">hokum</a> because no Christian worth their salt believes or says that. Now the claim that "FFOZ's motto is, "Proclaiming the Torah and it's way of life, fully centered on Messiah, to today's People of God" is truly comic because, again, what "Torah" are they proclaiming exactly? Wouldn't this be called <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_advertising.html" title="False advertising">false advertising</a> if someone were to claim "Proclaiming this second hand car to be good as new" when in truth the thing has it's engine missing and won't even sputter when you turn on the ignition? This is really funny: "1. They believe themselves as righteous..." or "They follow all commmandments of Adonai" very humble of them don't you think, when was the last time you heard of any serious group, even the most respected, arrogantly calling themselves "righteous" and that they follow "all the commandments"&#160;? hmmm, even the ones not to follow a false prophet? And there is more. It's a pathetic stub and one fears where such an article would go were it allowed to mushroom and grow out of all proportion to reality. Yeaa, let's all do a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reality_check" class="extiw" title="wikt:reality_check">reality check</a> whilst we're about it. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 02:59, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>IZAK, I can applaud your zealousness against anything that smacks of Christianity; but I think you have issues of confusion in your understanding of Messianics, FFOZ, and Boaz. First, you are correct, no Christian would claim to be a Jew by faith alone in Yeshua. Second, we're not Christian - we don't celebrate Christian holidays, we don't eat Christian food, we don't even share the same worship day. Third, if you really want to know what Torah they are teaching, please feel free to pick up the latest edition of the Stone Chumash, or your nearest Tanakh. Fourth, FFOZ has theological reasons, I am sure, that allow them to claim to "follow all the commandments of Adonai." Fifth, I don't see what substance your comment adds to the discussion of this AfD. Perhaps you can be a little more specific and stay away from such generalizations such as "its full of lies and deceptions" or "there's no such creature on this plant" or "these names are just neologisms." Come on, if you're as much a wiki fan as I am, I would think you could be more constructive. I encourage you to keep sharing with the group the reasons why you feel these articles should be deleted, but if you don't offer anything more specific than generalizations as accusations, then please don't bother posting and let the wikiprocess continue to move this discussion to a <b>speedykeep</b>. Otherwise, please refrain from engaging here a discussion over semantics, as VfDs are not the best place to engage Messianics in debates over their faith. I'm sure you'll spare a lot of people grief by keeping this VfD on topic. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a> 04:42, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

I have nothing against anyone who teaches Torah and I have nothing against anyone who wants to be a Christian, it's a free world as they say. But I do have a big problem when people who believe in Jesus, by any definition, not just me personally, are thus Christians, claim that they are teaching "Torah" which implies that they they are teaching "Judaism" -- which they are not. It is they that are trying to sell "the big lie" that if you coat belief in Jesus and Christianity in enough "Judaism" and "Jewish" and "Torah" jargon, then that will fool people into somehow buying into their false advertising. Let the Christians practice Christianity and the Jews practice Judaism, but when <i>anyone</i> says that "Judaism can be Christianity" or that "Christianity is somehow Judaism" we have to conclude that something very fishy and abnormal is taking place. Why create confusion?

<p>Very superficial article, unencyclopedic, seems to fall under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Deprodded, the prodder suggested "redirect &amp; merge with <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teaching_English_as_a_Foreign_Language_d864.html" title="Teaching English as a Foreign Language">Teaching English as a Foreign Language</a>", and I agree.

<dd>To clarify, I was expressing the prodder's suggestion, which seemed reasonable to me. However, I felt this is very borderline and realized other editors may feel it should be deleted. Further, I was not aware of the history raised by Husond prior to making this nom, which makes this discussion even more useful. On a side note, it would have been nice if you contacted me before trying to close the nom. <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 02:01, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> as spam for the book/s mentioned. Such information is there is should be - and is - better covered in the article on the general practice.

<p><b>Keep</b> This article is not superficial. It states the essential facts of the topic which are documented by the books mentioned. One of the books is out of print and I have no interest in promoting it. I objected to the merge with "Teaching English as a Foreign Language" because that article is blatant advertising for unnecessary certificate courses. I did not spam that article; I tested and demonstrated its lack of a neutral point of view by linking to a site with a different opinion. The link was removed because it conflicts with that article's primary purpose, which is to sell certificate courses marketed by the sites that article links to. Is it not odd and even suspicious that none of the crticisms I'm making of "Teaching English as a Foreign Language" are being addressed, let alone denied? Is that site not blatant advertising? Are there any links that question the value of certificate courses? The value of my article is that it adds balance to the "quick qualification" certificate business, which is entrenched in other articles on teaching abroad. What a tragedy if my article is deleted while the certificate sellers remain unopposed and unquestioned! omadaf2 <a href="../../../o/m/a/User%7EOmadaf2_d564.html" title="User:Omadaf2">Omadaf2</a> 07:08, 28 November 2006 (UTC) 28 Nov 06.

<dd>With respect, I'm not sure that it does state the essential facts of the topic - at least, not in a way which makes the case for this article existing by itself and separate to the more general one on the practice of teaching English as a foreign language. This article makes the comment that there is demand for English teachers in Italy (which is a statement not explicitly made in the larger article, although it does say that demand throughout the EU is high). It explains where the teachers teach (again, not explictly stated in the larger article, although I'd be amazed if this were a controversial statement to merge - are there any countries where TEFL would <i>not</i> be done "in state schools and universities as well as private schools, and/or teach private lessons"?). It explains that a certain sub-set of people are preferred (a statement largely mirrored in the larger article). It explains where jobs are to be found (which isn't mentioned in the larger article, but again could easily be generalised and merged - unless there are places where the international press and universities in the target country aren't the places to look). The final sentence is also a general one, as it is just as much the responsibility for teachers in Lesotho or Tibet to learn the local language as it is those in Italy. The question must therefore be asked whether there's anything specifically important about the Italian TEFL experience that requires its own article.</dd>
<dd>In terms of the links on the larger article, there may well be a number of spammy links (I'm not qualified to comment on that matter). If that's the case, that article should be cleaned up. The solution is not to create this article and then complain when people say that it doesn't seem to need to be here. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 07:25, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> Thanks for your input. I'm new to Wikipedia so I don't know how important technical questions are (in this case, whether a separate article is needed or appropriate), but in my opinion it is secondary to the main issue: Wikipedia is being exploited to sell unnecessary certificate courses by the article "Teaching English as a Foreign Language," and my attempt to contribute more balance by adding a link that expresses a different opinion was quickly deleted and itself called "spam!" The bottom line is that my neutral article is up for deletion, but the certificate sellers' article isn't. If I delete the commerical links from their article I'm sure I'll be accused of "vandalism." Why doesn't an editor delete those links? A separate article is needed because "Teaching English as a Foreign Language" doesn't allow disagreement with their marketing strategy. <a href="../../../o/m/a/User%7EOmadaf2_d564.html" title="User:Omadaf2">Omadaf2</a> 09:37, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I was the editor that initially marked the article with the {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} tag. As per mikkanarxi, unless there is sufficient notability in the subject matter, there is no need for a glut of Teaching X in Y articles. There is nothing in the article that cannot be transposed to any other country / language, and doing so would not change the context. There is not enough material (yet, at least) for even a stub. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincess_Tiswas_8ce5.html" title="User:Princess Tiswas"><span style="color:#00008B">T</span><span style="color:#0000CD">i</span><span style="color:#0000FF">s</span><span style="color:#006400">w</span><span style="color:#008000">a</span><span style="color:#008080">s</span></a><sup><span style="color:#FF0000">(</span><a href="../../../p/r/i/User_talk%7EPrincess_Tiswas_43c7.html" title="User talk:Princess Tiswas"><span style="color:#FF00FF">t</span></a><span style="color:#FF1493">/</span><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Princess_Tiswas_b92d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Princess Tiswas"><span style="color:#FF6347">c</span><span style="color:#FF4500">)</span></a></sup> 10:19, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> Please note that this is a conflict between a teacher with long experience who is telling the truth about teaching abroad (me) vs. salespeople who are using Wikipedia to market unnecessary certificate courses, i.e. the writers and editors of "Teaching English as a Foreign Language" (TEFL). Deleting my article or "merging it" with the latter sounds like a prime candidate for an investigation of conflict of interest. My recommendation to delete TEFL for some very good reasons was greeted by a recommendation of "speedy keep" without even addressing the specific violations of Wiki policies. Are the people who want to "merge" or delete my article prepared to show that they aren't in the business of selling certificates? Forgive me if I sound indignant, but where is the concern about what the writers/editors of "Teaching English as a Foreign Language" are doing to Wikipedia? <a href="../../../o/m/a/User%7EOmadaf2_d564.html" title="User:Omadaf2">Omadaf2</a> 17:01, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> Omadaf2, it is inappropriate to preface each follow-up comment with keep (or for that matter, delete). The closing admin will need to assess consensus and prefacing each of your comments with keep or delete makes it look as if you are voting multiple times. Since you are unfamiliar with the AFD process, this is most likely an innocent mistake. However, please be aware that it would otherwise look as if you were trying to "stuff the ballot box" in a clumsy and obvious manner. I have taken the liberty of changing your subsequent 'keep's to 'Comments' to make it easier for the closing admin to determine the consensus. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 23:43, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Delete</b> I disagree with Omadaf2. The content of this article does not provide sufficient value to warrant keeping. If there really are multiple books on the topic, surely more content could be added to this article. Until such time, I vote for deletion without prejudice against recreating the article with more substantive comment. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 23:43, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> I looked at the Teaching of English as a Foreign Language article. It does not seem to have the violations that Omadaf2 is complaining about. Perhaps the violations have been removed? In any event, I did come across the Teaching English as a Foreign Language in Hong Kong article and I think it should be deleted for the same reasons that this article should be deleted. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 23:43, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> Reply to Richard: OK, I'm willing to add more content. Could you suggest exactly what kind of content would make this article's continued existence likely? Is there a time limit? <a href="../../../o/m/a/User%7EOmadaf2_d564.html" title="User:Omadaf2">Omadaf2</a> 14:33, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> The article cites two books to document what the article says. It does not "promote" anything. The information may not be useful to you, but it could save young people hundreds of dollars on unnecessary certificate courses promoted by my critics in their article "Teaching English as a Foreign Language." Here are some quotes from the "Teaching English as a Foreign Language" article.</p>
<p>“The basic qualification” is a “TESL or TEFL certificate” <b>Blatant advertising</b> and meaningless other than expressing “The ones you should buy, see our external links for easy ordering”</p>
<p>“the two most commonly recognized certificates” are the UCLES CELTA and the Trinity CertTESOL <b>Unverifiable</b> and <b>blatant advertising</b>.</p>
<p>“The typical” (<b>unverifiable</b>) U.S. qualification is a TESOL “although many shorter certificates exist” <b>Irrelevant</b> Who cares if shorter certificates exist unless this is a shopping guide?</p>
<p>“Schools willing to take untrained staff typically run short courses” <b>Unverifiable</b> How common are schools that force teachers to pay for training? VERY common only on the sites that sell certificate courses.</p>
<p>“More Information on the TEFL Profession” Links are <b>Blatant advertising</b> If your site steers visitors to buy certificate courses, advertise here. Any links to sites that question the value of short certificate courses will be quickly deleted.</p>
<p>Genuine want ads for teachers in the international press rarely mention certificates as preferred, let alone required, but on the sites that sell such courses the percentage of ads shoots up amazingly. Attempt to contact those "employers" to confirm the ads and you receive no reply. I wonder why. <a href="../../../o/m/a/User%7EOmadaf2_d564.html" title="User:Omadaf2">Omadaf2</a> 18:57, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
