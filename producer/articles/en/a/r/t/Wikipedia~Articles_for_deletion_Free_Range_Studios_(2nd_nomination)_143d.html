<p>This article was deleted after the first AfD, mostly over advertising/POV concerns. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">User:VegaDark</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2006_September_12&amp;diff=75413253&amp;oldid=75409149" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2006_September_12&amp;diff=75413253&amp;oldid=75409149" rel="nofollow">requested</a> to recreate a non-POV version of the article. So the questions for this round are: 1. Does the article adhere to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and 2. Does the article successfully establish <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">notability</a>? ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 01:04, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Since the first AfD I've made major improvements to the article to make it much more NPOV and encyclopedic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:VegaDark/Free_Range_Studios&amp;diff=75394780&amp;oldid=75387100" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:VegaDark/Free_Range_Studios&amp;diff=75394780&amp;oldid=75387100" rel="nofollow">Diff</a>, which were the main reasons for it's original deletion. This company is to be considered notable based on the criteria at <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, please see my comments at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2006_September_12_aacb.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2006 September 12">Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2006 September 12</a> on that. The article still needs cleanup so feel free to make any edits you feel appropriate, I erred on the side of keeping info when I did my rewrite so there is probably still some info the article could do without. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 01:11, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> per <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a>. A clear, NPOV article that establishes notability. Since there is no one really voting delete, I feel a speedy keep is in order. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Olsen_0313.html" title="User:Daniel Olsen">Daniel Olsen</a> 01:17, 13 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can't tell if you're serious. But if you are, I'd suggest that 13 minutes from AfD listing to deciding that no one is really voting delete is a bit hasty given that <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">five days</a> is typical. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 01:25, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Three editors in the first AfD claimed non-notability. Since that's an open concern I doubt speedy applies here. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 01:27, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I voted Weak Keep last time; <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">User:VegaDark</a> has definitely improved the quality of the article greatly, mostly by making the article shorter. Nicely done VegaDark. <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> 01:26, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep â€”</b> much better than the draft&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucasbfr_3ae6.html" title="User:Lucasbfr">lucasbfr</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucasbfr_039f.html" title="User talk:Lucasbfr"><font color="darkblue">talk</font></a></sup> 01:35, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, with regret. VegaDark has done great work, but I still don't see enough <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that push the company over the line in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. Specifically, of the references, the first two sources are interviews, which are not fact-checked. The third is an article written by one of the company founders. The fourth is commercial self-promotion. Five, seven, and ten are about <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Meatrix_21ae.html" title="The Meatrix">The Meatrix</a>, which we have covered. Eight is a press release with a single paragraph about one of their films. And eleven is their own site. That leaves only one reference, number six, a short article from the <a href="../../../e/p/o/Epoch_Times_5afe.html" title="Epoch Times">Epoch Times</a>. With only one article that's actually about the company and from what I'd call a reliable source, to me this doesn't pass <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. It pains me to advocate deletion of such a nice-looking article, but unless more evidence of notability turns up, I don't see an alternative. Sorry, <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 01:45, 13 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While I agree some of the sources are suspect, the first two I would consider meeting the requirements of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> (first isn't working right now though). I asked on the talk page if interviews meet the requirement or not and the answer was essentially "it depends, use good judgement". I think they look independent enough to be reliable. The fifth source is not only about the movie, part of the article about the company that made it. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 01:57, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Oops. I left out reference 9, which is a link to an unsigned blog-ish post on a web portal. Sorry for the unintentional ommission. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 04:29, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I agree with William Pietri here, looking at the Newsbank coverage I get less than ten mentions total, about half in passing, and none that are actually <i>about</i> the company. Four or five are about Store Wars, so that might be worth an article, but I'm unwilling to buy arguments that two sources are enough to fulfill <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> when the WP article is longer than the full text length of the sources. We're here to summarize the existing sources, not to extend them. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 02:33, 13 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've tagged it as needing more relaible sources. I believe that is a better option than deleting the article outright when we do in fact have some reliable sources. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 02:53, 13 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think for the most part it needs to be cut down to size. I have no idea what the lengthy "Issues addressed" bullet point list is supposed to convey. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 03:04, 13 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was 50/50 on deleting that entire section. Now that you mention it, consider it gone. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 03:08, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I looked through the refs, and though some of the links don't work (after only 11 days), there are enough that do that, to me, provide independent verifiability. That, plus the filmography shows plenty of notability in my book. I didn't see it before the page was redone, but it looks like it should be kept at this point. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 02:48, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per William Petri. Though the article looks nice, if it isn't just promotion, why are there so many images in the page? It does feel like free advertising to me... --Ogdred 03:38, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per William's reasoning above. I share his disappointment - even I have heard of this and I am the <i>last</i> person to hear about web fads and the like, but the independent reliable sources simply do not seem to be there, and without them we can't have an article, because we can't verify the neutrality of the article. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 12:10, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Despite William's reasoning, a quick web search shows me that there's a lot more out there that <i>can</i> be used. WP:V should not be a major obstacle here. Okay, WP:CORP may be, but it seems like this is the kind of company that may fit in the fringes of that guideline... and I would really hesitate to classify this under "indiscriminate collection of information," and WP is not paper after all. As WP:NPOV is no longer an issue here, I think we can keep Vega's hard work. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 12:54, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I find that these two sentences:</li>
</ul>
<p>1. ...and the novelty of it got the attention of both the general public and the social activism community</p>
<p>2. ...Free Range delivered its first Flash animation piece that would have worldwide impact.</p>
<p>and the overall tone of the article is trying to be, at times, too corporate-bound, as someone from the company, Free Range Studios, or someone from an advertising firm hired for Free Range was to write to pronounce and glorify efforts, that I think, is from just another rank and file graphics firm. I understand that this studio has been instrumental in eliminating the civil war in Sierra Leone, but what percentage of contributions they gave to ending the bloodshed is questionable; (is there an article stating the direct cause Free Range Studio's movie had on both sides of the war? Would internet access and electricity be readily available for the warring sides? I simply cannot imagine whether the bloodshed in Sierra Leone, would have, even momentarily, ceased to watch and think about this Flash animation). Finally, The sources lack the tangible authority that Wikipedia is generally known for when its users produce knowledgeable, useful, and globally relative. The sources, or the lack thereof, appeal to people who have strong interest in graphic arts and is severely limited to that clique. An internet user would gather more information simply googling for Free Range Studios, and visiting the company's official website.<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellwing_cd92.html" title="User:Hellwing">Hellwing</a> 00:11, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
