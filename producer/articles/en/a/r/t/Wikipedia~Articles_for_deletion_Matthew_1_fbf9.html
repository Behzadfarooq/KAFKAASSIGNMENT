<p>I've listed this here to question the encyclopedic status of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_1.html" title="Matthew 1">Matthew 1</a> (and other pages very similar to it <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_2.html" title="Matthew 2">Matthew 2</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_3.html" title="Matthew 3">Matthew 3</a>, etc..., including all the individual verses subpages). It is my feeling that this is not what would be expected in an encyclopedia and would likely be better at Wikisource in just fulltext without the commentary (which would likely be POV). I personally believe that this page should probably be <b>deleted</b> as unencyclopedic (with it's objective, textual contents already retained at Wikisource), but am <i>quite</i> interested in community review. -<a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocratesJedi_4545.html" title="User:SocratesJedi">SocratesJedi</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/c/User_talk%7ESocratesJedi_9c57.html" title="User talk:SocratesJedi">Talk</a> 1 July 2005 05:16 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. We've been through this already. There is no reason why all kinds of minor things in various utterly unimportant fantasy and SF universes with a strong following among geeks should have articles, while the most influential piece of literature in the Western world for the last 2000 years should not be treated in equal detail. Practically every chapter and verse of the Bible has been extensively commented, quoted, paraphrased, illustrated or alluded to in art, music and literature many times over. Wars and major religious splits have been caused by the interpretation of some verses. Even an individual chapter such as <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_1.html" title="Matthew 1">Matthew 1</a> is certainly more important for Western culture and history than everything concerning <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon_5.html" title="Babylon 5">Babylon 5</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_8732.html" title="Buffy the Vampire Slayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dune_universe.html" title="Dune universe">Dune</a> put together; heck, I'll even throw in <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tolkien.html" title="Tolkien">Tolkien</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a>, not to mention all the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> garbage.

These articles just have to be based in scholarly literature (which this clearly is) and continuously watched for NPOV to prevent fundamentalist Bible-thumpers from taking over.

<li><b>Delete.</b> Wikipedia is not a church. In addition, public-domain religious texts belong on Wikisource.

I also agree with those who say that Wikipedia is not for theological exegesis.

<li><b>Keep</b> Discussion of the religious texts of all of the world's religions are appropriate for an encyclopedia. The Bible, Quaran, Gita, Tao te Ching, and many others all contain content that has had hugely significant historical and social impact. I cannot imagine an encyclopedia that did not extensively cover these. It's reasonable to organize content by the chapters and verses of these texts since this is how most people refer to them. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobycat_72d8.html" title="User:Tobycat">Tobycat</a> 1 July 2005 17:51 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Organizing by verses has the unfortunate consequence of implying that <i>every single verse</i> of the whole text merits an article, which is the principle that some editors wish to establish, but which is simply untrue of large swathes of the text. Of course, this is the discussion of the article on the chapter, not an individual verse. However, if you support articles on individual chapters of religious texts, let alone individual verses, you should vote "keep" at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Akilam_Two_64e3.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Akilam Two">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Akilam Two</a>, which is the deletion discussion of an article on a chapter of a religious text. Currently, none of the editors who have voted "keep" here have voted "keep" in that discussion. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 2005-07-01 19:51:17 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Enough has been written about the New Testament that there is something to say about pretty much every verse. So far I've worked through most of the first four chapters of Matthew. Based on only a half dozen, of the many hundreds, of sources I have been able to write two or three paragraphs of content on almost all of them. There are some verses about which there doesn't seem to be much to say, (e.g. <a href="../../../1/4/_/Matthew_4%7E14.html" title="Matthew 4:14">Matthew 4:14</a>) but these are few and far between. We might as well include them to have a well organized structure. The same does not seem to be true of <a href="../../../a/k/i/Akilam_Two_1841.html" title="Akilam Two">Akilam Two</a> and its cohorts, which are all very short and it has yet to be demonstrated that larger articles can be written on the subject. Since there are only a couple sentences on each verse, there is no reason they should not be merged. The same might be true of other parts of the Bible. In the discussion at <a href="../../../1/6/_/John_20%7E16.html" title="John 20:16">John 20:16</a> I already noted that the verse by verse approach should perhaps only be confined to the Pentateuch and Gospels. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> July 1, 2005 20:08 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Enough has been written about the New Testament</i> — I agree that there are <i>certain specific</i> parts of the text that have generated controversy and detailed analysis by many people. Indeed, I was the one who wrote <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primacy_of_Simon_Peter_0355.html" title="Primacy of Simon Peter">primacy of Simon Peter</a> describing the controversy centring upon <i>a single word in a single verse</i>. However, it is important to reflect the actual secondary sources, and the secondary sources do <i>not</i> show an even attention to all verses of all chapters of all books of both Testaments. The attention is decidedly <i>uneven</i>. There are verses <i>even in the Pentateuch and Gospels</i> that have simply drawn no attention whatever. Blanket principles that every verse, or even every chapter, deserve articles, are wrong; and structures that, on "symmetry" or "good organization" or "completeness" grounds, encourage filler articles (or, worse, original research) for the individual verses that secondary sources effectively do not touch upon, are bad ones. (I didn't call the article that I wrote Matthew 16:18, 10th word, notice. Not only is that a bad structure that encourages fillers "for symmetry", that's not the common name of the subject.) It's worth noting that most secondary sources are structured in terms of <i>groups</i> of verses, rather than in terms of individual verses. It's daft to treat Matthew 6:9 to Matthew 6:13 individually, for example; rather than treating it as <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord%27s_Prayer_8f51.html" title="Lord's Prayer">Lord's Prayer</a>. (Again, note that the common name of the subject is not the verse number.) The same goes for the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sermon_on_the_Mount_69ef.html" title="Sermon on the Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a>, the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parable_of_the_talents.html" title="Parable of the talents">Parable of the talents</a>, and many others. All of those are from the gospel that you are writing about, notice, and you will end up duplicating them, badly. Your individual verse-by-verse approach is wrong. <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sermon_on_the_Mount_69ef.html" title="Sermon on the Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a> shows that even <i>chapters</i> need to be grouped together. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 2005-07-01 21:20:19 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Most of the secondary sources I have been using go verse by verse (<a href="../../../a/n/c/Anchor_Bible_Series_fe5f.html" title="Anchor Bible Series">AB</a>, Tyndale, NCB). Though they do sometimes group related verses or slow down and go word by word. Of course attention is not even, but I have yet to find a verse that none of the sources have anything to say about. I have also already run into the issue of duplication and found that is not much of a problem. The <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_Magi_0a2e.html" title="Biblical Magi">Biblical Magi</a> are solely found in <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_2.html" title="Matthew 2">Matthew 2</a>:1-18, but there is little duplication between the verses pages and that article. Similarly the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genealogy_of_Jesus_8dec.html" title="Genealogy of Jesus">Genealogy of Jesus</a> article has little overlap with the first half of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_1.html" title="Matthew 1">Matthew 1</a>. I am about to start work on the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sermon_on_the_Mount_69ef.html" title="Sermon on the Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a> and have few concerns over duplication there. That article currently runs to some 4.2kb. Going by previous averages the total size of the series on the verses will be some 300kb. The series will no more duplicate the main page than <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nancy_Pelosi_1644.html" title="Nancy Pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a> duplicates <a href="../../../1/0/9/109th_United_States_Congress_d141.html" title="109th United States Congress">109th United States Congress</a>. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> July 1, 2005 21:45 (UTC)</li>

(Wikisource, which takes public domain and GFDL works, has the full KJV text, notice.) KJV is a special case in copyright law, and superficial arguments both about it being "crown copyright" and about it "preceding copyright laws" are flawed, as the situation is more complex than either. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 2005-07-01 21:20:19 (UTC)

<li>Agreed, in the UK the status of the KJV is a mix of confusing crown copyright regulations that are also almost certainly incompatible with EU law and the international treaties that the UK has signed. Fortunately, Wikipedia is based in the United States and is only beholden to U.S. copyright rules, so the legal status of the KJV in the UK should matter no more than the legal status of a fair use image there. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> July 1, 2005 21:45 (UTC)

<li>English law is quite simple to understand in this respect. EU law only applies because it is turned into UK acts of parliament as an uncontested semi-automatic process (involving an army of civil servants, quite often turning a 2 page EU law into a 50 page UK act). It is the crown which is sovereign, not parliament, and so crown copyright has absolute precedence. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 1 July 2005 22:51 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Livajo. Many chapters of the Bible are deserving of individual encyclopedic articles. Many are not. Those with verifiable NPOV information should be kept.

While comparisons to other articles and discussions are important to this discussion, we're still talking primarily about the article that was nominated for deletion.

<li>If that is the case, I think the Matthew 1 article stands as a pretty good example of a notable passage with verifiable context. It focuses on inter-scriptural references and could benefit from more about how this passage has influenced history ("calculations" of the age of the earth, etc).

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't understand the explanation of your vote. Could you clarify? Are you saying that all articles related to the Bible are inherently aimed at gaining new adherents to Christianity? I am truly baffled by the strength of the "no Bible articles" proponents. Although I am an athiest who generally bristles at the nonsense imposed upon our culture by religion, I find the existence of religion a legitimate academic and scholarly interest. Its impact on our culture cannot be understated.

<li>There are dozens of versions of the Bible, and dozens of Holy Books of other religions. Should Wikipedia host commentaries on all possible permutations? Also, scriptures are almost by definition open to interpretation, so any article is bound to be hopelessly subjective and controversial. If people wish to study the endless meanings that can be attributed to any Bible verse, there are plenty of churches willing to accomodate them. An encyclopedia should give the whole thing a wide berth. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStoatBringer_f2ea.html" title="User:StoatBringer">StoatBringer</a> 00:37, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
