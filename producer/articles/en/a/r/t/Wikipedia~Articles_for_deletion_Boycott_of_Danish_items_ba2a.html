<p>Where to start? First, as it is, it's a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> violation, as it largely serves as one-stop-shopping for those wanting to know whose products to boycott as a result of the <a href="../../../j/y/l/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_dcd7.html" title="Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons">Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy</a>. Second, it violates <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Third, it's poorly written and already has a cleanup tag on it. Fourth, it's <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EListcruft_170b.html" title="Wikipedia:Listcruft">listcruft</a>; there are only seven companies on the entire list. At the least, I believe it's a prime candidate for <b>merging</b> into <a href="../../../j/y/l/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_dcd7.html" title="Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons">Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons</a>. (This has already been proposed, but the talk page is moving so fast that the merge discussion has already been moved to an archive page and thus will probably never reach a consensus.) At best, it should probably be <b>deleted</b> entirely. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 01:27, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Strong Delete</b> <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boycott_of_Danish_items_1182.html" title="Boycott of Danish items">Boycott of Danish items</a> and the redirect <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark_boycott.html" title="Denmark boycott">Denmark boycott</a>.

<ul>
<li>Tricky one, IMO this is a possibly a candidate for Speedy Delete under A6 - Attack Page as it arguably encourages people to boycott certain named entirely innocent companies. Removal of the company names would turn it back into a reasonable article with some POV issues that would be regulated by the community. On balance this is a <b>delete</b> unless the company names are removed. ++<a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz">Deiz</a> 03:46, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> It may be that this article is too specific and needs to be merged into <a href="../../../j/y/l/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_dcd7.html" title="Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons">Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons</a>; however, I do not believe that contributors to this article were necessarily pushing an agenda, even if the existence or contents of the article are judged to violate <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Personally, I understand "listcruft" to be a reason for deletion only when the article <i>is</i> a list, while this article merely includes one, along with a timeline, pictures, and an introduction/overview. It also appears to me that most of this article is verifiable, if not yet verified. Deletion or merging may still be the best options, though. Participants in the boycott and the "Buy Danish" (makes me hungry) counter-boycott campaign will probably consult <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Danish_companies_94ee.html" title="List of Danish companies">List of Danish companies</a>, so this article is unnecessary and inferior from the point of view of somebody pushing an agenda regarding Denmark. In response to Deiz: I don't think it is an attack page, it does not appear to encourage the boycott, and removing relevant factual information from an article is not a good idea. --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoel7687_4b33.html" title="User:Joel7687">Joel7687</a> 04:08, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yeah, it isn't purely an attack so not an A6 but not fair on the named companies either, as you say people can check out the full list of Danish companies. IMO the list should be replaced with that link sooner rather than later. ++<a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz">Deiz</a> 04:33, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> per above. I am concerned about listing the companies affected, as that seems to support the boycott. If some Danish companies are not on the list, then it tends to favor them. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogophile_6192.html" title="User:Logophile">Logophile</a> 10:08, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge and delete.</b> The event is certainly notable, and one can quite easily write a well-referenced article that will meet WP articlespace policy. However, the correct page is Jyllands-Posten muhamad cartoons. Sjakkalle's suggestion is the natural one; I'm asking for a merge &amp; delete because I think this page is not a good redirect. I disagree with Logophile and Joel that listing the companies lends "support" to the boycott: the encyclopedia neither supports nor opposes. It reports, and is neutral. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:navy;cursor:crosshair;">ENCEPHALON</span></a> <i>11:42, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</i></li>

<li><b>Merge, not delete</b>. I am already on the record as supporting such; much but not all of the content is contained in the larger article. Verifiability is an issue of obtaining appropriate sources (which, I agree, this article lacks). The list of companies itself can probably go. However, I entirely disagree with the assertion that a list of Danish companies and the declaration of a fact of a boycott is POV. --<a href="../../../s/t/l/User%7EStlemur_8a12.html" title="User:Stlemur">Stlemur</a> 13:35, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> into the article about the cartoon controversy if it's not already covered there. There is a huge difference between calling for a boycott and a boycott that is successful in attaining some goal. It is not likely that this will seriously impact these Danish companies in such a way that causes some change. If that happens, the boycott itself is more worth an article. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 14:57, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>Comment</i>. If someone reads this list and decides to boycott these companies, then we are supporting the boycott--albeit inadvertantly. And if someone boycotts these companies after reading about them here, but doesn't boycott other Danish companies, then we are inadvertantly favoring some and protecting others. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogophile_6192.html" title="User:Logophile">Logophile</a> 10:57, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I just realized something that may prove this page to be unchangably <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EListcruft_170b.html" title="Wikipedia:Listcruft">listcruftian</a> and inaccurate in its current form: The seven companies listed in the article were apparently picked at random by one or more editors, based solely on whether or not the companies' products were mentioned as examples in the news articles listed as references on the article page. But the boycott is not against these seven companies; it's against <i>all</i> Danish products. It's as if someone started a boycott against all products made in Japan, and then a WP article was created listing Sony and Toyota as the sole targets of the boycott because those were the only two companies the article's creator could think of at the time. That's simply dead wrong information. I won't vote again since I nominated the article, but this point should be taken into consideration. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 15:47, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> preferable than <b>Merging</b> it into the cartoon's article which has a size of 60 kilobytes already. Much longer than suggested. --<a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizcarra_288c.html" title="User:Vizcarra">Vizcarra</a> 16:47, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> given the size of the cartoon article. Perhaps should be renamed as Mohammad cartoons boycott to make the context clearer. The article now has references and illustrations so is in reasonable shape. Has real potential to be an ongoing issue in foreign and trade relations ie <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Trade_Organisation_4625.html" title="World Trade Organisation">World Trade Organisation</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 20:12, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The illustrations are probable copyvios and awaiting deletion, for what it's worth. The article now consists of a single paragraph somewhat duplicative of its sort-of-parent article, along with a timeline of events which seems to be of limited value. If it's going to be kept, it ought to be greatly expanded into something about the economic and social ramifications of the boycott itself. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 20:29, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
