<p>JRandazzo created Joe Randazzo which is an obvious <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> as it is autobiographical. Beyond that, he also created Vincent Zambrano and Jose Patino...the two others with whom he made the non-notable short film The Last Request. He also created David Forsyth one of the actors from this short film. The film claims notability based on winning second place in a tiny L.A. horror film fesitval, Shriekfest...a festival so small it has exactly three staff members <a href="http://www.shriekfest.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.shriekfest.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 02:03, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It takes very little to be listed on IMDB and the only real credits are for this one short film. That isn't notability. I looked at your additions to find other pages created about this same subject in doing so, I cleaned up the William Malone article. Also, as a minor detail...your account JRandazzo didn't edit William Malone, Jrandazzofilms did. Are you admitting that you are using multiple accounts to edit Wikipedia? <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 02:57, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I also have an IMDb listing. That does not make me sufficiently notable. That does not imply that multiple reliable sources have talked about me at length.

<li><b>Comment</b> (EC) As listings can be bought on IMDb and content written by those directly concerned with or connected to the subject of articles, it is not considered a reliable primary source, rather it can act as a guide to the body of work of an actor, film company etc. The policies and guidelines that should be considered here include <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. Given the topics at hand here it appears Irishguy has simply conducted research to help make a decision about the AfD listing, unless you have more specific evidence that he is "targeting you specifically"? <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 03:02, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No one ever said that being on IMDB in and of itself qualifies me to have an article about me. Because that would mean anyone who got someone coffee on the set of "G-String Divas" would qualify. But if a film or TV series is listed, then it is notable because not every film or TV series qualifies to be listed. Also, a film festival that is listed on IMDB and is recognized by industry professionals as a major festival is also notable. There are plenty of festivals whose awards are not recognized by IMDB, just as there are thousands of films not recognized. As a matter of fact, one of the qualifications your film must pass is that it has been screened to a wide audience via a major film festival and winning said festival is notable.

<li>I would imagine most regular visitors to this page are well aware that IMDb's criteria and practices are shrouded in mystery, hence the reason many Wikipedia editors are reluctant to trust it as a source when considering the notability of relatively unknown people, films and companies. Unlike Wikipedia which has very clear, prominent explanations and definitions of it's standards for inclusion, IMDb does not reveal any specifics, and has I believe been criticized for this approach. Joe, if you wish to save these articles your only option is to demonstrate compliance with Wikipedia policies and guidelines. "WE ARE ON IMDB! IMDB SAY WE ARE NOTABLE!" will not suffice, no matter how long and loud you scream it. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 16:06, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I would say that IMDb's eligibility criteria are at least as objective as Wikipedia's, and probably more consistently administered. See <a href="http://us.imdb.com/updates?update=title" class="external text" title="http://us.imdb.com/updates?update=title" rel="nofollow">the IMDb eligibility rules</a> here. Note that the film festival provision says "accepted and shown on film festivals that don't accept everything regardless of its quality", not "screened to a wide audience via a major film festival". --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 16:20, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Again, I never said that my just being listed on IMDB makes me notable. My ex g/f is on IMDB, she's never done anything above extra work and she definately is not notable. But if a festival or film is recognized, that is notable. And yes, I am relatively unknown, but I will bet that there are many people who are relatively unknown that you can not easily discredit as "not notable." Michael Tadross' name is relatively unknown, yet he has produced Hitch, Tony 'n' Tina's Wedding, Die Hard 3, The Devil's Advocate among other films. Winning a major festival is a notable achievement.

<li>How about this guideline then? "Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work."

<dd>Except you didn't win a major award. You got second place from a festival with three staff members.

<li>In which case there would be a guideline-friendly Wikipedia article about these awards, as the awards themselves would in turn satisfy WP criteria. If you have received all this acclaim then surely you can point to independent sources presenting reviews / coverage in newspapers, magazines, TV or other outlets which focus on your work? <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 16:51, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>So the webpages of the specific awards themselves do not qualifyas independent? Shriekfest is a recognized award even on Wiki as other films that have won an award at the festival are listed in your pages with mentions of the award. JRandazzo 16:56, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Coverage must be reliable and independent. So for "Shriekfest" to be notable, it must have received independent coverage as the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works, eg reports in the LA Times, Empire magazine etc. If Shriekfest can be demonstrated to be notable and a bestower of notable industry awards, then the Shriekfest website could be used as an indicator of the awards it has awarded to films. Are other articles relying on Shriekfest for notability, or is it mentioned alongside evidence of meeting WP standards? <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 17:02, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

It's the number of results, rather than pages of results that matter in the "google test", so you were inadvertently doing yourself a disservice with the 40 figure.
