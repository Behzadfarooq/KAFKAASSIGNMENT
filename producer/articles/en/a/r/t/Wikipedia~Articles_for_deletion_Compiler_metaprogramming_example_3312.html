<p>Uninformative, mostly a useless assembly listing, and not generally considered metaprogramming -- it would only be metaprogramming in the loosest possible sense of the word. The way a compiler works is described elsewhere, making this article entirely redundant. This might be useful if it actually described how this is metaprogramming (which it isn't), which it doesn't.

<li><b>Keep</b>, and take discussion to Talk:Compiler_metaprogramming_example. Heh, this is the canonical example of a page being deleted while the author is on wikivacation&#160;;-). Furrykef rightly challenged this page on talk, but I wasn't around to contradict his particular pov, which I naturally disagree with 100%. Sorry about that, hopefully it's not too late to hold that discussion now. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 20:08, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Whether or not you were on wikivacation is irrelevant.&#160;;) After all, pages on Wikipedia, or any "true" wiki, don't really have "authors" as such. My original comment had been on that talk page for a long time (the timestamp says 16 Aug 2004), and had been unanswered until now. Anyway, I think discussion belongs here rather than on the talk page for now, so that it's all in one place. After all, if the page is retained, the talk page will still have a link to this one. - <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFurrykef_4620.html" title="User:Furrykef">furrykef</a> (<a href="../../../f/u/r/User_talk%7EFurrykef_1184.html" title="User talk:Furrykef">Talk at me</a>) 04:51, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>An article doesn't have an "owner" that's true, but articles officially do have authors (if only because that's defined by copyright law and also by the GFDL). By author here I just mean someone who's keeping an eye on the article and willing to work on it if something needs doing.</dd>
<dd>As to not taking this to talk: are you saying you want to run a (possibly lengthy) technical discussion on vfd? Ok, we can do that, but wouldn't that make the job of the VFD maintainers really hard? <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 12:47, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Comment: I've reverted <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaprogramming_%28programming%29.html" title="Metaprogramming (programming)">metaprogramming (programming)</a> to the version before furrykef's edits, to avoid distortion of this discussion.</p>
<ul>
<li>I disagree that it's distortion, though perhaps you're right that I should have held off until the page was deleted (sorry to say it, but I'm pretty confident it will be). I still think most programmers will disagree with the statement that the compiler is a metaprogramming tool, which is a strong argument both for the deletion of this page and for rewording the metaprogramming page. I can understand where you're coming from, and I agree that a compiler is a metaprogramming tool in a <i>loose</i> sense. But your POV and my POV don't really matter for something like this. (And forget about NPOV... it'd be useless for the articles to be riddled with "Some people think this and other people think that and some people think this article shouldn't exist at all anyway.") - <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFurrykef_4620.html" title="User:Furrykef">furrykef</a> (<a href="../../../f/u/r/User_talk%7EFurrykef_1184.html" title="User talk:Furrykef">Talk at me</a>) 04:51, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I basically second that. A C++ compiler can be used to do template metaprogramming, but that's not what this "example" is. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Cherry_99df.html" title="User:Josh Cherry">Josh Cherry</a> 05:19, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I can understand your sentiment, but do recall that NPOV itself is a non-negotiable policy. As far as I can tell, this is definately metaprogramming from the point of view of an assembly programmer. <i>However</i> I'd be willing to change my mind, if it turns out that the definition given by <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaprogramming_%28programming%29.html" title="Metaprogramming (programming)">metaprogramming_(programming)</a> is wrong or lacking. In any case, IMHO this is not a job for VFD, but rather for cleanup. (which I admit might be needed) <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 09:32, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>OK, the whole POV issue aside, which upon reflection probably indeed does not belong here in VfD, the only use of this page, which is admitted within the page itself, is to isolate a really long assembly listing. I would think that including only a few sample lines and noting that the entire file is over 200 lines long is sufficient, which, if this can be agreed upon, removes any argument for the isolation of that content, and therefore removes any argument for the existence of this page, which is why it's listed on VfD rather than being discussed through talk pages. (Sorry for not being entirely clear on that.) - <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFurrykef_4620.html" title="User:Furrykef">furrykef</a> (<a href="../../../f/u/r/User_talk%7EFurrykef_1184.html" title="User talk:Furrykef">Talk at me</a>) 17:02, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Originally I'd wanted to make the example an exact parrallel of the bash code on <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaprogramming_%28programming%29.html" title="Metaprogramming (programming)">Metaprogramming (programming)</a>, which would have gone a long way towards what you might have preferred to see. Unfortunately, my version of gcc was ignoring the "optimisation" flags I'd set to get somewhere near to that result. I talked it through with one of the gcc crew and it turns out that this is in fact deliberate, and is actually normally a useful feature. (Except for me that is, Hmph! )</dd>
<dd>If we could find a better way to generate a (shorter!) example, then I'd have no trouble at all with merging that with the main article.&#160;:-)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Pointless. Merely mention of a disassembly flag on a compiler should be enough. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 05:26, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hmm, could have done that, but when I read about things I'm always insanely curious as to what an example might look like. So I was shamelessly catering to "people like me"&#160;;-). If you could somehow provide a shorter example, perhaps we could merge that into the metaprogramming article, if that's your preference. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 09:32, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But what the page describes isn't really metaprogramming. Metaprogramming is really writing a program that writes code, not using the compiler to generate code. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 21:21, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Consider for a moment, what's a compiler? Right, it's a program. So what you're saying (<i>"metaprogramming is really writing a program that writes/generates code, not writing a program that writes/generates code"</i>) doesn't make sense at all. Did you mean something else but make a thinko while typing? <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a>
<ul>
<li>No, I don't believe I did make a typo, and you did not copy what I had wrote verbatim. I shall clarify. Metaprogramming, as far as I can see, is <i>writing</i> a program <i>whose intended output is code</i>, not <i>using</i> a compiler that generates code. A program that prints "hello" and is compiled is not metaprogramming, but a program that prints "int main(void) {printf("hello") return 0;}" is. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 05:40, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ok, gotcha, not a thinko. Did you realize that a 4GL compiler is defined as a program that does exactly that? <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 08:07, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're still missing the point. You <i>don't write</i> the compiler, you merely execute it. Executing programs is not programming. Writing programs is. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 08:28, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For starters, you're only assuming I didn't write the compiler. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 15:06, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah, and generally the person who uses a compiler is somebody other than the one who wrote it.&#160;:) Isn't the bullet nesting level here enough, by the way? - <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFurrykef_4620.html" title="User:Furrykef">furrykef</a> (<a href="../../../f/u/r/User_talk%7EFurrykef_1184.html" title="User talk:Furrykef">Talk at me</a>) 20:07, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I recall having seen examples of code where <a href="../../../y/a/c/Yacc.html" title="Yacc">yacc</a> (/<a href="../../../b/i/s/Bison.html" title="Bison">bison</a>) is used, and the resulting compiler is immediately applied by the same program/package. So I'll grant it's uncommon, but it's certainly not unheard of. <small>(ps. You can't say I didn't warn you about this page getting messy!&#160;;) )</small> <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 21:03, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps then that isn't really metaprogramming then. To class what is and what isn't metaprogramming we need a firm definition: see my comment below. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 22:08, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think Kim and I have established that the definition of metaprogramming doesn't really belong in a VfD debate. I think even if this <i>is</i> metaprogramming, this page isn't useful at all and cannot really hope to be improved. - <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFurrykef_4620.html" title="User:Furrykef">furrykef</a> (<a href="../../../f/u/r/User_talk%7EFurrykef_1184.html" title="User talk:Furrykef">Talk at me</a>) 20:07, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that the outcome here will depend on the definition of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaprogramming_%28programming%29.html" title="Metaprogramming (programming)">Metaprogramming (programming)</a>, because the 2 pages are related. I'd be convinced one way or the other, depending on whether there is evidence showing that the definition is flawed. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 21:03, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is really a pick-one-definition-and-stick-to-it sort of discussion. The problem is we should use whatever preexisting definition out there, when there may in fact be none. The issue with using a definition that includes compilation to machine code as metaprogramming means that <i>all</i> programming is essentially metaprogramming, and that essentially sullies the word because then it has no real meaning. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 22:08, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps it's better to say that much modern day programming <i>depends</i> on metaprogramming at some point or other. You're not nescesarily doing it yourself. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 23:13, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>With the definition of metaprogramming extending to compilers, <b>all</b> programming is metaprogramming. The term "metaprogramming" then becomes meaningless. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 04:13, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think we're likely in <i>violent agreement</i>. Would you agree that the compiler writers themselves are actually doing metaprogramming? <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 08:12, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I don't necessarily agree that "all programming is metaprogramming", if that's what you mean&#160;;) I wouldn't agree that compiler writers are doing metaprogramming, for a few reasons, unless they are using the compiler to write compiler code. I think I've seen enough however to propose a definition, I shall do so on <a href="../../../m/e/t/Talk%7EMetaprogramming_%28programming%29_e449.html" title="Talk:Metaprogramming (programming)">Talk:Metaprogramming (programming)</a>. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 09:22, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
