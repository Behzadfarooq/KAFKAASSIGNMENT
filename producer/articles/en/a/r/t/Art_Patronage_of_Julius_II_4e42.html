<p><a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Julius_II_790c.html" title="Pope Julius II">Pope Julius II</a>, also known as <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giuliano_della_Rovere_3121.html" title="Giuliano della Rovere">Giuliano della Rovere</a>, was <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">pope</a> between 1503 and 1513. The time of his papal rule coincided with the age known as the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Renaissance_fbe6.html" title="High Renaissance">High Renaissance</a>. A contemporary writer of della Rovere, <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vasari.html" title="Vasari">Vasari</a>, coined this term, and it is still used today. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artists.html" title="Artists">Artists</a> such as <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelangelo.html" title="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/p/Raphael.html" title="Raphael">Raphael</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bramante.html" title="Bramante">Bramante</a> were at the height of their careers during this time, and all contributed to projects in the <a href="../../../v/a/t/Vatican.html" title="Vatican">Vatican</a> under Julius II’s patronage. While Julius II may best be remembered as the “warrior pope”, or for his <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machiavellian.html" title="Machiavellian">Machiavellian</a> tactics, his additions to the art collection of the Vatican may be his most impressive venture. He commissioned such projects as the painting of the <a href="../../../s/i/s/Sistine_Chapel_8b2a.html" title="Sistine Chapel">Sistine Chapel</a>’s ceiling, the reconstruction of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Peter%E2%80%99s_Basilica_87e4.html" title="St. Peter’s Basilica">St. Peter’s Basilica</a>, and the <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_of_Athens_b247.html" title="School of Athens">School of Athens</a>. His reasons for commissioning these, as well as other art works were varied. They served him political, spiritual and ascetical purposes. Also, during his papacy, the beginnings of the Protestant Reformation led to increased tension in <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, which caused the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Church_2beb.html" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> to lose influence and political power in Europe. Only hurting Julius II’s control was the fact that several of his predecessors were poor, unjust, and impious rulers who caused people to doubt the papal seat and the Vatican’s monopoly on religion. For these reasons, among others, Julius requested the magnificent and powerful images that are still so recognizable today. Julius II died <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_21.html" title="February 21">February 21</a>, 1513 amid an increasing struggle for the Catholic Church. Several of his commissions were still underway or unfinished by the time of his death.</p>

<p>During his reign, Julius II utilized his iconic status to his advantage, displaying his interest in the arts by placing himself on medals, emblems, and by commissioning specific artworks containing his image. Choosing to commission objects such as <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medals.html" title="Medals">medals</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/i/Coins.html" title="Coins">coins</a> is quite different from, having a self-portrait created. A medal or coin can be representative of an “antitype” or “modern counterpart” to typical, readable typologies that commonly appear in art. The “types” can serve as a code to decode antiquity, Renaissance or even Baroque art.</p>
<p>The most noticeable self-referencing image trend on the coins commissioned by Julius II was the “Della Rovere oak.” “The branches are arranged in St. Andrew’s crosses (horizontal X’s).” The Spernadino medal of Giuliano Della Rovere (1488) is a prime example of a representation of the “Della Rovere oak.” It is common to correlate such repetitions to scriptural references as allusions to Christianity and Faith. Although Julius did not lead a blameless, celibate lifestyle, he can be celebrated for his appreciation and contribution to the “High Renaissance” period.</p>
<p>Often, men of high rank in Renaissance culture would envision a portrait adorned with details of their bravery, vigor and accomplishment. Painted a year or so before his death, Raphael’s Portrait of Julius II, sometimes referred to as the “sitter”, is devoid of bravery and victory but drenched in modesty. The Pope sits upon his throne, eyes locked in a distant gaze. Clothed in garb untailored to the glorified Pope, he appears informal absent the traditional tiara or pontifical vestments. His hooded cape or mozzetta, his red velvet cap, his rings and accessories appear transient and invaluable. The only indication other than his physical image that the man sitting in the chair is Pope Julius II, Giuliano della Rovere, is the carved acorns in his throne.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Patronage_of_Julius_II_4e42.html" title="Edit section: Julius II and his Artists">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Julius II and his Artists</span></h2>
<p>The goal of Julius II’s art campaign in the Sistine Chapel and the Vatican library was reflected in the artists and architects that he commissioned. Raphael and Michelangelo were the greatest artists of their time and Bramante represented the most accomplished architect. Julius II’s goals as an art patron are shown by the virtue of these choices.</p>
<p>Julius first came to adore Michelangelo’s work after seeing The Pietá outside of the St Peter Basilica. Julius then commissioned him to design and sculpt an elaborate papal tomb that was to be placed in the middle of St. Peter’s Basilica. Michelangelo submitted a grand proposal to Julius of a free standing tomb that would be almost three stories tall with 40 fully sculpted figures. Michelangelo started the tomb but was then stopped by Julius to begin a new project, frescoing the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Even though Michelangelo had virtually no experience painting, Julius was set on having him paint the ceiling. Della Rovere wanted Michelangelo because of his reputation and the recognition that he would bring to the Sistine Chapel.</p>
<p>One of Pope Julius II’s largest and most well known commissions was the reconstruction of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Peter%E2%80%99s_Basilica_87e4.html" title="St. Peter’s Basilica">St. Peter’s Basilica</a>, beginning in 1506. When Julius took the papal office, the condition of the Church was extremely poor, and he took the opportunity to expand it, modernize it, and leave his impression forever on the Vatican. Julius hired <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donato_Bramante_cc4f.html" title="Donato Bramante">Donato Bramante</a> to design the Basilica, a prominent architect and artist of the day. This was seen as a surprise move at the time, many thought <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giuliano_da_Sangallo_0aa5.html" title="Giuliano da Sangallo">Giuliano da Sangallo</a> was the front runner for the commission. Della Rovere wanted the splendor of the new Cathedral to inspire awe in the masses, produce support for Catholicism and prove to his enemies he was a pious and devoted man. Bramante not only would fulfill these expectations with his design, but also with his character, which may explain why della Rovere chose him over Sangallo. “Bramante wanted to build a Basilica that would ‘surpass in beauty, invention, art and design, as well as in grandeur, richness and adornment all the buildings that had been erected in that city’" (Scotti, 47).</p>
<p>Raphael came to work for the Pope because of his friendship with Bramante. Bramante had been in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> working for the Pope when he sent a letter to Raphael telling him that he had convinced Julius to allow Raphael to paint some of the rooms in the Stranza della Segnatura. Raphael who had been working on other commission in Florence immediately dropped his projects and moved to Rome to work for the Pope, but when he arrived he found many great artists painting in the Stranza della Segnatura. When he finished the Vatican Library, he amazed Julius II so much that according to Vasari the chose "to destroy all the scenes painted by other masters from the past and present, so that Raphael alone would be honored above all those who labored on the paints which had been done up to that time"(Vasari, 314).</p>

<p>Generally, scholars have taken one of two sides regarding the many magnificent commissions of Julius II. The first, more widely accepted viewpoint is that Julius was an extravagant patron. He was know by scholars to be a patron purely for selfish motives, imposing aspirations, and a grandiose self image. (Gosman, 43). Scholars accept that the probable and foremost reason was that it would be a way to forever leave his mark on the Catholic Church. Many argue that Julius was using art to further extend his own Papacy, as well as the role of Popes to come. Julius II’s Papacy is frequently looked down upon for it is common conception that he was keen for glory, which is reflective in his nickname, “The Warrior Pope” (Gosman, 50). The Pope was an extremely proud and motivated man, who aspired to be remembered as one of the greatest popes in history. Building the largest Cathedral, Saint Peter’s Basilica, in the world would certainly add to the Pope’s résumé. Many also discredit Julius II for having repeatedly identified himself with <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Caesar_5dfd.html" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>. His desire to emulate Caesar and his extravagant patronage further the negative connotations (Scholars have drawn this conclusion from the medal his had made for Saint Peters with himself on the back and his self chosen name of Julius). (Gosman, 44) Another reason for these commissions is said to be a blatant attempt to display his and the Church’s wealth. Essentially, Julius II was advertising the bountifulness of Catholicism. It is argued that he tried to win the masses over with grand and majestic marvels that would inspire awe, reverence and even fear. Modern scholars also argue that the Pope was attempting to prove his piety in the eyes of both the Church and the people. Julius II was not regarded as an extremely “religious” man; many, in fact, thought of him as the opposite. In Julius’s eyes constructing such a large religious site would help him prove his devotion to God and the Church. Scholars believe that Julius II was well aware that the artwork he was commissioning could convey powerful messages, and thus the reason he was commissioning them.</p>
<p><br />
The second, less common stance is that Julius’s main motive for his patronage was for his own personal aesthetic pleasure (Gosman, 45). One scholar defends Julius II's patronage by stating;</p>
<p><br />
<i>“It must not be forgotten that not all messages conveyed in works commissioned by a patron, let alone those merely addressed to him, can be read as a communication by the patron of his thinking and claims and aspirations. To say this is not to deny that messages may be read into them, but it should not be assumed that patrons would necessarily have cared about or understood or been motivated by theories and statements about their power and authority that may be coded into the works of art they paid for".</i> (Gosman, 61)</p>
<p><br />
Scholars argue that these works can not be literally taken as a guide to the ideas of the Pope himself. These scholars point out that it was not solely the patron pulling the strings behind these imposing works of art, but a group of people working together. For example, Julius appears in several of Raphael’s frescos, it is a known fact that he approved his placement there. However, modern scholars are only inferring that this is with his instruction with facts to support the notion that Julius did indeed desire to be painted in the frescos. (Gosman, 55) Julius was, according to some scholars, a man who appreicated art, took pleasure in building, and merely wanted to create grand places to live in which are must more important than the desire to project political ideas and the images of his power. (Gosman, 55)</p>
