<p>Ok, I understand that WP only wants to see "verifiable proof" that an artist has been successful all over the place...which really confuses me. Obviously in ths case we have a person that has accomplished MUCH in his career (read "Accomplishments") and yet because he has not had songs on the top 40 charts, WP wants to see him deleted. Very, very sad and unfortunate indeed...but typical. If a person hasn't made millions, nobody cares.</p>
<p>This person travelled with one of the most well-known Christian music artists, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rich_Mullins_3e08.html" title="Rich Mullins">Rich Mullins</a>, yet should I assume that the article would need some sort of proof of this? Too bad it was in the early 80's, and now that Mr. Mullins has passed away, we can't get a quote from him.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am willing to "tone down alot" the "hagiography" as requested, if you'll allow this well written, well laid out, and interesting article to remain on WP. Either way, I had fun spending my ENTIRE DAY putting this article together, only to have it nominated for deletion before the ink was dry.</p>

<dd>I'm afraid that it <i>is</i> our policy (see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) that all our information has to be verifiable by independent third-party sources, and that all our articles have to establish the notability of their subject matter. As a musician, Mr Behnken is subject to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> to establish his notability - if you can prove that he satisfies any one of the conditions on that page, the article can stay. You may also want to look at the general <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines; it's quite possible that he may be notable as an evangelist rather than a musician, but we'll still need independent proof of this. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 05:38, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is not impossible that the same publicist caused the same text to be cut and pasted there and here. Album charts for contemporary Christian music do exist.

<p>I can tell you that I personally communicated with the folks at CD Baby and YES, they in fact DID copy/paste the information from the article I WROTE which has appeared throughout the Internet at various times. And, I might mention here that the reference to the charts was made in regard to the earliest release (1988), and I would like you to point me to any records of the 1988 CHRISTIAN charts (Not "Billboard") online so I can use them as my source.

<p>OK, I put the only magazine articles from the late 80's I could find on the article, which falls in line with WP:MUSIC MAIN CRITERION: "It has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent from the musician/ensemble itself and reliable. - This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, magazine articles, and television documentaries" Kutlessfan777 06:04, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have now added information in the article about Mr. Behnken's long-time producer and keyboardist, Jason Webb, who fits in with the WP:MUSIC criterion #5: "Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable"Kutlessfan777 06:51, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, it states on the Notability page: "A musician or ensemble (note that this includes a band, singer, rapper, orchestra, hip hop crew, DJ, musical theatre group, etc.) is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria"</p>
<p>According to this statement, Mr. Behnken is, in fact, notable. He has met 2 of the notability requirements, including the main criterion. Kutlessfan777 07:12, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> (vote changed, see below). First, I'll make something clear: I may be biased. I have some issues with the horn-tooting about somebody's evangelistic accomplishments - this is something you do for God, not something you do to boast about what you do for God! That said, I'll put aside my personal problems with this, since Wikipedia is <i>definitely</i> not the place to go on about this, and note that there are major POV issues with this article. Aside from that, it's clear he's notable within <i>at least</i> the Christian music realms, if not within Christianity as a whole, but there is the issue that intra-group notability is not <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> as far as meets the Wikipedia standards (we've seen much of that with some of the furry deletia recently), and it's exceedingly rare that a Christian artist breaks out of the strongholds of CCM - those inside consider doing so harmful, and of the few who actually do, most seem to fail spectacularly. I'm also not seeing assertion within the article of meeting <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Clean up the article or get rid of it. Note to Kutlessfan777, please note that this is not a slight at you, but I would strongly encourage you to change my mind. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 09:00, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I have left a note on the user's talk page suggesting possible ways to improve the article. If this *cannot* be done, then I guess I will have to go with delete.

<dd>Update - found 2 cites from 2001 and 1994 which reference his trips to China and Uzbekistan, but both are from the local newspaper Dayton Daily News in Dayton, Ohio. I'm surprised that no Asian-region or US newspapers or religious journals reported on the China visit in particular. The reference to the "Samarakand city museum" seems suspect - I tried searching under "Samarkand", the correct spelling, and found no reference to Lee at all. If anyone can think of anywhere else to look, this article might be salvageable - but it's leaning towards a rather reluctant delete from me&#160;:( <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 12:47, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for youur comments, Dennisthe2. I must point out you are then in disagreement with articles on such people as <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Graham_526a.html" title="Billy Graham">Billy Graham</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_Graham_446a.html" title="Franklin Graham">Franklin Graham</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gaither_a3f3.html" title="Bill Gaither">Bill Gaither</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_W._Smith_dd4b.html" title="Michael W. Smith">Michael W. Smith</a>, and so on and so on. It just happens to be their career, and it is their American right to have a career as an evangelist. Anyway, these folks can have an article I suppose because they have won awards and sold millions of books and records in their careers as evengelists. You're right, WP is not the place to go on about this, since it is clear that WP allows articles on such people.And once again I repeat that the article now meets WP:MUSIC criterion #5: "Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable." I have inserted the criteria here exactly as it appears in WP"MUSIC, so I'm not sure why there's any question. As for China and Uzbekistan, we have plenty of photos. Is that sufficient? Or not because we took them? We have photos from several different concert venues in the Philippines, as well as appearances in Thailand. As for why there are no articles in Chinese newspapers about the TV event, might it be because China is a Communist country? They do not necessarily support an event that has an American singing a "Christian" song on their airwaves. I can understand why there might not be any press on this. However, we may have some things in print that are not online. Does every source have to be an online source? Still learning.Kutlessfan777 17:59, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Don't get me wrong, I'm not harping about their careers - but thinking more about it, it's kind of a paradox. That aside, I'm looking closer at it, and you're right: it does meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> (and maybe just so), but its references are a bit hidden. That leaves the issue of <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">POV</a>: it reads more like something for a church or for <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvest_Crusade_60f2.html" title="Harvest Crusade">Harvest Crusade</a> than an encyclopedia article, and many people who read this article are going to balk when they see that it's got a Christian evangelistic bent in its tone. As such, I'm changing my vote to <b>Keep</b>, but it needs cleanup due to the point of view problem. (Yes, I know, sanitizing it and all, but...well, know your audience.) --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 19:31, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My opinion only, but the consensus lies between weak keep and weak delete, and work can be done on this article to improve it. I don't think there's any doubt that within the field or area this individual is notable, so it wouldn't fail notability - the main issue is verifiability and published reliable sources, which I would think to be more of a cleanup issue. Perhaps what we should do, and what I might propose as a compromise that could be acceptable to all here, is to close this AfD debate, whack a big cleanup tag on it, fix it up, find more sources (I've found two, Kutless may have a few more) and if within, say, 2 or 3 weeks we haven't got or can't get it to the stage where it's a decent article that cites sources, then revisit this debate. (In answer to a question you asked me, Kutless - a magazine that is out of print can be a reliable source as long as someone else can find it in a library somewhere. Much of my work is with geographical articles and most of the information can only be found in either the nearest local library or in the State Library.) What do others think? <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 20:37, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To be honest, I don't think we've even established that he's notable within the CCM community. We have two album reviews from 15 years ago, and two articles in a local newspaper. As an absolute minimum, I think we need evidence that he's been in the CCM charts. We should, of course, let the AfD run to completion, but I still think that we should delete the article if more sources aren't forthcoming, with no predjudice against re-creation if such sources are found subsequently. I'm sorry to sound sceptical, but it's important for us not to rely on unsupported assertions of notability. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 21:18, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will do my part. However, I want to point out to Tevildo that you continue to ignore the fact that the article DOES meet the requirements of WP:MUSIC criterion #5: "Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable." I have inserted the criteria here exactly as it appears in WP:MUSIC. Why does this continue to be overlooked? It is very clearly spelled out, and WP:MUSIC is very clear in the criteria. If the notable sources are weak, but nonetheless are THERE and may just need "cleaned up" as Orderinchaos suggests, AND criteria #5 is covered without question, then why do you still suggest keeping this debate open?Kutlessfan777 21:31, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That would only apply if Mr Behnken and Mr Webb performed together as a group (rather than as soloist and accompanist) - and, indeed, if Mr Webb <i>is</i> notable. We have no article on him at present, and his involvement with the (undeniably notable) <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gaither_%28Gospel_singer%29_ca8f.html" title="Bill Gaither (Gospel singer)">Bill Gaither</a> doesn't appear to be major. I'm not saying that this applies to the current situation, but a session musician _might_ be notable for performing with a major artist; that doesn't automatically convey notability on anyone who's ever performed with that session musician. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 22:01, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
