<p>Article is spam.</p>
<p>Claims:</p>
<p>According to Google's PageRank, her site gets more hits than any other BBW sites, and by a sizable margin. [1]</p>
<p>However, the PageRank is basically a measure of how many links you have to you. Links such as wikipedia.org, which counts a lot as a very big site.</p>
<p>PageRank does NOT measure hits, it measures the number and weight of inbound links. In addition, the supplied link shows very low page rank, although it is higher than the other articles in t hat directory. However, the directory makes no claim to be definitive for BBW sites.</p>
<p>In any case, a more real measure of site popularity is alexa.com, which shows it is the 587,155th site in the world <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.fatfemnudist.com" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.fatfemnudist.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.fatfemnudist.com</a></p>
<p>Until the 587,154 sites above it are listed, this article should be deleted. --<small style="line-height:130%">unsigned listing and comments by User:87.74.12.83</small></p>

<li>Excuse me, anonymous poster, but this article is NOT spam. If the reference to Google's PageRank offends you, I'll remove it now. As stated elsewhere, I think there's <i>ample</i> reason for inclusion, especially considering that Wikipedia already has pages devoted to such less-notable porn sites as <a href="../../../w/i/f/Wifey%27s_World_ae3b.html" title="Wifey's World">Wifey's World</a> and <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideepthroat.html" title="Ideepthroat">Ideepthroat</a>. For that matter, Wikipedia is filled with entries for little-known musicians, artists, and even obscure role-playing game characters. At least fatfemnudist has been seen by many hundreds of thousands of people, and I don't think I'm required to have to make articles for the 587,154 sites you mentioned before doing this one. But give me time, and I will. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 02:42, 12 November 2005 (UTC) <i>Note: <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">Wikipediatrix</a> is the article's author.</i></li>

<li>Wifey's world is many times better known. I have actually heard of wifey. It also has been seen by many times more people. <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=www.wifeysworld.com" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=www.wifeysworld.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=www.wifeysworld.com</a> cf. <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=www.fatfemnudist.com" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=www.fatfemnudist.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=www.fatfemnudist.com</a> I am not saying wifey's world deserves an entry (on balance I think not, an encyclopedia of minor porn sites is a bit odd), but fatfemnudist definitely doesn't. I actually find your claim that fatfemnudist has beenseen by hundreds of thousands of people (how do you know?) extremely difficult to believe, given that traffic graph. I also note that a google search for link:www.fatfemnudist.com only finds three links. 87.74.12.83 10:12, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Firstly, I don't claim Wikipedia should be a web guide. Not all websites are notable. I would say this one IS a trailblazer and innovator for reasons I could expound upon if anyone really is listening. Secondly, the page is really just as much about the minor web-celebrity "fatfemnudist" herself, not just her site. This can be clarified and cleaned up if deemed necessary. Thirdly, fatfemnudist's site and her posts on amateur-porn message boards are well known to, well, <i>those who know</i>. If you're not a devotee of the amateur BBW pic-post world, then you may not have heard of her, but if you're not a marine biologist, then you probably haven't heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicoflagellate" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicoflagellate" rel="nofollow">Silicoflagellates</a> either.

<li><b>Delete</b>. There are a number of people who <i>have</i> gained a significant measure of notability in the field of amateur porn. There is no evidence to support the claims by the article's author that "fatfemnudist" is more notable than those people, and in fact I've just done a simple experiment. On a P2P program (which of course I just downloaded <b>only</b> for the purpose of this experiment of course of course) I type in "ideepthroat" and get 410 hits. I type in "Wifey's" and get 196 hits. I type in "Dawn's" (for Dawn's Place) and get 78 after subtracting five accidental hits. I type in "fatfemnudist" and get 0. Now, consider that Wifey's World, Dawn's Place, and Ideepthroat are all <i>pay</i> sites that don't <i>want</i> people sharing their stuff; fatfemnudist <i>wants</i> people sharing -- but no one is. It kind of dispels the claim that fatfemnudist is more notable than all of those. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:54, 12 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Mr.Feldspar, surely you can understand that commercial sites like Wifey's are far more likely to generate hits than ffn's. What I think I haven't made clear is the fact that ffn's web-popularity is largely through her posts on adult pic-post sites and XXX message boards, almost <i>none</i> of which get fully crawled by search engines. I am curious to know who you mean when you say that there <i>are</i> notable people in the world of amateur porn. Let me know and I'll do articles on them too (By definition, professional paysites like Wifey's and Dawn's are not amateur porn in the true sense). I think the <i>real</i> dangerous precedent here is the "I've never heard of her, so she's not notable" mindset. Most people have never heard of MOST of what's in Wikipedia: that's why human beings need encyclopedias. I know ffn is very well-known in certain (shady) circles of the net because I've witnessed it firsthand for several years. She's no <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennicam.html" title="Jennicam">jennicam</a>, of course, but by some people's criteria, apparently even jennicam doesn't warrant an entry here. Anyway, I won't berate the point, but I do sense an anti-porn bias here (as well as sockpuppetry). <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 20:45, 12 November 2005 (UTC) <i>Note: <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">Wikipediatrix</a> is the article's author.</i>
<ul>
<li>The fact that you choose to classify fatfemnudist as "true" amateur porn and Wifey's World as somehow not true amateur porn is really irrelevant; we're not asking "is this person notable within their league-determined competition category" but "is this person notable?" No evidence has been submitted that shows that fatfemnudist is notable; we only have the testimony of the article's author that she is. Be careful with your accusations, by the way; accusing people of being sockpuppets just because they say things you don't like is the sort of thing that damages the accuser much more than the accused. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 03:03, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wow. Did I accuse any specific person of being a sockpuppet? No. And if I did, it would be for far more tangible reasons than "just because they say things I don't like", so <i>you</i> need to plug up <i>your own</i> emitter of accusations, okay? Okay. (Also, you didn't answer my question before, asking you to be specific about your earlier comments. My question was not a rhetorical one.) Clearly certain folks are getting cranky and all up in my face now, so I suppose I will regard this article as a lost cause for the nonce. I had hoped for a higher level of discussion than this though. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 03:36, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>You don't want to just bandy around vague accusations of sockpuppetry. Levelling these claims, in effect, at everyone who voted <i>delete</i> is just as bad as accusing an specific individual. Did you mean me? Geogre perhaps? Maybe "Mr. Anonymous User"? Everyone who voted <i>delete</i> is the subject of your petty attack. Don't try to trivialize people or their opinions just because they don't agree with you. <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyk_0a6a.html" title="User:Reyk">Reyk</a> 01:34, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think your inflammatory and false-assumption-laden statement is far more uncalled-for than my brief and cryptic passing reference to sockpuppetry. If you really think I intended "everyone who voted delete" as the subject of my alleged "attack", you seriously might lack the reading comprehension skills necessary for Wikipedia. I said no such thing, nor did I even hint at it, so stop trying to put words in my mouth, Jack. And hey, I abandoned this dead horse already, why are you still flogging it? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 05:11, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - if you actually looked at the web site, it is basically a personal homepage. This person called Linda wrote it, and all of the pictures are of herself. Yes, they are pornographic pictures, but that doesn't stop it from being a homepage. She doesn't have a single picture of anyone other than herself in there. Its free, yes, for a reason. Whilst there have been girls who have made pornographic homepages and then charged people for entry - and also for example famous models (and porn stars) who have had free pornographic web sites, this is not one of them. This classifies comfortably as a vanity page. Perhaps the article shouldn't have been deleted without a discussion, but it should have been deleted just the same. Unless you're is Linda or you think that Linda is hot, I don't see why you'd want this in the encyclopaedia full stop.203.122.218.47 16:16, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
