This is already listed at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Toronto_parks_12ab.html" title="List of Toronto parks">List of Toronto parks</a>, and the article adds little additional information.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Non-notability is not necessarily a factor when deciding whether or not to keep an article. Moreover, in his above comment, <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> severely misrepresents the state parks in Toronto, as well as their converage on Wikipedia. Not only are there many parks deserving of articles, there's a whole category that includes a substantial portion of them. While the article is rather paltry at the moment, it does provide useful information, and it is frequently the case that great articles start out small. Another consideration is that this appears to be the first article Daloonik has created. While this alone can't be a reason not to delete, it can be a reason to err on the side of <i>keep</i>, as destroying the work of a contributor who took the initiative to learn enough about Wikipedia to create an article, including apparently going out to take pictures specifically for the article, is only likely to discourage a user who has shown he can make useful edits from continuing to participate on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. It's a park in Toronto. There is nothing encyclopaedic about that; all the necessary exposition possible on an unnotable park is within the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Toronto_parks_12ab.html" title="List of Toronto parks">List of Toronto parks</a>. The park has no special features or unique aspects that make it anything more than a patch of grass and trees. Quite frankly, if it wasn't already going through AFD, I'd <b>speedy delete</b> the article as containing no significant content. The article states "Fairbank Memorial Park is a park in Toronto. There's a street to the west, and it has a community centre". That's not even a substub. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i><b>/</b>/<b>/</b></i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 09:14, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I don't get it. How is a 1 block park a "notable public resource"? Look at a Google earth or something and you'll see what this is: a park with a baseball field and a basketball court. Any city the size of Toronto has about 100 of these. So even by a conservative estimate there are hundreds of thousands of parks like this all over the world. I don't see how any future editor will be motivated to expand this. <b>Half of the edit history is due to racist vandalism</b> created by user:Daloonik and user:Stanfordandson (who incidently voted above to keep the page).

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Vandalism isn't a reason for deletion.

If vandalism is a problem, request semi-protection for the article. As to your other point, neither you nor I have any idea as to which articles hypothetical future editors will want to expand. We have some very nice articles on small urban parks, such as <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Bunche_Park_e018.html" title="Ralph Bunche Park">Ralph Bunche Park</a> (to cite one example), so it's certainly not out of the question that some editor will improve this one. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 17:56, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> note that I am not saying that the article should be deleted because of vandalism. All I am saying is that an article about an <i>un-notable small park</i> (unlike <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Bunche_Park_e018.html" title="Ralph Bunche Park">Ralph Bunche Park</a>) is a door left open for <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trolling.html" title="Trolling">trolling</a>. Keeping the article means having admins patrolling it to remove inappropriate edits and then facing accusations of stalking (again, pls take a look at the edit history).

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I've already looked at the edit history, thanks, and my opinion is unchanged.

<dd>You keep _saying_ that, but your argument about "denying useful information" breaks down for articles, like this one, that contain _no_ useful information.

<dd>Right now, even though it's a stub, the article still indicates the location of the park within Toronto and the existence of a community center within the park. It also provides two photographs of the park, indicating that the north end is mostly level ground, with a paved area containing children's playground equipment. That is useful information for someone interested in the subject, and it's information that wouldn't be available from a plain entry on a list. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 22:16, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The list of Toronto parks, though it may seem large, is in fact incomplete. It would make that article even more cumbersome to merge this current article with that one. I would also like to draw people's attention to what wikipedia really is. This is a place for information to be shared, and although most of you may have never visited this park in person, there might be somebody who would want pictures of this park, and would like to find them somewhere on the internet; this is the place for that. Trivialising an urban park, small as it may be, should not be done on wikipedia. In time, I would like to see an article with photographs of every urban park in Toronto, and the list of Toronto parks containing links to each of those parks. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank <a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a> for expanding the article. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivelequebeclibre_b54e.html" title="User:Vivelequebeclibre">Vivelequebeclibre</a> 23:12, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
