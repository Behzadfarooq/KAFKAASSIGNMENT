<li><b>Comment</b>: Appears to be a notable internet incident/phenomenon, however I can't find any offline sources. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 00:06, 29 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - the incident that prompted a large proportion of the discussion about her only happened at the end of last week. I think that's too recently for any offline sources that are likely to be interested (e.g. publishing trade or free speech related publications) to have had a chance to discuss her yet. I'm pretty sure we'll see some, and a number of important online sources have featured articles about her. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 08:36, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>: I wrote some of what was deleted, trying to explain context of why this is here without it being an attack. If Bauer was merely one of twenty agents on this rather important, widely-disseminated list, I would agree that she's non-notable. What distinguishes her from the rest of the 20 is that she has allegedly tried to have an editor fired, successfully campaigned to get a web community with thousands of members (Absolute Write) shut down on an hour's notice, and generally threatened many of those who initially disseminated the list with spurious claims of illegality, specifically that publishing her email address (which she has publicly posted elsewhere) constitutes copyright infringement and spamming. This is well documented on Making Light and probably elsewhere, from several sources (check the comment thread in ML). I expect this will spill over into print media eventually. It was this campaign of intimidation that caused many, many writers and bloggers to write on their blogs about her, and to Googlebomb her in retaliation. So basically, she's notable for having allegedly a) overcharged for services without producing producing professional sales, b) caused inconvenience and in one case economic harm to her perceived enemies in her attempts to suppress the list, without any legal basis to do so, and c) for being the victim of retaliatory Googlebombing. I suspect this article was originally written on this basis, but I think there is an element of notability, especially if an actual lawsuit arises as a result of the Absolute Write debacle. That has, by the way, a much larger story than just the Bauer part in it.<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> 02:27, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and clean up, probably by <b>undeleting</b> the original, since it was better sourced and better written than the current incarnation at the time it was unceremoniously dumped. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 08:37, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, at least in the short term. There's been credible evidence presented else-net of unscrupulous behaviour by this person, and we probably have two opposed factions here. Delete the article, and one side wins. Keep the article, and its history, and keep the content verifiable, and maybe everybody wins. I'd agree that being on that 20 Worst Agents list isn't enough to make Barbara Bauer notable. Her apparent involvement with the <b>Absolute Write</b> shutdown, which raises issues of free speech, the security of user data on websites, and possibly much more, tips the balance. I think this page could be a part of a little thicket of linked pages, as the situation develops, and all of them may need guarding against biased and unscrupulous changes.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: This is rather the point. There appears to be no documented evidence that a single client has been paid for his or her writing as a direct result of Ms. Bauer's activities. If such a person does exist and can be discovered, the article should include that information. Also on the positive/neutral side, and not yet present, is Ms. Bauer's PhD, which has been researched and found to be legitimate, and any other biographical information of note.
<ul>
<li>There's a list of clients on her website. Unfortunately, as you might expect, none appear to be notable, the same sort of problem you'd run into if you listed the "Notable alumni" of diploma mills or the "Notable authors" of vanity publishers. I agree that stronger documentary evidence is called for to bring this up to snuff. BY the way, where <i>is</i> her Ph.d from? Not even her website mentions that. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 04:58, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: this lady is well-known—notorious, even—on various writing-related mailing lists.
