<p>this guy is just a professor, there really are lots of professors. Not only is no mention of why he is notable. It really appears he is not notable. <a href="../../../n/l/s/User%7ENlsanand_c56d.html" title="User:Nlsanand">Nlsanand</a> 21:40, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Do NOT Delete</b> as Prof. Mohammed is primarily notable with respect to his thesis concerning support for the establishment of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>, which is a controversial position for a muslim scholar <a href="http://www.sdjewishjournal.com/stories/aug04_4.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sdjewishjournal.com/stories/aug04_4.html" rel="nofollow">(link)</a>. A simple Google search for him makes it clear that he is a well-regarded and well-travelled speaker, especially as to the controversial subject of Israel/<a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine.html" title="Palestine">Palestine</a>. I would add that information to article but I do not possess enough information or knowledge on that exact subject to add the appropriate content; perhaps a current student or graduate assistant could do so? It makes me wonder if the inclusion of this article into AFD has more to do with him being a professor at <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego_State_University_abb7.html" title="San Diego State University">San Diego State University</a> (a <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_State_University_37c3.html" title="California State University">California State University</a> campus rather than a <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California_04ab.html" title="University of California">University of California</a> campus) and not so much as being perceived as non-notable; perhaps if he was a professor elsewhere this article wouldn't have been identified as AFD. Unfortunately, if the majority consider him "simply a professor at a mid-tier school" then we had better delete this article. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStreltzer_2ab2.html" title="User:Streltzer">Streltzer</a> 22:53, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The second half of the introductory paragraph is copied from the subject's web page at <a href="http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~khaleel/" class="external free" title="http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~khaleel/" rel="nofollow">http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~khaleel/</a> ... since there are no references or citations that support <i><b>any</b></i> of the criteria in <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>, I don't see how you can say it "seems to be met here." Show me just one link in the article to a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reputable source</a> that satisfies just one of them! The "assertion" that it fails is self-evident and implicit in the <b>fact</b> that it <b>does not satisfy <i>any</i> of the criteria</b> ... and the burden of proof that it satisfies the criteria lies with the supporters, not the detractors ... a personal web page and a bio from the "Carol Fass Publicity &amp; Public Relations" website do not even come close, since both are explicitly forbidden reference sources for notability ... that link for <a href="http://www.cias.sdsu.edu/" class="external free" title="http://www.cias.sdsu.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cias.sdsu.edu/</a> is useless even as proof that he is "a core faculty member of SDSU's Center for Islamic and Arabic Studies" because his name is not mentioned on the linked page, or any page to which it is linked. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennette_c7df.html" title="User:Dennette">Dennette</a> 01:11, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Could you explain to me (possibly insert in the article) how he meets the professor test? Prof test means you have to be more than a university professor. If this guy meets the test, can I start writing articles on all my uni professors. I may be willing to accept that he is well known, however, I really haven't seen it in this article. Every professor has had work submitted. What particularly worries me is if this article exists alone because of his support of the State of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>. Having a controversial view alone, does not warrant having your own article. Should we have articles about every Jewish professor who has come to the conclusion that Israel is actually the modern day South Africa? I bet there's a lot more of those. No, they have to be noteworthy because of what they have done with that view (ie many works, and notoriety in a more general sector). Mohammed appears not to have done it. Also, I dont want to judge San Diego State, however I think the academic ranking and population of the school is somewhat important in determining notability. Maybe, I'm wrong. <a href="../../../n/l/s/User%7ENlsanand_c56d.html" title="User:Nlsanand">Nlsanand</a> 04:36, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> many professors have published their dissertation and 2 or 3 more articles in refereed journals, then avioded any more such effort, and have had no influence or note outside the classroom or departmental committees. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:04, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I agree with Samir ... this is just an average academic who has published one paper a year since 1996 ... while the subject may have <i>written</i> many articles, there has been nothing <i>written about</i> the subject that establishes their notability in their field. According to Wiki policy, it is the responsibility of the supporters to show that the subject satisfies the criteria (in this case <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>), and I cannot find any citations in the article to satisfy <i>either</i> of them. It's not a question of how much they have published ... "notability" is a measure of how much has been published <i>about them</i>, and that is the evidence which the supporters have failed to provide ... none of the "Keep" votes (including <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a>) has offered any indication <b>in the article</b> of how the subject <i>satisfies</i> the criteria, whereas the "Delete" votes only need to say, "I don't see anything that satisfies the criteria". --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennette_c7df.html" title="User:Dennette">Dennette</a> 16:01, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I added a significant amount of biographical and "notable" information to the article. I hope to add more.

<li><b>Keep</b> His public advocacy work and the fact that he has been engaged as a consultant to goverments (including here in Quebec) suggest, to me, that he has a notability beyond academia. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShawn_in_Montreal_5a73.html" title="User:Shawn in Montreal">Shawn in Montreal</a> 18:07, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> What "public advocacy work"? What "consultant to governments"? There is <i>nothing</i> in the article about either of those claims, and unless you can provide some <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source citations</a>, we only have <i>your word</i> that the statements are true, which makes such claims just <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverified</a> <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> that cannot be included in the article ... lack of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> citations is what this AfD is about ... unless you can show <i>citations</i> for those claims, they are just rumors, and thus invalidate your "Keep" vote. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennette_c7df.html" title="User:Dennette">Dennette</a> 01:18, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Any unverified statements can be tagged as such. You're right, they should be backed with citations. The article needs to be improved, as do many.

<dd>Also, just to clear up any possible misunderstanding: I mentioned advocacy and government consultancy because they <i>are</i> mentioned in the article, however incompletely.
