<li><b>Comment</b>: Just now I trawled the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Category%7EPolitical_books_513b.html" title="Category:Political books">Category: Political books</a> and listed all those that dealt wholly or mainly with Bush or his Presidency. As most of the conservative writers these days tend to be writing about the twin evils of liberalism and Islam, this may give the list a somewhat lopsided appearance. There aren't a lot of articles about hagiographies of Bush around, that I can see. I suggest that this could be remedied by writing such articles. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 13:43, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Legit and useful list - if your concern is POV, then list the right-wing books as well. The solution to bias speeched is counter-bias, not censorship. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 14:05, 2005 Jun 20 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, enough there to be useful, enough books about Bush to be encyclopedic topic. In most cases I would have thought "Books about X" belong in the article on X but in the case of Bush where the article is so long, a separate article is justified. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:02, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep but expand</b> to more than a list of books, give both pro- and anti- and contrast their viewpoints, and talk about their social and political significance. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">â˜º</a> 16:03, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. That article is rather large at the moment.

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - just an afterthought - shouldn't this be a "List of..."; or if not, shouldn't the article delve a bit into the fairly recent phenomena of dozens of critical (and some laudatory) books being written about sitting presidents? I may be too young to speak wisely on this, but it seems to me the phenomenon only began when Reagan was in office. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 20:57, 2005 Jun 20 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Worthwhile spin-off of the main article. In some cases there are simply too many works to comfortably accommodate in an article's references list. I agree the list should include pro- and con- books to be NPOV. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 22:09, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Merge contents into appropriate articles and <b>delete</b>. Separating the references from the article is a bad precedent. If an article is too large, the remedy should be to split up the article, each piece carrying appropriate references. An unannotated bibliography does not stand alone as an encyclopedic article. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 00:35, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Exactly...I was just imagining having hundreds of "Books about" pages. Messy, messy, messy. There are many topics that have a more extensive literature than Mr. Bush (French Revolution, World War II, Chess?). It is indeed a very bad precedent, and I don't see why a long references section is necessarily a bad thing. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades</a> 01:00, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: It seems unlikely that all these books are actually being used as "references" in the GWB article. Books that are actually used to verify facts in that article should also be mentioned there, but as I understand it this is a general list of books about George W. Bush, not even implying that anyone here has actually turned a single page. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 05:03, 2005 Jun 23 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Merge into relevant articles if someone has the energy.

<li>Amazon.com is great, but it has no ambition to be NPOV and I can't edit its pages. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 22:44, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Amazon strives to achieve <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> by balancing - which is an acceptable way to do things on the Wikipedia too. It does a more thorough job of it, and maintains its <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> better by adding everything within a narrow remit (books only) with nothing taken away, reverted, blanked, scrambled or vandalized. Such flexibility is important in WP, as is a wider remit, but there's no need to duplicate other, far more authoritative and comprehensive sources. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a web directory, and by the same token it should not try to be a ISBN listing service. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 00:41, Jun 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>You just made that up. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 01:24, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ummm....? Ok, it's not Amazon's stated policy, but they must surely try to get as many books to sell as they can and they don't seem to have a POV to push in the meantime. Was that what you meant?-<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 02:35, Jun 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I meant that the statement "Amazon strives to achieve <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> by balancing" was a fabrication. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:21, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't suppose they do it as a matter of explicit policy, no, but as a matter of implicit final-result I'm fairly sure they're pretty NPOV. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 13:54, Jun 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A very encyclopedic list, could use expanding though. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaibabsquirrel_3907.html" title="User:Kaibabsquirrel">Kaibabsquirrel</a> 22:42, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. In addition to agreeing with <a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades</a>, I don't think that "about George W. Bush" is a specific enough topic to keep it from falling within category 2 of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> An Indiscriminate Collection of Information. As previously noted, "Books About George W. Bush" would make a great category, but as a list, it doesn't work because it doesn't type the book: are they purposefully pro- or anti-Bush, are they about one term or both, do they even address his Presidency at all or just his Governorship of Texas, do they address one specific policy/event only, etc? To even be a useful list, the list would have to get broken up, and I don't feel right voting to keep an article that'd have to become nothing but a categorized list of books under such an "umbrella" topic, especially not when that list's better placed in the George W. Bush article and best placed in the form of a category. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 04:45, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but annotate the list with a short comment for each book, and remove all the redlinks. I think the Literate Engineer is wrong in saying this would make a great Category. The big trouble with Categories is that they can only list books that have Wikipedia articles about them. It couldn't include books of borderline notability: important enough to be listed, but not important enough to be the subject of a whole article. And, or course, it's even harder to anotate a category than a list. Face it, categories are totally useless for this sort of thing. Give me lists any time. <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson"></a> â€” <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson">P Ingerson</a> <a href="../../../p/_/i/User_talk%7EP_Ingerson_766c.html" title="User talk:P Ingerson">(talk)</a> 11:31, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
