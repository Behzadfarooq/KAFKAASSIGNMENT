<p>Please delete this article. I am the one who wrote it. I spent several weeks researching the material and organizing it to come up with a barebones outline of an article. I fully intended to expand it but health problems intervened. I never once considered it a controversial subject but have since been accused of bad faith in its creation, my efforts belittled, and I have been lectured rather than asked for sources. In addition the page seems to have become somewhat of a magnet for those pursuing an opinionated rather than a scholarly approach to the subject. I would therefore ask that it be deleted.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Sorry, but just because you created it does not allow you to have the authority to delete it as well. We try not to own our articles.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and <b>Do not redirect</b>. My reasons are on the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Talk%7EAmerican_West_archive1_e405.html" title="Talk:American West/archive1">archived talk page</a> but here's a recap: The <i>American West</i> is the nearly universal name for this region in both academic works and the popular press—that's what most people will be looking for. The <i>American Old West</i> is not a region but a historical era occurring in the <i>American West</i> from about the Civil War through the 1890s. Most of the history of the <i>American West</i> occurred before and after those 30-40 years and continues to this day. Also, to imply, as the <i>Western United States</i> article does, that Hawaii is culturally and historically part of the <i>American West</i> and states like Texas through the Dakotas are not, is simply wrong. And I think there is plenty of evidence to back that up. Also, only with great difficulty can the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_West_b966.html" title="Category:American West">category system</a> for the <i>American West</i> article which has been built up over time by several contributors be transferred to the <i>Western United States</i> because the articles are defining two different regions using different criteria. I would redirect <i>Western United States</i> to <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography_of_the_Western_United_States_dfb8.html" title="Geography of the Western United States">Geography of the Western United States</a> and dab that page. <a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDialUp_ed76.html" title="User:DialUp">DialUp</a> 19:15, 10 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just some notes: Texas and the Dakotas are include in the Western United States article, it's just noted that they are often consider part of the South and Midwest respectfully as well, and thus aren't always include in the West. Also the Geography of the Western United States, does not include Texas and the Dakotas at present. According to Naming conventions adopted by <a href="../../../u/s/r/WP%7EUSR_ad62.html" title="WP:USR">WikiProject U.S. regions</a>, the article should be located at Western United States, which is where the original U.S. West article was moved; all other regions with diretions in their names are located at -ern United States. -<a href="../../../j/c/a/User%7EJCarriker_76c6.html" title="User:JCarriker">JCarriker</a> 19:24, July 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> this article should be included in the history of the American West. The modern West does NOT include states such as Texas. Not only is geography a distinction but culture and politics as well. In response to DailUp, yes, Hawaii is part of the MODERN West and culturally too. Hawaii has similar legislation, outlooks and demographics to other Western states. Texas is nothing at all like any modern Western states, if you include it in the present West I am prepared to NPOV for original research. Yes, historically Texas WAS part of the West, not anymore. Here are some reasons why: US Census does not include Texas, polls indicate major differences in cultural opinion between Texas and the majority of thr West, ie 48% of southerners against same-sex unions vs. 28% of westerners, Texas restricts the sale of sex toys (there is absolutely nothing like this in any modern western state, in fact Nevada allows prostitution), Texas had a ban on interracial marriage at the time of the 1967 Supreme Court ruling striking it down, no Western state had such a law. Texas TODAY is part of the South, plain and simple. Using your line of thinking we would have to include West Virginia in the American West, when in reality, yes, it was considered Western in the past but not today. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlobeism_e3ea.html" title="User:Globeism">Globeism</a> 20:13, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have fixed the map and I hope you will agree. The current American West article has major flaws, for example in the past the Great Lakes region was considered Western: <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northwest_Territory_2237.html" title="Northwest Territory">Northwest Territory</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Virginia_4016.html" title="West Virginia">West Virginia</a>. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlobeism_e3ea.html" title="User:Globeism">Globeism</a> 21:18, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
