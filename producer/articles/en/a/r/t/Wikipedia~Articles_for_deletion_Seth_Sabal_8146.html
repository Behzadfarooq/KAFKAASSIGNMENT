<p>At the moment, the article contradicts itself, unless one can distinguish between (a) work for which a photographer is most famous, and (b) the most famous work of that photographer (conceivable, but farfetched). Let's not quibble and accept that he's claimed to be famous for both his fashion work and <i>"The American Dream," a nine year project documenting the life and face of homelessness in America</i>. He's from the US. I'd expect that somebody who's so famous that he'd do (unspecified) <i>international exhibitions and world renown</i> [sic] <i>keynote speeches</i> (as claimed in the article) would have a book out: a search at amazon.com, abebooks.com and bookfinder.com shows nothing. I accept that it can be hard to break into publishing when you're doing something that's as resolutely uncommercial as "The American Dream" (if it exists). Surely this is mentioned somewhere? Not by Google: a search for <span style="color:#000; background-color:#cfc">"seth sabal" "american dream"</span> shows only this WP article and some commercial scrapes thereof. What's written about this person is <b>not verifiable</b>. <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 11:18, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

I have seen the American Dream Display in Riverside CA. very nice, and attended a seminar in Los Angelas CA, where Seth gave a fashion class to 70 students. <a href="http://www.phphotographers.org/images/Octubre17y18-04/10-18-04/Seminario18.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.phphotographers.org/images/Octubre17y18-04/10-18-04/Seminario18.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
Its is very easy to find Mr. Sabal's work in the fashion industry.

As for books, their are plenty of famous photographers without published books. From my recollection the "Amercian Dream Project" was not about the photographer nor did the contributors want to profit from its showings, I am almost certain that the project help raise awareness to a group of individuals that were starting a homeless shelter. I do honestly cannot remember the name. I can tell you that I did see the show.</p>
<p>Furthmore; Hoary, I would remove the part in your grounds for deleation about "Mr Sabal claiming to be famous", It's libelous. I do not know that Mr. Sabal or his attoneys have seen your enties or for that matter the Wiki article; however, I have forwarded your Libelous claim through to the legal dept. at Seth Sabal Studio in NYC. I agree with Robertissimo calling the artical Apparent <a href="../../../a/d/s/WP%7EADS_2ee6.html" title="WP:ADS">advertisement</a> , but this can be fixed. I will do that myself. <i>.... contributed at 14:12, 18 October 2006 by [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=DrBillMartin" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=DrBillMartin" rel="nofollow">DrBillMartin</a>]</i></p>

Furthermore, the AfD nomination states that the <i>article</i> claims that Mr Sabal is famous, not that Mr Sabal claims it himself.

<li><b>Comment</b>: You say that <i>there is a contention that his work has appeared in several magazines, which would meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria.</i> I'm puzzled by this. I can't see anything to support this in WP:BIO (though I must admit that I haven't yet drunk my first coffee of the day and thus may have missed something), whereas when I look within that page for "photographer" I read of<i>Published ... photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work</i>; and I don't think that any of the various usernames who have defended this "artical", as they call it, have claimed multiple independent reviews of or awards for Sabal's work. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 23:34, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The Sept. issue of Vogue Mexico and the current issue of Vogue Brazil (Oct. 2006) both have covers shot by the photographer. If you visit the websites of these publishing houses or subscribe to the magazines you can clearly see the presence of Mr. Sabal work. Coincidentally, the people that are fighting the issues of the articles are more than likely frustrated photographers, with professional jealousy. I am sure that Mr. Sabal does not care wither the artical stands or not; however, it would be childish and unfair to not have every photographer site every single sentence of all the work on all the articles on WIkipedia. I can understand that some people have nothing better to do. SO far the only person that has even been reasonable is isotope23, his points were valid unbias and very reasonable, plus you can tell he can see the trees in the forest. Hoary on the otherhand must really want to bother people, or is just hurting inside so much that he chooses to fight with his computer. I think its sad, get a job.

<li><b>Delete.</b> So many comments and arguments, and no votes. Well I'm voting. None of the discussion above or on the talk pages convinces me that this article is anything but a vanity article. The fact that so many proponent(s) are anonymous speaks volumes, and suggests sockpuppetry. "Legal counsul"? Real lawyers can spell better than that. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 23:45, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Further oddities</b>: I wonder about the photograph within the article, captioned <i>International Photography Convention 2004. Photo of Seth Sabal by Felipe Zapata Vazquez.</i> It's Image:Mexicocity2.jpg, which we are told there is <i>Photograph of Seth Sabal Keynote Speech International Photography Convention, Mexico City 2004.</i> Google has very few hits for <span style="color:#000; background-color:#dfd; padding:0 5px">"international photography convention"</span>; none of them seems related. But perhaps "International Photography Convention" is a translation of a name in Spanish. No matter, as anything so grand and so recent in which Sabal made the keynote speech must surely be written up on the web -- but when I google for either <span style="color:#000; background-color:#dfd; padding:0 5px">"seth sabal" mexico</span> or <span style="color:#000; background-color:#dfd; padding:0 5px">"seth sabal" méxico</span>, I see nothing about this event. I'm left with no reason to believe that Sabal made a keynote speech to any "International Photography Convention" in Mexico City, or to one of any significance. ¶ Incidentally, Talk:Seth Sabal has some interesting bits in it. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 15:06, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> I have considered and researched this AfD over the past several days and cannot reach any conclusion other than Delete. None of my extensive searches has turned up any positive information about this photographer that was not generated by himself or as a result of the Wiki article. I have found some extremely negative material suggesting unethical business practices, but this information has not factored into my decision. Each thread suggested by the article or the editors above has not produced any verifiable information. I have also watched the article shrink as other editors have questioned the accuracy of the information. As a side note, this discussion has been very acrimonious with so many personal accusations. While I resent the barbs thrown my way for my actions in trying to preserve AfD notice on the article, these did not factor into my decision. I would suggest that administrators follow-up on the questions of Sockpuppetry as the article and this discussion would seem to exhibit evidence of this strategy. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveHopson_68d6.html" title="User:SteveHopson">SteveHopson</a> 20:20, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
