<p>The result of the debate was <b>Redirect to <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katie_Holmes_d2ac.html" title="Katie Holmes">Katie Holmes</a></b>; someone else may merge any notable information into Katie's article. The reason that I chose redirect is that I think a good portion of the delete voters would have endorsed a redirect, and some of the keep voters offered it as an option as well. I chose Katie rather than Tom since Tom's article has very little information on Suri (or Katie, for that matter), while Katie's article has a lot about their relationship.

<li><b>Keep</b> - IMHO, the incredible amount of media attention that has been devoted to this pregnancy made this kid notable before she was born.

<li><b>Comment</b> Contrary to the printed policy, Notability doesn't have anything to do with what the person did. We have a couple of precedents. <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Smart_%28Utah%29_2bf0.html" title="Elizabeth Smart (Utah)">Elizabeth Smart (Utah)</a> was "notable" but she doesn't have her own article, that link redirects to <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Smart_kidnapping_5fe8.html" title="Elizabeth Smart kidnapping">Elizabeth Smart kidnapping</a>. So while Suri Cruise isn't notable per se, her birth is. the aforementioned <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Martin_8166.html" title="Apple Martin">Apple Martin</a> redirects to <a href="../../../g/w/e/Gweneth_Paltrow_a32f.html" title="Gweneth Paltrow">Gweneth Paltrow</a>. Suri's birth is more notable than Apple's, partially because of the ties with <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> and the fact that <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Cruise_61a0.html" title="Tom Cruise">Tom Cruise</a> is insane, insisted on a <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silent_birth.html" title="Silent birth">Silent birth</a>, and he ate Suri's placenta.

<li>Yep, from our own article here: "<i>But when the interviewer said it would be a big meal, Cruise replied: "OK, maybe I won't." In a later interview with Diane Sawyer, Cruise joked about the comments and said he wasn't really going to eat it</i>". Also, you mention that he's "insane". Though I have some unflattering thoughts about him, I don't know if insane is quite technically correct. <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a>|<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDismas_5419.html" title="User talk:Dismas"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:21, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>&#160;! This child may not even be Tom Cruise and katie Holmes biological child. There has been reports for years that he shoot blanks and this all tomkat sham is repulsive. It's a cover for the most well know and documanted closeted case of Hollywood history&#160;! I will think much lower of wikipedia if you do not delete very soon that article about a poor child gay-boy Tom is using to promote his "virility". I really hope wikipedia is not gonna stand anything about that disgusting tomkat sham. It was probably a fake pregnancy anyway and they're adopting a scientology baby from a teenager locked in the basement of scientology center. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.92.227.91 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.92.227.91_4a71.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.92.227.91">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Lots of news about Suri happening, notable enough. --User:Carie 23:56, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Suri Cruise is clearly a person of public interest. You can find dozens of articles about her birth on Google News. Given the very public rumors of Tom's sexuality, religion and sperm-count, and Katie's dramatic and near-inexplicable spiritual U-turn, Suri will be a notable figure in celebrity news for quite some time. --Goldsounds 10:30, 21 April 2006 (UTC+10)
<ul>
<li>Comment - Most of those things you just mentioned have nothing directly to do with Suri. A) <i>Tom's sexuality</i> - Tom, not Suri. B) <i>... religion</i> - again a Tom thing. C) <i>... sperm-count</i> - again a Tom thing. D) <i>spiritual U-turn</i> - already in the Katie article and related to her, not Suri. And finally, she'll be in the news for the next few months but will become just a footnote until she's done anything of any worth. <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a>|<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDismas_5419.html" title="User talk:Dismas"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 00:42, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - But which do we redirect to? Tom Cruise is more famous Ms. Holmes, so arguably he'd get the redirect. But this may be POV.

</li>
<li><b>Further comment/suggestion</b> - There's more than enough material out there, in print or otherwise, to write a fairly detailed article on the Pregnancy of Katie Holmes, dealing with all of the controversies (is it Tom's baby? Will it be a silent birth? Will Tom eat the placenta? Did Tom abandon Katie to go promote M:I 3? etc.,) and discuss Suri's birth as well. It was certainly a notable event, given the amount of coverage that was given to it. What do y'all think of that idea? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Disco_King_7736.html" title="User:The Disco King">The Disco King</a> 14:00, 21 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I rather like this idea, actually. Instead of focusing on the child, which hasn't done anything note-worthy yet, create a page focusing more on the birth and the surrounding controversies. WHEN (or if?) the child does anything note worthy in times to come, then she can have her own page... But for now, the thing that's note worthy are the things happening as a result of the pregnancy, not that the child has directly influenced or done herself. <a href="../../../k/v/i/User%7EKvidell_1fb0.html" title="User:Kvidell">kvidell</a> 15:16, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, very notable. This child has been major celebrity news since Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made the pregnancy public back in October. I don't think this article should be consolidated into either Tom's or Katie's article. She's a seperate entity from those two actors. She deserves her own page simply because of her popularity that she's procured for herself the past 7 months. I feel that if she hasn't accumulated anymore news for herself in the next 9 months, then consolidation can be considered. She's a week old. You can't seriously expect someone of her age to create the grandiose of news that you're expecting for a "notable" article. I say we wait 9 months and see if this article has any further contributions. If it doesn't, then, and only then, should merging be made an option. I personally think that people who are anti-Scientology are picking her apart and I don't think that her religious affiliation should play any part in the decision to retain or remove this article.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Um, it's not discrimination against Suri but if she is going to get a WP page then all celebrity babies should get pages regardless of the amount of publicity. As far as the the black comment made earlier, that's racism which is a form of discrimination but completely different. There is not discrimination here. Just think about why she has a page and then look at the pages of people who have actually done something in their lives and gotten recognized for their contributions to society and then look at Suri's page. The only reason she has a page is because of her parent's strange behavior and comments. And the fact that people don't know where her name comes from does not count as a contribution to society. i think that we as Americans need to focus on more important things than celebrity babies.

<p>As many people have pointed out, Suri is only notable for being born to two famous parents. In some people's opinion, that's enough to warrant an article, especially considering the considerable amount of media attention which has been devoted to her since her birth. For others, Suri is no different than any other celebrity baby. My thoughts (as briefly outlined above) are as follows: Suri is not notable for anything that she did, and so does not deserve her own article. HOWEVER: Suri is still notable as one of the most famous celebrity babies in recent years. All through Katie Holmes' pregnancy, celebrity magazines across the country were FILLED with articles, photos, speculation, etc., relating to this pregnancy - Tom's behaviour, the Scientology aspect, rumours about the true parentage of the baby, etc. What's notable here isn't the baby; what's notable is the PREGNANCY. So I think that an article should be created on the Pregnancy of Katie Holmes, spinning off information from <a href="../../../s/u/r/Suri_Cruise_64f5.html" title="Suri Cruise">Suri Cruise</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katie_Holmes_d2ac.html" title="Katie Holmes">Katie Holmes</a>, and <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Cruise_61a0.html" title="Tom Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>, and incorporating all of this wild speculation, discussion, and intense interest relating to this pregnancy. I think that according to this site's guidelines, the pregnancy qualifies as a significant event, and perhaps this model could be applied to other notable celebrity pregnancies (such as that of Angelina Jolie). What does everybody else think of this? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Disco_King_7736.html" title="User:The Disco King">The Disco King</a> 20:05, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
