<dd>Additional comment: this article was authored by a company employee. Furthermore, the company has aroused some controversy by virtue of many of its writers adding links to Wikipedia articles in violation of <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>. Nevertheless, the critical point as I see it turns on notability -- by our rules as an encyclopedia, if they're notable, they're included regardless of congeniality, ethics, or other POV attributes. See the talk page of the article for more discussion of notability -- several of us did a lot of digging and came up with some a few references, but they're very mrginal at best. I'm bringing the article to deletion not so much as a partisan for its deletion but more to get a broader community look at it and the refs. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A.

<dd>Thanks for digging up the NY Times links, Jim. Several of us dug around pretty thoroughly for evidence of notability and didn't find anything, so you win the search prize.

<dd>Oh, sorry if I was unclear! No, I didn't intend for those links to be taken as valid <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">external links</a>; I was just pointing out that there appears to be a significant amount of ill will floating around out there, and the company may regret opening this can of worms.

<dd>Changing to <b>Weak delete</b>. Ok, call me a flip-flopper too. I've been teetering on the fence, and I didn't want this to be just a pile-on, but I tend to agree that two incidental NYTimes references aren't quite enough, particularly after re-reading what the current article says about relaunching in 2006 under new management; I don't see any recent and notable third-party citations.

<li><b>Delete</b> per Sandstein. I am not partisan regarding the addition of links to S101 in WP articles - that can be dealt with separately. Here we are discussing notability of a website per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. A single 4½ year old article (which basically said the company was in decline) in a non-notable email newsletter is a clever find, but does not achieve notability for the company. The information we have is that the company operates under a different business model now and therefore that citation is largely irrelevant on content alone. Regarding the Alexa rank, I wonder if that link wasn't achieved at least in part through spamming Wikipedia. If this company was notable, there'd be a lot more independent reviews and news on them than there seems to be. —&#160;<a href="../../../m/o/o/User_talk%7EMoondyne_51fd.html" title="User talk:Moondyne">Moondyne</a> 03:16, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm the original prodder on this one. There is so many unreliable sources out there for this one that it is tough finding substantial reliable sources on this. The New York Times is obviously a reliable source, but the mentions of the site are, at best, in passing. I see a fair amount of blog entries mentioning some of the problems this organization is having, but if this were a notable site, it seems to me that it would be possible to find references to these issues (or even positive ones) in a site we could reference per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. I'm open to being proven wrong here, but so far I'm not seeing how this article could be more than a stub. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 14:49, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - This is a tough one for me. I actually utilize this website, posted there a few times and read from it alot, particularly from its investing advice sections. From my experience with it, I would say it is a very large in scope, prolific and heavily used website. I'm just a a regular person who has had no connection with this company's management* and who lives in a place far away from the company's headquarters. (*Disclosure:the nice president and I recently discussed this matter on <a href="../../../o/a/k/User_talk%7EOakshade_8291.html#Suite101.com" title="User talk:Oakshade">my talk page</a> after I demonstated I was sympathetic to this company.) I know this is antidotal, but it's one of those situations where it seems that it's notable even if if it doesn't strictly fall under WP inclusion guidelines. I really have been looking hard for more conventional <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, found this article from Blog Critics Magazine <a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2005/11/30/065809.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2005/11/30/065809.php" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> which is an independent write-up (I just inserted this into the article), but I'm not finding alot more... it has been suggested by the president that print articles exist from sources like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Globe_and_Mail_a135.html" title="The Globe and Mail">The Globe and Mail</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Vancouver_Sun_1e33.html" title="The Vancouver Sun">The Vancouver Sun</a> but the corresponding web articles have been delted. Sometimes the media simply misses notable things. I might have to employ <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">WP:POKEMON</a> comparisons with this one and look to sites like <a href="../../../e/z/b/Ezboard.html" title="Ezboard">ezboard</a> or <a href="../../../o/h/m/OhmyNews_cf53.html" title="OhmyNews">OhmyNews</a> where similar companies, perhaps lower in scope, have articles. Teetering on <a href="../../../i/g/n/WP%7EIGNORE_187e.html" title="WP:IGNORE">WP:IGNORE</a>, these might not be the usual arguments for inclusion, but I feel there should be an exception to the rules in some cases. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 02:47, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> very borderline this one. A quick search in google news brings up a number of results <a href="http://news.google.co.uk/news?hl=en&amp;q=suite101&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.co.uk/news?hl=en&amp;q=suite101&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, but a decent percentage are probably discountable due to the fact that they are trivial and/or press releases. Don't know if others would like to comment on these results. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 09:18, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I looked through a fair amount of these results. So far, the vast majority of what I can find is self promotion on free sites, pr sites, and blogs. A couple of other editors did the same, and so far very little substantial has come up. Earlier in the discussion, someone noted a mention in the NYTimes, but if you take a look at the article, I think you'll agree that it falls in the trivial category. If this is a notable company/site, there would be at least some degree of non-trivial, independent coverage. I'm open to being convinced to the contrary, but so far, my conclusion is that this coverage doesn't exist. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 12:12, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
