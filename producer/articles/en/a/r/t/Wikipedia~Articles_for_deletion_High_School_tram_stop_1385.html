<dd>It doesn't mean anything. There is nothing about notability in deletion policy.

<dd>Or, it could be a good-faith nomination based on an understood but controversial and uncodified notion of encylcopedic notability.

<dd>I don't know why he did it MiB, but mass nomination of seemingly random articles, with no explanation, except a coded reference to something that he must know is not in policy, and is best controversial, is bound to raise a certain amount of irritation.

<li>Well, not serious about BJAODNing it. This is obviously an unexpandable stub, but I leave it to the wisdom of those who actually want to write about tram stations to arrange it or dispose of it.

<li><b>Delete</b> or merge. Having checked it up, this is not a tram <b>station</b> (which might be notable, they tend to be large and locally prominent) but a tram <b>stop</b>, which is equivalent to a bus shelter. See <a href="http://www.thetram.net/maps/highschool.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.thetram.net/maps/highschool.asp" rel="nofollow">this link</a>, which has a picture of this allegedly notable structure. So this is a footnote to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Nottingham_Express_Transit_6184.html" title="Nottingham Express Transit">Nottingham Express Transit</a> but on its own the structure is patently non-notable. Or should I create a Wikipedia article for the bus shelter at the end of my road? - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> 18:30, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hmmmm... could you be a little <i>more</i> condescending? "As you know" not being notable means not being encyclopedic.

<dd>So where, Trollderella, do you place the cutoff point for notability? I'd say a bus shelter for tram passengers is not notable.

<dd>Well, where do you place the cut off point for how yellow the object is? I don't place a cut-off point for notability, because notability has nothing to do with deletion criteria.

<li>There's a lot of things that can be told about London Underground stations as the The Tube is world-famous and the stations are actually more than a shelter and a sign. We could merge all of it in an article about the tram line, but can you think of any information that can be included in an article on the bus stop. (It's not a station). - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 10:13, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, nothing resembling notable. It is about a tram station at a high school no one cares about (figuratively speaking).
