<p>A listcruft of items from the Pokemon video games. Much better suited for a gaming and/or Pokemon wiki. On a side note (if this is kept), I hope it doesn't get changed into something like this: <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recurring_weapons_and_items_from_The_Legend_of_Zelda_series_ea71.html" title="Recurring weapons and items from The Legend of Zelda series">Recurring weapons and items from The Legend of Zelda series</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>; I don't see anything wrong with this article since M_C_Y_1008's trimming. Calling it "indiscriminate" or "cruft" is a non-argument akin to <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDON%27TLIKEIT_90f9.html" title="WP:IDON'TLIKEIT">WP:IDON'TLIKEIT</a>. The material is certainly verifiable and for a game series as important as Pokémon, notable. The scope of the list is narrow and objective. So why is it indiscriminate? On the other hand, the comments above probably reflect the pre-trimmed state so maybe we are evaluating different articles. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 20:18, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, it does apply here, just as the policy applies to every article on wikipedia. Its not a selective policy. In fact, the first sentence of Indiscriminate Information even says 'collections of items of information' and what we have here is a collection of item information. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 10:17, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And mroe to the point, you say 'whatever that is' in relation to an indiscriminate information, so you admit to not knowing what it even means, but the proceed to try and argue that this article isn't one. And I think the fact that this article is indiscriminate information has EVERYTHING to do with wikipedia not being a collection of indiscriminate information.

<dd>The policy applies to every article on Wikipedia, but the statement "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection" can apply here positively or negatively. <i>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection</i> of items of information. "Collection" here applies to Wikipedia. This article is an item of information. Whether this article makes Wikipedia an indiscriminate collection is what is up to debate. –<a href="../../../p/o/m/User_talk%7EPomte_8819.html" title="User talk:Pomte">Pomte</a> 10:31, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is a linguistic issue. In the sentence "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information", "collection" applies to Wikipedia. Nowhere does "collection" apply to any specific article. It should be clear what this sentence means, yet many editors shift its meaning to apply to specific articles. They probably mean "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of indiscriminate collections of information", which is not what the policy states, though it could be argued that is what it implies. I said that this article does not clearly fall under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> because it falls under none of those 8 types of articles listed there. Please take care to note that "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information" is not the same as "Wikipedia is not a collection of indiscriminate information". –<a href="../../../p/o/m/User_talk%7EPomte_8819.html" title="User talk:Pomte">Pomte</a> 10:36, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I diasgree because the only way the policy can be applied is to individual articles. 'Wikipedia should not be made up of articles containing indiscriminate information such as this.' is the only way the policy can be enforceably applied. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 11:03, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The policy is about Wikipedia, and applies to individual articles that belong to its list. What exactly does "indiscriminate" information mean in terms of article content? Trivial? Loosely connected? Poorly defined scope? Isolated facts grouped in lists? –<a href="../../../p/o/m/User_talk%7EPomte_8819.html" title="User talk:Pomte">Pomte</a> 11:06, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>All of the above AFAIC. Not to mention 'List of items that are only being listed because they are featured in a game and providee no useful information to anyone outside of the games community.' And please don't edit other peoples posts, even to correct spelling.

<dd>I didn't edit your post. Where did you get that quote from? I can't find it. Note that the items are featured in not only games, but also anime and manga. This list could be of interest to anyone who likes any other game/anime/manga, to compare and contrast the item types and functions. If someone mentions "Pokétch" anywhere, anyone else could think, "that is the stupidest name I have ever read, let me look on Wikipedia to find out what it is". Articles get forked per <a href="../../../s/u/m/WP%7ESUMMARY_66b7.html" title="WP:SUMMARY">WP:SUMMARY</a>, and some are bound to be so subject-specific that they are of no interest to anyone else.

<dd>well then kinslayer perhaps you should start slaying <i>any</i> article that disusses strategy of games, <i>any</i> article that disucusses advanced mathematics or physics... the point i'm trying to make is that just because <i>you</i> don't see a use for this article isn't enough of a reason to delete it. Pomte's example is exactly why we have articles here on wikipedia about subjects like this. Many lay people out there rely on wikipedia to give them accurate information on a wide variety of topics. We like to say that these things belong elsewhere, but that's not true. A person outside the pokemon community wouldn't have the faintest idea of where else to look, and even after doing a google search might get stuck with a fansite, that not only tells them what a poketch <i>is</i> but then proceeds to tell them certain things like when you get each feature - strategies on how to best utilize your poketch and a wealth of other sutff they don't need to know about. For example, "The poketch's step counter ability will help with breeding, just remember to place the egg next to someone with Flame Body so it'll go faster." Now this poor person is more confused then ever. And that's if use a fansite, if they go check gamefaqs, they'll need to sift through LOADS of irrelevant info to find what they want. Wikipedia's purpose is to serve this layperson by giving them the most concise relevant information and then provide helpful external links if they wish to delve into the nitty gritty. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">ΖαππερΝαππερ</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappernapper_cf32.html" title="User talk:Zappernapper">Babel</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zappernapper_a171.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zappernapper">Alexandria</a></sub> 19:41, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> ironically, i actually prefer the version prior to MCY's trimming. I feel that there is significant information missing, but perhaps it is better to build from this more compact article and discuss specific changes on the talk page so we can avoid cruft-aholics from nominating it again. besides - this is not an indiscriminate list, the introduction properly defines the scope of the list according to <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> and extraneous info has been removed throughout the article's history. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">ΖαππερΝαππερ</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappernapper_cf32.html" title="User talk:Zappernapper">Babel</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zappernapper_a171.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zappernapper">Alexandria</a></sub> 20:31, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Kinslayer, do you really believe that "collection of items of information" means the same thing as "collection of information about items?" I thought you were joking above (and it is an amusing twist of wording) but having repeated it now it sounds like you are serious. Is it because they both use the word "item" (in different senses) or because it is "information"? Obviously encyclopedia articles can have information. Anyway, to reiterate: calling an article "indiscriminate" is too vague, and in this case I simply don't understand what you mean. <i>Why</i> is it indiscriminate? <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 14:47, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Because it is listed with no apparnt thought to why it should be here beyond 'it's in Pokemon and should be listed on Wikipedia', look at the references too. All of them are magazine guides, instruction manuals and strategy guides. Pokemon may well be notable (or IS in fact), but do we honestly need to know Pokemon contains potions, vitamins etc etc? What would be next, 'List of Flora and Funghi in Pokemon'or 'List of terrain types in Pokemon'? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 15:03, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>there is very good reason for this article beyond "b/c it's in Pokemon" The most apt description for this would be a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_glossaries.html" title="List of glossaries">glossary</a> rather than <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">list</a> because it's a grouping of items that <i>are</i> oft referenced throughout the 500+ articles on pokemon in general (e.g. the article on <a href="../../../f/e/e/Feebas.html" title="Feebas">Feebas</a> really shouldn't delve into the detail on <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9block.html" title="Pokéblock">Pokéblock</a> that this article already has - i.e. it shouldn't talk about what generation it was introduced in, or it's relation to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_items_de9a.html#Berry-related_items" title="List of Pokémon items">Pofin</a>). The items themselves feature not only in the video games, but also the anime and manga... so would a condensed version (that would still prolly need to be split off per <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a>) be put in at <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon.html" title="Pokémon">Pokémon</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_%28anime%29.html" title="Pokémon (anime)">Pokémon (anime)</a>, or <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_%28manga%29.html" title="Pokémon (manga)">Pokémon (manga)</a> (ok... so manga prolly wouldn't have such a prob fitting in relevant parts)? Some items (e.g. <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9_ball.html" title="Poké ball">Poké ball</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9dex.html" title="Pokédex">Pokédex</a>) are notable enough to have their own articles and would definitely then deserve <i>some</i> sort of page to be grouped on as per the guidlines at WP:LIST. Some items, like TMs and HMs, require too much explanation to be easily mentioned within the VAST amount of articles that wikilink to the applicable section. Your criticism of the references is ill-deserved because they are perfectly suited to articles of a non-scholarly nature (i was going to give a link to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> but it appears the page has undergone a massive overhaul). -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">ΖαππερΝαππερ</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappernapper_cf32.html" title="User talk:Zappernapper">Babel</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zappernapper_a171.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zappernapper">Alexandria</a></sub> 20:28, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Based on the cultural significance of Pokémon and the importance of collecting items within the hugely successful video games, card games, movies, television series(es), manga, etc., I am arguing that yes, we can afford an article on some of its most salient items. The article is not perfect, but that should be addressed via cleanup, not by deletion. Do you think that scholars fifty years from now will never be interested in this stuff?

<dd>Peregrine has hit the nail on the head. Those voting keep feel that for the topic to be comprehensive, a list like this is neccessary, while those voting to delete see it as a bunch of trivia thrown on a page b/c "I LOVE EVERYTHING POKEMON". Personally, I'd argue the same points for a page discussing the the different mushrooms/shells/bombs in the mario franchise or some other RPG. The only one to actually say <i>why</i> they feel the list is indiscriminate has failed to provide a counter argument to points presented against them. If AMIB has more, i'd like to here them. as an extension of description for the purposes of aiding and understanding <b>sources independent of the subject</b> are <i>not</i> required as per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> - primary sources.

<dd>at wikipedia when we refer to an <i>indiscriminate collection of info</i>, we are referring to the idea that that not every last bit of information (my hair color) needs to be included. This becomes extended to topics in fiction-based media by only including information that is essential to understanding the concepts introduced, and information relevant to the notability of the subjects. For example, if I were to say that, "<a href="../../../g/a/r/Gardevoir.html" title="Gardevoir">Gardevoir</a> has a special attack of 125 which is higher than that of the recent legendary <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arseus.html" title="Arseus">Arseus</a> at 120, but it is still outclassed by <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alakazam.html" title="Alakazam">Alakazam</a> who's base special attack is 135..." then proceed to tell you how it would still be possible to obtain a higher sp. att stat than some Alakazam due to EV training and that most beneficial nature is something that lowers attack... see where this is going? It would have been enough to say that, "Gardevoir have among the highest Special Attacks in the Pokemon universe." We need to be <b>disciminating</b> in the <i>kind</i> of info we include, we <i>should</i> be <b>selective</b> in what gets included because most information (like all of <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>'s past phone numbers) is not relevant enough to the topics at hand. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">ΖαππερΝαππερ</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappernapper_cf32.html" title="User talk:Zappernapper">Babel</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zappernapper_a171.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zappernapper">Alexandria</a></sub> 18:41, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We discuss the number of HMs because it changed througout the history of the game and to answer the question of "Well what changed?" we divulge that info, it's also important that we give the names because some were removed and then readded later on. This is information of interest to anyone who wants to know how things changed throughout the series. While it would be reasonable to include this info under "Changes" on each generation's main page, this offers a concise overview that allows the reader to take it all in without having to load the five different articles. The same argument could essentially be made for the Pokegear/PDA/Poketch stuff, and I've already explained the reasoning behind the Pokeflute. <i>Specialist interest</i> is a term that could be used to AFD massive amounts of articles on Politcs, Mathematics, and Physics. We exclude numbers for all pokemon because they'd add no <i>value</i> to the article. A lay person can't take anything away from that number other than "Oh, that's high" or "Oh, that's low" and additionally <i>we'd</i> have to tell them it's high or low, so there's no reason having the number anyways - we can leave the # out and they still learn just as much. But you leave out description of an item that is oft mentioned - Pokeflute is used to wake up <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snorlax.html" title="Snorlax">Snorlax</a>, Pokeflute's function was duplicated in the anime in Snorlax's first appearance, Pokeflute has an incarnation in the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_Trading_Card_Game_5587.html" title="Pokémon Trading Card Game">Pokémon Trading Card Game</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_Snap_e9dd.html" title="Pokémon Snap">Pokémon Snap</a>, Pokeflute was replaced with Pokeflute radio station in <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_d777.html" title="Pokémon Gold">GSC</a>, utilizing the Pokegear's (oh wait, what's that?) radio, Pokeflute was later replaced by Blue flute in <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_Ruby_beef.html" title="Pokémon Ruby">RSE</a> - leave it out and the reader's understanding of the item is drastically affected. Indiscriminate info would include how many steps of ash you need to get the Blue flute, what route the guy is located on. For a lay reader it wouldn't matter if we said 100 or 200 steps, Rt. 10 or Rt. 15 - their understanding of Pokeflute isn't affected so it's extraneous, irrelevant info. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">ΖαππερΝαππερ</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappernapper_cf32.html" title="User talk:Zappernapper">Babel</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zappernapper_a171.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zappernapper">Alexandria</a></sub> 07:19, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is not a vote. Would "Delete, non-notable" be convincing to you?

<li>at the risk of alienating those who agree with my position, AMIB is right, it would be more constructive to say <i>what makes</i> the topic notable. However to be fair, many articles get deleted with nothing more than "NN" or "Foo-cruft" as arguments (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_references_or_spoofs_%282nd_AfD_Nomination%29_46bc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Pokémon references or spoofs (2nd AfD Nomination)">Pokémon spoofs</a>), especially when the article is only at a stub stage 4 days after its creation and it is reasonable to assume it could be expanded or improved based on cursory searches (i've seen admins speedy things like <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diphallic_terata.html" title="Diphallic terata">Diphallic terata</a> as "patent nonsense"... wiki is not censored, but that link leads to an article some might find "offensive"), it's understandable why some might think that favorable "votes" are acceptable in place of discussion. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">ΖαππερΝαππερ</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappernapper_cf32.html" title="User talk:Zappernapper">Babel</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zappernapper_a171.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zappernapper">Alexandria</a></sub> 07:19, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep, but trim a little bit further</b>. "Listcruft" is certainly not a good reason for deletion, especially standing on its own. Granted, parts of the article are still a little too in-depth (look at the PokéFlute's section), but it's been much improved from before, and all the items currently on the list are arranged in fairly large groups that are at least moderately notable within the games (and/or anime) themselves.~e.o.t.d~ (<a href="../../../e/y/e/User%7EEye.of.the.dragonfly_c6de.html" title="User:Eye.of.the.dragonfly">蜻蛉の目</a>•<a href="../../../e/y/e/User_talk%7EEye.of.the.dragonfly_9f7c.html" title="User talk:Eye.of.the.dragonfly">話す</a>•<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Eye.of.the.dragonfly_c220.html" title="Special:Contributions/Eye.of.the.dragonfly">貢献</a>) 19:05, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Only possible sources are game guides/manuals, thus the result article is a game guide/manual. Its notability is not in question imo, but this is not encyclopedic material. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 22:27, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>So if the only possible source for an article is a newspaper, then the article must be a newspaper? I fail to see the logic in your statement. ~e.o.t.d~ (<a href="../../../e/y/e/User%7EEye.of.the.dragonfly_c6de.html" title="User:Eye.of.the.dragonfly">蜻蛉の目</a>•<a href="../../../e/y/e/User_talk%7EEye.of.the.dragonfly_9f7c.html" title="User talk:Eye.of.the.dragonfly">話す</a>•<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Eye.of.the.dragonfly_c220.html" title="Special:Contributions/Eye.of.the.dragonfly">貢献</a>) 08:39, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, if the only possible sources for an article are newspaper articles, then the article will be descriptive, fairly neutral, and will lack in long-term historical impact.<br />
The qualities of the sources will be reflected in the article, and game guides will focus on information required for playing the game, not information required for a general, broad understanding. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 21:38, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, which suggests that content on minor characters, places, and concepts should be included in a list that is separate from the article if it becomes too long. Regarding <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a game guide, statements in this article should <i>describe</i> the objects in question; they should not give tips as to how to use them. The use of game guides as references does not automatically make this article a game guide itself, just as the use of news sources does not make an article news, and the use of government reports does not make an article such a report. This is how I see it from a WP-policy standpoint. I have never directly dealt with anything Pokemon-related (except on WP), so I can't comment as to how "major" or "minor" these objects/concepts are. Please correct me if I'm making some erroneous assumption regarding what these objects in fact are. However, even if minor, I believe the content qualifies for inclusion. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:01, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yep, it does; the only part that goes beyond simple description is the flute section, which has already been mentioned, and can be easily fixed. ~e.o.t.d~ (<a href="../../../e/y/e/User%7EEye.of.the.dragonfly_c6de.html" title="User:Eye.of.the.dragonfly">蜻蛉の目</a>•<a href="../../../e/y/e/User_talk%7EEye.of.the.dragonfly_9f7c.html" title="User talk:Eye.of.the.dragonfly">話す</a>•<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Eye.of.the.dragonfly_c220.html" title="Special:Contributions/Eye.of.the.dragonfly">貢献</a>) 08:39, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
