<li>If only people were eligible for deletion on the basis of notability (or lack thereof), then we may begin to see an article on every individual building ("101 Elm Street, Townville", "102 Elm Street, Townville", "103 Elm Street, Townville", etc.). If I wrote an article about my house, which is insignificant apart from my living there, that could be considered nothing more than a vanity (by association) article. I hope that Tony Sidaway (and the rest of the "all schools are notable" crowd) see the folly and the absurdity of taking Wikipedia down this path.

<li>Suppose it were true that an article on every single school in the world were ever likely to appear on Wikipedia. Suppose further that these articles would, in their number, "dwarf" all the other content of Wikipedia. Why would this be a problem?

<li>This is true, and subtrivial-but-probably-accurate articles are <i>almost</i> harmless. Wikipedia is not intended to be mainly used via the "random article" link. And it doesn't have an easily visible list of contents. But let me ask: if I go to the article <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embryogenesis.html" title="Embryogenesis">Embryogenesis</a>, in what way is my reading experience affected by the existence of <i>inaccuracies</i> in articles on other topics? If there is, say, a group of people who wish to contribute inaccurate articles about a topic that is of interest <i>mainly to other people who tolerate these inaccuracies,</i> should anyone be concerned? If so, why? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:22, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'd definitely like to see a coherent answer to this. <b>Why</b> does it matter that WP has lots of articles about schools or any other marginally interesting thing? Surely our primary concern ought to be that the articles are well written, so that if someone were to look up X chool, they are not faced with nonsense or ugliness? Why would it matter if there were 64 million articles in Wikipedia, and 60 million were about schools? You keep saying it matters, guys, but you never actually explain why. Do you feel it is a question of <i>dignity</i>? Do you think it somehow reflects badly on you?</li>
<li>I don't understand your question, Dpbsmith, which is a pity because you are at least more thoughtful than most of the wannabe deletionists in this area. Your enjoyment of an article is not in the least affected by inaccuracies in other articles so long as it doesn't link to them <i>except</i> that if you read many very inaccurate articles, your faith in the accuracy of the article in question is damaged. This would seem to be an argument for accuracy (and by extension verifiability) and nothing much to do with whether articles should be included. If you are trying to argue that deletionists should be encouraged to spend more time ensuring that articles we have are accurate and less on trying to delete things they don't like, I wholeheartedly agree. If you are arguing that we should be encouraging people to contribute poor articles because others who tend to read them don't care about their mistakes (which you seem to be suggesting), then I don't agree. We should neither encourage nor discourage it, but should do our best to mitigate it by fixing up the bad stuff. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 02:38, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Tony seemed to be arguing that I shouldn't care about articles if they are not on topics of interest to me, because if they don't interest me I'll never see them and therefore they don't affect me. I'm saying, well, copyvios and inaccurate articles and POV and hoaxes <i>do</i> affect me <i>even</i> if they are on topics on which I would never consult WIkipedia. Therefore, I say, yes, I do have some interest in the quality of Wikipedia <i>as a whole.</i></dd>
<dd>Now, let's take this to the next step. Should <b>really low-quality</b> articles <b>ever</b> be deleted, simply because they are of low quality? This is tough, because we all recognize that Wikipedia articles are improved over time. <b>But not at the same rate.</b> There's no harm in a low-quality article about <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beethoven.html" title="Beethoven">Beethoven</a>, or <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddy_Holly_7119.html" title="Buddy Holly">Buddy Holly</a>, or <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisconsin.html" title="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>, because a lot of people know something about these topics and they will get improved quickly. On the other hand, very few people know much about Heathcote Elementary School. If the first person to write about it write a good-quality stub, good. If not, it may be months or years before anybody gets around to writing one—and it will likely be an independent event, i.e. the new article will probably not have "grown" from the old one.</dd>
<dd>Let's suppose that, for some reason, there is a class of topic that is attracting the contribution of large numbers of low-quality articles. If they are being contributed faster than they are being improved, yes, that's a problem.</dd>
<dd>There are no absolutes here. School articles are less of a problem than they used to be, because there are more serious, experienced editors working on them than there used to be.</dd>
<dd>People can't believe the Wikipedia process actually works. Well, it does work—but not automatically and not without conditions. One of the conditions is that there really be "many eyes." The problem with "non-notable" topics is that they attract <i>few eyes.</i></dd>
<dd><b>At some point,</b> articles are deletable if they are about something that is <b>too</b> non-notable. As you'd expect, not everyone draws the line at the same place. And, as you'd expect, at the borderline, there is great contention. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:30, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Okay, I think I can respond to that. I think the point is precisely this: that school articles are generally of such high quality, or can be made so, that deletion of a school article is actually quite a rare and surprising event. For nearly 276 school article deletion nominations, we've only had 37 school article deletions--less than 15% of those listed.</li>
<li>So is the problem that most school stubs created are rubbish? Well no, I don't think that claim can be defended either. Here is a log I have just created linking to every school article created on Wikipedia in the past three or four days: <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_New_2739.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/New">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/New</a>. There are some duds in there, but I'd happily take on most of them and pilot them through a AfD with a very high confidence of keeping the result.</li>
<li>Okay, is the problem that most school stubs aren't being improved, and there are too few eyes? I think one has to adopt a very blinkered approach to article production to support this hypothesis. Firstly, I think it's highly likely that Wikipedia or some successor project is likely to maintain this knowledge base in some publicly editable form for many decades. Secondly, only articles that people want to edit ever get created. There is no evidence that some mechanical script, like the one that created all those articles about tiny blips on the US census map, is at work here.</li>
<li>But finally I just don't buy the thesis. Schools are public institutions, so there is plenty of verifiable information about them. There is no reason to support the hypothesis that lack of eyes will be a problem. Any reasonably well educated, reasonably bright person can look at any school article and determine whether the statements in the article are adequately sourced and neutral. There is no problem with school articles that cannot be solved by the normal process of editing. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 03:55, 10 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Three questions. 1) Is it <i>possible</i> that there <i>could</i> be a class of article that attracts a rate of creation of articles of low quality and has a very low <i>rate</i> of article review and improvement—so that, at any given time, the average article quality was very low? 2) Would such a hypothetical class of article be a problem for Wikipedia? 3) Are school articles an instance of such a class? Obviously your answer to #3 is "no." But what about 1 and 2? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 11:14, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't buy 1 and 2, really. I think it's an interesting hypothesis but I don't find a lot of articles that are likely to be a problem for Wikipedia. A low rate of improvement is absolutely of no concern here; there is no deadline. I've got some concrete examples, too. Of the sixteen school articles created since midnight, UTC, I'd say three or four need cleanup, but the others are already pretty good stubs. Not bad going for their first day. Older schools get more edits and I think they tend to fare better at AfD. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 12:15, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
