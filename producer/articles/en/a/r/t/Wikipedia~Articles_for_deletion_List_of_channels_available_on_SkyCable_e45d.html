<li>Can anyone <i>please</i> properly define "TV guide?" In <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>, the only expample on "guide" is on a radio guide. "For example, an article on a radio station generally should not list upcoming events, current promotions, phone numbers, schedules etc., although mention of major events or promotions may be acceptable."(~From <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>) which makes the discussion of a TV guide issue very hard. But judging from the given example, listing radio stations is <i>not</i> included. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_channels_available_on_SkyCable_123b.html" title="List of channels available on SkyCable">This article</a> does not show any "upcoming events, current promotions, telephone numbers, schedules, etc." From my level of knowledge (3rd year high school student), a TV guide is a guide of <i>program schedules</i>. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_channels_available_on_SkyCable_123b.html" title="List of channels available on SkyCable">This</a> is a channel lineup.

A list of channels or even a list of programs is not the kind of TV guide that's been warned against. Now if this network used a wide variety of different programming blocks, then there might be arguments against this list, but it wouldn't be because it's a TV Guide.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, This is an old discussion. The DirecTV listing was nominated for deletion along with lists of ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, CW, MNTV, Dish Network and XM channels less than two months ago. The general consensus was that the lists of channels offered by each service, as long as they did not include detailed guide-type listings, did <b>not</b> constitute TV Guide as noted in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Nothing has changed since that point. Each of those nominations resulted in a finding of <b>keep</b>. I urge those prior decisions to be upheld, as nothing has changed in the interim. --<a href="../../../m/h/k/User%7EMhking_b8d7.html" title="User:Mhking">Mhking</a> 07:06, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, Each of these listings (I can't speak for SkyCable) grew out of their parent articles. They do not constitute a TV Guide-type listing; they are an indication as to what stations are associated with the network/satellite company, not unlike the list of teams in the NFL or the templates of stations in each television/radio market. I want to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, but this AfD feels more arbitrary than anything else. --<a href="../../../m/h/k/User%7EMhking_b8d7.html" title="User:Mhking">Mhking</a> 17:16, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>POI.</b> There are lots of things that are ever-changing that are in Wikipedia. Politics is ever changing, culture is ever changing. There is an article on the War in Somalia. That's a war in progress. How about the article on the War on Terror, the War in Iraq? Also, there are other people who might want to read this article, who are not subscribers. I think it's valid information to include a list of channels that DirecTV provides as their service.

<dd><b>Comment to both delete above</b> How are these non-encyclopedia works when they would give information? By using the judgement that you are giving, <i>Category:Lists of radio stations</i> and all lists within should be deleted. The previous ruling stated that these lists were not a directory, which is the closest to what you are meaning by listings. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETravKoolBreeze_4b48.html" title="User:TravKoolBreeze">TravKoolBreeze</a> 22:59, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> One of the first things I looked at when I was looking into getting DirecTV subscription was the DirecTV channels article. Very noteworthy and very informative. And to those who say that Wikipedia isn't a TV Guide, TV Guide shows what programs each channel is broadcasting. Listing what channels a satellite company is available to its customers is not a TV guide. For that reason, this AFD should really be deemed void. --<a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERaderick_97ff.html" title="User:Raderick">Raderick</a> 02:32, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> for bottom four, <b>Weak Keep</b> for the rest. As long as these articles are all kept on a tight leash so no advertising seeps through, then I don't have a problem with this. To me it's notable enough, even thogh I understand that Wikipedia's not a TV guide. --<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardman_4d38.html" title="User:Wizardman"><span style="color:#0D0;background:#009">Wizardman</span></a> 01:49, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
