<li>Whoa, hold on a moment, I just noticed something. "Other similar galleries"? What, precisely, is a "similar gallery"? I'm withdrawing my vote for now on the premise that I don't really think it's a good idea to fill out a blank check for the deletion of any page someone feels is similar to the ones explicitly listed....

<li>This is getting better and better.... As per Garrett's comment at the top, it most certainly does "make a difference." I would agree with the deletion of all of these articles, provided they were presented clearly at the very beginning of the vote. But this moving target approach stinks, and it's not giving any of the articles the chance for interested parties to make a countercase. I'm changing my vote to <b>keep</b>, as this whole vote is looking more and more like a fiasco, no matter how sound the reasoning is. – <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Seancdaug</a> 22:48, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Here are a few ways of getting around this: Create an article on the evolution of gaming graphics, then use some of these images to illustrate, or create articles for the games that don't already have articles, make sure the images are used, and make sure an easily accessible list page or category is made available (if not already in place).<a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 22:34, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No, those are <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_software.html" title="Free software">free</a> images, so you can do with them what you want, including making galleries. Fair use images on the other hand are images we don't have a licence to use but are allowed to use anyway for a fairly small number of purposes and in a fairly limited set of contexts. Galleries aren't one of those contexts. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 00:50, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, this VfD is nonsense, why should this be deleted when other galleries for artists or other recognised image media are kept? Nintendo and SEGA are notable companies as well as consoles, the imagery provided represents the progress that these companies have succeeded throughout the 20th Century with their video games. I find that this is of extreme importance to any archive or record relating to the history of video games and consoles. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 12:01, 24 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This <i>A</i>fD is <i><b>not</b></i> nonsense, so long as the official Wikipedia policy at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> <i><b>specifically</b></i> forbids it. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:55, 24 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then explain to me the purpose for such a galley as <a href="../../../w/i/l/William-Adolphe_Bouguereau_gallery_cf56.html" title="William-Adolphe Bouguereau gallery">William-Adolphe Bouguereau gallery</a>&#160;? Because as far as I can see both seem to be related in regards of displaying images related to an artist or in this case a video-game console. In regards to the video game console which so happens to be SEGA and Nintendo - both are notable and I think it is relevant to have a record of images based on the evolution of graphics of the games that both consoles have notable produced throughout the years. Unless you can come up with a better argument then I will continue to consider this VfD <b>nonsense</b> - I hope that was made clear. Also please be made sure that I am aware of what Wikipedia is not and is, and as far as I can see concerning the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> I quote "<i>Collections of photographs or media files with no text to go with the articles. If you are interested in presenting a picture, please provide an encyclopedic context, or consider adding it to Wikimedia Commons. If a picture comes from a public domain source on a website, then consider adding it to Wikipedia:Images with missing articles or Wikipedia:Public domain image resources.</i>" I can't see how the aforementioned article is an example of this. It is a gallery I agree, however a gallery of images that have been used throughout Wikipedia for articles related to the games, also they have been displayed under an encyclopedic context with added text and references to the individual articles of the games - just as other lists have been made, only in this case we are given information related to the evolution of the games in terms of their graphics and their respective screen shot. And whilst you're at it you lot should consider this entire category: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_image_galleries|Wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_image_galleries|Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Image Galleries</a>].

<li>Those galleries are in the namespace, I'm assuming to provide a place for editors to find images to illustrate their articles. And the images are free. These are not. I'm fairly sure no one is proposing to delete this images themselves, as they are valid fair use images in the context of the articles for the games. And the proposed article by 23skidoo would also be a valid fair use.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Heinous abuse of <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>. I suggest that we hunt out other such "screenshots of platform X" galleries and get them deleted too. Personally I think contentless policy-breach galleries are speedyable material, but if we have to drag each through an Afd then so be it. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 16:01, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - All of these galleries serve a purpose. They are encyclopedic, therefore they belong here. You delete these, then artist articles that are galleries besides these should be deleted as well. --<a href="../../../z/e/w/User%7EZeWrestler_d815.html" title="User:ZeWrestler"><span style="color:green">ZeWrestler</span></a> <a href="../../../z/e/w/User_talk%7EZeWrestler_e29c.html" title="User talk:ZeWrestler"><sup><span style="color:green">Talk</span></sup></a> 18:50, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please explain why <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_image_galleries_625f.html" title="Category:Wikipedia image galleries">Category:Wikipedia image galleries</a> is allowed to exist and this galleries are not? They all would be in the same violation.

Because as far as I can see it is exactly as I have indicated in my last statement, a gallery displaying reference worthy images that illustrate an important and encyclopedic purpose, otherwise as I and other have already stated before, you might as well get rid of the <b>ENTIRE</b> Category of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_image_galleries_625f.html" title="Category:Wikipedia image galleries">Category:Wikipedia image galleries</a>.

<li>To be fair, there is currently a proposal to move <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_image_galleries_625f.html" title="Category:Wikipedia image galleries">Category:Wikipedia image galleries</a> to the Commons for the very reasons being cited here (and repeated directly above by Zoe).

<li>There seems to be many list articles (of software, linux distributions) etc. Why not a list article of images?
