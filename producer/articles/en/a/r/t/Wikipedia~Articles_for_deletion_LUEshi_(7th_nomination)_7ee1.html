<p>Before we get this thing started, let me iterate that I am a member of both LUE and LUElinks, the central locations of the meme. Now, I clearly realize there have been previous decisions to keep this article. However, those decisions almost entirely ignored the rule and guideline violations, most of which it cannot live up to. This nomination is not of bad faith.</p>
<p>The article violates the following policies and guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I quote: "Wikipedia is not the place for original research. Citing sources and avoiding original research are inextricably linked: the only way to demonstrate that you are not doing original research is to cite reliable sources that provide information directly related to the topic of the article, and to adhere to what those sources say." - now, there are no reliable sources for this article and I don't believe there are any in existence. Due to the fact its main presence is on a private board, it's very unlikely for a source to publish any information on it. The "GameFAQs archive" is barely reliable, I don't believe it is. It a list of topics submitted by users, which means anything could easily have been modified.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The only thing that can possibly be verified is its origin (the source isn't very reliable either) and its existence. This isn't fact, but it is shown with the article's great lack of references.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Quote: "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself." The article does not have any references showing this, and based on my research, I cannot find any.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I assure you there are a few more guidelines the article violates, but I believe this is enough to convince deletion. I have gathered a list of things that the ASCII art claims notability for, and rebuttals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signed by Shigeru Miyamoto</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This was simply because a person asked him to - Miyamoto would likely sign my arm if I asked him to, that doesn't make my hand notable for an article.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Popular on the GameFAQs message boards</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, for the purposes of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, it's not, since it seems only to be popular on "Life, Universe and Everything", a private message board on GameFAQs - its popularity therefore cannot be confirmed. I invite you to give a reliable source that asserts its popularity.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Interesting/I like it/Why not?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>These are not reasons to keep an article. Observe the policies and guidelines to give a valid argument.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>[this meme] was kept on Wikipedia! Why can't this stay?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>That's a different situation. The meme has most likely been more popular, or is able to be researched without violating <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Regardless, if you believe that article should go, you're free to nominate it.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The previous consensuses were to keep</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The previous consensuses were also rather ill-founded. I have taken the liberty to give the violations and provide rebuttals to arguments. These rules weren't even argued against in the previous nominations, leading to a simple battle of votes, not consensus.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I remind everyone not to blindly vote. The result is decided with consensus, not vote amount, so don't waste your time if you have no argument. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 03:43, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Votes and discussion</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - I am the nominator. Other options are to merge/redirect to <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameFAQs_b5e0.html" title="GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/c/ASCII_art_8901.html" title="ASCII art">ASCII art</a> or create a new Non-proportional ASCII art page. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 03:43, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> and redirect to <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameFAQs_b5e0.html" title="GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a>. Honestly, I'd been considering nominating this again myself for a while. Simply put, this is yet another example of unverifiable internet stuff that's been kept around due to a lot of <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>, meatpuppetry, and other such nonsense. The only sources here are archived GameFAQs message board posts, which are far from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Any claims to notability need to be backed up with verifiable information from reliable sources, and there really isn't any in this case.<br />
Meanwhile, note that the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_LUEshi_%285th_nomination%29_9fd2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/LUEshi (5th nomination)">second-to-last AfD</a> ended with a suggestion for a merge to <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameFAQs_message_boards_e521.html" title="GameFAQs message boards">GameFAQs message boards</a>, which never materialized. That article has since been merged into the main GameFAQs article itself, which is a sign that all of the GameFAQs-related stuff should be confined to a single article.<br />
Finally, the last AfD was speedy kept as a bad-faith nom, "citing the GNAA clause". Of course, the GNAA article itself has now been deleted due to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> concerns, so it's now safe to say that there isn't really any kind of policy exemption given to repeatedly-nominated articles. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 04:28, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment'</b>. TEG, do you have a personal feud against LUE and its descendants? This article is being nominated for deletion the seventh ****ing time - most of previous ones were your work! What if someone gets a forum invasion with ton of LUEshis and wants to look up WTF the LUEshi is? Your claim about it being non-verifiable is false, since any GameFAQs staff member could do it, should <i>you</i> ask. As for notability, ANY Internet fad could be rendered as such, since one always could find a million people who doesn't know about it. <a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzman_59bf.html" title="User:Xyzman">xyzman</a> 09:33, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>According to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">the verifiability policy</a>: "<i>If an article topic has no reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it.</i>" "Reliable sources" refers to actual published sources; "GameFAQs staff members" do not qualify.<br />
"Someone might want to look this up" is also not a valid reason for having an article here; you could insert just about anything into that hypothetical. And anyway, if one were to look up "LUEshi" in such a situation, they'd be redirected to the GameFAQs article. Then they could scroll down to the "Message boards" section, where LUEshi is mentioned under the "Life, the Universe, and Everything" heading.<br />
And I don't see any previous AfDs started by the nominator of this one. What are you talking about? <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 10:12, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't have a personal feud against "LUE and its descendants", in fact I enjoy going there. None of the previous AfDs were my work - where are you getting this from!? If someone gets a forum invasion with a ton of ASCII-art renditions of my arm, does that mean we need an article on it? No, not really. It's a terrible analogy, I know, but it works. A GameFAQs staff member verifying it is called "original research" and is against the primary policies of Wikipedia. I'd advise you to read these, they're the basis for the deletion. Sure, a "million people" don't know about anything, but that's irrelevant - Wikipedia needs sources and verifiability, and articles that cannot achieve this do not belong. I have nothing against LUEshi, in fact it's pretty funny sometimes. It just doesn't belong on Wikipedia. I really don't understand why members of LUE can't differentiate between the two. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 19:19, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is the 7th nomination to delete this article. Give it up. - The Norse 21:49, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm sorry, but the article breaks rules, and all it needs is a lengthy nomination so it doesn't get sabotaged by blind voters. Came from <a href="http://www.luelinks.net/showmessages.php?board=42&amp;topic=1987325" class="external text" title="http://www.luelinks.net/showmessages.php?board=42&amp;topic=1987325" rel="nofollow">this topic</a>, didn't you?--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 21:50, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. TEG, unless you can somehow prove that people are being lured here to serve as blind voters, please don't throw around the accusation. You cherry-picked <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, which gives three criteria, and only one of them needs to be met. "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." Given that this is simply a meme, "distributed" could reasonably be interpreted to mean that an explanation, as well as the ASCII itself, are present on the site. A quick google search shows Urbandictionary, encyclopediadramatica, and YTMND all on the first page, with YTMND having 43 hits for "LUEshi" and the other two having articles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, LUEshi is being used as a mascot, not just as the ASCII. The Urban Dead wiki has an article about a group called "LUEshi's Undead" (<a href="http://wiki.urbandead.com/index.php?title=Lueshi's_Undead&amp;printable=yes" class="external free" title="http://wiki.urbandead.com/index.php?title=Lueshi's_Undead&amp;printable=yes" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.urbandead.com/index.php?title=Lueshi's_Undead&amp;printable=yes</a>). CafePress offers a LUEshi shirt (<a href="http://www.cafepress.com/buy/andrea/-/pv_design_prod/pg_1/p_storeid.11085364/pNo_11085364/id_4397428/opt_/fpt_/c_360/" class="external free" title="http://www.cafepress.com/buy/andrea/-/pv_design_prod/pg_1/p_storeid.11085364/pNo_11085364/id_4397428/opt_/fpt_/c_360/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cafepress.com/buy/andrea/-/pv_design_prod/pg_1/p_storeid.11085364/pNo_11085364/id_4397428/opt_/fpt_/c_360/</a>). LUEshi is (admittedly slowly) spreading across the internet due to the actions of LUEsers, has reached a variety of sites, has links to archived topics off GameFAQs (including his creation); what more is really needed? Just because you don't like the GameFAQs archive doesn't mean it isn't a valid source, with fictional entries removed when they are noticed, which is essentially the same system of peer review that Wikipedia itself uses.<a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlternator_2109.html" title="User:Alternator">Alternator</a> 22:49, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>You've voted a strong keep and yet you've simply ignored the policy violations. As well as that, every single site you've listed is user-created. Urbandictionary, ed, YTMND, Urban Dead, Cafe Press. They're all user-edited sites. None of them are reliable sources, and all articles need reliable sources. There simply aren't any, and you're foolish to ignore that. Really, I'm trying extremely hard to control my anger. You're throwing false accusations and ignoring points all over the place. "What more is really needed"? A RELIABLE SOURCE. "LUEshi is spreading accross the internet"? You'll need a source for that. "you don't like the GameFAQs archive"? Actually, I like it. The problem is that it is user-submitted material, meaning it is not a reliable source. You cannot ignore this. Your argument is so lacking in logic it's not funny. Next time try making a relevant argument to the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guideline, and the two policies that you plainly ignored. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 23:00, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>In addition to that, I think you misunderstood the thing you quoted in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. If you'll read the footnote, it's clear that user-created material is not fulfilling the criteria. Because of this, it does not pass <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. May I ask, why do you want the LUEshi article? It breaks rules, and you know it. Don't deny it. There must be some reason for it, I'm assuming it has something to do with LUE's fame. I realize I'm swaying into bad conduct here, but when only LUE members are keeping, it simply makes me curious as to why they want the article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 23:11, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>First off, civility would be appreciated. Stop badgering, harassing, accusing, and/or badmouthing people who express different opinions. Further, you're ignoring the very important differences between the rules for articles (which are strict) and talk pages (which are meant to be discussions), complaining when people express their personal viewpoint. I'm not going to reply to your accusations, nor to any of your complaints save one, because quite frankly you've demonstrated a complete inability to maintain a civil discourse. I'd like to note, however, that Wikipedia is technically a "user submitted site"; WP:WEB discounts sites with no review process whatsoever, such as Newgrounds; while this would discount YTMND (which was more about Notability, which has been brought up in prior VfD), it would not remove the other Wiki sites that I included. I'm maintaining my Strong Keep, and noting that I feel this is a Bad Faith Nom.<a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlternator_2109.html" title="User:Alternator">Alternator</a> 23:49, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My mistakes in following discussion rules are not a reason for you to ignore the article rules. You have still yet to provide any argument whatsoever that disprove any of the policies I have given. May you answer my question? May you back up your vote? I think you know exactly why I'm being uncivil, it's because your arguments are false, ignore points, and have no basis. I hope you realize those sites are not reliable sources under any terms. Please, just read the rules. It is not a bad faith nom AT ALL! HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT? I provided THREE CLEAR VIOLATIONS, and a rebuttal to any points brought up. That's the most anyone can expect from a nomination. You disgust me. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 00:02, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Wikis are <i>far</i> from reliable sources. That includes WP itself; that's why third-party published sources for verification are insisted upon here. Suggesting that pages from other wikis with even lower standards of inclusion could be taken as sources is just silly. (And of course, ED isn't even allowed to be linked to on WP any more, so that's even more unusable.) <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 01:17, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Alternator, look at the sixth AFD. It was ****ing flooded with anonymous users who were all voting keep. I know that the both the third and the sixth nominations at least have had a LUElinks topic on the AFD, which naturally led to the use of SPAs, anonymous users, and some dead accoutns piling on the keep votes. This article has had a history of massive sockpuppetry and meatpuppetry, so this accusation is just a precaution against this happening again. Hbdragon88 23:32, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm aware of this, and if this is his reason, he should have pointed out the prior issues rather than blasting away without substantiating his complaints.
