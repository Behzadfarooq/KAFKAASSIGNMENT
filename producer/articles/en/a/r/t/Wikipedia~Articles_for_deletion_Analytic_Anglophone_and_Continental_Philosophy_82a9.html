<p>The overwhelming majority of text in this article is unsourced. Worse, the overwhelming majority of text in this article is unverifiably vague, or simply false (e.g.: analytic philosophy is not identical to anglophone philosophy, and continental philosophy by that name is primarily practiced in anglophone philosophy departments). Numerous discussions on the talk page have made it clear that this page is essentially a piece of original research by User:Lucas. <a href="../../../2/7/1/User%7E271828182.html" title="User:271828182">271828182</a> 04:02, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The book that is <i>cited by the article</i> is not only subtitled "Comparing Analytic and Continental Philosophy", it also has a chapter on the subject of "On the Analytic-Continental Divide in philosophy" that runs to 42 pages. Then there are:
<ul>
<li>page 11 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 3937202366</a> — where Simons argues that Austrian philosophy is "geographically continental" but "in content and tenor analytic"</li>
<li>the two chapters of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0415162513</a> — chapter 5 where Sacks examines the two traditions' approaches to a single subject and chapter 3 where Ross argues that the analytic/continential dichotomy is incorrect</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0631221255</a> — where Solomon discusses the twain on page 1</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0415242096</a> — which discusses and critiques "Rorty's attempt to restore the peace" on pages 14 to 17</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0748624716</a> — where Glendinning argues, like Ross, that the analytic/continential dichotomy is incorrect</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And those are just for starters. There are <i>plenty</i> of sources on this subject to be used, both that describe the idea of the split and that argue against it. Any problems with this article are a matter of cleanup, not deletion. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 04:19, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment.</b> While there are sources on the general topic of analytic and continental styles of philosophy, that has little to do with the issue at hand, which is <i>the article</i> in question. The article makes no reference to the sources Uncle G mentions (aside from one book), and the overwhelming majority of the claims in the article would be quite difficult to trace to such sources, owing to their vagueness or falsity. Crucially, the entire article is premised on a strongly POV assumption that the titular divide exists as a sharp distinction, capable of yielding the (unsourced) blanket generalizations made in practically every line of the article. An article needing cleanup "generally requires only editing skills" -- but this article would have to be rewritten almost from scratch, quite likely including the title. And as the history of this article shows, such a global revision would likely provoke a series of reverts and edit wars that would tax the patience or sanity of all but the saintliest of Wikipedians. Given these fundamental problems of verifiability and POV original research, this article is beyond mere cleanup. <a href="../../../2/7/1/User%7E271828182.html" title="User:271828182">271828182</a> 04:03, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The assertion that an article needs rewriting, a cleanup action for which we have a <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_Cleanup_ae6e.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/Cleanup">cleanup tag</a> ({{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-rewrite_97ec.html" title="Template:Cleanup-rewrite">cleanup-rewrite</a>}}), does not support a conclusion that fixing the problems with the article is not a matter of cleanup. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:54, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment. on 271828182's comment above</b>To say it is beyond cleanup and should be deleted means you must deny the premise of the book which is called, as noted by Uncle G above: "Comparing Analytic and Continental Philosophy". You should also go to the pages <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Philosophy_ecd8.html" title="Continental Philosophy">Continental Philosophy</a> and Analytic Philsophy and suggest they be deleted too since you deny such a divide exists. Given the divide and that neither of the two mentioned above pages can satisfy the requirment of an unbiased article we need a page to details the historical course of this schism (as Rorty calls it) and also provide some clarity to the huge amount of confusion that results in philosophy because of this split. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> 14:46, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>There is nothing wrong with Anglophone/Analytic philosophy and it is not bigoted but <i>de facto</i>. Suggest the name also is kept, it balances any accusation of bias, since nor is the word Continental, used by the continental Philosophers, who tend to use Anglophone to refer to U.S./British philosophy that is called by themselves Analytic. No one said Analytic was identical with Anglophone but they are often used nowadays interchangeably. There are sources there too, in all thirteen pblished philosophers. Nor is there "evidence on the talk page" that this is original or unsourced. One comment on the talk pages suggest it is the best article they have read in philosophy. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> 22:30, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. First: there are three references, not thirteen. I'm not sure exactly where the latter number came from. Second: in any case, if Analytic philosophy is not meant to be paired with the Anglophone ethnicity in any rigid way, then this should not be suggested by the forward slash. Hence the requirement for moving the article. Third: there is a contingent historical connection between Anglophone countries and analytic philosophy that no-one will deny. However, if it is true that the two are used "interchangably" by some group of people -- an assertion which remains to be proven -- then it is out of carelessness, not prudence. Grad school programs at Northwestern University, Boston University, McGill University, SUNY Stony Brook, among many other so-called "Anglo" universities, presently emphasize an interdisciplinary education which is versed in both in continental and analytic forms. Moreover, I'm sure that the Polish logicians would be rather surprised to hear about the latent anglo-analytic suggestion (for one). <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">{ Ben S.

<li><b>Comment</b> The thirteen I referred to were the number of top line philosophers who wrotes essays in the book called "A House Divided". But it even took them 50 years before coming to that book, since as Rorty suggests it was in the 50s that the "take over" of English language philosophy schools occurred by the Analytic philosophers. Yet even these 13 are not the only ones who refer to this divide, it is also remarked upon by many others.</li>
<li>The issue of using the term Anglophone is a little complicated but mainly under an accusation of Anglophone bias the words used by Continentals for themselves is not Continental, they are labelled as such by Analytics. However, Analytics call themselves Analytic. So we have to add a word that Continentals use for Analytics, that word is Anglophone (or do you know a better one). <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> 14:46, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To be sure, nobody doubts that there is a continental/analytic distinction in the history of philosophy. The item under question is not that, but whether or not use of "Anglo" as a synonymy for "Analytic" is a bigoted conflation.</li>
<li>The ugly story of slight and revenge is not at all grounding for Wikipedia's endorsement of it. It is curious that anyone could think that such a thing would be appropriate.</li>
<li>My alternative word is "analytic", because there is no reason which rests in facts to conflate analytic philosophy and those of anglophone heritage. "Continental (metaphysics)" may have been a more or less crappy phrase, but at least it was <i>geographical</i>, not <i>ethnic</i>. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">{ Ben S.

<li><b>delete</b> hopelessly pov, simplistic &amp; innacurate. terms 'b. analytic' &amp; 'cont. phil.' are inherently slippery, &amp; often only terms of abuse. granted they are are commonly used but (&amp; the polish logicians are a good example here) these terms don't actually correspond to either schools, methodologies or even geographical distribution. would be better to have descriptions of how these terms are commonly (mis)used, in the relevant articles. the rest can be covered in more specific articles on the relevant issues/debates. this article also hopelessly oversimplifies most of the so called 'continental philosophy' it briefly teeters into. (also sentences like "At times parsimoniously reifying concepts that are, in fact, more complexly related." aside from possibly being meaningless, are not appropriate in a general purpose encyclopedia). cld be stubbed, but unlikely to ever produce a useful article, also problems with art. name.&#160;<span style="background-color: #000000">&#160;<font color="white"><b>⇒</b></font> <a href="../../../b/s/n/User%7EBsnowball_6f51.html" title="User:Bsnowball"><font color="white">bsnowball</font></a>&#160;</span> 10:01, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>While what you say is true, it remains the case that there is a latent association in the article title that passes itself off as a necessary association. However we deal with this, be it through mere redirect or outright move, it is disrespectful to analytics in the world outside Anglophonia, and disrespectful to Continentals within it. I think that that rationale should be made totally clear, here. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">{ Ben S.

<li><b>Comment</b>The issue of geography is made abundantly clear in the article. The reason for the article is that neither of the pages on Analytic or the one on Continental are capable of giving an unbiased overview of the split. Though both of these article do say they are defined mainly as being in distinction from the other. The issue of parsimony is not meaningless, nor is reifying. The section you refer to on pejorative uses gets across some of the heat of the division. The urgency with which a few editors seem to want to delete the article completely even thought they never edited it, also tells of this blind-spot in wiki philosophy. Anglophone seems to be the keyword here, Analytics do not like it, it seems, but why do you not like being "Anglophone", is it self-disgust or what? As to insulting those on the Continent who do Analytic in French, for example, I would say it is not insulting but a reality most of them have to read the major Analytic philosophers and they are mainly in English. Again we try to give a general sense of this divide without the one-to-one accuracy of terms that certain, mainly Analytic people, believe exists.</li>

<dd>"The reason for the article is that neither of the pages on Analytic or the one on Continental are capable of giving an unbiased overview of the split." You are assuming that only analytic philosophers (with animosity toward so-called continental) edit the analytic article, and only 'continental' philosophers (with animosity toward analytic) edit the Continental philosophy article and never the twain shall meet. Why not assume good faith that those editing these articles do not have such an agenda. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 15:18, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

If "most of them have to read the major Analytic philosophers", then that provides grounds for the opposite conclusions. And analytic texts, like all texts, are translated into other tongues. Those that originate in English, may be translated into French.

<li><b>Delete.</b> The title is obviously inappropriate. Indeed, the citation to Rorty which Lucas keeps mentioning is one I provided to demonstrate that analytic philosophy is something Anglophone philosophy departments started doing at some point in their history. Previously, they did something ELSE (mainly neo-Hegelianism), and they did it anglophonically. Furthermore, analytic philosophy has its most important roots in German-language philosophy - Frege, Wittgenstein, Carnap.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have argued for deletion in the Talk section. I have also attempted to make changes - which really means deleting the many errors and leaving little substance (e.g. the "Schism" section), but the main author simply reverts. Even the "endorsement" mentions that there are "blatant formal errors"! There is nothing here which could not be covered in a couple of accurate sentences in the Continental and Analytic main articles. <a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD</a></p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: One amusing feature of this discussion is that as a prominent non-analytic anglophone philosopher, Rorty himself is an excellent counter-example to the title's conflation. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECHE_35ad.html" title="User:CHE">CHE</a> 04:42, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This particular article is mainly an original-research essay and should not exist, and furthermore <i>nothing</i> should exist at the title "Analytic/Anglophone and Continental Philosophy". A better written, better sourced, and more cautious article on the schism between analytic and continental philosophy might be worth writing, though. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 13:43, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>:There is nothing original about this article, again it is a major issue of contemporary philosophy, the article has many references, multiple editors work on it. Anyhow, this is not a delete but a re-write request. Nor does CHE seem to understand that Rorty crosses the divide he does not refute it, but sees it very clearly. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> 09:05, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> as OR essay. I know little about the issue, but I recognise that with blanket statements like "Continental and Analytic philosophers tend to ignore one another", this is one poor article. The topic is clearly notable, though. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 22:52, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Well they do "tend to ignore one another"! Wake up and read the reference material or any entrenched Analytic or Continental philosopher, you will not seem them mention philosophers other than those in their own side of the schism, anyhow the statement is backed up by a reference. Searle remarked the attidude of Analytic to postmodernism is that "most of this stuff just passes them by, they wonder, why waste my time attackingit".</li>
<li>I really do not know from where this move to delete the article rather than rename it, the article has been the work of over 40 editors over only a few months, there are 7 references to books and journals by leading philosophers which is even better than the intro to the main wiki philosophy page! Not only this but the page has to resist trained minions who can only see Analytic or Continental philosophy but never both.</li>
<li>By the way, the page was called just "Analytic and Continental Philosophy", we could rename it to this if required. The reason Anglophone was added to the name I explained above, such reasons no one seems to refute, since balance is the key to this article. However, I added an extra caveat in the article on the much disliked word, "Anglophone." --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> 09:05, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Come on, I have given any number of reasons to "refute" the new title on the Talk Page. (1) "Anglophone" just means English-speaking, which Wittgenstein, Frege, Carnap and the rest of the Vienna Circle, and countless lesser analytic philosophers were not (I mean, of course, they didn't write English as their first language). (2) As the Rorty quote makes clear, Anglophone philosophy departments existed for a century or so without teaching analytic philosophy. (3) As has been pointed out endlessly on the Talk page, and here, both these kinds of philosophy are done by Anglophone and non-Anglophone philosophers. The title has to change. As for re-writing, the main part of the article is a series of comparative sections (X vs Y). All of these are just wrong - they need to come out. The schism section has only a couple of arguably relevant entries. The rest needs to be deleted. Then just try to read what's left ("At times parsimoniously reifying concepts that are, in fact, more complexly related.") An entirely new article could be written, but I'd recommend a few, consistent sentences in the existing articles for Analytic and Continental (with balanced comments on the philosophers who have tried to understand both traditions: Dummett, Ryle, etc). As for "trained minions who can only see Analytic or Continental philosophy but never both", my undergraduate philosophy degree is from an Anglophone, analytic Philosophy Department, where I specialised in Wittgenstein; my postgraduate was based on Heidegger and Nietzsche. So I do both - which is not as freakish as this article implies. Note also that a bunch of references were added only after the article was threatened with deletion: it's not clear that the content of the article was based on that material - indeed, given the errors in the article it seems unlikely. <a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD</a></li>
<li>Yes you have given reasons but they do not refute this use of the word. (1) Anglophone connotes more than one thing (2) Rorty makes clear the Anglophone was "taken over" in the 50s and remains taken over by Analytic philosophy. When a country is conquered the flag is changed. (3) I remind you each time that the artcile makes it clear that Analytic also takes place in Italy etc. and that when they read they must read alot of English, you can't do Analytic without Anglophone otherwise you can't read all the latest Analytic stuff in the journals which is overwhelmingly Anglophone (4) The comparitive sections are backed up by references, they are well known differences between these two camps as illucidated in the 10 or so references given at the bottom of the article. By the way you obviously never read the referenced material? (5) It is based closely and with quotes on these references, most of which were already there if not so explicitly. (6) The article does not make out that doing both Analytic and Continental is freakish, Rorty seems to do ok and we quote him there. Ask youself why your degree was Analytic? and further why did you switch entirely to Continental for your postgrad? Did you learn anything, what was the difference? And if there is none why didnt you do Heidegger at degree level? Again if you spent a tenth of the time on the article instead of on the talk page and here trying to delete it, you might have contributed something to wiki. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> 21:05, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

For the record, I corrected the Schism section, and Lucas reverted to the previous version. I know when I am wasting my time. <b>The References</b> - as I said above, these were dropped into the article as an afterthought when it was threatened with deletion. It would be interesting to check them (for the most part, page references are missing). The reference to Heidegger (#6) obviously does not support the (false) claim made in the article ("Continental philosophy on the other hand tends to use the term Logic more loosely...etc). Ref #8 is easily checked too, as its online, and it does not support the text in the article ("each accused of being either, too historical or completely ahistorical").

<li><b>Overall Coment Prior to Closure</b>: The article is undoubtedly controversial, inevitably so, because the issue rises between both of the main academic philosophies. Since this is an English speaking website, Analytic trained people have prepondered and wish to delete it. Why? because it shows up perhaps a whole other way of doing philosophy that is at least equal to it. The same would probably happen on the Continental website. With multiple references and 40 contributors, to delete it would be a waste and it would be giving in to prejudice. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> 22:43, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>However, the bigoted title is very much grounds for deletion. Perhaps you disagree, and maintain the position that the forward-slash is not indicative of synonymy, etc. (As you know, I think this is an entirely untenable position.) But feigning innocence and confusion over this point on your part, making a variety of attributions of bad will, prejudice, etc. is disengenuous at best. I own a book by Lyotard. I am inspired by the existentialists. But these facts, far from endearing me to your position, actually motivate me further to clear up the error. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">{ Ben S.

<dd>The whole point of adding Anglophone to the title was to even up the balance, since, someone had complained that it is unfair to call Continentals, "Continental" as they do not call themselves that. Anglophone evens it up a little. So the bigotry I must tell you is on your side (regardless of what books you read) and I feign no innocence: I mentioned clearly above that I see the bigoted view coming mainly from a very English-centred philosophy. However, the same I agreed might happen on a Continental website. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> 12:16, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>THis is the kind of thing which makes progress impossible: "You have obviously not read the reference to Heidegger, otherwise you wouldn't be saying that." I have a doctorate in Heidegger's philosophy, I know Being and Time like the back of my hand; he does not say there or anywhere that COntinental philosophers understand logic more loosely in terms of Logos. Both the references I checked were wrong; given that the others were dumped long after the article appeared, skepticism is inevitable. If page numbers were provided by whoever (!) inserted them, they would be easier to check. I removed the entries under Key Moments in the Schism which didn't mention analytic philosopher or philosophers at all. I corrected the entries on Carnap and Searle/Derrida, but Lucas reverted to the previous factually incorrect entries. I would like to see the article deleted, and I am not an analytic philosopher. It is as much of an embarrassment to both schools. An article about difference between analytic and Continental philosophy could be written: the current article has a fatally misleading title, and is something like 90% wrong - either factually inaccurate or meaningless. Those calling for re-writes nevertheless have to realise, from this page and the talk page, that Lucas will block and undo any editing which changes the article fundamentally. <a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD</a> P.S.
