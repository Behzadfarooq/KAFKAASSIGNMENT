<li><s><b>Delete</b>. The article is now mainly a collection of lists of random Book Seven trivia. None of the other editors of the page have any desire to change that. As <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> expounds, "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information." If are article can't be anything but a random jumble of facts, it shouldn't be there at all. Furthermore, it is plainly bad style. I urge people to check the current version of the article and reconsider their votes.

<dd>Comment - My understanding of VfD is that a page should only be deleted if the title of the article is one for which no sutable article might be placed there. So per yoru original comments I think its worth keeping, even if in its current state the quality is left much to be desired.

<li><b>Keep</b>, this has been officially annouced, is a notable event, and the current article is reasonable at sticking to the known fact.

<li><small><b>Keep</b>. If someone looks up book 7 in wiki they will expect to find something more than the known definite facts, which they probably will know already (since they are few). They will expect this article also to contain reasonable analysis of what could (must) be in it, based on the other books so far, and further hints which will undoubtedly come along as the authors seek a bit of publicity. For example, Rowlings has already stated that it will contain more about Dumbledore, despite his just having been killed off.<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 16:36, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><small><b>Keep</b>. Needs cleanup, not deletion. There is, at this point, enough factual information about this book to make a short article.
