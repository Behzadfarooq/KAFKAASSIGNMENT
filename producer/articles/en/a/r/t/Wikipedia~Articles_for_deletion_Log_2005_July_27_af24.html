<li>Delete: <b>Duplicate material</b> is either for deletion or redirection. I have serious trouble with the very idea, however, of The Bible and homosexuality, as it implies that the Bible as a whole can be said to have a view on "homosexuality," which is a 19th century cultural construction. Further, everything in this is "uses of the Bible by proponents and opponents of homosexual intercourse." If no passage in the Bible says "homosexual," and none does, then everything is interpretation, and therefore the subject is really "what people say is sanctioned by passages in the Bible." <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:10, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The term <i>homosexual</i> does not exist in the Bible, but it does reference homosexuals ith both the Old Testament and the New Testament (as the article explains). The fact that you an educated man think that the Bible does not refer to homosexuality whenit does explains the need for the article. However, condemnation is up to interpretation, I agree. But it cannot be denied how big of an issue it is with governments allowing gay marriages and religious groups condemning it because it is unnatural according to the Bible. There is a need for an article that discusses (or at least lists) the verses of the Bible they refer to. Otherwise the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality_and_Christianity_4e22.html" title="Homosexuality and Christianity">Homosexuality and Christianity</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality_and_Judaism_d158.html" title="Homosexuality and Judaism">Homosexuality and Judaism</a>, the <b><a href="../../../g/o/d/Godhatesfags.com.html" title="Godhatesfags.com">godhatesfags.com</a></b> articles (and several others) should be removed as well.

<dd>I largely agree with Geogre, but I still think that, since many people believe the bible discusses this topic it merits an article. That article, I think, should include the fact that the whole discussion is comparing ancient writings with a modern day cultural construct. I don't think that fact invalidates the article though. As the unsigned person says this is debated even at the governmental level, and providing a resource to help people more intelligently discuss the topic is valid in my opinion. I am not retracting my statement that the article needs a complete rewrite though. <a href="../../../c/o/h/User%7ECohesion_07b5.html" title="User:Cohesion">cohesion</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/h/User_talk%7ECohesion_c433.html" title="User talk:Cohesion">talk</a> 18:53, July 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, my point is that same-sex sexual acts are discussed, somewhat, in the Bible, but it takes interpretation to even make that so. On the other hand, "homosexuality" is a construct (the idea of a life-long same-sex pairing) and derives largely from a clinical setting. We're dealing with apples and shotguns, here. It's quite true that governments and shrill folks are speaking of The Bible as having something to say on the issue, but, honestly, I see that as addressed elsewhere already. E.g. the fundamentalist attack on homosexuality is discussed in the Christianity and article, while Judaic disquiet is in that article. I.e. the "what they say about them" is already covered in the various 'they' articles. Other than that, there really isn't a need to offer up a prescriptive group of prooftexts for folks. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:45, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The point of this article is not "what they say about them" but "what the bible says about them" which has affected how christians (and societies of christian majorities and even organizations like "the boy scouts") think of homosexuality (and same-sex marriage, and adoption by homosexuals, etc.). This article is supposed to be a collection of the verses that talk about same-sex relationship (whether they are sexual or long-term non-sexual). Christians are being accused everywhere of bigotry when the Bible itself talks about same-sex relationships. Homosexuals are attacked everywhere when the Bible may not even condemn explicitly their relationships. This article is supposed to show the foundation of the positions. --<a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizcarra_288c.html" title="User:Vizcarra">Vizcarra</a> 21:04, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

To be honest, now that I've grown up a bit, I think it's a bit wasteful. Wikipedia is a place to get information. It's not a place to get converted, it's not a place to listen to the latest arguments for or agaist a certain Christian point, et cetera. The topic is almost <i>never</i> given proper citations and references, and, largely, they are the opinions of Wikipedia users. Wikipedia should not be cataloging all of the scripture used to make a point or not to make a point; it should <b>link to the people making the points.</b> They can cite their own scripture, and do their own apologetics, however they please. If this page remains, I would like to see it reduced to a list of citations, possibly with included text, with <b>each quote followed by a link to a non-wikipedia site,</b> and that's it. Since there's no consensus, Wikipedia shouldn't jump to conclusions, and Wikipedia <b>definitely</b> need not present the arguments that prevent a consensus. 128.253.110.167 03:02, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If there is going to be an edit war over these ridiculous allegations, it's better that it be on this page then mucking up Harry Magdoff's web page. I should note that a Google search for "Magdoff", "Venona" and "Kant" (Magdoff's supposed Venona secret spy name) yields four results currently. One is Wikipedia. One is a white supremacist site. One is John Earl Haynes web site - Haynes is a far right author who makes accusations of Soviet espionage by name of hundreds of US Democrats and liberals, never mind people to the left of them. As I said - a Google search turns this up as the fringiest of fringe things, yet they want to fill up three quarters of Magdoff's article with these fringe accusations that he is a Soviet spy. I should note <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">User:Nobs01</a> is editing the Wikipedia articles for half of the liberals and Democrats in the early/mid twentieth century and accusing them of being spies.

<li>Cberlet, you are the one who <i>unilaterally</i> moved all of the text from the main article to a POV fork without consensus and without even asking anyone's thoughts; I was simply correcting this move. It was <i>already</i> the largest section (by text) on the page when you got there. The reason being the section was challenged factually so we backed it up in the most concise manner possible.

<li><s><b>Keep, but rename</b></s><b>Dithering</b>. This material is way too lengthy to put in the Magdoff article; if he was a source, it was a relatively minor episode in his overall career, and putting all this stuff in his article is poor stylistically - it needs to be in a separate article. (I would suggest something like Harry Magdoff spying controversy.) It has to be covered at length, alas, because this whole issue of whether or not Magdoff was a source for the Golos network is apparently a <i>bete noire</i> for those on the left, which has resulted in this becoming a big go-round. It seems that to simply say "he was a source" is deemed unacceptable (although all reputable historians of the period of whom I am aware now agree he was one), but the inclusion of material from offical archives, excerpts from sworn legal depositions, etc is harder to question, so that has become the default path. As such, it's necessary to extensively cite all the relevant documents (VENONA decrypts, Comintern archives, etc), and as I explained, that sort of lengthy material is not appropriate for his main article. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 19:58, 27 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Now that I think about it, whether <i>this</i> page is encyclopaedic, well, I'm somewhat dubious - it's really a bit too detailed; this is really devolving into a level of detail where it's more like a journal article on the issue at this point, giving all the original sources - not really encyclopaedic. On the other hand, given lack of a consensus to say in the main article what contemporary secondary sources say flatly (that he was a "source"), I don't know what to do. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 16:28, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For the record, I totally agree that the main article should indicate that several published sources stat flatly that Magdoff was used as a source of information by the KGB, as long as there is also text that explores the dispute over what that actually means. For too long the large amount of text and illusrations were designed to imply that Magdoff was a Soviet spy.

<li><b>Keep until dispute settled</b> Well researched article and should not even be called 'conspiracy allegations', but 'espionage allegations'. A good title would be 'Harry Magdoff - Espionage Allegations'. I wouldn't call it a controversy until we have another side to the issue. It simply documents the allegations based on solid secondary research. In any case, the article is convoluted and off-topic as I see it with the main article and so it probably should not be <b>merged</b> with the main article unless consensus says otherwise. <a href="../../../c/y/f/User%7ECyferx_cbb6.html" title="User:Cyferx">Cyferx</a> 21:27, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Somehow I doubt this is going to be settled anytime before the next coming.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Set aside the issue of the slang in the title, the intro even says such romances are "ubiquitous" in pre-1950s movies... which makes the list nigh unmaintainable. Beyond that, there's the issue of "What positive contribution does this make to Wikipedia?" I believe the answer to that question is "none." <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 05:21, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> This type of list entry is of considerable value to screenwriters, aspiring screenwriters, critical theory students, film buffs, etc. The entry, however, could use some work, both in content and formatting. As far as "positive contributions to Wikipedia" -- Wiki is a <i>reference</i> tool. Wiki has at least 162 movie list entries, based on the category link in the article. How is this list entry less relevant than the other 161 film-list entries? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidHoag_23c6.html" title="User:DavidHoag">David Hoag</a> 05:32, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't believe any of the 162 film-list entries make a positive contribution. 162 <i>articles</i> that actually said something about 162 categorizations of movies would be a positive contribution. 162 lists, though, are just 162 wastes of server space. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 06:05, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I disagree. Lists like this are valuable to film professionals. Comparative archetypes are very valuable, but it can take a long time to create such lists. There are actually books of "movie lists" used by film writers; however, those books are quickly outdated. A list of romantic comedies, for example, is arguably of greater value than a list of Oscar-winners. The latter is simply a laundry list. Wiki has episode lists for many popular television shows. Are they worthless or valuable? Wiki has lists of first basemen. Shortstops. Name the position in sports and there's a Wiki list for them. Is that worthless or valuable. Just because something may not be of interest or value to <i>you</i> doesn't mean it's not of value to someone else. I could care less about seeing a list of forty famous shortstops; however, that doesn't render the list of no value. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidHoag_23c6.html" title="User:DavidHoag">David Hoag</a> 06:27, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: For my part, I can't believe the eagerness of my learned friend Kappa (two votes above) to look on the bright side of any article. Look, if we're going to have an article like this with a metaphorical title, the need for an immediate explanation of that title should ring alarm bells -- a metaphor should <i>help</i> explanation, no? But OK, let's not argue against the notion of a year-cycle metaphor (or complain of "hemispherism"), but instead examine how it's applied. <i>December</i>: this isn't the coldest month in the northern hemisphere, but it's the one with the winter solstice, and all the leaves have been shed by many trees. When I think of a May-December romance, I think of the pneumatic Anna Nicole Smith and her wizened nonagenarian (Image:Anna_Nicole_and_hubby.JPG). In movie terms, I'll stretch that a bit and count <i>Harold and Maude</i>. But <i>Roman Holiday</i>? I suggest that one important issue might be whether the age difference is one that raises eyebrows (or worse) within the fantasy world of the movie itself: by contrast, when we coolly consider Cary Grant's late films, his successes with the chicks may seem somewhat surprising, but within the films, they don't. Lists of the usual are impossibly big; this must list the unusual. So what's the unusual factor here: age differences that raise other characters' hackles within the movies, or age differences that improbably don't even raise eyebrows within the movies, or something else again? At this point, I'm inclined to vote "delete", but I'd be happy to see and vote to keep a carefully rethought list. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 10:25, July 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: First, it violates the naming convention, as we must use the most common name. Second, it is a list that cannot be maintained. Third, it is <i>inherently POV,</i> which kills lists dead. Why inherently POV? Well, if I date a woman 10 years my junior, and I'm 40, is that May-December? What if it's 20 years, and I'm 50? What if it's 20, and I'm 30? At what point is this a May-December relationship? The metaphor refers to death's-edge and youth's-bloom (i.e. <i><a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_and_Maude_ec2b.html" title="Harold and Maude">Harold and Maude</a></i>), and yet the list gleefully flops all over.

The home page shows... what would you say? A man in his seventies and a woman in her fifties? The slogan is (gack) "Years apart, coming together." Well, the Internet is always educational.

<li><b>Delete</b>, wikipedia is not toilet paper. And I thought from the title that a "May-December romance" meant a romance that lasted 8 months.

I'm in the UK, where Lego remains 'popular', and I'm unable to buy it according to the site.

It apparently can't be viewed anywhere (a newer cartoon is on the school's website), so this ends up being mostly just an ad for some kid's Geocities website. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 03:47, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Delete: <a href="../../../j/n/i/User%7EJni_807c.html" title="User:Jni">User:Jni</a> is right: it can be mentioned in the list of winners, after an article on the award exists. This article <i>for its own sake</i> is not needed, as the animation's low Google hit count shows that, at least at this point, it has not proven very influential, successful, or unusual.

<li><b>Delete</b> as the awards are not "a prestigious national competition". ATOM is an acronym for "Australian Teachers of Media", and usually less than 1000 people enter. The very grand sounding "Australian Centre for the Moving Image" also functions as a hothouse for experimental and contemporary art. Thus while ACMI <i>does</i> host some notable works, merely being given an award inside it does not make you notable. Considering the very high internet profile that works of this type have, the fact that it didn't "sweep the internet" is material. If and when these young men make some larger mark, this can go into their article under "First Steps". Until then (despite it being someone's pet project) it is not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 13:25, 28 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. That is very misleading. While it is organised by Australian Teachers of Media and has a strong focus on education, ATOM awards are also awarded to, and are prized by, the Australian independent media <a href="http://www.perthfilms.com/reviews.asp?iCategoryID=4&amp;iArticleID=55&amp;archived=TRUE" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.perthfilms.com/reviews.asp?iCategoryID=4&amp;iArticleID=55&amp;archived=TRUE" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.aimia.com.au/i-cms?page=758" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aimia.com.au/i-cms?page=758" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://www.7dimensions.com.au/awards.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.7dimensions.com.au/awards.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://www.filmartdoco.com/us.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.filmartdoco.com/us.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="http://www.gogroup.com.au/filmography.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gogroup.com.au/filmography.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. I am not sure what <i>"Australian Centre for the Moving Image" also functions as a hothouse for experimental and contemporary art</i> is supposed to mean, but perhaps it is an attempt to argue that experimental and contemporary art lack notability and by extension an organisation holding its awards ceremony here is in some way a lesser one for that. You say that it's significant that a work by two twelve-year olds didn't "sweep the internet." Were this the case then there would be no way of judging the excellence of the work of younger people, which cannot possibly compete against the work of more experienced, more capable adults. This is precisely the kind of problem that awards such as the ATOMs exist to remedy. The same panel that judges the general documentary categories also judges the K-8 categories. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 18:56, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Irritated Comment</b> Yes, misleading indeed. Misleading to juxtapose the location of the award (the "very prestigious affair at [ACMI]") with the prominence of the award itself. Misleading to provide a list of links that fails to demonstrate the prominence of the award. Misleading to spin a statement of fact into a slag of contemprary art in an attempt to discredit. I am very disappointed.<br />

<li>I'm totally mystified. I don't understand your response but you're clearly yupset. I apologise for this, it was inadvertent.
<ol>
<li>I do happen to believe that the prestige of an award-giving ceremony is good evidence of the prominence of the award--your opinion may differ on that but this doesn't mean people who do not share your opinion are intentionally misleading anyone.</li>
<li>I said I didn't know why you mentioned that ACMI promoted contemporary and experimental art, and I meant it. What is the relevance of this? I hazarded a guess and got it wrong and seem to have offended you--my apologies for this.</li>
<li>The list of links that I gave illustrate precisely what I said, no more and no less, that: "While it is organised by Australian Teachers of Media and has a strong focus on education, ATOM awards are also awarded to, and are prized by, the Australian independent media". --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 01:06, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Saying, "You're clearly upset" has the connotation that I am overly emotional or mentally disturbed. I have respect for "people who do not share [my] opinion". Please:
<ol>
<li>Demonstrate that the presentation was a <b>very prestigious</b> affair.</li>
<li>Demonstrate that this is a <b>prestigious</b> national competition.</li>

<p>I read a few years back that there were about 16,000 people with the name Moran. These would surely be unhappy to see that their name only means "moron" in wikipedia. The name is an english adaptation to several Irish names similar O'Moran, Morrigan, Mograine, and similar names. One family Moran was mentioned in Sherlock Holmes "The hound of Basqerville"). The family arms is a black background with three stars, and the motto is "Lucent in Tenebris", which might roughly translated to "A shining light in the darkness".</p>
<p><br />
I do not know if such a short description as above might be a suitable replacement. If yes, then replace it, if not, then please delete.</p>
<p>I just googled the word "Moran" and got about 5 million hits. The first page , at least, was from people with the name, starting with congressman Jim Moran.</p>

<p>I've been meaning to replace this page with a history of the Moran family surname.. I wasn't sure whether the "moron" misspelling was worth splitting into a seperate disambugation page with Moran_(Surname) and Moran_(intentional_misspelling) or something like that. I completely missed that 'famous' photo and the "sub-moronic" that followed. But in a short time, nobody will even remember it and that picture link is broken anyway. I vote we get rid of it entirely and create a surname page. But since my last name is Moran, I might be biased on it. &#160;:)</p>
<p>By the way, "Lucent in Tenebris" more accurately translates to "They shine in darkness".</p>

<p>Reply to User Bmicomp:</p>
<p>I created this page. I am impressed that you read it so quickly, but not with your analysis of the page, which is not fairminded. I would note that any attempt to write anything serious and complete about spam cannot help but also contain examples of it. To criticise the article solely on that basis (that it has spam in it), is quite simplistic and inconsequential.</p>
<p>So I disagree with your opinion about what the article is really about. The article is not about "burlap body boy" specifically , but about Humorous chain emails, as a distinct type of chain email. The main part of the page is a discussion of what exactly is a humourous chain email, and how it distinguishes itself from other types of chain emails. I will admit that the page is as yet incomplete, and perhaps not even very good. The discussion could go deeper, and contain other points common to such emails, perhaps with other example (which undoubtedly will spur more ire from certain users). It would be fair minded Criticize the page on THOSE MERITS.</p>
<p>Certainly many types of chain emails (humorous, fake charity scams, etc) can be categorized and described, and this endeavour is exactly what this very site is for. They are a part of the culture of the internet.</p>
<p>The Burlap body boy was used only as an example of this type of email because it illustrates (as described on the page) the salient characteristics of such emails. Which are that it is a humorous story, which asks to be forwarded, and part of its humour is derived from the attempts within the story itself to forward it. <b>I vote to Keep the page, and Improve it</b> -- CRF (page creator). 27 July, 2005 207.216.12.220 07:11, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete/Merge</b>. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chain_letters.html" title="Chain letters">Chain letters</a> are a valid topic, but it seems there's already an article about them. I suppose someone (CRF perhaps?) could attempt to merge the content in with that article, although quoting the entirety of the "burlap body boy" email is probably a bit much.

<p>It is apt to bring the Chain letters page into the discussion, for I had not known about it. However, after reading it, I am not yet inclined to think merging the Humorous Chain Email page into that page would be wise. This particular subject (humorous chain mail) is very well defined and contained as a subset of the chain letter, and as such, is best on a separate page, in my opinion. A link from the Chain letters page, to this new one, could even be considered.</p>
<p>The point that it is a 'bit much' to quote the entire story is valid I suppose. But the analysis on the page would suffer if the links were completely external. Also, any external links could not (will likely not) remain valid. Therefore, it made sense to me, in the absence of my knowing of a persistent, reliable copy of this story (and, perhaps, examples of its evolution) being available, that I would quote it in its entirety. One might argue that "Burlap Body Boy" could have a page on its own in the wiki, so as to have some reliable record of its existance, and so avoid the need to quote it extensively -- but I really don't think -that- is necessary. I cannot think of another wiki page where "burlap Body Boy" would be mentioned, let alone need to be quoted.</p>
<p>There seems to be, in the other two commenters, a small bias against any inclusion of what could be considered spam, almost as if it were an automatically conditioned response (for example, the good-humoured joke from the&#160;?moderator?, alan au, about again reading Burlap Boy in an email summary). This is not an unwise bias to have to be sure, but I hope I am not being rude by suggesting that it is necessary to temper it on some occasions. I truly mean no disrespect by creating this topic, on an admitedly disagreeable subject. CRF 207.216.12.220 07:45, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have now edited the page. I placed the body of the Burlap Body Boy Email on Wikisource, as suggested by Android79. This is useful, as this page is not meant as a discussion on solely that particular email, but a discussion upon the well defined characteristics of such emails as Burlap Body Boy.</p>
<p>I do disagree with CDC that there is nothing here that is not in chain email, and, as anyone can note by reading the page, its subject is beyond the simplistic "chain emails sometimes contain jokes" -- everyone can infer that. This is like saying language contains jokes, therefore, all discussions of jokes belong on the language wiki page. It is not wrong to say that jokes belong in the language category, but it would be very inconvenient to place jokes, and everything else to do with language, on language's wiki page. Thus we categorize jokes into its own page, and furthermore, we subdivide jokes into categories that have their own pages (etc). That is the purpose of an encyclopedia. I agree that at some point a subject will become trivial or so small that it doesn't warrant its own page (at least, at that time of consideration). But on this point of contention, I think this page deserves to stay separate, as opposed its being merged into existing pages, where the subteties (albeit, disagreable for some people to discuss) will likely be lost.</p>
<p>I disagree with user Scimitar's cryptic <i>not notable</i> designation. If that is supposed to be a comment upon the subject matter itself, I appreciate his opinion, but ask that he consider the possibility that others might find the subject (humorous chain emails) notable, well defined, and worthy of comment and discussion on their own. Scimitar should explain himself further, perhaps by directly criticizing on how I have written my definition, what is lacking in it, or why it is indistinguishable from some other entry in wikipedia, or ill-defined.</p>
<p>Of course, I claim it is not ill-defined, but I claim it is well defined. And I claim that is is distinguished from other wikipedia entries.</p>
<p>I have heard little in this discussion criticizing my article on those points, which are some valid points upon which to place criticism.</p>
<p>I note again, this type of email is part of our culture. It is a well defined category within chain emails: I've not yet read what I would consider to be a well-argued opinion to the contrary. I think it is best if it had its own page, so that the subject can be elaborated upon futher.</p>

<p>True, thank you for reminding me. I had come accross that page before. Incidentally, there are differences between that version on snopes and that one I originally posted. Which, I suppose, is an example of how such chain letters evolve. crf 207.216.12.220 20:28, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> This page refers to a group of videogamers who have an online association.

<li>I go to this school, and so did Nicole Kidman. There is a picture of her in our famous peoples' wall. As for 'completely non-notable', I would like to add that for a number of years we have come first in HSC results in the state for girl's schools and second in overall, just behind James Ruse. 20 July 2005. <i>(unsigned comment by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_220.237.108.74_56df.html" title="Special:Contributions/220.237.108.74">220.237.108.74</a>)</i></li>

<li>Just yesterday, there was a <i>majority</i> to delete a school article. Progress towards consensus may be slow, but it is not completely absent. There is no reason to pretend that we cannot continue to have the debate over time. After all, isn't that how WP works? School articles are only nominated occasionally, though there has been a bit of a spate just recently.-<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 00:58, 28 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>1. What school was deleted yesterday? 2. I don't consider an average of a school article VfD nomination per day as "occasional". 3. It is not only not useful to nominate verifiable, expandable schools for deletion, it is also harmful by unnecessarily <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7Ebite_fe9c.html" title="WP:bite">biting a great number of newbies</a>. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoubleBlue_f889.html" title="User:DoubleBlue"><font color="darkblue"><b>Double</b></font><font color="blue">Blue</font></a> (<a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoubleBlue_3ebb.html" title="User talk:DoubleBlue">Talk)</a> 03:22, 28 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>1.No, I could have put that more clearly: it wasn't deleted, but I thought there was a <i>majority</i> for deletion <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Sunshine_Coast_Grammar_School_7fdd.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Sunshine Coast Grammar School">here</a>. <b>In fact I miscounted</b>, it was 15d, 15k since Lucky6.9 sort-of voted twice by accident. That is still no consensus to keep, however, unlike some school VfDs. 2. Is it really that much? It might be that I just skip over them. But even so, that's less than 1% of the VfD load today. 3. I do not agree that nominating a page for deletion is necessarily biting the author, whether they are new or not. <i>"If you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly...do not submit it"</i> is right there on the screen as I type. Speedying it might be biting, but I would never condone that for schools. It <i>is</i> useful to continue the debate precisely because there is no consensus; no harm will be done if you expect the consensus to go your way. 3.1. Articles can be written on many things that are verifiable and expandable e.g. an article about the contents of my bedroom; but those attributes alone do not make their topic encyclopedic. Particularly not in the blanket no-consideration case that is made for keeping schools. I personally consider each article I vote on on its own merits and I thus voted to keep this one. Finally, there is no point getting annoyed about this process, as some participants do, since it is evident that schools <i>will</i> carry on getting nominated. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 04:29, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Actually I think there would be less consensus to deleting if some effort was being made to improve the non encyclopedic articles that are out there. Since that may not be happening, then editors who don't wish to have more low quality articles see a need to add them to a VfD. A side effect of this is to actually get articles that are nominated here improved. Those improvements are why you see so many keeps. If the articles were not improved you would likely see a consensus for delete. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 05:53, 28 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, there <i>does</i> seem to be a systematic and ongoing effort by school-inclusionists to brings school articles up to some reasonable standard. I'm not sure about this history of this specific school, but in general it is probably a good idea to list schools on <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGRider_Schoolwatch_74ee.html" title="User:GRider/Schoolwatch">Schoolwatch</a> for a while before nominating them for deletion, and I believe I'll add this to <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> if it is not there already. Articles do not automatically and magically "grow" and improve all by themselves, but they do grow if there is a support network of interested editors for a topic category. I think doing the work on this articles is more or less the obligation of those who <i>want</i> Wikipedia to include these articles. Two years ago I don't think this was happening, but now it looks as if it is. I'm also tempted to say that when a school substub is not showing signs of improvement the appropriate routine might be to delete it <i>but</i> make it a requested article. That is, treat low-quality school substubs as article requests. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:38, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>While it has only been three days since listing, I would have expected that if your comments were supported by actions then more work would have been done on the articles listed at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_9658.html#Collaboration_of_the_week" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools">Collaboration of the week</a>.

<li>Well, I'm not really in touch with the school-inclusionists. Perhaps one of them will opine as to where problem school articles are best listed. I think they are still monitoring <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGRider_Schoolwatch_74ee.html" title="User:GRider/Schoolwatch">Schoolwatch</a>, which was set up for the purpose of rescuing school articles from deletion.

<p><b>Keep</b> A triage tag is a specialized tool and deserves its own page. You don't put a pictures of a horseshoe types on the horse page&#160;:)</p>
<p>This is the first time I've been to a vote page. I don't like unsigned opinions. There was some duplication with the Triage page. I did not see a picture of a tag on the Triage page nor do I think there should be one there. I did see at link at the top from there to the triage tag page, which is good.

<p>The (half written) article claims to be about "the most decorated enlisted soldier from the state of Maryland [who] was also the personal driver of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and right hand man of Chiang Kai Shek." Somehow, someone with such a bizarre yet kindof noteworthy career trajectory fails the google test miserably with four hits, three of which are not relevant, one of which comes back to wikipedia. The content of the page, which was created July 23rd and shortly abandoned, was written entirely by anon users, possibly the same one, with the majority of content coming from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carlos_Mencia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19557934" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carlos_Mencia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19557934" rel="nofollow">vandal</a>, although the IP may be shared.

<p>This article has been tagged for speedy deletion a long time now, and I think that's because I am not the only administrator loathe to delete this as a vanity article not asserting notability.

<p>Just a pub. The article even describes it as a "no-frills" pub. Got mention in CAMRA's "Good Beer Guide", but so do many pubs (and, last I checked, Wikipedia is not CAMRA's "Good Beer Guide") I guess it appeared in some animated TV show, but obviously, being animated, it was not actually in the show.

<li><b>Keep</b> The pub is a landmark of the Plymouth waterfront. People all over the UK instantly recognise her paintings. The size of the pub should not be relevant in making the decision to delete the article. Also, the article is about the pub itself, not about the selection of beers it serves. I thought the goal of Wikipedia was to provide a reference about little known subjects as well as well known subjects. This article could potentially provide a resource to someone who has seen the painting and has wondered whether the establishment featured in the painting actually exists. How about having this article as a stub in preparation for the main article about Beryl Cook? <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigeonshouse_ab11.html" title="User:Pigeonshouse">Pigeonshouse</a> 18:13, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>We're voting on this pub, not her paintings. And I just looked at her paintings on her website and, man, those are ugly. More significantly I only saw one that indicated any connection with the Dolphin, and really it could have well been any pub. It doesn't even seem to me she painted the pub exactly, but she painted people who happened to be in the pub, in a somewhat generic background. The pub itself is incidental. Most paintings in the world are of real places (if not most than very many) and I'm not sure being painted by a somewhat recognized, marginally talented painter is grounds for including every such thing in an encyclopedia. This isn't exactly <a href="../../../g/i/v/Giverny.html" title="Giverny">Giverny</a>. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 18:41, 27 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well for a start, whether you think her paintings are "ugly" or not is rather irrelevant. And she has painted a lot more pictures than are on the website, including the one shown in the top right of the <a href="http://www.dolphinhotelplymouth.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.dolphinhotelplymouth.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">pub's website</a> - which is an accurate picture of the outside of the pub, and most certainly could not be "any pub". The same site has another picture of hers on the left hand side which features the landlord. I am not an expert on her paintings, but I am sure there are many others that are recognisably this particular pub. In addition, that website has reminded me that many of the <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tolpuddle_Martyrs_7cf7.html" title="Tolpuddle Martyrs">Tolpuddle Martyrs</a> were visitors - something which I think is notable <a href="../../../m/y/n/User%7EMyNameIsClare_ad7c.html" title="User:MyNameIsClare"><font color="#EE82EE">MyNameIsClare</font></a> <a href="../../../m/y/n/User_talk%7EMyNameIsClare_72b4.html" title="User talk:MyNameIsClare"><font color="#778899">talk</font></a> 11:20, 28 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm aware that my opinions of her work is irrelevent; I just really thought it bad enough that I felt I had to say something. However, these not exactly great connections to various other things seem somewhat lacking. It's not mentioned in the articles for <a href="../../../b/e/r/Beryl_Cook_6839.html" title="Beryl Cook">Beryl Cook</a> (though I have no doubts someone here will add it in the next hour or so), nor the <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tolpuddle_Martyrs_7cf7.html" title="Tolpuddle Martyrs">Tolpuddle Martyrs</a>, and there doesn't even seem to be a page yet for Bosom Pals. So these seem sort of tenuous connections to sometimes pretty minor things. I think the Bosom Pals connection might be the best reason to keep, but I'd like to see an article there before I consider that a compelling reason. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:56, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<pre>
cruft: /kruhft/ [very common; back-formation from crufty] 1. n.
An unpleasant substance. The dust that gathers under your bed is
cruft; the TMRC Dictionary correctly noted that attacking it with a
broom only produces more. 2. n. The results of shoddy construction.
3. vt. [from `hand cruft', pun on `hand craft'] To write assembler
code for something normally (and better) done by a compiler (see
hand-hacking). 4. n. Excess; superfluous junk; used esp. of
redundant or superseded code. 5. [University of Wisconsin] n. Cruft
is to hackers as gaggle is to geese; that is, at UW one properly
says "a cruft of hackers".

Since other fundamentalists hold this position, it is not a "new/novel interpretation". It is obviously not encyclopedic, however, as it cherrypicks material which supports a contention (persuasive), both within the Bible and within the scientific literature. This particular user, as it has been shown, has ignored the substantial proof that the OT was compiled at a much later date than he purports, and that it relied heavily upon well-established practices throughout antiquity, such as burying waste and avoiding blood. Not encyclopedia material, this would spread ignorance and confusion rather than enlighten. Only way to preserve this page is to present theories of the origin of information in the OT, and compare to synchronous information in the ancient near east, which would make this a huge page...untenable--skiddum12:19, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>re: re: alleged neologism</b>: volume of usage of a neologism does not preclude its being such. you must prove that, according to Wikipedia's definition, as a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a>, "Biblical scientific foreknowledge" is not, " word, term, or phrase which has been recently created ("coined") —often to apply to new concepts, or to reshape older terms in newer language form. Neologisms are especially useful in identifying inventions, new phenomena, or old ideas which have taken on a new cultural context. Neologisms are by definition "new," and as such are often directly attributable to a specific individual, publication, period or event. The term "neologism" was itself coined around 1800. It can also refer to an existing word or phrase which has been assigned a new meaning." I think this title definitively falls into "reshape older terms in newer language form..."; specifically, you have repeated a neologism created by, "...They are often created by combining existing words (see compound noun and adjective) or by giving words new and unique suffixes or prefixes. Those which are portmanteaus are shortened. Neologisms can also be created through abbreviation or acronym, by intentionally rhyming with existing words, or simply through playing with sounds."

<dd>"The Future Society of Anarchism" or equivalent title would result in the existing edit wars being played out as a series of normative statements. There's a difference between the normative statements of anarchism that "humanity requires no government to function effectively" and "social taboos would prevent murder." The example of banishment or shunning without trial for socially abstract "crimes" is one that I consider sufficiently like "government" (in its form of mob rule) to be anti-anarchistic, yet many anarchists consider "banishment" to be a sufficient legal system. Similarly, my strong feelings about the need to be confronted with specific charges, evidenced, and evaluated by the community before social sanction take place is considered "government" by others. "Law" is probably the best heading. By the way, "Anarchist economics" was colonised by par-econon supporters, who removed the prior content (mostly about the industrial commonwealth, the example I know best). I predict that even amongst workers-movement anarchists the same would happen to a "future society" article which covered econ, law, gender, family, society, etc. <a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFifelfoo_12d0.html" title="User:Fifelfoo">Fifelfoo</a> 04:17, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Not a neologism. It has been common for at least 35 years, and probably was used by Individualist Anarchists since 1870.

<p>This was marked for transwiki to Wiktionary, but I don't think it should be on either. It's a little fishy when there's an external link to a business website in the article.

<li><b>Comment</b> The GFDL insists that authors are credited. If you merge content, the only place the content has the original user attached to it is on the original page. If you delete this, the author is no longer credited. Thus, it is not allowed.

<li><b>Keep</b>, per above.

<li><b>Delete</b>, as it is pretty unlikely that this particular mistranslation will ever occur again. To the ears of a native english speaker, "Earl of Hai Hun" suggests "Hai Hun" is a geographic place. This is not so, therefor a cautious translator would avoid this formulation. "Hai Hun" (海昏) is a derisive nickname, so a clearer translation would be "Earl Hai Hun" (without the "of"), directly translating as "Earl Ocean Confusion". So if we want to keep as a redirect, I suggest <b>renaming</b> it to "Earl Hai Hun" or "Earl Ocean Confusion" (which gets right to the point).
