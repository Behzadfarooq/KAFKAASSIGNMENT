<li><b>Move</b>. After spending hours wikifying the Hindi section, I just see this <i>now</i>. Oh, the bitter irony! Now I won't feel guilty for not starting the Urdu or adding IPA tonight. Perhaps I'll cut and paste into the Wikitravel Hindi/Urdu phrase book? It was sparse and full of errors. So not all was a waste I suppose. I also don't get the copyvio issue. Languages are public domain, right? Unless some dacoit is copying verbatim, it isn't preposterous that the contributer is a native speaker or student, right? Anyway, I do see the point for deletion. If languages don't evolve, they die; such it is here. Though having many related languages and the same phrases together <i>is</i> fascinating to compare on a theoretical linguistics level.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article is not really that useful for tourists (anyone fancy a trip to Anglo-Saxon times?) but is of considerable interest from the linguistic point of view, in showing how a few common phrases are treated differently in different languages, and thus complements the various other articles of a linguistic nature. I would say this is eminently encyclopedic. If it gets too big it could be split up, perhaps by language family: constructed languages already have a separate article although Esperanto somehow appears in both! <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 17:34, 24 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I <b>strongly disagree</b>, being a linguist myself. The most important reason is that phrases and snatches like this are by far the least interesting from a cross-linguistic point of view. Look at the article: most listings are language-specific phrases lacking any grammatical embedding. Greetings for example are often fossilized scripts that are not comparable cross-linguistically — incidentally, this 'article' does not even succeed in spelling out any of those scripts (it only contains the English 'hello' and 'goodbye' and and their loose equivalents on other languages). Demonstrative phrases like 'that one' and 'this' are either not interesting to compare because they're not really phrases, or they are impossible to compare because of missing (sentential) context. Additionally, the very few full sentences that there are are not glossed and thus are still useless for a linguistic comparison on a morpheme-by-morpheme basis. — <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 19:51, 24 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>This sounds like an argument for improving the article and putting it on a more scientific basis, rather than deleting it! <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 20:40, 24 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Absolutely not. It is unsalvageable, starting with the title. My general point is precisely that <i>common phrases</i> are the least interesting data from a linguistic point of view. — <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 20:56, 24 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Mark, this page provides samples (however representative or unrepresentative they may be) of languages, often with IPA representation. That alone is of enough linguistic value to me, especially since many of the phrases are repeated again in different languages and so can be used for comparison. And if it were intended as a phrasebook, I doubt it would use IPA as most tourists won't know it and most American tourists won't be willing to learn it. --<a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" title="User:Node ue">Node</a> 21:11, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article is very useful (though probably in need of cleanup), not only for the interested reader, but also as a merge destination for various foreign-language phrases that occasionally get added to Wikipedia. This is also a good merge destination for "List of x phrases" for languages that may not be as notable or large as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Latin_phrases_e36e.html" title="List of Latin phrases">List of Latin phrases</a>. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 12:04, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Definitely Keep</b> It's been of great use to me; I refer to it from time to time. It serves as a comparison of other languages. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Sundita_7a61.html" title="User:Christopher Sundita">Chris</a> 02:08, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- this is exactly the sort of thing I used to enjoy browsing encyclopedias for as a kid. It's not harmful, it's factual, it's interesting, it's widely linked, it's still being actively edited and used. People are adding sounds to it! Moving this to Wikibooks would be a shame. — <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatherineMunro_0200.html" title="User:CatherineMunro">Catherine</a>\<sup><a href="../../../c/a/t/User_talk%7ECatherineMunro_06c5.html" title="User talk:CatherineMunro">talk</a></sup> 14:59, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
