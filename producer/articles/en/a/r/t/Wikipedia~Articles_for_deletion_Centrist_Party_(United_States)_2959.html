<li><b>Weak Keep</b> but cleanup citations. Guidelines for notability start with articles on the subject in multiple verifiable secondary sources, and this article links six different newspaper articles on the subject at the bottom. Okay, so they aren't the largest newspapers in America, but while one might quibble with the college newspapers (justifiably), the Eureka Reporter and OK City Journal Record are (as far as I know) genuine regional newspapers. No criticism of the nom though, while I'd say this article passes notability, it's doing so by the skin of it's teeth. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 13:21, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> it isn't that hard to get registered as a party. What it is hard to do is get on a ballot and earn votes. I say delete until the party actually gets on a ballot for something.

<li><b>Keep, tentatively</b>. The novelty of this party's appeal stems from the absence of a narrow-issue focus (e.g., Greens), extremist orientations (e.g., Libertarians), and stated alignment on specific wedge issues (such as abortion). This makes the party a very odd creature on the bipolar American political scene, where the Democrats and Republicans use wedge issues to squelch "wasted" voting on other parties in much the same way adults use distraction to quiet petulant toddlers screaming at their mothers. In the highly unlikely event the Centrist Party ever begins to amass a voter constituency, it will face a barrage of incumbent-party rhetoric (here on Wikipedia and elsewhere) aimed at nipping it in the bud, as a party of its type poses the only conceivable threat to the two-party system. In theory, a centrist party could gain the broad support required to impose democracy on the U.S. (i.e., a multiparty system with proportional voting as a minimum standard). Because of the likelihood of suspect motives underlying "delete" recommendations, Wikipedia should adopt a protective attitude for now. The article should remain for a couple of years until this new party has failed to thrive; it should then be considered for deletion if any surge in interest was historically insignificant.--87.49.44.157 01:29, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'll reply here. Based on newspaper coverage cited by others, the Centrist Party has arguably attained a minimum level of notability to warrant inclusion in Wikipedia. However, this notability is temporal in nature: if the party grows, its notability will, too, but if it fails to do so, the currency of interest in it will pass, and it will fade into obscurity, joining countless others. I haven't "predicted" its demise, only noted that it, like any fledgling political party, has only the slimmest chance of success.--87.52.109.121 14:34, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
