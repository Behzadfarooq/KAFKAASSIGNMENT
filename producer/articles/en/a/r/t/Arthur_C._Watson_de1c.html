<p>Watson returned to Natchitoches to establish a law practice with Judge Denis (pronounced də-NEESE) Joseph Hyams. Over time, the firm became known as Watson, Murchison, Crews &amp; Arthur. Watson quickly rose to prominence in local and state affairs. He was the director of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natchitoches_Parish_dd37.html" title="Natchitoches Parish">Natchitoches Parish</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chamber_of_Commerce_9b74.html" title="Chamber of Commerce">Chamber of Commerce</a> from 1936 – 1940.

<p>In 1936, Watson ran unsuccessfully for the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana_House_of_Representatives_cd4e.html" title="Louisiana House of Representatives">Louisiana House of Representatives</a> on an intraparty ticket opposing the <a href="../../../h/u/e/Huey_Long_16fe.html" title="Huey Long">Long</a> <a href="../../../f/a/c/Faction.html" title="Faction">faction</a>. Two incumbents, W. Peyton Cunningham and Leon Friedman, were renominated and reelected at large. There was no single-member representative for Natchitoches Parish until 1968.</p>
<p>However, Watson was elected to the legislature in 1940, when <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Jones_34be.html" title="Sam Jones">Sam Houston Jones</a> of <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Charles%2C_Louisiana_8679.html" title="Lake Charles, Louisiana">Lake Charles</a> defeated <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_Kemp_Long_c43f.html" title="Earl Kemp Long">Earl Kemp Long</a> for the governorship. Watson served in the state House until 1943. Though Natchitoches Parish is a neighbor to the Long stronghold of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winn_Parish_4822.html" title="Winn Parish">Winn Parish</a>, Watson was identified with anti-Long elements within the state's dominant Democratic Party.

He was vice-chairman from 1960 – 1964 and chairman for eight years beginning in 1968. He was a member of the Democratic National Committee in 1975. His chairmanship began when Louisiana rejected the Democratic presidential nominee, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vice_President_56ab.html" title="Vice President">Vice President</a> <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubert_Humphrey_c118.html" title="Hubert Humphrey">Hubert Humphrey</a>, a former student at <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana_State_University_92ca.html" title="Louisiana State University">Louisiana State University</a> in <a href="../../../b/a/t/Baton_Rouge_2a4c.html" title="Baton Rouge">Baton Rouge</a>.
