<p>The result was <b>procedural close, optional relist</b>. Seriously, no concensus had or was ever going to form out of this, given the different levels of development the articles are at. The closest thing to concensus I found in this debate after reading it a couple of times was that these artists would require separate AfD's if anything like concensus was to be formed to delete.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Actually, this may just show that you are maybe a bit too close to the topic to be objective (and yes, I know, can any of us be truly objective, blah, blah, blah). But, "my artists" is a bit of an odd statement. You are the original author of the articles, and I understand that you feel strongly about it, but someone has nominated them for deletion and I think there is a healthy debate going on, which is especially useful for media such as graffiti art, where traditional sources may not be applicable. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 16:52, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The debate is more than healthy. I apologize for writing the shorter "my artists" in the stead of "the articles which feature Melbourne graffiti artists which I have contributed significantly to". I see your point, and the debate may be especially useful for media such as graffiti art, I just wish it wouldn't involve the deletion of "the articles which feature Melbourne graffiti artists which I have contributed significantly to."

In the absence of citations it is unlikely the artist has demonstrated sufficient importance for inclusion on Wikipedia. How is that "Point Of View?" Are you saying that Wikipedia shouldn't have any criteria for who is considered notable and who is not considered notable? I think those standards are a necessary fact. If you are citing individuals with little or no recognition, then they likely are not sufficiently notable for inclusion on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 16:47, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The reason for deletion is: notability. Many of these artists are extremely notable. If you follow Street Art. All of these artists are notable if you live in Melbourne. Some of these artists are notable if you live in Australia. Few of these artists are notable if you live in New Zealand. None of these artists are notable if you live in Lisbon. It is very difficult to get web sources on graffiti artists who decline to reveal pictures or even their real names. <a href="../../../d/f/r/User%7EDfrg.msc_c6f9.html" title="User:Dfrg.msc">Dfrg.</a><a href="../../../d/f/r/User_talk%7EDfrg.msc_187f.html" title="User talk:Dfrg.msc">msc</a> 20:56, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

It is the responsibility of the editor of the article to supply sources. You say that the artists are notable if one follows Street Art. But the burden is not on the reader of the article to <i>be</i> someone who follows Street Art. That responsibility belongs to the editor who creates the article. In the absence of notability I think articles should be deleted. Do you feel street artists constitute a separate category of artists that deserve special consideration? Do you feel lower standards of notability should be applied to this group of artists?

<dd>The editor(s) have now supplied the sources.

<p>I am also nominating the following related pages because in each and every case, as far as I can see, there is nothing to substantiate the statement common to each that "'X' is a notable artist'".

<p>which substantiate the notability of the artists and shows work done by them as evidence to their notability.</p>
<p>I also believe that several books have been written on the subject. Here's one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title: Stencil graffiti capital&#160;: Melbourne / Jake Smallman and Carl Nyman. <a href="http://graphicdesignbasics.com/2006/stencil-graffiti-capital-melbourne.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://graphicdesignbasics.com/2006/stencil-graffiti-capital-melbourne.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></li>
<li>Author: Smallman, Jake.</li>
<li>New York&#160;: Mark Batty Publisher, 2005.</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0976224534</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The articles are covered and recognized by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Melbourne_547b.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Melbourne">Wikipedia:WikiProject Melbourne</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Australia_0645.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Australia">Wikipedia:WikiProject Australia</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Graffiti_a155.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Graffiti">Wikipedia:WikiProject Graffiti</a>.</p>
<p>If these articles are allowed for deletion, then <a href="../../../g/r/a/Category%7EGraffiti_stubs_2faa.html" title="Category:Graffiti stubs">these articles</a> would also merit deletion. So would <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banksy.html" title="Banksy">Banksy</a>. This cannot happen. It seems that you are allowing your personal interest to determine what and who is notable, to you. If you followed street art, these people are internationally known. The "fact" that they are no-notable local personalities is false. I don't even live in Melbourne, but I do follow street art, which is why they are notable enough to have an article on, in the same way that <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhani_Ram_Shandil_31a6.html" title="Dhani Ram Shandil">Dhani Ram Shandil</a> is not notable to me, as I don't follow Indian National Congress.</p>
<p>Please look at he effort I have, and continue to put into, articles like <a href="../../../h/a/-/Ha-Ha_%28street_artist%29_42c9.html" title="Ha-Ha (street artist)">Ha-Ha (street artist)</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/n/Rone.html" title="Rone">Rone</a>. Don't delete them, you'll find they are more notable and better quality than a huge amount of articles currently on Wikipedia. I should be improving them instead of defending them.</p>
<p>Read before you judge and please reconsider. <a href="../../../d/f/r/User%7EDfrg.msc_c6f9.html" title="User:Dfrg.msc">Dfrg.</a><a href="../../../d/f/r/User_talk%7EDfrg.msc_187f.html" title="User talk:Dfrg.msc">msc</a> 22:27, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>There is no comparison between Banksy and these artists. No-one is saying that a properly referenced article on an artist of repute is going to be deleted. The problem here - with all of the above - is that there are no sources whatsoever other than blogs and, ostensibly, one single reference book. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 11:15, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> into one article. I'm inclined to lean towards keep, simply because a precedent has been set for graffiti art (albeit not my personal favourite medium). However, the only legitimate reference is one published book in which all the above artists appear. That doesn't firmly establish notability as individuals, but as some sort of collective, or grouping, you could make a case. Could this be reworked as one article with a small section on each artist? Just a thought. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 22:54, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> too many to evaluate together, even if they are related. They appear to all come from the same book, but they should be evaluated individually. --<b><a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelket_adc6.html" title="User:Selket">Selket</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/l/User_talk%7ESelket_51a5.html" title="User talk:Selket">Talk</a></sup> 00:38, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep/Merge</b> There does seem to be a notable Melbourne graffiti scene. <a href="../../../r/o/n/Rone.html" title="Rone">Rone</a> seems to be the leading light, so deserves an article, <i>maybe</i> one or two of the others. An article Melbourne graffiti art should be started and most of the articles merged into it. The references need to be more specific, not just a book, but page numbers and exactly what is referenced on the particular page(s). As for the list of refs provided above, flickr and Youtube are not acceptable references. Besides which, it's not up to the nom to find references: they should already be in the article. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 01:06, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Grounds for a Speedy Keep are not 'there are too many to evaluate together'. Where are the sources? A few blogs and one unknown book? If that makes for a Keep - let alone a Speedy Keep - we are setting new and, to my mind, unacceptably low levels for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 11:15, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> – I don't know enough about this artist to say one way or the other about his or her notability. However, if any graffiti artist that gets a modicum of local fame is sufficiently notable for a Wikipedia article, then there should be articles on at least half the artists in the documentary <i><a href="../../../p/i/e/Piece_by_Piece_%28documentary%29_0a3a.html" title="Piece by Piece (documentary)">Piece by Piece</a></i> should have an article. In some of the articles I've contributed to on the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mission_School_1334.html" title="Mission School">Mission School</a> and related topics, I've avoided creating new articles on artists like Reminisce and Amaze because I didn't feel like they quite made the cut in terms of notability, at least, not any more than do any of several dozen local up-and-coming gallery artists. Some graffiti/street artists (like <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bansky.html" title="Bansky">Bansky</a> or <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shepard_Fairey_37a6.html" title="Shepard Fairey">Shepard Fairey</a>) clearly are notable enough to merit an article, of course, but there really should be clear guidelines as to what constitutes sufficient notability for inclusion for street artists. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 07:44, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>One more thing – if Civilian, Rone, Optic, etc are sufficinetly notable to have articles, than what about San Francisco graffiti legends Reminisce, Amaze, Dug, ORFN, Vegan, Ribbity, etc? (<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_McGee_f747.html" title="Barry McGee">Twist</a> already has an article, but his notability based on fame in the "fine art" world is clearly established.)

<dd>Well, apparently they're not notable enough.<u><b>Notability is POV.</b></u> Peter, I live in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a>, I like street art, so I have heard of these artists, so I developed articles on each of them. I've never heard of Reminisce, Amaze, Dug, ORFN, Vegan or Ribbity; but I would very much like to. You have, because you live in America, you like street art, and you can develop articles on them. Through Wikipedia, I can learn about your Street Artists, and you can learn about mine. If the consensus is not that most graffiti artists deserve not to have articles, I'll help you as much as I can to make them. <a href="../../../d/f/r/User%7EDfrg.msc_c6f9.html" title="User:Dfrg.msc">Dfrg.</a><a href="../../../d/f/r/User_talk%7EDfrg.msc_187f.html" title="User talk:Dfrg.msc">msc</a> 09:05, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Has Wikipedia really changed so much? Here, for example, is the full text of the article for "Meek (street artist)":- <i>Meek is a notable street artist operating out of Melbourne, Australia. Meek is twenty six years old, and started putting up street art at the start of 2003. Meek enjoys the irony of his name, in an area that is all about bragging and boasting. Meek lived in London for some time and was exposed to the work of Banksy. As well as stenciling prolifically Meek has also hijacked billboards, used wheat paste and stickers.</i> And here is the full text for the article for "Phibs (street artist)":- <i>Phibs is a notable street art operating out of Melbourne Australia.</i> Some of the others say just as little. And those which say more are saying just as little! Are these really Keeps? Are they even a Relist?? Is it too much work for an editor on AfD to look at these articles and decide that they are all saying nothing? As to the single reference book - which we have no access to - is that really all that suffices these days in order to warrant an article? Times certainly have-a-changed on here.... <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 10:58, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep some. Delete some.</b> The original author has asserted twice in this AfD that notability is POV. While in life, I tend to agree, there are some guidelines in place to prevent editor POV from prevailing. See <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE#Notability is not subjective</a>. Of course, there's the basic def of notability: "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and of each other." So notability is POV, but the POV of people writing for sources outside of Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In the end, I think these need to be treated individually and not deleted or kept wholesale. The ones that are more developed and demonstrate references from multiple verifiable sources (<a href="../../../r/o/n/Rone.html" title="Rone">Rone</a>, for example) are worth stronger consideration than the ones that only reference this one book. The originally-nominated article is probably a delete, unless additional references can be directly incorporated into the article. I think an article on this scene as a whole might be worthwhile, but not necessarily at the expense of some of the more notable individuals with the scene. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlanetneutral_0d3a.html" title="User:Planetneutral">Planetneutral</a> 14:32, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep/merge</b> Per Tyrenius &amp; Freshacconci above. One article on Melbourne street art would I think be clearly justified for notability. Individually, even Rone is a bit marginal. Whatever Star Trek &amp; the Australian cricket team do, treating minor artists as "schools" is a traditional way of handling them, of which there are many examples in WP (and there could usefully be more).

<li><b>Keep All and nominate to Delete some individually at a later time</b> There is no sensible way to deal with a multiple listing of pages like this. Clearly, the Rone and Ha-Ha pages, for example, are currently much better than some of the other pages and should not be considered for deletion. The fact that some of these artists have formed an artist's collective, Everfresh Studios, in Melbourne is notable and encyclopedic. Also, some of these artists could be contacted for photos, surely, and visuals would make these articles better. An example of art found at Everfresh Studios can be found here: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/--meggs--/" class="external text" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/--meggs--/" rel="nofollow">Meggs photos</a>.

<li>I like the sound of these comments. There's something worthwhile here. It just needs the right form for it. There's no reason why a deleted article would be "salted". That usually only happens in cases of abusive recreation, e.g. with same content after AfD, as opposed to new super-improved content, which can make recreation acceptable if it successfully addresses AfD objections. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 05:37, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can't understand why the articles would be deleted only to have them re-instated later. The article would be deleted just for the sake of being deleted, then re-instated.

<li>Actually the notability hasnt been established across the board. My recommendation was to give you more time to establish it. The reason why some should be deleted is that you can only work on a few articles at a time, and some of these articles arnt worth keeping in there current form. For example, Vexta only says "<b>Vexta</b> is a notable <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_artist.html" title="Street artist">street art</a> operating out of <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>". Thats it; the rest of the text in the article is merely dressing. Hardly worth keeping. Compare it to another article that is being considered for deletion: <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magdalena_Trzebiatowska_3b23.html" title="Magdalena Trzebiatowska">Magdalena Trzebiatowska</a>.

<dd>That's the ideology. It's laid out pretty clearly. No one who edits here gets to decide notability any more than you do. The decision is based on whether reliable outside sources think the subject is worthy of attention and demonstrate it through publication (and whether there is a consensus that this is the case). From the available evidence, I'd say that some of these entries qualify and some don't.</dd>

Some of them, however, do have the right stuff. Sure, it's possible that there will be stronger evidence of notability for the other artists in the future, but there might be more evidence of my notability later too. Doesn't mean I warrant an entry now. I'm pretty sure there are hundreds of articles that would disappear after a deletion proposal, but it's a matter of insufficient time and attention.</dd>

<li>Culverin, it great to hear you are keen for these articles to be kept. A lot of the comments on this discussion indicate that you are not alone. This deletion process will last about five days from when it was started, and you are more than welcome to help improve the articles during this time. For my own part, I would prefer that we concentrate on the best five of them. Five good articles is better than eleven stubs. If you look at the history of the five I have recommended to be kept, you will see that I have edited them all; <a href="../../../r/f/w/User%7ERfwoolf_6c5c.html" title="User:Rfwoolf">User:Rfwoolf</a> also has, and a new user User:Urbanistika also has started helping on <a href="../../../r/o/n/Rone.html" title="Rone">Rone</a>. If you know anything at all about these artists, share what you know by adding a comment on the talk page of the article. Each article needs to have at least two pieces of supporting evidence from [[WP:RS|"reliable sources"]. Due to the nature of this art work, I think it would be really helpful to have more photographs of the artwork. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 14:10, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hi John, I've added quite a few reference links with numerous photos of works exhibited in galleries or at shows, and a link to an award winning documentary in which several of these artists were featured...I'm not sure I agree that only the five best should be kept. 'Phibs,' for example, is now referenced well enough to develop the article further.

<li><b>Keep All, <i>but</i> nominate to Delete some individually at a later time</b>, per Greatwalk. I think the notability of each artist needs to be assessed on its own merits – I do not support either blanket inclusion or blanket deletion. I also don't agree that "notability is POV". Wikipedia has clear standards about <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">notability</a>, namely multiple non-trivial mentions in published sources. Some graffiti artists rise to that level of notability, but many don't.<br />
<br />
I do like the idea of an article like Street art in Melbourne, or some variation on that (using "street art" in the title would make it more inclusive than "graffiti"). Such an article could probably be quite easily assembled from multiple non-trivial sources, even if individual artists may not rise to that level of notability. If that kind of article is a good idea, in the future, I'd certainly like to contribute a Street art in San Francisco article (for which I can find many published sources for). <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 07:05, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't know much about the notability of these artists, and none of the articles (except for the one on Rone) tell me very much about what makes that artist notable. Its probably the case that not every single artist listed above is notable in the sense of having been published in multiple non-trivial sources. The ones that aren't shouldn't have their own article, even though they should merit mention in a Street art of Mebourne article. Rone sounds notable, but there's very little in the other articles which speaks to the notability of those artists. Prime example, "Optic is a notable street artist operating out of Melbourne Australia." Well, why is he "notable"? Just because he has a page in the Stencil Graffiti book? Does that mean every single artist in Graffiti World and Graffiti Women gets a Wikipedia page? That's an awfully low standard of notability. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 21:58, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> I would call it "Stencil art in Melbourne," or "Stencil art movement in Melbourne." But that second name really should have a citation referring to it as a "movement." I don't know if that already exists. I would not call it "Street art" or "Graffiti art." Neither "street" or "graffiti" is as specifically related to visual art as is stencil printing. I don't think any of the artists are notable enough to have articles devoted to them. None of them have received sufficient critical note. If one or more of them goes on to receive multiple non-trivial published citations then by all means I think separate articles should be devoted to them. Another possible name would be "Stencil art movement in Australia," since there seems also to be a Sydney stencil art movement. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 00:26, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> -- Very little can be said about any artist. Notability is all that matters. Or, if you want to see what matters, look at the piece. Or, look at reproductions of the pieces. You can't write an article if a prior article or articles do not exist. That is: multiple, non trivial published material from reliable sources. That is why Wikipedia is an encyclopedia.

<li>Graphics would make better articles, but I agree in part. An artist is 'made' by review: public exhibitions, becoming the subject of documentaries, interviews, being members of known artists' collectives, becoming curators, judges and reviewers, etc. A surprising number of the artists the primary editor has selected have, and are, these. A quick search on Google shows as much in several cases. --<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreatwalk_4ed3.html" title="User:Greatwalk">Greatwalk</a> 07:10, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

My point was: Most of these artist have been exhibited, have been the subject of a documentary or have taken part in public exhibitions, have been interviewed by reliable sources...some are curators themselves, some have organised exhibitions and artists' collectives. As it turns out, Melbourne is recognised for its street art, and the National Gallery is currently collecting pieces. I found all of this out in the last 24 hours, in bits and pieces when I had the time, as the result of this AfD debate...so I think we're not really asking Wiki to drop its standards to allow these articles.

<dd>Bus stop, you appear (to me) to be stating some different policy for 'notability' than I believe Wiki gives. Several of these artists are featured as artists in numerous, non-trivial sources: (the documentary and the feature in a book about street art in Melbourne is sufficient to show notability by Wiki standards, but several artists also are referenced as exhibited artists in their own right at festivals and galleries). I think a page on graffiti in Melbourne would make a great article too, but whether one exists or not can not be used as grounds for deletion of these articles, surely: they were made in good faith, and either meet or can clearly be improved to meet Wiki standards.

Obviously I am not holding these artists to higher Wikipedia standards than other artists. It is normal Wikipedia minimal standards of notability that are not attained. The closest any of the artists come to notability is being mentioned in passing while describing the stencil art scene in general in Melbourne. That constitutes "trivial" coverage, in my opinion. To none of these artists is actually devoted anything approaching individual coverage. I don't think the mention of the names and a few tidbits about them in an article covering stencil art in Melbourne qualifies each one for a separate free standing article. I do not see in the references even one of these artists actually receiving non trivial coverage. I've suggested the Melbourne stencil art article only because that seems an appropriate setting at this time for what little needs to be said about these individual artists. That is not to degrade them. But the published material out there simply barely does more than mention them, and only as part of a group.

Smallman/Nyman provide a photo of the pages dedicated to 'Psalm' for instance: book is a collection of individual artist profiles, including the eleven artists the primary editor chose to make articles about and the documentary site clearly lists names of the 'featured artists.' Some of the articles are better referenced again.: I don't know why all haven't been improved yet: perhaps they will be after the AfD closes.

I have downloaded that PDF for the program, and indeed I see an individual spray painting what looks like "610." So what? By means of this I am to accept that a name not even associated with the number "610" except by the assertion of that in the article, is notable for inclusion on Wikipedia? I don't see that as notability. "Six ten" may be a very clever alternative to "610," but does that add to notability? <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 16:15, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Added references to <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civilian_%28street_artist%29.html" title="Civilian (street artist)">Civilian (street artist)</a> and believe this article can be further improved. There are numerous articles under consideration in this AfD...not all are in the same shape as the 'Civilian' page was/still is. Some being considered for deletion are much better.

<li><b>Note</b> Due to the fact that so much has changed on these articles, and more than two sources exist on each of the articles except Optic (street artist), I believe they should all be kept and individually renominated in a month or so if someone thinks that the articles arnt up to scratch at that time. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 07:02, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
