<li>The fact that the subject's notability is probably borderline does not change the fact that the nomination was made in bad faith.

<li><b>Reply</b> How can you read the nominator's mind to determine her motivation? Even you say that the subject's notability is probably borderline, so how is that a bad faith nomination? That seems exactly the type of article that should go to afd. Further, the article's history indicates that the original author, <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERosencomet_1f6e.html" title="User talk:Rosencomet">Rosencomet</a>, made just one intial entry and has not touched it since. Yet 14 of the 16 subsequent content-related entries (I'm including changing the article's name here) have been made by you, <a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> (<a href="../../../9/9/9/User_talk%7E999.html" title="User talk:999">Talk</a>), on a subject of borderline notability at best.

<li>The fact that the subject's notability is probably borderline makes me wonder how you could possibly have a basis to question the good faith of the nomination. If you have an issue about the nominator's good faith, start an RFC.

<dd><b>Reply</b> <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoffspear_16b0.html" title="User:Geoffspear">Geoffrey Spear</a>, you misunderstand. Wikipedia policy is that every article must pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, the goal of which is verifiabilty not truth. The fact you can see the book with your eyes (or whatever you mean by "looking") is not the same a verifing its existance through citing reliable unbiased third party sources. Seeing the book as a means of verification is OR and is unacceptable per <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.

<dd><b>Reply</b> Actually, for the first book cited in the article, I take the fact that librarians at 10 OCLC-affiliated libraries (Including the Library of Congress and New York Public Library) claim to own a copy of the book as verification. Granted, the second does seem to have been published by a vanity press. I've never personally seen a copy of either book to verify their existence through original research. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoffspear_16b0.html" title="User:Geoffspear">Geoffrey Spear</a> 14:04, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply</b> - Then you are missing the point of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> which is a non negotiable requirement for all articles.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I've read his work and googled NLP, his name turned up almost as often as Richard Bandler's. Phil's work is very interesting and important on different levels. He takes into account the esoteric, but also says it can be dismissed for purposes of trying out his work without those particular mental conditionings. He writes for both the lay man and the scientific commnunity. Its not easy to explain NLP to people, but I always recommend looking up Phil's work when people ask me what NLP is about. beatrix216.194.56.15 16:20, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Phill has been active in publishing on the subject of NLP and Magick for over 10 years now. He was an Early adopter of the web as a form of online publication with the webzine Paradign Shift in the early 90's. He also has participated as a speeker at several national conferences on Hypnosis and NLP. His books are real and only his early works were published by a small press out of chicago called eschaton books. They still have a web site <a href="http://www.eschatonbooks.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.eschatonbooks.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eschatonbooks.com/</a>, though I think they may not be doing much these days. His works have been endorsed by the Likes of Robert Anton Willson and Genesis P.

<li><b>Comment</b> If his notability in NLP even vaguely approaches Bandler's, there is nothing in the article to bear that out. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 22:24, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Of course he's notable. Just because it can't be proved is no reason to vote against him. Besides the article doesn't say anything anyway. You say he is not notable just because the references in the article are stupid.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't think there's any reason to question it anymore, now that his listing has been beefed up. I'm sure more data will be added as time goes on, too. He has several DVDs out on Magical, Psychological and Entheogenic topics, and has appeared far more widely than has been expressed here so far. I believe he may have more writings than listed here as well. If not, he will in the near future. I think he's a keeper.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Farber is an interesting figure in the Aquarian movement; the combination of NLP and magickal techniques alone is significant. I note that today's "Featured Article" on the Wikipedia Homepage is about "Illuminatus Triology" - and given Farber's association with Robert Anton Wilson this alone would indicate he's Wikipedia-worthy.</li>
