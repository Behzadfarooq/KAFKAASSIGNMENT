<li>I disagree. The content in those articles establishes some (minor) level of noteability. There is nothing comparable in this article. If someone can expand this article, then I would be happy to change my vote or withdraw the nomination. But the onus for establishing the noteability of a subject should be on the creator of the article, not the general Wikipedia community. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 00:04, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I recognize that the article is poorly written and this particular neighborhood may be less notable than others but I think there may perhaps be a need to have a consistent policy before we go down this slippery slope. Is there a policy? This is a good faith question. I just don't see the notablity difference with many other similar articles. Note that I have not voted. It seems that Cities are notable regardless of size or location, as long as they are incorporated. Even unicorporated cities are included. Secondary schools are notable no matter what. There are thousands of neighborhood articles. This one happens to be poorly written and about <i>four days old</i>.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 23:58, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you find a policy, please point it out to us! I'll be happy to withdraw this nomination or vote to keep it if there is policy or significant precedent. It's just difficult to establish noteabiliy for such a brief, poorly written, and completely unreferenced article. There is nothing in the article even establishing the existence of such a place. I think it's perfectly reasonable to require the creator of a new article to provide some evidence of the subject's existence and noteability. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 00:22, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> "Local Prominence"??? You mean that they are cute and have nice fancy stores where you can buy nice things or get a gourment meal? Point Richmond has like 20 stores/resturants total and it is surrounded by an oil refinery.

<li><b>merge</b> The neighborhood is not notable, I live in Richmond. A carpet store? its some mom and pop store. It should be merged into the Richmond article. Poeple throughout the bay area know of Hilltop and Point Richmond and Rockridge. Pt. Richmond? Its so nice there. Hilltop, theres that Mall there right?. Rockridge. It that by the Rockruidge Bart station? pullman is more of a neioghborhood name for the hood which people out of that area dont even know. i live 20 blocks from "<i>Pullman</i>" and had never heard of it. Allthough within the bureorcracy i do know that the city does delimit it on the garbage/reclycling pickup list and dates. but my hood has a name too, which only appears on that list and non one would know where i was talkign about if i told em. i do request people check out the article once more since it has changed since it was put up for deletion. i also think its a little bit aggressive to put up articles for deletion sop quickly, even the richmond article was a poorly qritten one sentance thingy at first. <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Richmond%2C_California_6b74.html" title="North Richmond, California">North Richmond, California</a> is a good example of this compare earliest to most recnt, night and day. and that comment about people dont know about neighborhoods in Richmond. well youre sheltered and maybe a little gentrified agrregious and ignorant. im guessing all you know about richmond is enviornmenttal catatrophes and drive by shootings and are ignorant to the fact of 2 country clubs malls department stores casinos national monuments milllion dollar mcmansions state of the art bus system and upscale cookie cutter homes bike trails ranches horticultural centers shipbuilding port funtions wildlife anbd diversity and yes even pullman. and cmon dude i know youve heard of Poitn Richmond and Hilltop<a href="../../../q/r/c/User%7EQrc2006_905d.html" title="User:Qrc2006">Qrc2006</a> 23:45, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Again I am really not concerned about this neighborhood. I just don't see that since Rockridge has "upscale" shops that it is more notable than Pullman. I clearly think that there is a bias that will creep in here. Rockridge is nothing but an old suburb that is now urban. It has fancy resturants, expensive fancy resturants. I totally agree with voting on these things but I really see a very negative bias being created here where, those places near and dear to wealthy people like Rockridege and Point Richmond, those places that are cute, are called notable. Personally I would think that a neighborhood (with some sort of official existance) in a major city would always be notable as a geographical location.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 16:40, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
