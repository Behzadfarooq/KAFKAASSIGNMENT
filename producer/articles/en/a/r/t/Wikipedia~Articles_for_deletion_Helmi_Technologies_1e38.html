<p>Article was speedily deleted as a non-notable company article, then as a recreation of deleted material. The original author believes that the article is notable enough for inclusion, so I am putting this up on Afd. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETangotango_2487.html" title="User:Tangotango">Tangot</a><font color="green">a</font><a href="../../../t/a/n/User_talk%7ETangotango_e3e5.html" title="User talk:Tangotango">ngo</a> 10:28, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Initial comment from author</b> I feel that the article meets the notability criterias. The company has been around since 2004, there has been several printed and non printed articles in independetn and well established, respected news sources, magazines etc. about the company including some full page articles during the last few years (both due pressreleases and due personal interviews of the company officials) both in US and Finland. Additionally Helmi as a company is referede by several independent analysts, including <a href="http://www.rfgonline.com" class="external text" title="http://www.rfgonline.com" rel="nofollow">Rober Francis Group</a>, <a href="http://www.the451group.com" class="external text" title="http://www.the451group.com" rel="nofollow">451 Group</a> among others, in their analysts reports. Obiously most of the information, in terms of source, in the article is from the company itself, but atleast the article tries to be objective there. <a href="../../../j/r/i/User%7EJrisku_a99e.html" title="User:Jrisku">Jrisku</a> 10:49, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Please provide references for the published material in indepdendent, respected publications. This will clearly resolve the notability question in favour of the article. Add the references to the article rather than here. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich257_a349.html" title="User:Rich257">Rich257</a> 10:53, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In Finland there has been several printed articles about Helmi Technologies, for instance one of the most respected economic magazines of finland "Talouselämä" had an interview of three entepreneurs from Oulu, Helmi had coverage of over one full color page. "Talouselämä" is such news paper, that frequently intervies for instance CEO's of companies like <a href="../../../n/o/k/Nokia.html" title="Nokia">Nokia</a>. There has also been several other printed articles, not related to press releases, for instance in news paper called "Kaleva" (published in Oulu, Finland, about 200 000 readers). I don't know all the US and English language sources, but I know that there has been articles also in English printed press. Helmi has also been several times, among press and other sources, refered as one of the most promising startups in Oulu, Finland (which is one of the most important software hubs in Finland). I would also say, that since helmi is mentioned in several US analyst reports (definately an independent source), it also makes the case rather strong. Personally, I feel that informative and objective content about some company shouldn't constitute article to be deleted. In that way only big companies end up in to wikipedia, which is shame. Additionally I would like to make a note that there are allready few editors who has edited the article and outsiders from Helmi's stand point. Please also note that the link to the 451 group "protected" content is a full report only focused on Helmi, it goes trough in detailled manner Helmi's product and it's strenghts and weaknesses. Helmi doesn't have any client relationship to the 451 group. I added few references to the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helmi_Technologies_ef49.html" title="Helmi Technologies">article page</a>. <a href="../../../j/r/i/User%7EJrisku_a99e.html" title="User:Jrisku">Jrisku</a> 18:06, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../j/r/i/User%7EJrisku_a99e.html" title="User:Jrisku">Jrisku</a> appears to be the CEO of the company based on his user page, while that isnt a problem it should be noted in relation to this AfD. A quick google search returns 253,000 pages thats a reasonible quantity of hits and lends itself towards notibility. From within wikipedia the article has no links to it from other articles which I would like to know/see how it can contribute to the overall project by supporting other articles. I would also like to hear <a href="../../../j/r/i/User%7EJrisku_a99e.html" title="User:Jrisku">Jrisku</a> opinion of the article in relation to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> especially the section on soapbox. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> 11:01, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Above note is correct, just thought, that for credibility shake (so that there will be no "hidden agendas" discussion"), I should place my background on user page as well so that everybody know that I'm part of the source (original page was entered by some one else, propably by some one of our US employees). I feel that there could be links from other articles to this one, and I'm quite sure that there will bee soon enough. The thing though is that article is so new, that there hasn't been too much time for links to appear. We're putting significant resources in to use of Open Source community. Obiously, Helmi is a small company compared to IBM and ohter large contributors, but compared the overall resources of Helmi it's very significant, there are 6-8 full time employees involved in to Open Source development all the time (and it's going to grow significantly).<a href="../../../j/r/i/User%7EJrisku_a99e.html" title="User:Jrisku">Jrisku</a> 11:32, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> What comes to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> section on soapbox, I feel that current article tries to be objective. There is facts like locations, employees, history etc. about the company, objective information about state of the product as well as references to some independent sources (there has been hundreds of mentionings about the company in press). The primary reason for the article is not advertizing, but provide company information in relation to open source community. In case you feel that it should be changed some way in regards to quidelines descriped in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, the article should be changed such a way. <a href="../../../j/r/i/User%7EJrisku_a99e.html" title="User:Jrisku">Jrisku</a> 11:49, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> it appears to be a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_faith.html" title="Good faith">good faith</a> contribution while the article may have a mild appearance of advertising I think <a href="../../../j/r/i/User%7EJrisku_a99e.html" title="User:Jrisku">User:Jrisku</a> as a new contributor is genuine in intentions, willing to comply with Wikipedia policies.
