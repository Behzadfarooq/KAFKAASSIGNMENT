<li><b>Keep</b> This is a must,this is a game long time in the making and very revolutionary as homebrew 2d fighting games go. theres tons of fans who download and enjoy making games with the original engine (BOR) and its cousins (OpenBOR, BORHed, OpenHOR), it will be no diferent with this game,people will love it and it be a mistake to remove it from here.

<dd>It "will"? I think you mean it "might". You have no evidence to support your claim: past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The game might never even be finished.

<dd><b>Comment</b> There is a video available at the homepage showcasing the features of the game, and Age of the Beast: Special Edition was demoed briefly at the Midwest Gaming Classic on June 3, 2006. This makes the game just as notable for wikipedia inclusion as any unreleased video game that was demoed at the E3 gaming convention (and there's an abundance of those in wikipedia). - <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetaFox_390e.html" title="User:MetaFox">MetaFox</a> 13:12, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Despite of what the 'Warning' says: Of course I came here because a friend told me that the Wikipedia entry of Age of the Beast might be deleted. And why shouldn't I make my voice heard&#160;?</p>
<p>Some Facts: There is something like a release date set: Though annouced for 2006, a release in 2007 is very likely going to happen. One got to consider it's a game by semi-professional independent programmers, not a big budget major company. There will be a commercial release for SEGA Dreamcast. It's announced as a Special Edition that will peacefully coexist next to the freeware download - but still with a pressed run of estimated 7000+ units.</p>
<p>As others already pointed out, there is a video available showcasing the game in action: <a href="http://www.senileteam.com/downloads.php?d=12" class="external free" title="http://www.senileteam.com/downloads.php?d=12" rel="nofollow">http://www.senileteam.com/downloads.php?d=12</a></p>
<p>Obviously the game is using all original graphics, sounds and music along with an extremely customizable and powerful 2D game engine. To really achieve commercial quality takes a good bit of time for a small group of people, working on the game in their spare time.</p>
<p>It's predecessor Beats of Rage was ported to an insane number of platforms (there even is an AMIGA and Nintendo DS port), and the SEGA Dreamcast version was downloaded several tenthousand times - alone from the website I am involved in (<a href="http://www.DCEvolution.net" class="external free" title="http://www.DCEvolution.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.DCEvolution.net</a>).</p>
<p>Three years after its initial release, Beats of Rage still sees updates (OpenBoR, Linux &amp; PSP port), and there still are several promising projects in the works based on the Beats of Rage game engine:</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> It's an engine evolution and spiritual sequel of a game that has had millions of downloads. The video preview has been downloaded thousands of times, and the commercial special edition was previewed at one of the largest classic gaming conventions around as I mentioned above. Senile Team has a huge and loyal fan following, and has been covered in print magazines ranging from Pure to Retrogamer. I don't see how anyone can say it's not notable. - <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetaFox_390e.html" title="User:MetaFox">MetaFox</a> 23:27, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Just because a game is not mainstream, doesn't make the fanbase restricted. Age of the Beast is one of the most anticipated games in the retro gaming community, and the retro gaming community makes up a large portion of the regular gaming community. The game was listed in the popular UK print magazine Retrogamer in issue number 8 as being one of the most anticipated upcoming games for the Sega Dreamcast. This article should have been tagged for notability instead of being tagged for deletion, because with a small bit of article expansion, acceptable references can be made that will show that the game is notable for inclusion on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetaFox_390e.html" title="User:MetaFox">MetaFox</a> 19:51, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
