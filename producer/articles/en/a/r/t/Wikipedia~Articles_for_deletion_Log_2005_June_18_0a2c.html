<p><b>Delete</b>. Probable vanity.

<li><b>Speedy delete</b>. This is a very short article with almost no context, so is a candidate for speedying, article 1. Even if does not seem to be a test.-<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 01:16, Jun 18, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I disagree. Compared to the example given at <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>, "He is a funny man that has created Factory and the Hacienda. And, by the way, his wife is great", this has plenty of context. We know at a basic level who this person is; just not why she warrants an encyclopedia article. Perhaps this criterion needs to be clarified? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>Ð¸<small>D</small>Ñ<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 01:23, Jun 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>We know she's in Exeter. That's it. Criterion is not "no context", but "little or no context", and this is certainly little. The criterion does need clarifying, though. Specifically, to allow speedy delete of blatant vanity as an expansion to <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_nonsense.html" title="Patent nonsense">patent nonsense</a>.

<li>Delete: This is a speedy candidate, IMO. I'm one of those who disagrees with making vanity articles CSD candidates, but I agree that this falls under criterion #1. "He is a funny man" = "She is the daughter of"; "has a factory" = "She goes to college"; "his wife is great" = "she is studying X &amp; Y." The trick is that this is a vanity article that's also an article with no content. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:45, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment. It has now been blanked by the original author, and re-marked as a speedy candidate on those grounds. However, Critera #A7 reads "Any page which is requested for deletion by the original author, provided the author reasonably explains that it was created by mistake, and the page was edited only by its author." Even if you stretch-interpret the blanking to "mean" "requested for deletion" AND ignore the 'tagging' edits by other Wikipedians, it still fails the "provided the author reasonably explains that it was created by mistake" test, making it <b>not, <i>technically</i>, a speedy candidate</b>, although many admins will delete articles in this case regardless. Thus, I still maintain that the speedy criteria still needs considerable expansion just to reflect <i>common practice</i> even before it can be expanded to provide any relief from the 100+ (and growing) articles/day posted on VfD. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 16:18, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I would like to be very clear in saying that I <b>fully agree that SD needs expansion.</b> I always have agreed with that. VfD is more insane than ever -- over 100 articles a day -- so there is no question. I just think that "vanity" shouldn't be a criterion. We'd need to attack the obvious vanity article by another criterion than just its appearance of being about the author. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:18, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I speedied it on the grounds that the author might have thought it was acceptable to create an article on herself, then saw it listed here and realised it should never have been created, thus making it speedyable under the "blanked mistake" criterion. I agree with you that this is not clear-cut and policy needs to be updated to reflect common practice, but this would certainly have been deleted anyway. â <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">Talk</a>) 18:18, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But: <i>Original research is research that produces [...] secondary sources. [...] Secondary sources present a generalization, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, or evaluation of information or data.</i> which this clearly does.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Mostly it's a brief canter through existing sources, so encyclopedic. Where he introduces his own ideas these should be deleted as Original Research, but that's not a reason to delete the entire article, which is of great encyclopedic value. There was a historical figure called Josef Stalin and he has been amply written about, and this article simply reviews those sources for the most part. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 10:18, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This dab page contains two entries, one incorrect, one nonencyclopedic. The incorrect entry states that ".ai" is top-level domain for Antigua. (It's actually <a href="../../../a/i/_/Ai.html" title="Ai">ai</a>.) The nonencylopedic entry refers to a filename extension for Adobe Illustrator files.

<li>Have you looked at <a href="../../../c/c/t/Template%7ECcTLD_73f3.html" title="Template:CcTLD">Template:CcTLD</a>? We have quite a lot of them. And that's not including the articles on filename extensions. There appears to be a lot of duplication here (<a href="../../../a/i/_/Ai.html" title="Ai">ai</a> telling us that it is an ISO country code, and <a href="../../../2E/a/i/.ai.html" title=".ai">.ai</a> telling us that it is a CCTLD, which of course use the ISO country codes.) <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac Rabinovitch</a> is almost right, though. The dot preceding the label is, in fact, <i>not</i> valid without a preceding label, and so isn't a part of the name of the CCTLD itself. However, strictly, since it is a top-level <i>domain name</i>, and not a shorthand, <a href="http://menandmice.com./online_docs_and_faq/glossary/fqdn.htm" class="external text" title="http://menandmice.com./online_docs_and_faq/glossary/fqdn.htm" rel="nofollow">there should be a dot</a> <i>following</i> the label. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:32, 2005 Jun 18 (UTC)

<li>I tent to agree about these article titles starting with dots. There seem to be dozens of them: <a href="../../../c/o/u/Category%7ECountry_code_top-level_domains_81df.html" title="Category:Country code top-level domains">Category:Country_code_top-level_domains</a>. There is also a monster series template associated with them: {{<a href="../../../c/c/t/Template%7ECcTLD_73f3.html" title="Template:CcTLD">CcTLD</a>}}. Perhaps the whole category/member articles/template should be discussed together. (Somewhere other than VfD?)

<li>It doesn't make much sense to delete this one alone.

<ul>
<li>I doubt that every non-religious song could be listed here. <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCartney_c886.html" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>'s <i>We All Stand Together</i> seems unlikely to have ever been played at a dance, for example, it being in <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_signature.html" title="Time signature">triple time</a>. <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terence_Trent_D%27Arby_94ef.html" title="Terence Trent D'Arby">Terence Trent D'Arby</a>'s <i>As Yet Untitled</i> doesn't even have a beat. Furthermore: What makes you think that this article <i>requires</i> you to find out what a 100-student middle school in Arkansas played six years ago? The only requirement, given the page as it stands, is that one be able to verify whether the song is played <i>at dances</i>, <i>not</i> whether it was played at a specific dance. There are plenty of references to pick from that make such verification exceedingly easy. Google Web turns up hundreds of lists of songs played at dances that one can use for verification. Here are just three:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.acustomdj.com/Song-list-directory.html" class="external text" title="http://www.acustomdj.com/Song-list-directory.html" rel="nofollow">songs played at wedding dances</a></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>If, as it appears to be, your objection here is that the contents of such a list would be unverifiable because it would be impossible to verify that a song listed <i>was</i> in fact played at dances, your objection is highly flawed. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:42, 2005 Jun 19 (UTC)</li>

<li>Summary so far:
<ul>
<li><i>List could contain every song ever recorded.</i> â False.

<li><i>Every non-religious song could be listed here.</i> â False. Even some non-religious songs aren't songs played at dances. I've provided some examples of those, too.</li>
<li>We'd have to <i>find out what some 100-student middle school in Arkansas played six years ago.</i> â False. We only need to find out whether a song is played <i>at dances</i>.</li>

<li>Okay, you're right. All I'm saying is that while many lists on wikipedia cannot have all their items listed, this is the epitome of that. Also, as I said in my original comment, this is useless. Who would ever want to know if a song was played at a dance. I thought about that for a few minutes, and the only time I could think of was someone coordinating a dance. In light of your argument, I changed my vote from <i>strong delete</i> to just <i>delete</i>.

</ul>
<p>Oh, and the Arkansas thing. What I meant was that there might be a song played at a dance that was played at no other dances.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I would like to vote delete on gut feeling, but I can't find good, solid criteria on which to base it. That's not to say this list doesn't have serious problems, as others pointed out. Are lists we find on the web credible references? Can we ever verify a given song was <i>not</i> played at a dance, in other words, is this list <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a> at all? If they are references, should we mention them in the list or can we leave it to the reader? As others have pointed out, is there any <i>point</i> to listing every song played at some dance somewhere? Is that knowledge? Any song can be played at a dance, what does it matter? You could be interested in popular music or dance music or even popular dance music, but a list of songs <i>played</i> at dances? What's dance music, anyway? Should we include <a href="../../../g/a/v/Gavotte.html" title="Gavotte">gavottes</a>? No? Contemporary music only? What's that, then? Come to think of it, what's a "dance", actually? And what qualifies as a "dance" internationally? <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> Â· <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 21:02, 2005 Jun 21 (UTC)</li>

I disagree...I submitted this guy because I had do a presentation on his work this past Spring and it was difficult to find complete information on him (he is a pretty young fellow). Thus, my hope was to get others adding content. First saw him lecture at MIT in the fall...and have found numerous articles/text citations on the guy. The bulk of his work involved technology for 3G wireless networks. His research resulted in a way of allowing limited amounts of RF spectrum to be recycled at many times the rate allowed by existing technologies. This is currently a very big deal among wireless telco providers creating next-gen infrastructure. Also, he is CEO of a New York-based company called <a href="http://www.novatics.com" class="external text" title="http://www.novatics.com" rel="nofollow">Novatics</a>. These are the basics of what I have on him. -B.

<li>Delete: I do not disagree in any way with the above author's statement, and I sympathize. The problem here is that Wikipedia is intended to be a tertiary source of information. Therefore, while we may get praised for being "leading edge" in technology coverage, that's a result of the blindness of print encyclopedias. We're supposed to be slow and conservative about coverage and to accept figures who have already demonstrated notability. That's a vague term, but in the case of living authors most people mean by that that the figure turns up quite a few hits via Google. Obviously, this leads to distortions (people mistakenly (IMO) vote to keep minor actors and pornographers while missing artists), but it is the best method we have. This particular person is not yet discussed enough by other sources for an encyclopedia article to be written that isn't <i>original research.</i> However, I, and I'm sure we, welcome the contributions and the desire to broaden our coverage. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:02, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - non-notable. I looked around <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org" class="external text" title="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org" rel="nofollow">IEEEXplore</a> (which is authoritative) and 'Dooley' produced no publications that could be this guy if his field is wireless. To be notable in the field, you'll have published in an IEEE journal for sure. <i>Note</i>, without subscription access to IEEEXplore, you won't be able to verify what I say. It might help is someone else could back me up on this. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 14:39, Jun 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am impressed with the volunteer review process, and I think that the comments made here are valid. I study the effects of telecommunications on society, and my continual frustration is that there is very little information available on key innovators in the wireless field over the last thirty years. For example, individuals like <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Cooper_a349.html" title="Martin Cooper">Martin Cooper</a> (effective inventor of the cellular phone we know today) are not represented in Wikipedia. This, I believe, is due to the wireless industry media, which has always been less than stellar. I can think of at least half a dozen otherwise anonymous individuals in the field whose individual contributions have had profound economic, technological and social impacts. Having said this, I share Geogreâs sentiments, and I now feel that the relevant administrator should remove this listing until there is more broad-based awareness of Dooley and/or others can submit a more comprehensive article. -B.

<dd>That's impressively understanding of you. If you are happy for an admin to delete it, you could go to the page, and add a {{db|I'm the *'''Comment''' seems to be notable, but there is not enough material in the article to judge. If the author manages to expand, I would vote keep. For now, I abstain.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I've added some additional data, if only for the archive in case this topic is revisited down the line. I found Dooley's email address in an article he wrote last year. However, I've not yet heard back with additional biographical information. Interesting character nonetheless. -B. Manohar (article author)</li>

<li>Grr. I would like to be a helpful WP member, but you guys aren't giving me constructive criticism. What part of the WP laws am I braking? I looked over all the pages trying to find something that would invalid this type of page, but I couldn't. If you would just point something definitive out (some reason why this doesn't belong on WP), I'd be more than happy to leave, but so far it just seems like people's personal opinions. - 67.182.137.87</li>

<li>Here's some. An encyclopedia is not the place for lists of local information that needs to be constantly updated. That is a lot of effort for something of relatively little informational value and that really doesn't fit the mission of this project. Are there enough people who are informed and interested in this subject to perform that effort? Who will finish this list? Who will maintain it? Most likely this will remain the short, incomplete list that it is. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 09:23, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks Gamaliel. I was looking for some advice about why it wasn't a very good article, because I would like to be a helpful member. That said, I would work on the article as I travel around town, but this was all the info I had at the top of my head when I started. When trying to become a better WP member, I don't appreciate attacks from people like Porturology. That just frustrates me and gives me a sense that WP is full of elitists. I'm glad there are some on here who would help someone out. BTW, I have created and made slight modifications to pages under my username, but I'm not logged into that. -67.182.137.87</li>

<li>Delete: In the case of lists, they need to be comprehensive and finite, and they should be of encyclopedic value. In this case, the list is phrased in the present tense, and construction sites are eternally changing. I.e. it is an infinite list (as the "present" keeps moving), but it is of encyclopedic value. You would be better off with "major construction sites in Seattle 2005," but you'd still have trouble with the information being found by anyone or linking it to an existing article. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:29, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> But your suggestion would be a way to document major constuction projects in a given year. That could provide a way to trace the early history of these projects that can be liked to if you get an encylopedic building.

The result of the debate was no consensus for deletion, so the article will be <b>kept</b>.

<p>After reading this I wanted to clean out the bits that are speculation or <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, but then I realized that virtually <i>all</i> of it is speculation or research, or a trivial listing of synonyms. E.g. Trinity is asserted to refer to the female aspect of the Christian god (which is heavily disputed), Apoc is linked to Epoch because it sounds similar, Cypher is linked to Lucifer because it's <i>spelled</i> similar, and Switch is linked to a BDSM role. I'm sorry about this since I really like the film, but this article is far too devoid of actual content. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 12:46, Jun 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yes, that page, too, is original research. Basically they put on each and every synonym and spurious etymology they could find. Allow me to quote,
<ul>
<li><i>101 is a cool prime number.</i> (so friggin' what?)</li>
<li><i>Maybe the Merovingian was a former One.</i> (patently false, since he's a computer program as explained in the film)</li>
<li><i>Ander = "Man" (Greek)</i> (also wrong, the Greek word is Andros)</li>
<li><i>"Thomas A." is probably related to "Thomas Aquin" a saint of the catholic church.</i> (speculative)</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Matrix_9295.html" title="The Matrix">The Matrix</a>. I don't think that providing background information on mythological names qualifies as original research, especially when the name is established in Wikipedia -- those entries compromise a "Matrix List," more or less. By rough reckoning, about 40% of the list content is of that kind. I am not willing to vote keep, however, because this doesn't seem worthy of a separate article. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 04:32, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> Agree w/ Radiant. What little verifiable/factual stuff exists should be or is in character's articles. No sources or references cited for the rest. Looking at what I can find about that "Like A Splinter in Your Mind" book, I think it's a strong possibility that the author(s) of the article are confusing the "Matrix" metaphors or examples used in that book as a way to introduce philosophical concepts (like "The Physics of Star Trek" (see <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_M._Krauss_9c30.html" title="Lawrence M. Krauss">Lawrence M. Krauss</a>) uses ST devices and terms to introduce concepts of physics) with the thematic intentions of the writers of the film. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoundguy99_5970.html" title="User:Soundguy99">Soundguy99</a> 06:31, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> to individual wikis for each character, if a page exists. Some characters will never be developed and removing this bit of information removes what little data is available for lesser characters, like Switch or Apoc. The movie directors acknowledged the patent symbolisms, some obvious, some not, most unexplained. However, these items are part of information about the movies and the characters. Interpretation can be whittled on a page by page level, other less important definitions can disappear with this page. Like everything else, a credible source or explanation should be given. (For instance, the use of the name "Morpheus" can be confirmed from sources as intentional by the directors and its origin from The Sandman comics). One less page to edit is cool, but don't eliminate the origin of names that can be verified or are too obvious to ignore. <a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpencerian_205c.html" title="User:Spencerian">Spencerian</a> 22:47, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as per Vision. Also, I suppose non-Singaporeans do not realise that secondary school bands in Singapore are much more prominent on the national scene that their peers in many other countries. Every two years, secondary school bands fight it out for the SYF competition, and the winner (or finalist) gets to perform for the entire nation to see for Singapore's National Day Parade.

<p>This is nothing more than an advertisement for a specific MUD. Something like DikuMUD or CircleMUD is notable, these are codebases used for hundreds or even thousands of MUDs, but this is just a specific MUD running on modified Diku. Statements like <i>GrimneMUD is set in a high fantasy society, and boasts a very active player base</i> only confirm this as spam. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptoDerk_6aa9.html" title="User:CryptoDerk">CryptoDerk</a> 17:11, May 24, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>.. Are you sure that merely not having an internet presence easily findable to means that it is not notable? I cannot speak for the notability of this particular band as I don't know anything about it, but it seems quite possible that there are bands that are not online. Is a band posting its own website, listing itself in directories, and getting SEO help or some friends to make vanity web links to its site so that it gets many search results the difference between notability and non-notability? -<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 04:41, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, it <i>might</i> exist, but I'd wager good money no one but its members care and so neither should we.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Well, kid, this may be cold comfort, but I think it's a pretty funny account of a pretty funny experiment. I threw an egg off my high school's roof (two-story building) eons ago, with no safety devices, trying to prove chickens used to lay eggs while flying (I don't remember why I was trying to prove this). It landed safely, but it was <i>thrown</i>, not dropped, into grass. Other experiments from taller buildings onto harder ground resulted in Humpty Dumpty all over again. Your article isn't for Wikipedia, but you show plenty of promise in other areas. So don't be discouraged. Writers have to get used to being rejected. It doesn't mean what you've written is crap, even if you're told it is. That's only an <b>opinion</b>, not a proven fact. If you were to rewrite it to Wiki standards, it wouldn't be nearly as entertaining. And I think it's more than entertaining enough for BJAODN (which is <i>not</i> a diss in this case, at <i>all</i>). I say <b>Delete</b>, to go straight to BJAODN. --<a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMothperson_66a8.html" title="User:Mothperson">Mothperson</a> 12:54, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Dear Znode Well, if you're interestet we have released a full length movie this May. it was even announced on <a href="http://www.uncut.at/graz/events/loft-beisser.php" class="external free" title="http://www.uncut.at/graz/events/loft-beisser.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.uncut.at/graz/events/loft-beisser.php</a> , a really famous event magazine here (since I suppose you re not from Austria, I'll believe you ve never heard of it.)</p>
<p>Anyway. I was trying out wikipedia for the first time today, and If you want to throw me out just go ahead. I just have to say, I'm quite disappointed of the ignorance of the wiki team. All the best, max</p>
<dl>
<dd>Max, we are not trying to throw <i>you</i> out of wikipedia. It is just that you and your projects are not notable enough for articles in the main namespace. I wish you well with your projects/ambitions, but they are simply not yet notable enough for an article; this is yet another amateur production. The lack of google hits implies that you are using wikipedia for publicity.</dd>
<dd>By the way, i reported you for vandalism for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=REBOL&amp;oldid=15411067" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=REBOL&amp;oldid=15411067" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS">The JPS</a> 22:38, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Not notable</b>. I'd <i>say</i> that this character was featured in only one episode of <i>Darkwing Duck</i>, but as a matter of fact he's never appeared in any; he was mentioned as being dead in one episode, and someone had a photograph of him, and that was it. Whoever started the article wrote the first paragraph mostly copying, word for word, from <a href="http://moa.dracandros.com" class="external text" title="http://moa.dracandros.com" rel="nofollow">MultiversalOmnipediaAtlas</a>; I wrote the second paragraph and added the stub template thinking that maybe he did play a larger role in the series, until I saw the MultiversalOmnipediaAtlas and found that that was all there was. I'm not sure how big a problem the word-for-word copying is, but this is a concern to me because in the article <a href="../../../t/a/u/Taurus_Bulba_2ae7.html" title="Taurus Bulba">Taurus Bulba</a>, I wrote most of the "Darkly Dawns the Duck" section, but someone wrote most of the next section once again copying from MultiversalOmnipediaAtlas. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> 21:38, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>At one point, when the proposal to change to the CE date notation was being lost, I asked what would happen to other articles, such as <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_and_historical_background_of_Jesus_53d0.html" title="Cultural and historical background of Jesus">Cultural and historical background of Jesus</a> which were been changed. âThey will be revertedâ (to AD) was the reply. In the light of [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration/Jguk/Proposed_decision" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration/Jguk/Proposed_decision" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>] that will not happen. That particular article may well be an excellent account of the history of Judaism from a Jewish perspective, but it hardly merits its title. A similar fate awaits this article.

<li><strike><b>Keep</b> and permit this proposed rewrite run its course. This should not be a subject of a VfD until such time as agreement is requested that this article should replace the current Jesus article. There is nothing, substantiated in the VfD proposal, about the rewrite in progress that indicates that it (the rewrite) is either POV nor a fork. It is, instead, an effort (and from what I've seen of it, in good faith) an in-progress attempt to reconstruct the Jesus article. At worst, in my own (disinterested) POV this VfD is in bad faith, at best it is premature. As it is, it is not an article, it is instead, as is quite clearly stated at the only actual article that used to point directly to it (until the pointer was removed on <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>), an ongoing effort to rewrite the article in as unobtrusive manner as possible. Let the rewrite proceed as it will, and take up argumentation wrt thereto at such time as a proposal to replace the current argument therewith is proffered. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 09:23, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)</strike>

<li>Well, since <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">Jguk</a> was the originator of this attempted rewrite, for reasons which he never made clear anywhere, except possibly in a comment at <a href="../../../j/e/s/Talk%7EJesus_Archive_17_03f7.html#Problems_with_this_article" title="Talk:Jesus/Archive 17">Talk:Jesus/Archive_17#Problems_with_this_article</a>, and he claims to have left WP, its primary mover and shaker is not here to argue in favor of its retention. I'm convinced tho by the arguments that the main article should have been edited rather than this rewrite, that it is a POV fork, in light of a number of comments and edits made by Jguk, and that it coulda shoulda been undertaken in his userspace. I am, therefore, modifying my vote accordingly. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 00:46, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, accoring to the article history, 15 editors have worked on it (although I didn't look at the extent of each of their edits).

<li><b>STRONG DELETE</b> Highly POV resulting in propoganda with it being too strong POV and factually inaccurate to allow rewrite. For example, it discusses "Muslim persecution in Spain" without even mentioning the Muslim invasion of Spain or the long campaign of warfare the Muslims used to conquer and convert the pennisula. An armed response to an invasion is not persecution! It cannot be logically equalled to say, the Holocaust were a peaceful ethnic minority were made scapegoats and killed.Similarly, "Muslim persecution during the Crusades" - The Crusades were an armed response to the Muslim persecution of Christian pilgrims. While the Crusaders slaughtering Muslims in Jerusalem was wrong, an action like that is more like total warfare, not persecution. That's like saying the massive bombing of Dresden, Germany in WWII, was persecution? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarneygumble_6c6f.html" title="User:Barneygumble">Barneygumble</a> 15:42, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Non-notable? Not an international mega rock star type by but worth more research before deletion.

Possibly info on all band members and the band itself should be <b>merged</b> into one place?

<p>-i feel you people are being too harsh. This is just some kid who wants to feel like he did something special. You do this and delete his page then you are deleting his dream. What does it matter if this is in here. NO one is going to look at it, who cares you people shouldn't be so quick to micro-manage. And it doesn't matter if it doesn't bring any "influential" things to the table. no one is going to look at it other than the people who have no lives and just go around looking for these pages. Let it go, and continue on to another page, because this was a dieing persons last wish, they wanted this exact script put up on the web and kept there, so why are you going to kill that persons wish? <a href="../../../j/i/b/User%7EJiber_a8b9.html" title="User:Jiber">jiber</a> 20:58 19 june</p>
