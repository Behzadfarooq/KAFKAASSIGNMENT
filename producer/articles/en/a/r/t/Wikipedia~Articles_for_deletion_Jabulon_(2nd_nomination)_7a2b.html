<p>The article is about a little known word, supposedly used in a particularly small branch of Freemasonry as a password or recognition word. As such, it is not really encyclopedic (See <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>). At one time, the article was longer... including a lot of speculation as to the word's origins and meaning.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Just because I think that the whole thing is bonkers (and worse, a red herring) does not mean that it is not notable. Whether I think it is bonkers is largely subjective.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - "Traditional veil of secrecy". my foot. Go to Amazon, or EBay, or do a search online. I think you'll find plenty of rituals. I certainly did - they're not really very secret at all. That's a misconception, and the simple fact is, if Freemason editors weren't here to make sure what was written in the Freemasonry-related articles was accurate, every article would be full of conspiracy theories and uniinformed statements, such as "Anti-Masonic ritual", which doesn't exist, and actually popped up in <a href="../../../j/a/h/Jahbulon.html" title="Jahbulon">Jahbulon</a> just recently, or "veil of secrecy" for that matter. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 10:16, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Sigh, <b>Keep</b>... we've already been through this once. As Tlöniq says, "Jabulon" is out there, like it or not. While there may be no wikipedia editors who <i>believe</i> in "Jabulon" [except the nominator, perhaps? wow, watch the conspiracy theories spin!!!], the fact remains that millions of Christians in the US, at the very least, have been exposed to this concept...and that alone makes it notable. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 07:53, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As the article has changed since the AfD was entered and there is currently an argument going on about whether a report from the Baptist Union of Scotland can be included under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> can this consultation be suspended until the article is stabilised?

<dd>JASpencer's comment goes right to the heart of the matter... Almost all of the "controversy" surounding Jahbulon can and has been removed because it comes from unreliable sources and fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Without that "controversy" there is nothing notable or encyclopedic about the existance of the word. This is why the time has come to re-nominate it for deletion. If those who wish to keep the article could locate reliable sources to back their claims, I would agree that it would be worth keeping. Since they can not, it should be deleted. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 17:56, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I apologise for being unclear but this is not what I said. Small but substantial changes have been made to the article giving it some context as to why it is notable. We are also in the middle of a discussion as to whether Church websites are reliable sources for hosting other church's documents and wheter <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is being used to remove valid information. I believe that the AfD is inappropriate at the moment. It may be appropriate later when this becomes a stable article. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 19:16, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Basicly what you are saying is that we are destined to keep going in circles... someone will insert the "controversy" material with citing yet another unreliable source, someone else will delete that material per WP:RS, the article will then be renomimated for yet another AFD, and then someone will insert the "controversy" using a different unreliable source and say that the article isn't stable so should be given a third, fourth, fifth chance ... etc. etc. etc. I really don't think we should be waisting everyones time like that. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 20:22, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well no. The question is not whether the Jahbulon claims are <b>true</b> but whether they are notable.</dd>
<dd>There is reliable material saying that people believe that Jahbulon is a Masonic deity - Knight and deHoyos for two. They may be wrong (and I have been outed already on this page in my scepticism) but the concept is still there. This was made <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jahbulon_fcd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jahbulon">first time around</a>:
<dl>
<dd><i>The claim that Freemasons use the word "Jahbulon" or "Jabulon" as the name of a deity, and discussions about its possible etymology, seem to be attested outside of Wikipedia</i> <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">User:Ihcoyc</a></dd>
<dd><i>the fact that conspiracy buffs and antimasonists discuss the subject incessantly make it noteworthy, even if they're off the wall. I can see people coming to WP to verify the claims made by the conspiracy theorists and their ilk</i> <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">User:TShilo12</a> (I don't think that MSJ or you got to the heart of this objection in your replies).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Knight and Hannah have both had an effect - including in church reports. Many Christians believe that Jahbulon is either the name of a Masonic deity or else a very dubious theological construct (or in the Baptist's case both). For this reason it is notable. And for once I'd love to agree with you.</dd>

<dd>Well, the problem is that there's no reliable evidence on the anti-Masonic side to say that it exists, and clear denial on the Masonic side. So where's the article in all this? <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 21:33, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's not the point though. It's the accusation that's notable. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 21:49, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Note that when I posted this AFD, there <i>was</i> no accusation mentioned in the article. The material about accusations had been deleted due to the lack of reliable sources to back the accusation up. In essence all the article consisted of was "Royal Arch Masons may use a word called Jahbulon and Rev. Tydeman thinks it means such and such". The article had been that way for over a month with no objections or edits. In fact, the only other editor who participated in discussion on the deletions agreed that, without the accusation, the article should be deleted. Without the accusation the word Jahbulon is not notable the article is not encyclopedic. I do find it strange that no-one seemed to care about this article until an AFD nomination was made.</dd>
<dd>That said, I agree that <i>with</i> the accusation material included the topic is notable... if only for the existance of the controversy surrounding it. IF someone can find reliable sources to back the accusation materials, I am willing to drop the AFD nomination. And I am willing to postpone it to give you time to try and find those reliable sources.
