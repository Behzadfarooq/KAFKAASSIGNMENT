<p>The result was <b>KEEP</b>. Since nomination, the article has been somewhat rewritten to remove the attack tone. The article is certainly referenced. Is the person notable? I would say that being notorious is not the same as being notable, but that argument was not made. Most every commentor conceded his notability. Does the article violate <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>? In my view it does not, being rigorously referenced. I did not even count the votes because of the many puppets, but base the close strictly on strength of argument, which falls to the Keep view in my opinion. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 13:05, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Massive, well-referenced attack page. The history is filled with too many anon edits to accurately sort out, but in its current state this article is in dire violation of BLP.

<dd>To begin with, this article is basically libel bait. Over the past two hours I've seen editors add and subtract personal information, baseless speculation, and random accusations. The tone of this article is nowhere near <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Wikipedia standards for neutrality</a>. I don't much care if the content is credible, my concern is that this is a biography tailored for the sole reason of disparaging its subject. Wikipedia is not a vehicle for character assassination, and the massive involvement by various blogs is detrimental to building any sort of encyclopedic article. ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 03:41, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Serin is actually fairly well known among those discussing the housing bubble online. His blog has an Alexa ranking of 46,633, and has 130 pages linking in. I do agree that the page appears to violate <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and should be rewritten. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkipSmith_e48d.html" title="User:SkipSmith">SkipSmith</a> 03:27, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As a Realtor, and having followed the Casey Serin story since early October, and doing a good amount of reasearch on public records regarding his transactions, I believe the Casey Serin article is fair, accurate and unbiased as of 20:22 PST USA on 03/15/2007. There is considerable interest in the Mainstream Media about the story of Casey Serin, and the legal ramifications of his real estate transactions. Removing this article would be a disservice to Wikipedia, considering all the work and research that has gone into its creation. It is not an attack page. Instead, it is a well-researched and documented page that is important, regarding current real estate lending practices in the USA.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I see virtually no discussion of real estate lending practices in this article, but quite a bit of mudslinging. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESaranary_c55d.html" title="User:Saranary">Saranary</a> 03:53, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The subject person is notable. Considerable amount of external references are being quoted. Agree though that there are un-encyclopedic comments and personal attacks going on. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterMarkSmith_68e3.html" title="User:PeterMarkSmith">PeterMarkSmith</a> 03:45, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> or revise to be consistent with NPOV/BLP policies and protect from further edits. The page seems designed to humiliate and harass the subject. Since its inception, it has included offensive or insulting references to Serin's religion, nationality, marriage, family relationships, and appearance - none of which seem particularly relevant. I also question the repeated posting of his family members' names, photographs, and contact information. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESaranary_c55d.html" title="User:Saranary">Saranary</a> 03:48, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I think an article on Casey Serin should exist, but to claim that the article in its current form is unbiased is laughable. Do neutral encyclopedia articles contain phrases like "Visitors to his blog are usually surprised at his smug comments, where it's obvious he doesn't believe he has done anything wrong, and that he deserves a lifestyle which includes several luxuries he can't afford to pay" and "Serin's personal eccentricities: his habitually unkempt haircut, his carrying a murse (which he refers to as his "man bag"), and his obsession with juicing"? Like I said, I believe an article on Casey Serin should exist, but only if it adheres to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkipSmith_e48d.html" title="User:SkipSmith">SkipSmith</a> 03:50, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>(edit conflict) Right now its little more than a liability. Serin's story is interesting, but not because of him as a person. Journalist coverage indeed used him as a "posterboy" to illustrate the volatile and absurd state of the real estate market. In a surprising (and not a little narcissistic) twist, Serin embraced this image, and created a blog. All of the negative comments, the structure, research, and defacement of his article are the result of this circus. There are hundreds of speculators who are in debt because of stupid business decision, singling Sarin out to illustrate the phenomenon is simply a poor basis for establishing a fair biography. ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 04:06, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree there's nothing inherently notable about Serin, except that other people have decided to talk about him. I guess that makes him the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Hilton_9740.html" title="Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a> of real estate --- famous for being famous. But if people are talking about him, that makes him notable, even if by more objective standards he's not unusual. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkipSmith_e48d.html" title="User:SkipSmith">SkipSmith</a> 04:15, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Depends, do claims of dubious notoriety trump the BLP/NPOV requirements of neutrality and doing no harm? Plenty of people were talking about Brian Peppers at one point, yet his article was little more than a freakshow. I'd rank Serin's claim of notability somewhere above Peppers' and quite a ways below Paris Hilton's. Hilton, at least, has a widely documented public image and a mainstream modelling/acting career. Serin has a series of technologically adept bloggers who actively maintain a clearly outlined smear campaign. I sure as hell wouldn't want to monitor this article for impropriety if it is kept, I'd go insane after a day's worth of back-and-forth edits! ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 04:30, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep, but edit out certain parts</b>* The entire story is pretty much verifiable, it is the tone that is the problem.

<dd>Then we edit it to neutrality. Considering that Serin is relatively famous and an very telling example of the subprime meltdown, which is a very hot and current topic in the US, the article should be kept. I dont have a problem editing it down to a more neutral tone, but much of what was on there prior was a stub entry, last I had seen it before this mess. In addition, we cant blame all the edits on exurban. Serin opened up his blog to unmoderated comments for a few hours once, and the vehement posted was NOTHING like we're seeing here.

<li><b>Keep</b>; Serin has made himself a public figure through his media appearances and has developed some notoriety, particularly within the housing bubble blogs. I believe his story is significant enough, as an exemplar of property speculation, to merit inclusion. I'd note that article has actually *improved* in tone and reliability since Serin drew attention to it. Some mixed feelings though: there are NPOV problems, particularly within the Criticisms section; it does rely heavily on citations to Serin's own blog, not a reliable source for any statement not qualified with "Serin claims"; it will continue to be a target for vandalism given that both Serin and Exurban Nation have directed readers to it. --Jkew 17:24, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>"Keep". Again, Casey's story has been published in numerous major media outlets and is well known within the real-estate community. As for NOPV, I agree, it needs work in this area but when you have the subject providing information such as "Yes, I committed mortgage fraud." in an audio interview it is hard to not make the article seem as a bit biased against him when he has admitted on many occasions to have committed illegal acts and most people have built in negative feelings towards those who are un-remoseful about committing crimes and openly talk about it. While the article itself may be neutral, it, understandably, may feel un-neutral given that many people will find his actions and lack of remorse for those actions to be morally reprehensible and he has a distinct lack of any effort to rectify them. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.96.236.92_c553.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.96.236.92">71.96.236.92</a> (talk) 17:31, 16 March 2007 (UTC).</small> <small>— 71.96.236.92 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.96.236.92_c553.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.96.236.92">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree it will take work to keep this one encyclopedic, but I suspect that is common of pages for persons with many detractors. I don't think it is Wikipedia that is "granting notability" to Serin. It is that with all the easy lending the media and the blogosphere are predisposed to put a face and a name to this phenomenon. Serin just came along to fit that bill and the bloggers and then the media picked up on it. I have been trying to make a case that we should ratchet down some of the personal content, but wasn't getting anyone backing me up and didn't want to get into an edit war. I think the discussion that needs to happen (where?) is what should be in- and out-of bounds for this article as a bio of a living person. If we can come to some consensus on the ground rules, it will make it easier to edit and police the page. As it is there are differing opinions about how much of his family's details are appropriate given his explicit request to keep them out of it. --<a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakeVortex_215f.html" title="User:JakeVortex">Jake</a> 21:37, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I can see your point about Serin becoming the face of the real estate meltdown. The biggest problem with this article in its current form is that many of its inflammatory assertions have been sourced to Serin's blog, Ramit's blog, the Exurban Nation blog, other real estate blogs, google caches and Usenet. All of these are considered unreliable sources, as per <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTR_8ce7.html" title="WP:ATTR">WP:ATTR</a>, and <i>cannot</i> be used to support negative claims about a living person.

<li>Serin is no troll. His real estate dealings are very real. His notoriety stems from the fact that he has brazenly admitted to mortgage fraud, not just on his blog but to major media outlets as well, and has yet to face any consequences.

<li><b>Keep/restore</b>. This log is very accurate in itself and reliable content mostly suplied by Casey Serin himself in his own blog. While he may defend some of it now, that is only because his version is more biased than any normal person and wavers from day to day between taking responsibility and completely denying the facts as he [himself] stated them. This was his intention to cause so much havoc that Wiki would be utterly comfused and be forced to remove or seriously edit the page in a way that would completely omit the facts. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.226.136.208_2e60.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.226.136.208">70.226.136.208</a> (talk) 04:27, 17 March 2007 (UTC).</small> <small>— User:70.226.136.208 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7E70.226.136.208_6539.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:70.226.136.208">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> If he were just some guy who lost money on real estate, then there would be nothing to write. Casey Serin is notable not for his failed investments, but for the incredible level of detail he provides while talking about them. It's not just a blog; he has posted screenshots and scans of legal and financial documents that most people consider extremely private. The houses are relevant only to the extent that they make the exhibitionism interesting. If we have articles for porn stars, then it certainly makes sense to have one for him, for about the same reasons.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As far as what the article should say, and what references should be acceptable: this is a strange situation. Serin freely admits (on his blog, of course) to things that would be libelous if you accused someone of them. The anti-self-published guidelines on <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> are written to prevent Wikipedia from propagating someone's self-promotion.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Whether or not the current article is any good is irrelevant to question of whether an article should exist at all. Serin's name often comes up in real estate discussions without any explanation of who he is. People are just expected to know, and if they don't they may come here looking for information. They should find something, even if it's just a stub. 205.212.74.143 05:21, 17 March 2007 (UTC) <small>— User:205.212.74.143 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7E205.212.74.143_8e38.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:205.212.74.143">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I'm going to go with the poster above who notes that most of Serin's own entries are essentially self-defamatory. Serin admits to multiple acts of fraud, foolishness and self-delusion. Also, there are users who may appear to be single purpose IP's only due to the nature of the modern internet. My ISP uses DHCP, and resets the leases every 24 hours, plus, i wander between work, home and my mobile card, so i pop in and out of 3 Class A networks on a routine basis. Add in the fact, we are using NAT and it becomes very hard to predict what my IP is going to be. I don't login to Wikipedia, because, i want to be anonymous. I worked very hard just creating a table of entries of real estate deals done by Serin, and, i hate seeing it messed with. That table is essential to understanding what went on. YOu can see a slow movement, and then suddenly, a flurry of deals done as the cashback window was closing. Sadly, he blew much of his cash on a foolish house purchase in dallas.
