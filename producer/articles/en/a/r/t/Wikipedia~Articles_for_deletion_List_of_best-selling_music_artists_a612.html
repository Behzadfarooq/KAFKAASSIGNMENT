<li>Strong Keep - is a great source of discussion and seems a fair mark in the sand</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This list is made up</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> It's been proven that Beatles and Elvis have NOT sold over a billion records, there weren't even a billion of their albums printed. What's Michael Jackson doing way down on the list? He's been known as the biggest selling artist of all-time for a number of years now. This list is so wrong. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStreet_walker_7556.html" title="User:Street walker">Street walker</a> 06:14, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>dream on street walker, your views are biast towards michael jackson and have been more than obvious for a while. Michael Jackson has only been known as the number 1 act ever amoung his fans, NOONE ELSE, it has NOT been proven elvis and the beatles didn't sell a billion. There have been over 3,000 Presley titles in print, The Beatles dominated the charts around the world more than any act ever, both had more sales chart ativity than jackson. GET OVER IT.</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Why don't people just try to improve the accuracy, rather than blaming it? This is a collabrative community, isn't it?</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Metallica, 10 billion albums sold? Yeah right. And the Beatles aren't even on the list. I think we should do another one like that with certifiable sources and lock it from edition if it is possible. That should be a good idea.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Entirely fake figures from sources that are not accurate. It has become an article of fanboys of bands. Get rid of it!</li>
<li>Keep - useful, if not entirely accurate</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Full of inflated figures from shockingly dubious sources. Just look at the reference for Deep Purple's ludicrous claim of 100 million sold. This is a band that hasn't even sold 10 million in the USA. There is no way they sold more in countries where they generally charted worse. Just because some press agent makes a claim doesn't mean it's fact.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> it's a useful (though slightly innacutrate)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> it's highly innacutrate.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Just go and delete it It's useless</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> based soley on it claiming the Beatle's are a US group.... <a href="../../../x/e/n/User%7EXeno_7586.html" title="User:Xeno">Xeno</a></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> As stated before, it is biased. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Bisciut_d5c1.html" title="User:Mr Bisciut">Mr Bisciut</a></li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> This 'article' is, by far, the worst one on Wikipedia. Frankly, its getting out of hand. The figures are exaggerated and unreliable (there is no worldwide tracking system for sales) the page is vandalised incessantly. Many users take the page as a 'fansite' or forum, and they come here everyday and make false numbers and change the list to suit their artists. Really, what kind of article is this if its so unrealiable, people have to do their own research so that they can check if this article is accurate? At times, I want to revert the vandalism, but the page is so destroyed, I dont know the correct version to revert it to. <a href="../../../j/o/u/User%7EJournalist_823c.html" title="User:Journalist">Journalist</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/u/User_talk%7EJournalist_14df.html" title="User talk:Journalist">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Journalist_65e6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Journalist">contribs</a>)</li>

Similar non-scientific articles, particularly Biggest-selling female musician (<b>Note: also marked for deletion</b>), which repeats the same exaggerated fan claims, must also be deleted.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as i already mentioned to you on the discussion page there is no reliable "methodology" everything that was suggested by yourself and others was just as faultless, if not more so. Also, are sales that importnat in "music" anyway? We can celebrate a musicains carrer in their articles, regardless of how many albums/singles/candy bars that they have sold 195.93.21.1</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, essentially a list of unverifiable assertions. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacj_756e.html" title="User:Jacj">Jacj</a> 18:50, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, no way of positively knowing this... it is mostly a bunch of estimations. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroat_Canuck_c04a.html" title="User:Croat Canuck">Croat Canuck</a> 22:04, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, I say delete it until there's a better way to verify cd sales</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There is no way to verify record sales, estimates are all that is available. -<a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFallout_boy_7dea.html" title="User:Fallout boy">user:Fallout_boy</a></li>
<li><b>Abstain</b>. In one sense this article is unfixable. To do it right, you'd have to have reliable worldwide data (doesn't exist), a better wiki table formatting/numbering mechanism (doesn't exist), a real database query mechanism for the stats (doesn't exist), and no vandals (too many exist). <a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVorash_082f.html" title="User:Vorash">Vorash</a> spent tons of time and effort on this list, but eventually he was driven insane and left Wikipedia. On the other hand, even if you delete this article, someone else will create one down the road, and it won't be as good as the one <a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVorash_082f.html" title="User:Vorash">Vorash</a> put together before he left. Minus the vandalism, and with all the necessary qualifications that were given, the article did have some merit, in that it gave an order of magnitude idea of who sold a really lot of records and who didn't sell so much. Sometimes fuzzy data is all you have to work with. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 15:37, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, There is no way to verify, or know exactly who sold the most CDs, so therefore it is an estimate. Until we can verify it, and know exactly who sold many CDs, this article should be deleted.-<a href="../../../j/f/r/User%7EJfriedman11746_7110.html" title="User:Jfriedman11746">User:jfriedman11746</a>
<ul>
<li>THERE WILL NEVER BE A WAY TO VERIFY RECORD SALES. Especially on older releases, sales were never recorded, and even recent releases are difficult to keep track of sales. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFallout_boy_7dea.html" title="User:Fallout boy">user:Fallout boy</a></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> 68.101.51.87</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> --<a href="../../../a/v/a/User%7EAVainio_078a.html" title="User:AVainio">AVainio</a> 12:19, 20 August 2005 (UTC) Many of the accounts are false. Annie Lennox has sold 50 million? Maybe, but her own webpage states that her two albums have sold 12 million copies. Ok, maybe the 50 million (mentioned in some Live8 materials) could take into account the sales from Eurythmics. If so, why does Eurythmics have 80 million albums sold. That is just one example. These figures will never make sense. Just too little accuracy and too many wild, opinionated guesses thrown around.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoodchuck96_24d8.html" title="User:Woodchuck96">Woodchuck96</a> No validity, insane numbers, almost no accuracy - all in all, an horrid article which is a shame for Wikipédia.</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - Besides the American/Euro-centric nature of the artists mentioned, there just aren't many resources to validate the numbers. For example, I remember news of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coldplay.html" title="Coldplay">Coldplay</a> selling in the range of 20 million records at the beginning of the year. Just weeks before the release of <i><a href="../../../x/%26/y/X%26Y_ee90.html" title="X&amp;Y">X&amp;Y</a></i>, <a href="../../../e/m/i/EMI_68e5.html" title="EMI">EMI</a> give press releases claiming that the band has <i>now</i> sold 25+ million records. I doubt a band can sell 5 million records (in just 6 months) globally between releases.... in other words, the labels put their own spin on the numbers whenever they need to promote an act. --<a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadchester_c727.html" title="User:Madchester">Madchester</a> 01:26, August 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, evens sales info from the RIAA is as unreliable as anything, it is not a 100% truth.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This holds a lot of estimates on artist sales, and the article itself says that the information is suspect. However, this page is still a reliable reference (and is probably the best reference available in the world because the sources are so varied and averaged) People still have a ned to find out whereabouts famous artists are on this list, and there is no other place on the internet where you can find results tabled like this, which regularly get updated. If you're going to delete this, you might as well burn older school atlases "Because they're unreliable", as well as delete a significant amount of wikipedia. Those areas would be places like biblical references (only one reference), theories and death tolls. Wikipedia is a place to pool all the information on the internet, so why not keep it that way? --Mahogany h00r 19:35, August 21, 2005 (GMT+12)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There are no doubt a lot of mistakes on this list. However there will always be mistakes on these kinds of lists. Even recordlabels are often promoting artists by quoting much larger recordsales than the actual numbers to boost sales and make an image. However I think this list is as good as it gets. In adittion to " offical numbers there are also numbers for bootlegrecordings and so on. These kinds of list will never be accurate. However they give an general idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have also noticed that a lot of posters only talks about US sales. This is OK, since it's the only country who has an official statistic. However it does'nt mean that there is'nt a world outside the US with 6 billion people. Just because an artists has sold 2 million in the US, does'nt mean that they haven'nt sold 40 million in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>It is also noted on the list that: In general there is no official organization that certifies worldwide record sales (such as the RIAA does for U.S. record sales). Thus, there are few if any reliable figures to go into this list. Fans, biographers, and record lables may overestimate sales figures for publicity purposes. Many of bestselling artists from Asia, Africa and Latin America are still not included because of the lack of data. Thus, the list cannot be considered definitive, and should be taken with a large grain of salt.</p>
<p>I think that is good enough warnig. If we delete this list, we might as well delete all the bio's as well. Proabably a lot of mistakes there too. Soon we wont have a lexica at all............ ( User: MNorge1978 )</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> Careful now, saying that removing this project page will also lead to the deletion of artist bios is a <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slippery_slope.html" title="Slippery slope">slippery slope</a> argument. Artist pages like <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiohead.html" title="Radiohead">Radiohead</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coldplay.html" title="Coldplay">Coldplay</a> are all respectable, even with no details of total album sales. --<a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadchester_c727.html" title="User:Madchester">Madchester</a> 15:01, August 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>There is virtually no need to mention sales info in Bio's, not in Wikipedia.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I mostly agree with the comments below (I am still laughing about the 5 billion sales proposed for Cher). However, I think it would be better to reach a consensus about what kind of estimations may or may not be used. After all there are albums made gold or diamond regularly, which means that some estimations are indeed accurate. I propose to keep the article, indicate each time what kind of source is used, and reach a consensus about which of these sources are reliable (and delete the entries that are clearly not). <a href="../../../n/y/c/User%7ENyco_1034.html" title="User:Nyco">User: Nyco</a></li>
<li><b>Come off it</b>, there is NO CONSENSUS that is FACT. Just because albums are "certified" for sales, doesn't make it "more reliable". Album certifications rely a lot on what the record label say. Unless someone from the certification company (I.E the RIAA) has PERSONALLY COUNTED every copy of the record, even those statistics should be taken with a pinch of salt and NOT given credit as facts. If the RIAA's figures were so accurate, their certification of sales wouldn't be such a mess, i.e Led Zeppelin suddenly going up from "50 million" to "106 million" since 1990. It's complete fabrication. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 195.93.21.1 (<a href="../../../1/9/5/User_talk%7E195.93.21.1.html" title="User talk:195.93.21.1">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_195.93.21.1_1537.html" title="Special:Contributions/195.93.21.1">contribs</a>) 16:14, 21 August 2005.</small></li>

<p><b>Keep</b> Well, I withdraw my delete vote considering the fact that my argument was not strong enough in the first place. Secondly, I agree that since there are so many votes for Keeping it, deletion will only result in recreation of this page, never leading to its improvement.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete.</b> No international governing body? No way of determining who has sold the most. Like for the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World%27s_tallest_structures.html" title="World's tallest structures">World's tallest structures</a>, there's actually a head honcho called the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_on_Tall_Buildings_and_Urban_Habitat_312f.html" title="Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat">Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat</a> that has set out different categories and rules for building heights. Without some global party overlooking sales figures, those numbers will always be contestable.--LeoTheLion 22:22, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> A page I've been looking for for ages. I quickly copied it since a unique attempt is submerged in a perfectionist debate. I see a lot of negative votes from readers who apparently overlooked the top page "Note". I propose them to channel that energy into improving the list. Personally, as long as the limitations of the list are clearly stated, and every entry is tracable through source mentions, I can make up my own mind about the degree of exactitude. --Karl1000 00:47, August 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and see if it can't be protected from vandalism, like Wikipedia's main page. Discussion of changes or updates can be made on the discussion page. Personally, I like the page, despite its (current) obvious flaws. If semi-reliable data can be found for the artists, and the page protected from vandalism and grossly inflated numbers, I see no reason why it can't stay. I'd also like to add that other countries BESIDES the US do keep tallies of record sales, contrary to what someone above stated. Versions of the RIAA exist in many (even most) non-Third World countries, and many do have searchable web-sites.--<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron">Firsfron</a> 02:16, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b> because the rankings are unverifyable. Even listings from RIAA (and others) could be challanged - and in any case, duplicating RIAA's listings could raise copyright issues.

<li>No one is suggesting "duplicating RIAA's listings", and in point of fact since the List of Best-selling Music Artists is a <i>worldwide</i> list, that's not even an issue (RIAA only certifies the US). However, the RIAA sales data can be <i>cited</i> as a source, and even though their data "<i>could</i> be challenged", it usually isn't: these are the officially recognized bodies, after all. At some point, you have to stop believing in conspiracy theories and just go with official estimates. Deleting the entire list because you don't believe the RIAA numbers is kinda like saying "let's delete the Wikipedia articles on the U.S. Census, 'cause I <i>know</i> Philadelphia has more people than that!"--<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron">Firsfron</a> 10:49, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>^You're wrong there, Journalist, and you should read the wikipedia deletion policy: if a page is recreated several times after deletions, then it is kept because the fact that it is recreated proves that it is of interest... <a href="../../../n/y/c/User%7ENyco_1034.html" title="User:Nyco">Nyco</a> (<a href="../../../n/y/c/User_talk%7ENyco_b99c.html" title="User talk:Nyco">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nyco_9ab0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nyco">contribs</a>)

<li>^ Actually, the exact wording is "If an article is repeatedly re-created by unassociated editors after being deleted, this may be evidence of a need for an article". The policy does not say that the article is automaticall kept.

<li><b>Delete</b> As I said it needs to go.--Meanie 04:38, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, for two reasons: 1) The majority of people who want this article to be deleted have not put up a decent argument or good enough reason for its deletion. And 2) It is a decent list of best-selling artists that is useful in a historical context to the music industry. Most of the estimates can be researched and linked to actual sales of artists, although some are still slightly difficult to pin point it is still an article worth saving. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 22:37, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Create a new article say, Best-selling musicians in the United States, since the sales figures there are relatively verifiable through an official source, i.e., the <a href="../../../r/i/a/RIAA_104b.html" title="RIAA">RIAA</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>* These figures are rediculous. I am the biggest Oasis, Beatles and U2 fan going, I checked the RIAA, BPI and the European equivalent and no way have these artists sold so many based on certified awards. Oasis have sold 40 million based on certified awards. U2 is 90 million. Theres no point having this page if the info is incorrect. Mediatraffic also provided accurate information which refutes the information on this page. (Previous unsigned comment by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.37.10.44_e123.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.37.10.44">82.37.10.44</a>)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>* By far the worse article I have seen on Wikipedia based on the fact that none of the data is accurate and I assume that is what this community prides itself on.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>* Totally unaccurate.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>* Whoever said the RIAA usually isn't challenged is missing a point. So what if it's not usually challenged The fact remains their data is not solid fact. The RIAA flaws are easy to see in their sales fro Led Zeppelin. Since 1980, if we go by RIAA information this band, who havent had much chart action since then have somehow managed to have kept up in the sales leagues over the years with Madonna, Michael Jackson, Garth Brooks and Britney Spears, the top selling acts of their time, to keep moving back ahead of them on the all-time sellers list. I also find it funny how after Garth Brooks leaped ahead of Led Zeppelin with a after huge #1 album in 1997, Led Zeppelin suddenly sold enough records to go back up the list ahead of him. What is being suggested is we just take a "say so" figure from the "offical sources" like the RIAA just because they said so. How is that doing what this list is MEANT to do? It's not! Is that what Wikipedia is about? Not listing facts? Unless their is some magical place in America where Led Zeppelin records are selling non stop and billboard are unaware of it, then this proves that the RIAAs figures are just as much fiction as Harry Potter.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Valuable information that is not easy to find somewhere else. With a note that it can never be completely accurate. --<a href="../../../w/o/u/User%7EWouterstomp_b006.html" title="User:Wouterstomp">WS</a> 10:56, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> Some articles include a note like that, because figures are regularly changing but even they have a reliable source (say for movie box office totals from Exhibitor Relations). There's no such reliable source to track the music sales figures as they change. --70.27.20.140 18:28, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The arguments against this list being too narrowly Anglo- and Americocentric are specious. I note the presence of artists in the top 49 such as Nana Mouskouri, Mireille Mathieu, Alla Pugacheva, Wei Wei (韦唯), and a host of Indian artists all of whom are largely unknown in the United States and many of whom I speculate are poorly known in the UK. Yes, the list will have its faults and inaccuracies as figures are revised, but most of the acts here are legitimately top 500 acts worldwide, and the problems with the methodology and the accuracy of the sources is clearly laid out. --<a href="../../../r/c/h/User%7ERcharman_55dc.html" title="User:Rcharman">Craig</a> 20:38, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> with the caveat of putting a big(er) bolded disclaimer as to the list's accuracy and scientific merits (those being none at all). There's no need to remove information like this simply because there are inaccuracies; keep it up and it will become more accurate as new information becomes known. Just removing it is tantamount to censorship imo; most people will look on the page for entertainment purposes. Personally I find the list of countries of origin for the bands more interesting than sales figures, and that's another reason to keep it right there. The only real problem is deterring vandalism&#160;:/</li>

<li>[apparently] <b>Keep</b>. Im sorry I deleted everybodies responses about this topic but simply put, your bickering like a bunch of kids. Most of what you people say is not justified. Face it some of you are bias towards the topic [as stupid as that may sound] . Although I do admit that the "list" isnt 100% correct, but atleast there are links to web pages to where the author got this information. But my point is instead of bickering over the topic and wasting time we join together to recreate the page to make it a more accurate worldwide best sellers list that we all agree on and provide factuale evident to prove each response . After all this is wikipedia where were in control of the development of topics on this site. -- 18:29, 23 October 2005 70.128.143.78 [placed here instead of in blankout]</li>
