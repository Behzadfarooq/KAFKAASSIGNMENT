<li>I've worked extensively on this article in the past and most of it is <i>not</i> fancruft. Some past revisions of the article were <i>a lot</i> worse and basically summarized entire episodes of the show. There have been times when erroneous entries and information have been added and this is troubling because the content is unverifiable since there's not many credible sources about the article's content.

<li><b>Delete</b>: This is, apparently, a term and incomplete list of <i>non-appearing</i> characters on a TV show that appears to have fairly limited audience. (I mean that the UK folks seem to have never encountered it, and even the fannish Americans appear to be at a loss about it; suggesting that this is a Buena Vista syndication that just isn't being run.) This is not, as some have argued, a list of minor characters, but a list of minor characters below the minor characters (i.e. not phylum, but race). Far too narrow, too granular, too much of concern only within a fictional universe accessible to and of concern for only fans.

<li><b>Keep</b> I did not go to this high school but did grow up in Minnesota. This group is well known in the state and have even been documented on KARE 11 (about 10 years ago).

<p>MsMcMillan seeks noteriety with her blog... she does regular interviews for media outlets in Canada on the subject of blogging... she was recently quoted in at least 2 if not 3 mainstream daily publications in a contreversey surrounding <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Emery_f930.html" title="Marc Emery">Marc Emery</a></p>
<p>The real problem is Ms.McMillan does not like not having control over her own public relations.</p>
<p>She has made the comments that were attributed to her, re Angolans in Africa and Aboriginals, and their children needing to be "locked up" or put into <a href="../../../r/e/s/Residential_schools.html" title="Residential schools">residential schools</a></p>
<p>FWIW... I think racism, such as Ms.McMillan exhibits over and over again.. (see various discussions about her over at the Cannabis Culture Forum) needs to be documented and discussed, and people in Canada should be aware of what they are getting when they vote for a party of people who openly condone and support racists.</p>
<p>If there is anything factually incorrect with the entry about Ms.McMillan then she should be free to edit the entry like every other Wikipedian... and not just wipe out her contreversial statements when they cause her a problem, which they seem to be doing, as more media in the last week were alerted to her Angolan comments and various comments about Canada's indigenous people.</p>
<p>Lastly... what is Mike Brock and <a href="../../../e/z/r/Ezra_Levant_a7a6.html" title="Ezra Levant">Ezra Levant</a> doing with entries... when Ms.McMillan is not? Perhaps some of the progressive bloggers might be induced to comment on this. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomena_a0a6.html" title="User:Somena">Somena</a> 05:04, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. According to the Truth Laid Bear ratings, the Small Dead Animals blog is at least semi-notable with 3930 visits a day and 113th in links so there is a case for it staying. However, the article needs to seriously cleaned up in terms of NPOV and wider significance needs to be shown. User Somena seems to have serious POV problems in relation to this article. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 05:50, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Somena is most likely correct when she says that we are voting on this VfD because McMillan "does not like not having control over her own public relations". Alexa rank is negligible (&gt;100,000), but McMillan seems to be notable -- "Ms. McMillan was called an "inspiring friend" by conservative MP Monte Solberg, the opposition finance critic. She is the paid administrator of "The Shotgun", the on-line blog of the hard-right-of-center magazine Western Standard." Other reasons for notability are discussed on starblind's talk page, it seems. Having just tried to broker a compromise between warring bloggers, I sympathise with those who will have to negotiate between the blog-warring factions here. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 06:51, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep, but less NPOV</b> McMillan passes the notability test. She is on the radio alot (more than Mike Brock, another Canadian blogger who went through VfD and remained). She also seems to be quoted in the newspaper alot as a "blogging authority." Editors should also keep in mind the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">Systemic Bias</a> that has been identified in Wikipedia against entries that are non-American.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have actually been to this blog, which in and of itself practically makes this wikiworthy, given the minutely small number of blogs I have ever bothered to read. I am troubled, however, that the entry is currently being used to promote an anti-Tory political agenda - per <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomena_a0a6.html" title="User:Somena">Somena</a> and her assertions - which is an outright violation. If its stands as is, with its baiting content (the Solberg quote is loaded, as is the controversy) - i.e. no one is willing to bother to rewerite it as part of this AfD process, then it should be <b>Deleted</b> until it is authored in a manner that conforms to NPOV, or else merged to the cdn blogger list. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 01:44, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. McMillan seems quite convinced of her notability in this newspaper article: <a href="http://www.canada.com/saskatoon/starphoenix/news/story.html?id=9d1e977f-5add-43eb-a5ea-4c8ad0e9f494" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.canada.com/saskatoon/starphoenix/news/story.html?id=9d1e977f-5add-43eb-a5ea-4c8ad0e9f494" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<p><br />
(note on JTK3 commentator above, Mr.John T Kennedy and his wife Lynnette Warren's only contribution to Wikipedia prior to this entry has been to vandalize a page dealing with Somena. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Somena&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=21403200" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Somena&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=21403200" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://notreason.blogspot.com/2005/08/apple-dumpling-no-treason-gang-strikes.html" class="external text" title="http://notreason.blogspot.com/2005/08/apple-dumpling-no-treason-gang-strikes.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> )</p>
<p>Why is it *anti-tory* to point out what this woman has said including links to the comments and screen captures to prove she said it. Monte Solberg doesn't have a problem with people knowing about his relationship/inspiring friendship with her... or that it is well known... he has on 3 separate occasions promoted her blog on his website, and also in an interview by <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogging_Tories_edf8.html" title="Blogging Tories">Blogging Tories</a> Blog Alliance owner <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Taylor_550b.html" title="Stephen Taylor">Stephen Taylor</a> which was podcast on the internet.</p>
<p>If the Tories are comfortable with somebody like McMillan in their ranks, it seems a little unreasonable for them say people drawing attention to their involvement, association and promotion of this woman is "unfair" or partisan.</p>
<p>I personally don't vote. I don't belong to any politcal party. I'm actually libertarian... and I could care less which political party is running the country... they are all crooks as far as I am concerned. But I do think Canadians should be able to see the kinds of views and positions of "tories" who openly advocate these sorts of things on-line and be made aware of what they are voting for, and what they can expect from these people if they should ever achieve power.</p>
<p>For instance... would it be "NPOV" to build an entry about former Canadian Alliance MP <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Pankiw" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Pankiw" rel="nofollow">Jim Pankiw</a> , who made several remarkable derogatory comments about Aboriginals among other things? What about to draw reference to Stephen Harper's infamous remarks about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Harper" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Harper" rel="nofollow">contreversial</a> "Atlantic Canada" or the Firewall around Albert? Is it NPOV to have an entry about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svend_Robinson" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svend_Robinson" rel="nofollow">Svend Robinson's</a> shoplifting? Would it be wrong to have an entry about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ahenakew" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ahenakew" rel="nofollow">David Ahenakew's</a> anti-semetic remarks? Would it be NPOV to have a mention on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Malkin" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Malkin" rel="nofollow">Michelle Malkin's</a> entry, about her defence of internment for Japanese?</p>
<p>No. It wouldn't and it isn't See all the entries above. These are remarkable events, and remarkable commentaries by various personalities who crave noteriety and drawing attention to themselves.</p>
<p>McMillan says on her own blogpage that the reason she chooses a "dead gopher" on her website graphic is because it's a reminder to people that she is not afraid of saying offensive things. In fact, that's a big part of why she blogs according to interviews she has given... she enjoys saying contreversial and un-politically correct things. Context is important in all this.</p>
<p>Yes... my entry on McMillan is biased. If somebody wants to present the information about her in a non-biased format... that's what Wikipedia does and is for i.e. several people add and subtract, delete and modify until the page is the most correct and neutral. But notice that's not what the subject <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kate_McMillan_bb96.html" title="Kate McMillan">Kate McMillan</a> wants. She wants the facts about her to not be referrenced or linked to. She wants to have all control over what is being said about her. And if she can't have it that way... she demands that nobody say anything about her at all. Now considering McMillan's recent remarks on her blog about <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Emery_f930.html" title="Marc Emery">Marc Emery</a>, and how she went out of her way to make sure that as many people as possible found out about contreversial statements by Mr.Emery, I find it remarkable that she would object to getting the same treatment, because of her own contreversial remarks.</p>

<dd>A brief riposte. Some of your points cited as supporting examples I agree with, but then I think we are dealing with something that is different in both kind and specie. Ahenakew, for example, was elevated to the Order of Canada, and then expelled after his anti-semitic remarks. In an encyclopedic treatment of Ahenakew, therefore, that is important. Your other examples are equally disingenuous. Robinson was an elected MP (hence notable) and resigned due to the incident you mentioned. All the others are MPs, too, for that matter. Ms. McMillan is <i>barely noteworthy at all</i>. To single out her comments about race, etc... is, in my view, very tendentious since it implies a notability through controversy which does not exist. Also, a small point, but why should anyone be coming here for political commentary at all. Pour la politesse aux autres, you may wish to respond to any direct points on my talk page, instead of clogging up the AfD. Fwiw, I vote Bloc, so I am not being an apologist here.&#160;;) <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 03:32, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Subject has several things of note to name outside of being a BB contestant. Subject is extremely popular.

<li><b>Keep</b> certainly keep at least until and if she's evicted.

<li>Lets see... there's Marcellas Reynolds, Will Wikle, and Alisun Irwin to name a few.

Kaysar's (the only one more popular than her this season) been on a soap so far after the show and is in talks about a possible spot on The Amazing Race. CBS isn't exactly stupid when it finds popular folks (See Rupert or Rob and Amber). I'll also note the season isn't even over yet and although the odds are against her, she may yet win.--<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFiredrake_f9df.html" title="User:Firedrake">Firedrake</a> 19:59, 3 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Alisun and her boyfirend were on Amazing Race. Will writes on the CBS BB site as well as a few other reality TV sites. I'll grant you that if you aren't a BB fanatic you probably won't hear a lot about many of the non-winners. My main point is that neither of us would probably claim to hold the final ord on celebrity. I would say that she's known to enough folks and has done enough to earn her a few kbytes in Wiki. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFiredrake_f9df.html" title="User:Firedrake">Firedrake</a> 22:41, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

On Altavista I found only 5 listings that were actually about Mr. Wall, two of which were blank pages, one was a old newspaper article reviewing a stage show produced by Mr. Breck's shows and the rest were just spam keyword use.

<dd>Oh, we most certainly agree on that. My only concern here is with the careful use of CSD; if improperly used it will simply prolong the deletion of vanity/inappropriate articles from WP, as these will likely be targetted for undelete/re-AfD campaigns, purely for "process" reasons. That's not necessarily a bad thing — it's important to protect the integrity of WP's policies such as they are — but I think all of us can agree it's better to be careful with the rules in the first place and avoid such situations.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000066">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="red"><sup>ζ</sup></font></a>&#160; 04:35:09, 2005-09-02 (UTC)

<p>The result of the debate was <b>KEEP</b>. Since we prevail on placing articles at the most common usage, and the companies website itself refers to it as KTF, I'm not going to move it myself. I will, however, create the full-name as a redirect.

<li><b>Comment</b>. It's a very poorly written article. As it stands, it is a two-paragraph summary of the company's alleged business dealings. Complete contravention of the NPOV policy: everything written about it is from the company's point of view. What do its competitors think of the company? How do its customers feel about it? Any studies on customer satisfaction? If so, how well has it done? Who do the governments, local and national, think about it? Has it had legal troubles? What is its economic history? What role has it played in its industry? Is it merely one of several players? Are those claims about its finances accurate? Why is it <i>notable</i>, aside from having a lot of customers, which is something millions and millions of companies around the world have? What particular notability has it a claim to that warrants mention in an encyclopedia? The fact that it introduced ring tones (I don't know, I'm just asking, as that seems to be the only claim of uniqueness I can see)? These questions pertain to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Next, we have questions pertaining to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. To write a good encyclopedia article, the subject must be eminently verifiable from multiple reputable, independent sources. What sources were used to write this article? I see links to the company website. What primary or secondary sources were used to write this work? Or <i>can</i> be used by us if we wish to expand it? Do any exist? WP articles cannot be products of original research, they must be based on multiple reputable primary or secondary sources. See <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Like thousands of other articles currently on WP, this one seems to contravene some major WP policies and guidelines. Problem is what to do with articles that <i>may</i> indeed be about a notable subject (and this one may well be, I don't know; not enough is said about it for one to know), but which are in their present state really weak (and will likely always be weak)? After studying the policies, it seems to me this conundrum is open to interpretation, and is in fact the source of much dispute on AfD. My vote here is to <b>delete</b> (mainly because I think it will be near impossible for WP editors to source the material (what exists, that is) to write a good article per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>), but equally many well-meaning editors will vote the other way.

<li>I can't speak for everyone, but I certainly don't blame family members for things done by someone else (someone who's now dead, in fact).

<li>He worked for a few years as a journalist for TASS, the Russian news agency. Hardly surprising that the KGB was interested in him. This does not make him a spy as the author anonymously claims. Ed6061 14:51, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Krafsur was never convicted nor charged with espionage. The biographer is clearly on a mission. Here he applies highly severe judgment based on a few interpretatively disputatious intercepts. He ignores the legitimacy of being a TASS employee in wartime when the USSR was an ally. He persists in anonymity. His subject has been dead for twenty two years. The biography will cause further harm to the Krafsur name simply by association, as has indeed happened.Ekrafsur 15:07, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Incorrect. A URL refers to <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Krafsur_6923.html" title="Samuel Krafsur">Samuel Krafsur</a> as "KGB Agent" but the referenced document only suggests that he might be a source for other contacts. Furthermore the only issue at dispute is whether Krafsur was a "spy". The idea of his being an actual "KGB Agent" is totally farfetched. It seems likely that the URL heading is in fact a mistake, unless of course someone can point to a specific document that show otherwise. Jdivine 06:44, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>The URL you refer to starts with "<a href="http://www.nsa.gov/venona/" class="external free" title="http://www.nsa.gov/venona/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nsa.gov/venona/</a>" in other words, the <i>web page</i> at that URL (i.e. not the image of the old message, but the HTML file listing all those images) <i>is</i> a US Government document, one associated with the NSA archives, which does indeed refer to "KGB Agent Samuel Krafsur". It might be incorrect, but it <i>is</i> a <i>fact</i> that a formal US government document refers to him that way, and it's entirely appropriate to include that fact in an article about him. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 14:50, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article as written is indeed pejorative. For crying out loud, under Extenal Links we have "Spying on America." The Venona documents listed do discuss IDE but make no indication that the information gathered from him was covertly obtained. Indeed, as a journalist he would likely run across interesting tidbits of information from time to time. And as an employee of the TASS news agency Krafsur would have undoubtedly spoken from time to time with various Soviet government functionaries, some of whom were likely covert KGB. This does not make him a "spy." And frankly, if you caveat and footnote this article enough to make it "fair," it becomes clear that Krafsur is not a figure with enough historical importance to warrant his own biography. Also I note in the talk page for this topic and in their biographies that Nobs and Dwain appear to be on a bizarre quest to rehabilitate the image of Joe McCarthy. This would tend to lend a slant to their "POV" on topics such as these. Jdivine 07:36, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>If he was just "a journalist", why does an intelligence officer of the NKGB say (in the message of 17 May 1944) "we propose to use him", when he was <i>already</i> a TASS employee at that point?

<li>The page referenced reads "... we propose to use an employee of the Editorial Office ... for cultivating newspapermen's circles ..." This "cultivation" seems something a mere journalist or an employee of the TASS news agency would not normally be "used" for. The statement is somewhat ambigous, but seems to be a suggestion that names of potential "sources" might be gleaned from this man. Jdivine 04:03, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>While I agree that visibility to Google can vary from subject to subject and should not be used in borderline cases, a subject with no google hits at all (or, as in this case, only hits from Wikipedia and Wikipedia mirrors) is simply not notable. The extra Yahoo hits you referred to, note, seem to be because Yahoo is poorer at recognizing Wikipedia mirrors; flipping quickly through them, it seems that everything there is just the same few Wikipedia pages repeated over and over from different mirrors. That is a bad thing; when the Google search results on a subject turn up nothing but Wikipedia entries, it's a safe bet that someone is trying to use Wikipedia to push a non-notable subject into notability.

<dd>I don't doubt the value of your research into the Venona decrypts; but I'm still not comfortable with the idea of using Wikipedia for information that has not yet become generally accepted. I think it would be better if you published your conclusions with regard to his importance elsewhere first, outside of an encyclopedia; if he's as important as you concluded in those links, it will not take long for your conclusions to become widely-known enough to use as the basis for a Wikipedia article on him. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 04:40, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thanks, Doc. I also managed to verify it. It is referred to as Huntington High, and there were two colored schools in Newport News, this one and George Washington Carver, separated by a railroad track. At least one former Branch President of the NAACP went there, Flora Crittenden (one newspaper says it was Carver, but an official Virginia House bill thanking delegate Crittenden for her service says it was Huntington). So let's see, segregated black school in the South, closed when segregation ended. This has history coming out of its lugholes. <b>Keep and expand</b>.

<li>Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I guess I'm more partial to getting things done the quicker way. Anyways, don't get us wrong Mr. Davis, we're thrilled you want to contribute. Just that this is not the kind of article Wikipedia is looking for. Oh, and I agree with the userfying, but now that it's done, how about a redirect to his user page? —<a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMessedrocker_53b5.html" title="User:Messedrocker"><b>M</b><small><b>ESSED</b></small><b>R</b><small><b>OCKER</b></small></a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/e/s/User_talk%7EMessedrocker_915e.html" title="User talk:Messedrocker">talk</a>)</small> 17:10, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>yet another comment</b> As Mr. Burns would say... Excellent! I had already left a message on the user talk page, but when I userfied the page, I messed that up, since I didnt rename, I just cut-and-pasted the code, since there had not been a lot of revisions to the page.

(You could make a really informative article on those fights <i>alone.</i> Lots of interesting stuff.) <i>Mambo's descentants</i> (Mambo, Mambo's GPL version, and now this travestry) are being <i>used</i> on zillions of sites. There's no way to deny that. What they want to <i>call</i> that codebase any particular day, well, that's an issue that just has to wait. So, I would rather vote for merge to either this article or the other, or keep both. If people take the "kill them both, let God sort them out" attitude, that's <i>a bit</i> too harsh in my opinion. --<a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">Wwwwolf</a> 23:50, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

The forum at [<a href="http://forum.opensourcematters.org" class="external text" title="http://forum.opensourcematters.org" rel="nofollow">Open Source Matters</a>] has had 3211 members join in three weeks, so don't tell me Joomla! doesn't have a large number of people following. I think it is Wikipedia worthy. Furthermore, I don't see why the article should be deleted because it list features, <a href="../../../x/o/o/XOOPS_4751.html" title="XOOPS">XOOPS</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/p/PHP-Nuke_838d.html" title="PHP-Nuke">PHP-Nuke</a>, and <a href="../../../e/1/0/E107_%28software%29.html" title="E107 (software)">E107</a> all list their features and those aren't candidates for deletion. I think this <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> just doesn't like Mambo or Joomla! because he nominated both of these articles for deletion, yet other open source CMS articles haven't been nominated for deletion. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoffman11_6e5a.html" title="User:Shoffman11">Shoffman11</a> 19:18, September 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but don't merge - Joomla! is not the new name of Mambo they are separate products. While Joomla 1.0 will to a large degree be the same as the current Mambo release the two projects will diverge into separate products in the (near) future. This article is being updated and no longer looks like an advertisement. It just needs a little TLC. To delete this would be wrong as Joomla! will be a major player in the CMS world and no other CMS has been put up for deletion. Johnny Boy 08:55 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete and salt the earth</b>: Advertising. That's all we need: advertising.

<li>What do you mean "current format?" At this moment in time, it's back to advertising. If you're asking that we revert to the cleanest version, then protect it, just so that we can preserve a mention of Yet Another Open Source Program (and a management one at that), I think that's too much, too far. Feature lists are not content. Claims about how it will solve all my problems are not encyclopedic. Concentrate on the few facts, on the significance. If there isn't any, then realize that an <i>encyclopedia</i> is not the right place for this. 02:32, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep, and don't merge.</b> I agree with Stephanos Geogios John immediately above me. In fact, Wikipedia has the unique abiilty to be the <i>best</i> &#160; way to compare and contrast CMS software due to the rigorous community input. Including this type of software should not be discouraged on Wikipedia; it should in fact be encouraged. Also, forks in open source projects are extremely important. It is highly likely that the two packages will quickly begin to become sufficiently different to force users to have to look <i>somewhere</i> (I think it ought to be here) to find a careful articulation of the differences between the forks. Thus, don't combine. (Oh, and of all types of open source projects to include, it seems CMS systems are pretty important, given the number of people / companies who build sites using them.) <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatsonjay_f372.html" title="User:Batsonjay">Batsonjay</a> 04:12, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>: Utter tosh. "Arts" + "towns" will get loads of Google hits, just like "cockroach" + "towns" will. "Arts towns" is a particular guide's terminology, and it's monstrously irregular in formation (see "steel town" and "mining town," above). The "history" section is a POV fountain. The "reference" section is a flat dump of tour guides. Finally, this is duplicate material, and marginally literate duplicate material at that.

<li>My name is Timbur-Helgi Hermannsson, neologistic poet of the High Icelandic language movement. There are different terms for linguistic purism that are used by linguists but you can't find them in encyclopedias. there's regressive purism, which means that very old loan-words are replaced (very rare form), revolutionary purism is when a large part of the vocabulary in a language is replaced by neologisms in a very short time (The only example is the Turkish language reform lead by Kemal atatûrk). trimming purism is a terminvented by the linguist George thomas. It designates languages that sometimes undergo a puristic wave when the influence of other languages is threatening. These are no established terms. But Ultrapurism is a clear description of what High Icelandic is about. There is no better term for it. The members of the High Icelandic langauge council use the Icelandic translation of ultrapurism (málgjörhreinsun).</li>

<li>Yes, <a href="../../../j/o/o/Joomla%21.html" title="Joomla!">Joomla!</a> is new, but Mambo (CMS) was created over a year ago, in April 2004, and has been growing more, not less, ad-like ever since. That's what "working" on it has meant so far. Do you think Joomla! is likely to fare differently, really? But they will both have at least 5 days now on Articles for Deletion, maybe somebody/some people watching this page will dig in and {{sofixit}}. Improvements while on AfD are invited and welcomed, and they have often been known to save articles. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 08:09, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - An article about a product is not automatically an advertisement. This article <i>is</i> substandard, but worth keeping and improving. Also, Mambo has an immense install base, where as Joomla! is only a rebranding (at this point), it would make far more sense to keep this article and just raise the quality. Couldn't the request for deletion be changed to a plea for rewriting?--Choz 07:27, September 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>
