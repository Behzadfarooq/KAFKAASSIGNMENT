<li><b>Keep</b> He is a significant person within Mormon apologists. Several Mormon related pages refer to the article. It is a stub, but not (IMHO) really a vanity page. I rewrote the page, adding more detail than the original. I don't know the person, and have no connection to him. I added the article because I believe he is noteworthy. <a href="../../../w/r/p/User%7EWrp103_3edd.html" title="User:Wrp103">wrp103 (Bill Pringle)</a> 03:09, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Obvious Delete</b> There haven't really been any changes since the last one that make it worthy of a Wikipedia entry. Most of the links on "web references" aren't even notable enough either to be on a wikipedia page. That's like listing all the webpages that have references to CNN. Hmm...maybe I should reference my own webpage under the CNN website? Also, this was deleted previously.

<li><s><b>Delete</b> per nom.</s> There's way to much vanity fluff/website promotion in this article. Also, where is the notability here? Apologies if I am missing something, but isn't this just a chemist who moonlights as a blogger? The guy who writes those Dexter books, on the other hand, he is notable IMO. - DaveG12345 01:18, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The above was my original comment on this topic, but it's moved here now for technical reasons, so have reposted it intact. Just to elaborate, the article doesn't, to me, really make clear what this person is notable for. There is a lot of introductory fluff of no relevance to their supposed notability, then the blogging material at the end which seems more like an advert for the website. Just MHO at this stage. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 04:01, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I read the comments - they were complaining a year ago:
<blockquote>
<p>If there is anything of substance here except self-promotion, let us see it. I say this not out of a negative view, but I see little evidence here of value. I shouldn't have to go to his website to know what he is about- and that seems like what the article is seeking to do. It looks more like a personal webpage than an encyclopedia article.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - give the stub time to fill out. Someone who holds 65 US patents should at least have a stub. He is notable, much moreso than many wikipedia entries.

<li><b>Keep</b> I guess I must be missing a distinction between notable and those who are not and more importantly who determines this issue. Some of the articles that we have on WIKI are truly useless; think of all the articles on small towns of no significance, or those on episodes of TV series, or about people who have done absolutely nothing except play one inning of professional baseball. Now we have a fellow who is very active in the religious sector and he is insignificant???

<li><b>Reply</b> - 35 U.S.C. 102(f) requires that the true inventors, and only the true inventors, of an invention are named as inventors on the patent. If someone is named who is not an inventor, it could invalidate or otherwise limit the enforceability of the patent; if someone who materially contributed to the invention is not named as an inventor, and later found to have been a true co-inventor, they have full independent rights to the patent, including the right to license away to a competitor unfettered joint rights to the patent; which they have been known to do, to very great remuneration. Either way, millions of dollars often ride on naming the inventors accurately; it is a big deal. This is not like a senior professor plugging his name onto his students' research articles. The distinction implied above is without a difference. And for anyone, 86 patents is extraordinary territory. Note also, that <b><a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&amp;r=0&amp;p=1&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;Query=in%2Flindsay-jeff%24&amp;d=PG01" class="external text" title="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&amp;r=0&amp;p=1&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;Query=in%2Flindsay-jeff%24&amp;d=PG01" rel="nofollow">he is also named on 107 pending patent applications</a></b>, at least most of which can be expected to become issued patents in the next few years - and those are only the ones that have been pending at least 18 months.

<li><b>Rejoinder</b> Thank you. I don't see how that addresses my point. It is notoriously easy to get a U.S. patent, with approval rates estimated to be <a href="http://jip.kentlaw.edu/art/volume%204/4-1-4.htm" class="external text" title="http://jip.kentlaw.edu/art/volume%204/4-1-4.htm" rel="nofollow">upward of 75%</a>, so with corporate funding I mostly see someone who, as the corporate patent strategist, has his mind set on getting as many patents as possible, for reasons possibly more <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/p/wpa/wuwple/0303005.html" class="external text" title="http://ideas.repec.org/p/wpa/wuwple/0303005.html" rel="nofollow">strategic</a> than scientific.

<li><b>Re-rejoinder (???)</b> - Hey man, where would civilization be without wet wipes dispensing technologies?&#160;:-) While not all patents are on par with inventing laser or warp drive, but looking only at issue rate per application masks the self-limiting layers of in-house counsel, managers, and outside counsel deciding whether or not an engineer's submission for a patent application is likely enough to be passed to be worth the mound of cash and the years of effort to apply. A lot of would-be applicants are counseled - even by their outside attorney (including myself) - that their idea is not likely to get an issued patent. In short, I don't think the arguments for minimizing the accomplishment of a guy with 86 patents and over 100 more in the pipeline hold much water, and I think that in itself satisfies notability. There are a number of astronauts who list a single or a handful of patents on their bios alongside their spaceflight experience. Ray Kurzweil is famous as an inventor, and he holds <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;Query=in%2Fkurzweil-ray%24" class="external text" title="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;Query=in%2Fkurzweil-ray%24" rel="nofollow">15 patents</a> and <a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&amp;r=0&amp;p=1&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;Query=in%2Fkurzweil-ray%24&amp;d=PG01" class="external text" title="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&amp;r=0&amp;p=1&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;Query=in%2Fkurzweil-ray%24&amp;d=PG01" rel="nofollow">37 published pending patent applications</a>.

<li><b>Re³joinder</b> My point is mostly about the very limited value of patent counts. Patents are a massive <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_tail.html" title="Long tail">long tail</a> story, with only a tiny fraction creating the bulk of value. I'm a bit disinclined to buy the in-house controls argument if the subject himself is in control of the process. I should amend my comment above though by noting that the decorative elements seem to be about the riffles on toilet paper and paper towels rather than feminine hygiene products. If there is a patent among the bunch that received significant outside attention, I'm willing to reconsider. On sheer counts, I'm not. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 19:37, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

I guarantee you, he does not have unfettered rights to pour the company's money into a collection of vanity patents for himself. If they are anything like other F500 companies, there is a big department of in-house patent attorneys and managers taking a long, hard look at every thousand dollars being spent and deciding whether the likely benefit to the company of each patent application is worth the expense, with the knowledge that only a tiny fraction of patents are ever useful for litigation. So, again, I don't think it's apt to minimize the notability of one researcher with that many patents. - <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReaverdrop_37ac.html" title="User:Reaverdrop"><b>Reaverdrop</b></a> <small><font color="green">(<a href="../../../r/e/a/User_talk%7EReaverdrop_ce3e.html" title="User talk:Reaverdrop">talk</a>/<a href="../../../../nl/r/e/a/Gebruiker%7EReaverdrop_a5b4.html" class="extiw" title="nl:Gebruiker:Reaverdrop">nl</a>/<a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPACE_cbae.html" title="WP:SPACE">w:s</a>)</font></small> 19:57, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I left the stub template in the rewritten article because I realized it was a first stab at a new article. Since then, Trödel has greatly improved the article, so it can probably be removed by now, although there is more work to be done (like Criticsm). BTW - the guy is a chemical engineer, specializing in things to do with wood pulp who works for a paper company. Chances are his patents aren't going to be glamorous and exciting to those of us who don't appreciate the wonders of paper.;^) He did have two "best article" awards from a trade magazine, and co-winner of a "Best Technical Paper" from a professional institute, which sounds like professional recognition. <a href="../../../w/r/p/User%7EWrp103_3edd.html" title="User:Wrp103">wrp103 (Bill Pringle)</a> 02:47, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Lindsay is famous for polemically dismissing anything not faith-promoting to Mormonism, and his scientific expertise is often touted by his followers in this regard, who represent a fundamentalist faction within Mormonism, unyielding in their literalism. So Wikipedia is touting his scientific expertise for these followers without precedent, thus giving his controversial and unrelated apologetics added weight. Here is the problem explained, from a Mormon researcher: <i>My particular interest is Missouri Mormon History. Of this time ( 1831 - 1838 ), I concentrate on 1838. The 1838 Mormon War in Missouri - This is THE definitive book on the 1838 period, and is a must read for any student to the topic. Please note that Jeff Lindsay has written an unkind rebuttal of this book, and I fully dismiss Lindsay's work here as almost totally inaccurate. For an alternative to LeSueur's work, see Alex Baugh's A Call to Arms: The 1838 Mormon Defense of Northern Missouri. I know both authors personally, and they are two of the best historians in the field. Bro. Lindsay has done a disservice to his church in this area - he would be best advised to read Baugh's book, and follow his example. A full bibliography of the Missouri period can be found at the bottom of this page. For a rather complete chronology of 1838 Missouri, see 1838 Chronology, o this site. <a href="http://www.tungate.com/Missouri_1838.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.tungate.com/Missouri_1838.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tungate.com/Missouri_1838.htm</a></i> Anon166 15:50, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Trodel, yours is merely an argument for including anything. Whether or not it can be neutral is another question.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I notice that the resume-esque bullet points have been removed from the article. It's a good start, but everything I'm reading just seems so unremarkable and not NPOV. Allow me to illustrate: It says that he interrupted his time at BYU for a mission thing. That's great, but it's a <i>normal</i> thing for LDS members to do. For instance, the claim that he is a "prolific" inventor wreaks of NPOV issues. Looking at the article, I just find it extremely hard to justify its inclusion in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="maroon"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font>talk</font></b></a></sup> 18:30, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>First the article should decide what it wants to be. As a corporate executive, the subject is wildly non-notable. As a former academic, he seems to fail <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>. As an inventor, he doesn't seem to be anywhere near <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;RS=IN%2FLemelson-Jer%24&amp;Refine=Refine+Search&amp;Query=in%2FLemelson-Jerome%24" class="external text" title="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;RS=IN%2FLemelson-Jer%24&amp;Refine=Refine+Search&amp;Query=in%2FLemelson-Jerome%24" rel="nofollow">the top</a>.

Which would make this a very <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">POV</a> undertaking which should be deleted with prejudice.

<li><b>Response</b> I admit I didn't do a good job of the initial rewrite. (I'm better at tweaking than creating), but the discussion should be based on the topic, not the quality of the article.</li>
<li>Everyone's milage may vary, but the LDS DNA article isn't (IMHO) the most important thing he did. What makes it unique, is that it is the only paper that the official church web site references. (lds.org usually limits references to articles to top church leaders.) What he is best known for (for good and bad) is a variety of papers in the anti-mormon field. As I mentioned earlier, if you google "anti-mormon", his site shows up on the first page. That should indicate he is notable within <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Mormonism_32bf.html" title="Anti-Mormonism">Anti-Mormonism</a>. The next question would be "Is anti-mormonism notable?" If the answer is yes, then it seems that Jeff Lindsay is noteable. If the answer is no, then the answer would be no. His page is linked to from <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Mormonism_32bf.html" title="Anti-Mormonism">Anti-Mormonism</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormon_apologetics.html" title="Mormon apologetics">Mormon apologetics</a>, and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Mormonism_77f4.html" title="Criticism of Mormonism">Criticism of Mormonism</a>, which lends credence to him being known among Mormons. Now, granted, if you aren't a Mormon, a former Mormon, an Anti-Mormon, or a friend of a Mormon, that may not mean much. But does that make it non-notable?</li>
<li>I also should point out that <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_L_Rattigan_f48b.html" title="User:David L Rattigan">David L Rattigan</a> has greatly stripped down the article, so I would encourage people to look at it again. <a href="../../../w/r/p/User%7EWrp103_3edd.html" title="User:Wrp103">wrp103 (Bill Pringle)</a> 22:16, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I have radically revised the article, excising a lot of the irrelevant stuff that was making it look like a vanity article.

<li><b>Comment</b> High praise for David for cutting it down to size and removing the more blatant vanity elements. On the notability of his LDSDNA engagement, the problem is that the LDS webpage has to be seen as a partisan site in the debate, so what really matters is 1. whether the opposing site takes his arguments seriously enough to engage him in a debate, and 2. whether this spills over to a forum where I as an outsider could possibly be informed by it. For instance the LA Times article is good evidence that the debate is of interest to outsiders, but since Lindsay isn't mentioned in it it gives no testimony of his role. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> brings up the issue of undue weight, and if it isn't established that he holds a central role in the debate (outside web forums, which are almost never encyclopedic), this article could be seen as a POV fork. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 23:36, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, absolutely. Patent discussions aside, I agree that Lindsay is notable as an LDS apologist — I've become very familiar with his work both as a Mormon and after leaving the church (and know many others who read him that have nothing to do with Wikipedia, Anon). For the record, I've communicated with him via email in a (suspended) effort to fill this article out some, and he was surprised that it had been written — he did not author any part of it. For those voting delete as vanity, be careful to not equate an unfamiliarity with the subject at hand with identifying it as vanity. <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/j/User_talk%7ETijuana_Brass_8109.html" title="User talk:Tijuana Brass">¡Épa!</a></sup></b> 07:14, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Absent <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable outside sources</a> the subject is simply someone who is vocal on his webpage and on discussion groups but with zero news hits (even Utah or Wisconsin local news) simply lacks the outside standing of a <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phillip_E._Johnson_ce75.html" title="Phillip E. Johnson">Phillip E. Johnson</a> to be the public face of the apologist position in this debate.

<dl>
<dd>I must confess I'm confused about what is needed for retention. For my initial rewrite, I added lots of references, which caused several people to call it a vanity page. Then it got stripped down to mainly apologetics, and now it is too narrow.</dd>
<dd>So far, we have identified:
<ul>
<li>Two books that reference his site, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1568582838&amp;id=Iy-F3Dg3LccC&amp;pg=PA616&amp;lpg=PA616&amp;dq=jeff+lindsay&amp;sig=WtncZxe9fuVQVUJ3V2cVPy5tFlo" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1568582838&amp;id=Iy-F3Dg3LccC&amp;pg=PA616&amp;lpg=PA616&amp;dq=jeff+lindsay&amp;sig=WtncZxe9fuVQVUJ3V2cVPy5tFlo" rel="nofollow">one for religion</a>, and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1411646746&amp;id=ZyhxhPLnqNYC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;lpg=PA201&amp;dq=%22jeff+lindsay%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;sig=WbMiTE_pAe0ZbhQCEpD9OAT8z9g" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1411646746&amp;id=ZyhxhPLnqNYC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;lpg=PA201&amp;dq=%22jeff+lindsay%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;sig=WbMiTE_pAe0ZbhQCEpD9OAT8z9g" rel="nofollow">one for magic</a>.</li>
<li>Two professional organizations (<a href="http://www.tappi.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.tappi.org/" rel="nofollow">TAPPI</a> and American Paper Institute - now AF&amp;PA) cited his works for best technical papers</li>
<li>He served as director of AIChE Forest Products Division from 1989 to 1995</li>
<li>If you search for "Anti-Mormon" on google, his web site appears on the first page of hits.</li>
<li>Brittanica.com and USA Today each spotlighted his site as a "Hot Site" and "one of the best on the Internet when reviewed for quality, accuracy of content, presentation and usability" respectively. The site has received various other awards and recognitions.</li>
<li>The educators' magazine, <a href="http://www.edweek.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.edweek.org/" rel="nofollow">Education Week</a>, ran a story on Oct. 3, 2001 discussing his <a href="http://www.jefflindsay.com/Block.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.jefflindsay.com/Block.shtml" rel="nofollow">Block Scheduling site</a>.</li>
<li>BYU Chemical Engineering Dept. designated him as the outstanding alumnus for 2004</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>It seems to me that the above list indicates he is notable within apologetics (at least for the lds.org article and high ranking by google on "Anti-Mormon"), professionally (best papers, outstanding alumnus, and director of AIChE Forest Products Division, and the number of patents), general public visibility (USA Today and Brittanica.com), and other fields (e.g., Block Scheduling), so I'm not sure that he has not received any recognition outside of the world he is active in.</dd>
<dd>Can somebody clarify the issues at this point? <a href="../../../w/r/p/User%7EWrp103_3edd.html" title="User:Wrp103">wrp103 (Bill Pringle)</a> 00:25, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you go through your own list you'll notice that exactly one of your (non-blog/non-message board) sources is about his LDSDNA activities – the cite in a book that has probably 500 footnotes total. That is extremely meager. Everything else is essentially an <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">appeal to authority</a>, saying because he has done X his opinion on Y must be taken seriously. That's what <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> calls "undue weight". As I mentioned before, since Lindsay has no standing based on formal training his standing must be established by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">outside sources</a>. If he has been involved in a public debate on LDSDNA or has been cited by his adversaries, those are ways to establish his role. Magicianship and expertise in block scheduling aren't. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 00:42, 10 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>He doesn't even really have a good background in block scheduling. Most people in the education field who I've talked to regarding him consider his arguments to be pretty soft. --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Riley_1176.html" title="User:Adam Riley">Riley</a> 04:33, 10 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>One of the problems of finding outside sources from adversaries is that one of the characteristics of most anti-mormon literature is to ignore any apologetic material, and frame their arguments to imply that no counter-arguments have ever been expressed to their claims. This was recognized by two christian theologians in: Mosser, Carl and Owen, Paul (1997) in <a href="http://www.cometozarahemla.org/others/mosser-owen.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cometozarahemla.org/others/mosser-owen.html" rel="nofollow">Mormon Apologetic Scholarship and Evangelical Neglect: Losing the Battle and Not Knowing It?</a>.</dd>
<dd>The fact that his article appears on the official lds.org site is quite significant, indicating recognition from the apologetic side. This is a site that normally has only writings by high level church leaders and maybe faculty from church-sponsored schools and universities. Every article is carefully reviewed and given approval from high authorities before it is added to the web site, so his DNA article being there is a big deal.</dd>
<dd>As for block scheduling, it sounds like he is known (if not respected) in that field.</dd>
<dd>Let me be clear: I don't agree with much of his non-apologetic writings. He's a conservative and I'm a bleeding-heart liberal, and I think he is dead wrong on a lot of his opinions. Nevertheless, I have to admit that he is at least known in various circles. <a href="../../../w/r/p/User%7EWrp103_3edd.html" title="User:Wrp103">wrp103 (Bill Pringle)</a> 13:04, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have no idea whether this is true or not, but this very lack of discussion or outside reporting makes it clear that we have a problem with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. But in any case, unless there are other sources forthcoming I think we have discussed this from all sides and have to leave it to the closing administrator to decide whether the article can be kept. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 00:58, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you read the article I pointed to, you will see that at least the authors (who were not LDS, and in fact were on the anti-mormon side) believe that is one of the problems with their approach so far. This also illustrates how it is sometimes very difficult to teach people with no familiarity of a subject matter enough to make informed decisions. It reminds me a little of when people complain about not having reliable references for video games. The fact is, there really isn't many books written about video games, but the comments that appear in the articles I monitor do reflect the "general opinion", based on talking to others. If there isn't a clear answer, hopefully people will trust those who are more familiar with the topic.</dd>
<dd>I still don't understand why, if his web site shows up on the first page of a google search for "anti-mormon", how he can't be notable within that field. Is the problem that anti-mormonism isn't noteable? <a href="../../../w/r/p/User%7EWrp103_3edd.html" title="User:Wrp103">wrp103 (Bill Pringle)</a> 01:19, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I didn't read the full article but I noticed that they 1. don't mention Lindsay but 2. mention <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Nibley_f37e.html" title="Hugh Nibley">Hugh Nibley</a> as the "father of apologetic scholarship", i.e. someone who by academic standing has an article in WP. So I hav no idea if your claim is correct, and it isn't really my job to investigate. My job is to check whether we have sufficient reliable outside resources to write an unbiased article based solely on those sources, and my opinion is no, for reasons amply discussed above: no coverage in the media, no publications is reputable academic outlets, no discussion of his claims in those media. In other words, we are asked to give notability to someone who hasn't established notability for himself in the kinds of sources we consider reliable. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 01:37, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
