<li><b>Tentative keep</b> since I was one of the first to try and rescue this. I, too, was leaning toward a delete and it probably qualified as a speedy when it was first created. Admittedly, the school doesn't seem particularly notable and there was virtually no online info to back this up. If notability hasn't been fully established, it's because I can't find anything notable to say. &#160;:^) However, this has been really polished by users other than me and more than one user here is active in formatting and expanding school stubs. - Lucky 6.9 02:57, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>What happened to the guideline that articles should be noteworthy and encyclopedic?

<li>Schools are generally regarded as eminently noteworthy. I don't know about your country, but my country has lists of the institutions and sends inspectors round. We spend billions of pounds maintaining them, our kids spend most of their waking lives in them, and to put it briefly schools are a huge part of the society in my country--far more so than, say, the armed forces, and second only to the public health service. As to encyclopedic, that usually comes down to neutrality and verifiability. Because of the aforementioned inspections and the public appetite for information on schools, there is plenty of verifiable information about them. I shouldn't worry that anyone would mistake a school article for "meaningless garbage" and delete it. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:51, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> If this were a person rather than a school it would have been speedy-deleted on the criterion that it is "An article about a real person that does not assert that person's importance or significance." Despite the repeated assertions of school inclusionists, schools are <i>not</i> generally regarded as eminently noteworthy. This is an area within which there is no consensus within Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:17, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>There are hundreds of articles about hospitals on Wikipedia. See <a href="../../../h/o/s/Category%7EHospitals_5db9.html" title="Category:Hospitals">Category:Hospitals</a>. Police stations, fire brigades and sewage treatment plants don't fall into the same criteria. They generally have little impact on the larger community, unlike schools and hospitals. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a> 03:42, August 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That was meant as rhetoric... I did say <i>every</i> hospital, thinking that the absurdity of that was obvious.</li>
<li>That list is difficult to get an accurate number on (it has sub-lists) but it does not appear to contain "hundreds" of hospitals.</li>
<li>As to <i>notable</i> hospitals, it is not out of order that would be <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_hospitals_in_California_9b08.html" title="List of hospitals in California">ten in California</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_hospitals_in_Texas_9bb0.html" title="List of hospitals in Texas">two in Texas</a>, or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_hospitals_in_France_ed0d.html" title="List of hospitals in France">three in France</a>.
