<li><b>Delete</b>This article should be deleted because it is very subjective. All articles in Wikipedia should be objective.</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> This Vfd is an attempt by the Turkish propagandists and apologists named above (Snchduer and E.A) to deny the Turkish invasion of Cyprus and the crimes against humanity which Turkey perpetrated against Greek Cypriots including mass human rights violations of which Turkey has been found Guilty of by the European Court of Human Rights, destruction of cultural heritage, illegal colonisation and fate of missing persons. These Turkish apologists have repeatedly vandalised the Cyprus dispute page in order to prevent the facts and figures from being included and now they are using the same disruptive tactics here.--<a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyrosargyrou_666e.html" title="User:Argyrosargyrou">Argyrosargyrou</a> 13:59, 30 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>You are a Turkish apologist and do have involvement in disputed articles since you have nominated this historical article for deletions. That makes you a holocaust denier.

<li>As I have already said that article does not contain anything about war crimes, ethnic cleaning, missing persons, destruction of cultural heritage, human rights violations and illegal colonisation and it equates the innocent victims with the brutal aggressors.

<li>I guess you're having a hard time keeping all us Turkish apologists straight. I never nominated Hellenic Genocide for deletion. In fact, I actually voted to <i>keep it</i>, stating that wiki had a big gap in covering the events in question.

<li>Nobody is saying that the information shouldn't be there, nor that the Greek POV not be reported, but separating out all pro-Greek information into one article is not the Wikipedia way. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 23:53, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The Cyprus Issue itself is a POV issue. In my opinion there is no way that articles surrounding it will get away from POV issues. So, best thing to do is let both POVs exist not suppress them. I know that user <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyrosargyrou_666e.html" title="User:Argyrosargyrou">Argyrosargyrou</a> has been trying to pass his GC POV on <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus_dispute.html" title="Cyprus dispute">Cyprus dispute</a> without success due to an "organised gang" of Turkish or TC POV individuals. Also, the Turkish invasion of Cyprus is a significant event in the Cyprus dispute which does deserve its own article. --<a href="../../../a/n/k/User%7EAnk99_4145.html" title="User:Ank99">Ank99</a> 05:49, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This article certainly has more references than the pro-Turkish side. In light with recent developments of another user, I think we should keep this and let him share his point of view, just as others have. BTW this is not a duplication of the Cyprus dispute. It only uses the same sources of info. This is not rewriting history. This action is obviously a historical truth. There was an invasion. But if I were not so busy or if I were not on vacation, would I sit back while I see various new articles pop up with a Turkish POV allegedly, which may be historical just as this article is? No I would not. I would state my own opinion as others have done. Nevertheless, I would have done thinks a lot differently than anyone here. I was already branded as a person with a POV but I would not go on a crusade to write articles for the hell of it. By now whoever started it is irrelevant and the fact that it is happening is the issue. I have a lot more to say on this matter but I have to be brief right now. I have to get back to my vacation.

However, the concept of the article is valid (it has the potential to be far more than a POV fork). Just because we have an article <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleonic_Wars_898f.html" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> doesn't preclude the existence of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Waterloo_202f.html" title="Battle of Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a>. I think that everyone needs to calm down and get back to editing good articles. <a href="../../../p/h/l/User%7EPhlogistomania_618a.html" title="User:Phlogistomania">Phlogistomania</a> 13:56, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This needs sorting out, but not on VfD. My preference: Get rid of obviously POV titles (like Greek Cypriot Genocide or Turkish Cypriot Genocide), treat a broad overview in <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus_dispute.html" title="Cyprus dispute">Cyprus dispute</a>, and have a neutral article specifically on the Turkish invasion (which is part of the broader conflict but a specific military "event") at this location, preferably one that treats the invasion as narrowly as possible and refers the reader to <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus_dispute.html" title="Cyprus dispute">Cyprus dispute</a> for information on the wider geopolitical issues (so as to avoid fighting over the same issues on a multitude of pages). --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 01:27, Jun 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Nobody is saying that the information shouldn't be there, nor that the Greek POV not be reported, but separating out all pro-Greek information into one article is not the Wikipedia way. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 23:53, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The Cyprus Issue itself is a POV issue. In my opinion there is no way that articles surrounding it will get away from POV issues. So, best thing to do is let both POVs exist not suppress them. I know that user <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyrosargyrou_666e.html" title="User:Argyrosargyrou">Argyrosargyrou</a> has been trying to pass his GC POV on <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus_dispute.html" title="Cyprus dispute">Cyprus dispute</a> without success due to an "organised gang" of Turkish or TC POV individuals. Also, the Turkish invasion of Cyprus is a significant event in the Cyprus dispute which does deserve its own article. --<a href="../../../a/n/k/User%7EAnk99_4145.html" title="User:Ank99">Ank99</a> 05:49, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Your personal attacks are not acceptable. Just because someone wants to keep an article NPOV does not mean they adhere to the opposite POV from the one in this article. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 23:53, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The article is definitely not perfect, but it does contain relevant material. --<a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> 22:05, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Why can't that information be in the original article that this was forked from? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 23:53, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This article certainly has more references than the pro-Turkish side. In light with recent developments of another user, I think we should keep this and let him share his point of view, just as others have. BTW this is not a duplication of the Cyprus dispute. It only uses the same sources of info. This is not rewriting history. This action is obviously a historical truth. There was an invasion. But if I were not so busy or if I were not on vacation, would I sit back while I see various new articles pop up with a Turkish POV allegedly, which may be historical just as this article is? No I would not. I would state my own opinion as others have done. Nevertheless, I would have done thinks a lot differently than anyone here. I was already branded as a person with a POV but I would not go on a crusade to write articles for the hell of it. By now whoever started it is irrelevant and the fact that it is happening is the issue. I have a lot more to say on this matter but I have to be brief right now. I have to get back to my vacation.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I cannot understand why it should be deleted. I thought the Turkish Military is very proud on the success of the invasion. When there are articles on single battles, why a war cannot have its own article? —<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGeraki_f499.html" title="User:Geraki">Ger</a><a href="../../../g/e/r/User_talk%7EGeraki_a04a.html" title="User talk:Geraki"><b>ak</b></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Geraki_942b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Geraki">i</a> <small>2005-06-13 T 14:56 Z</small>
