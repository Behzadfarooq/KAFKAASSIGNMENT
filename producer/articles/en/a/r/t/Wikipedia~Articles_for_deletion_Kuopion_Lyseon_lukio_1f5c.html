<li><b>Keep</b> It's an International Baccalaureate school - one of a relatively small number around the world. If it's an IB school it probably is the top school in the region. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">LeeHunter</a> 16:59, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment'</b>. IB does not mean a school is academically the "top" school in a region. It just means that it has a significant number of students with international backgrounds: most likely it is a school that attracts the children of expatriates living in the region, since the IB will be more recognized by universities in other countries. IF a school has a distinguished history, is significant in terms of the history of education in its region, has many famous alumnae, etc, then it should be in, but not just because it awards the IB. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 17:41, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete: First, IB isn't that exclusive. Come on! In the UK, it's very common. In the US, you've still got scores and scores of them.

<li><b>Comment:</b> heh, my high school had IB students too, and even though my shcool was a pretty good school I would never say that it's a top shcool (simply because it isn't, just proving that IB doesn't mean that it's a top school) or think of writing an article about it. - <a href="../../../j/e/l/User%7EJeltz_23d5.html" title="User:Jeltz">Jeltz</a> <a href="../../../j/e/l/User_talk%7EJeltz_3bb8.html" title="User talk:Jeltz"><small>talk</small></a> 22:30, 2004 Dec 26 (UTC)</li>

<li>The nominator, namely me, has studied the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:deletion policy</a> in detail. I apparently have a different interpretation of it than the Messrs Gerard and Man, an interpretation which does not seem unique to me by any means. Perhaps the honored gentlemen would care to rewrite the policy in order to make it more clear, if they are so convinced that people are misinterpreting it. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:28, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li>I too have studied the Wikipedia deletion policy and nowhere could I find anything that stated a school should be deleted on grounds of something so subjective as notability. Aside from the fact that educational institutions are inherently noteworthy, perhaps you can direct me to the exact verbiage that states that noteworthiness is a reason for deletion? Its as clear as black and white and as far as I can see there <i>isn't anything to interpret</i>, so I'm not sure what it is you're referring to. Nothing needs rewriting; certain "groupthink" individuals here need re<i>wiring</i>. —<a href="../../../r/a/d/RaD_Man_2e7f.html" title="RaD Man"><b>RaD Man</b></a> (<a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadman1_76e9.html" title="User talk:Radman1"><i>talk</i></a>) 09:31, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Is it incumbent for every VfD nomination to cite the Wikipedia case law and precedents? Articles on high schools deleted as non-encyclopedic is one of the more common VfD situations, and comes up practically every day. It is even one of the specific cases dealt with in <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Precedents_e2a3.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Precedents</a>. The discussion centers on whether the school is sufficiently notable to warrant an article, not on whether this is a valid grounds for deletion. If you are going to take people to task for not following Wikipedia policy, please familiarize yourself with that policy, and the existing documentation on the precedents. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 17:46, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, actually it is to at least cite a reason that matches the policy! Surely that's not too much to ask. - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 22:18, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Comment</i>: A Finnish prime minister (<a href="../../../p/a/a/Paavo_Lipponen_a61f.html" title="Paavo Lipponen">Paavo Lipponen</a>) graduated from this school, and as a centrally located secondary school in a regional capital, it is very <i>likely</i> one of the older schools in the area and <i>probably</i> has other famous alumni or former teachers. However, the author seems unaware of this in just stressing the IB-bit. I would vote to keep it if the article would <s>actually show that the history of the school is interesting</s> be more informative as to the historical significance of the school. <s>but as it stands, I abstain.</s> / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 10:56, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC) I have been eagerly waiting to be able to change my non-vote to a "keep", but it appears I will be disappointed. Thus I vote <b>merge with <a href="../../../k/u/o/Kuopio.html" title="Kuopio">Kuopio</a> and redirect</b>, hoping somebody will come back and improve our knowledge of the Kuopio Lyceum and make it worth breaking out as an article of its own again. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 15:18, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>You said: "I would vote to keep it if the article would actually show that the history of the school is <b>interesting</b>". Interesting = amusing. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndylkl_090d.html" title="User:Andylkl">Andylkl</a> 12:49, Dec 30, 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see no point in a flame war over a trivial matter like this, especially as I am leaning more towards keep than delete. I changed the wording above for increased clarity, but if you had actually read what I wrote in context, you would have understood what was meant, i.e. the school is probably important, but there isn't enough "content or information" to make the school worth an article of its own - yet. I think there may well be at some later point. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 15:18, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)
