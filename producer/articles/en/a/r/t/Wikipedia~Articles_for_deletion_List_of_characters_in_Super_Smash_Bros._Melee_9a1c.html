<li>The nom believes that with List of Super Smash Bros. series NPCs not being a part of this list kills the purpose of this list. However, it is a simple matter of moving it to List of characters in the Super Smash Bros. series, merging the NPC list into that list, and adding <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl_101e.html" title="Super Smash Bros. Brawl">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a></i> characters to it. None of them are covered outside of categories, and as many will say, not all lists are redundant when a similar category exists. My suggestion removes the redundancy to the SSB series article, and redundancy to categories is absurd. List of FF titles? That's a category. List of Mario games by genre? There's the category for Mario games, and I'm pretty sure there is a cat for platformers, Mario Kart games, RPG Marios, and Mario sports games. So <b>keep</b> as List of characters in the Super Smash Bros. series with all playable characters from <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Smash_Bros._7a86.html" title="Super Smash Bros.">Super Smash Bros.</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee_ba8d.html" title="Super Smash Bros. Melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a></i>, and <i>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</i>, in addition to major NPCs such as the Hands, Giga Bowser, Wire Frames, Polygons, and Sandbag. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 05:52, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Final_Fantasy_titles_05b3.html" title="List of Final Fantasy titles">List of Final Fantasy titles</a> provides much more information than just the names of each game. It has release date information and other notes which cannot be conveyed with a category and has also achieved Featured List status. I may have to take a look at those "List of Mario games by genre" articles because they may be candidates for deletion too. In this case, the article provides no additional information except as categorization and possibly what series they came from, which is already adequately covered at <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Smash_Bros._%28series%29_0e8e.html#Fighters" title="Super Smash Bros. (series)">Super Smash Bros. (series)#Fighters</a>. I suppose List of Super Smash Bros. series NPCs could be moved to something like List of original characters from the Super Smash Bros. series, but that's a different discussion. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 21:24, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>By what you have said, it would not be deleted. List of Mario games by genre gives info that cats cannot. Additionally, as I have stated, there is no reason for SSB NPCs to have their own list. If it is merged into this list, there is no reason to delete. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 00:01, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Okay, fine. We're not actually discussing the Mario pages here. Anyway, I have merged the original characters to the main <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Smash_Bros._%28series%29_0e8e.html" title="Super Smash Bros. (series)">Super Smash Bros. (series)</a> page since there aren't that many and added List of Super Smash Bros. series NPCs to this AfD. As of right now, both pages are redundant since a separate character article wasn't necessary to begin with, especially considering the category, the table and the merge. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 02:01, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh Hell, this is insane! Have you seen the SSB series article? The best thing to eliminate the redundancy would be to remove the characters from the series article! It takes up most of the page! - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 21:19, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And then put them into their own redundant article? Great logic, there buddy. The tables on the series page are an easy way to find out which characters appear in which game (much better than the unreadable mess on the characters page, at least). Now I suggest that you calm down before you give yourself an aneurysm. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 22:39, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I freaked out because of the condition of the article. The article is mostly the list. If the article has that excessive list removed from it, then it's not redundant to anything. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 23:12, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Well, what else would you put into the article? SSB is a fighting game with little story. If you can't talk about its original characters in the series article, what can you talk about? <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 23:49, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li>If you feel that way, then please do add that stuff to the article. Wikipedia thrives on motivated editors. We can decide if the article is getting too long after that happens. For now, the section on the main article is much more appropriate than separating the information unnecessarily. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 00:32, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>The list is excessive on the article and is redundant. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 00:53, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Apparently, you're the only person on this AfD who thinks so. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 00:57, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The fact that the article about the series is less about the overall series and more about what characters appear in them makes that fact moot. The majority of the article is a list which could easily be made separate, just like List of Advance Wars COs is separate from the AW series page. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 01:03, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Surely you can't be serious when you use that example. Advance Wars has a considerably larger cast of original characters than SSB. In that case, summary style should be used to describe the function of COs and then link to the main characters page. In this case, there are only 6 "original" characters (I use that term loosely since Giga Bowser isn't truly original and the Polygons/Wire Frames don't really count as characters, per se). These characters are given a short description (which I can probably still trim, if necessary) and are well within <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>'s guidelines for having fictional character descriptions on the work of fiction's main page. Besides, I don't know about you, but I find it difficult to talk about a fighting game without talking about its characters, since you know, they're the most important part, 'cus, you know, they're the ones that do the fighting and such. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 01:26, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li>You've proved my point. In the case of <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Fighter_%28series%29_9db9.html" title="Street Fighter (series)">Street Fighter (series)</a>, each individual character might deserve his own article because of the sheer number of games each has appeared in and since including a list of characters would be awkward, considering the number of characters, it has been delegated to a category. There's also the fact that the Street Fighter articles aren't that good either, meaning that they shouldn't be used for comparison.</li>
<li>Anyway, your feeble rebuttals and frankly irrational stubbornness have shown me that I am wasting my time arguing with you. I have no hope of changing your mind so I won't try. I'm just going to leave the results of this debate to consensus. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 02:12, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Allow me to translate - because you cannot "defeat" me, you decide to call me stubborn, irrational, and everything I say feeble. The list of characters is too long. It may cut the article in half, but that is not a reason to keep it there. The contents of the article will be there. All that needs to be done is to have the information added. The fact that the list is the majority of the article is proof that it needs to be split. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 02:20, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's not unnecessary if the series article did not use the list. Ideally, the article will become much larger. <b>Request: I would like to have the result of the AfD delayed, oh, say, a week. If I can make the series big enough to remove the list from the main article as being too lengthy, then keep. If not, delete.
