<li><b>Delete</b> as initial prodder (thanks for making this an AfD, good call!). The main objection raised on the article talk page was that many other webcomics are equally non notable (two of the examples given by the objector have since already been removed). This is sadly true, and many webcomics have alreday been deleted or are currently nominated. As long as no arguments are given why this webcomic is verifiably notable, I fail to see why it should be kept. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 12:23, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>Reply to Fram</i> Among the much more numerous hits for "The parking lot is full" + comic (~1000), there are is an interview<a href="http://www.fadetoblack.com/interviews/plif/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fadetoblack.com/interviews/plif/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> that gives a brief history of the comic, starting with a print origin in a student newspaper. As this review asserts<a href="http://www.masterzdm.com/enter/webcomicbookclub/full.php?cid=122" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.masterzdm.com/enter/webcomicbookclub/full.php?cid=122" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, in spite of its lack of fame, it may have been one of the very first webcomics. It mostly seems to be reviewed in webzines<a href="http://www.justlaugh.com/online/plif.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.justlaugh.com/online/plif.php" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, but I'm having no trouble finding a lot of webzine reviews. Some come from interesting sources that I would not have expected to review webcomics.<a href="http://humaniststudies.org/enews/index.php?id=173&amp;article=19" class="external autonumber" title="http://humaniststudies.org/enews/index.php?id=173&amp;article=19" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/fiction/comics.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/fiction/comics.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> I think the case can be made that this is one of those cases where a webcomic is notable without being popular or famous. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 14:44, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>None of these sources are <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> as far as I can see. The Humaniststudies.org one comes perhaps closest, but then again, it is not a review of the comic, just mentioning that they publish it along with others in their ezine (this link gives the staff of the magazine, making clear that it is not the kind of magazine we normally consider as reliable, having only one editor<a href="http://humaniststudies.org/staff.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://humaniststudies.org/staff.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>). 1995, while certainly not late, is not exceptionally early for a webcomic (the review you cite talks about 1993, but then it was published in a student newspaper, not as a webcomic, giving an indication of the reliability of such reviews). As for groundbreaking... in what independently verified way? I know that deletion isn't a substitute for cleanup or sourcing, but then again, that wasn't my intention. I had seen the other reviews as well, but they are non notable or non reliable (mostly online) publications (webzines), so I don't see what they change to the deletion rationale. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 16:19, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>About half of the ones I mentioned fail independence, which is why I didn't say "strong keep," and the rest are marginally "published" online; however, if I could find that many sources hovering near the borderline of the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> standards in less than five minutes of looking, it seems a pretty sure bet that it passes <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> standards overall. In retrospect, it's not surprising that there are only a couple thousand pages on the web that mention this comic, seeing as it ended five years ago. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 17:07, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Many sources which fail <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> does not mean that there are probably some sources meeting <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> as well. Let me point out that your previous posts, while perhaps not having that intention, at least convinced the next editor wrongly that the comic is "recognized as having historical significance", when no such thing is shown except in one user-supplied and mistaken review. As for the "couple thousand pages", <i>all</i> 5 pages you gave as a reference were included in my initial search of 57 distinct Google hits, indicating that a) it was a quite good and fair search for reviews of this comic and b) there isn't probably that much more you can find about it on the internet. So basically, we still have a webcomic with only about 50 websites referencing it in slightly more than a passing way (at least mentioning the author), and depending on your criteria, only one or none of these sources could pass <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Which rather conclusively means that for all we have been able to find, it still clearely fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 20:28, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, since I don't start getting unrelated hits until the eighth page of search terms (results 71-80), and I keep finding relevant reviews of the comic hundreds of results down the list, your search <i>definitely</i> underrepresents the number of pages about TPIF, just as your searches have typically severely underrepresented comics. Those pages that I pulled out, several of which either come very close to meeting <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, or could be argued to meet it, although typically not also the independence criterion for <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, are simply the first few reviews. Five years is a long time on the internet, and I have to say that I was shocked to find such a quantity of solid reviews online after all this time.</dd>

<dd>To emphasize how much you're missing through your inadequate searches, hit #463 was tantalizingly titled "Notable Webcomics" and dated from last summer. It did only contain a relatively brief user-posted review, of course, but it's gross misrepresentation to claim that it's only referenced on 50 websites.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 23:06, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So basically, "how much I am missing through my inadequate searches" which returned all your previously given links, are all not meeting <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, just like I expected. So in what way, relevant to this discussion which is intended to see if this comic meets the Wikipedia guidelines, was my search inadequate? It was a search to look for multiple independent reviews (excluding trivial mentions) by reliable sources, of which your extended search didn't return any: this was to be expected, since it would be very unusual to have a thorough review in a serious magazine or newspaper that didn't even mention the author of the comic. Look, could you please provide the necessary reliable sources to support your keep&#160;!vote instead of attacking the methods used by the nominator? I appreciate the effort you have put in your search, but if it doesn't return anything further, just say so please.~ <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 06:12, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As matters stand, the fact that the webcomic was (a) published in print by a source that may or may not qualify under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> (student newspapers vary widely in this regard) and (b) talked about by, as I've pointed out, numerous sources whose status under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is open to question either way was enough for me to suggest that the article be kept on the basis of that open question and the strong probability that additional sources whose status is less unclear would soon be discovered (see Kizor's comment for clear vindication of that estimation). <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 11:58, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

And, yes, it was influential. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 00:15, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><i>The Parking Lot is Full</i> began in 1993, but it didn't go online until 1995. However, in my book, while 1993 qualifies as <i>amazingly</i> early, 1995 still qualifies as very early indeed: we only have a couple of webcomics on all of Wikipedia that were around before 1995 (<a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Fun_e46c.html" title="Doctor Fun">Doctor Fun</a> from 1993 and <a href="../../../w/h/e/Where_the_Buffalo_Roam_%28webcomic%29_b001.html" title="Where the Buffalo Roam (webcomic)">Where the Buffalo Roam</a> from 1991—neither of which have any more reliable sources than this page). The only other comics on Wikipedia that are from 1995 are <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymer_City_Chronicles_2eee.html" title="Polymer City Chronicles">Polymer City Chronicles</a> (March), <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argon_Zark%21_cccf.html" title="Argon Zark!">Argon Zark!</a> (June), <a href="../../../s/e/v/Sev_Wide_Web_b212.html" title="Sev Wide Web">Sev Wide Web</a> (July), and <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_and_Kell_7cca.html" title="Kevin and Kell">Kevin and Kell</a> (September). So that makes <i>The Parking Lot is Full</i> one of the 3-7 oldest webcomics in existence that currently have Wikipedia articles. Just to put things in perspective a bit. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 01:43, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm not sure I understand the parameters of your list, but maybe you ought to add things like <a href="../../../r/o/g/Rogues_of_Clwyd-Rhan_894d.html" title="Rogues of Clwyd-Rhan">Rogues of Clwyd-Rhan</a> from 1994 to your list? --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 04:28, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If it had been on the web on 1993, I would have agreed. Since it was 1995, I think it was somewhat early, but not early enough to be truly notable for that aspect. As for influential... I would expect it to have reviews like this one for <i><a href="../../../a/r/g/Argon_Zark%21_cccf.html" title="Argon Zark!">Argon Zark!</a></i>, which is from 1995 as well but gets at least a lot more recognition<a href="http://webcomicsreview.com/examiner/issue050912/history1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://webcomicsreview.com/examiner/issue050912/history1.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. It also discusses <i><a href="../../../d/i/l/Dilbert.html" title="Dilbert">Dilbert</a></i>, which went online in 1995 as well, and a bunch of other truly influential (but later) webcomics. It just indicates that 1995 was the start of the boom for webcomics: anything earlier is truly early, anything from then or later is no longer, in my view, notable for being early. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 09:41, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>For what it's worth, The <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doonesbury.html" title="Doonesbury">Doonesbury</a> web site also launched in 1995. Here's a little <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~sree_p/bookmarks/Comics.html" class="external text" title="http://members.tripod.com/~sree_p/bookmarks/Comics.html" rel="nofollow">historical snapshot</a>: A "a collection of regularly updated comics found in the WWW" started in 1995 and last updated June 17, 1996.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom, Fram, and Freepsbane. <i>Fade to Black</i> doesn't impress, and without that there's not sufficient material to make this suitable for inclusion.
