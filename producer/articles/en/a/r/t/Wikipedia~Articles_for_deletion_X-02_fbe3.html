<dd>Why remove the in-game specs? Please do not confuse a Real-Time-Strategy game which relies on the overall effectiveness of specialized units and a flying/simulation game where individual plane statistics alter the very nature of how to approach flying that plane successfully in a mission. While individual HPS and damages of each of the little units in say, StarCraft, matter little in the overall strategies of playing the game, a difference of what loudouts a plane has or how maneuverable it is within the game's architecture are incredibly important to the simulation aspect of the game. Had Ace Combat been a RTS utilyzing aircraft, then I could possibly see not having a description regarding their statistics, but this is clearly not the case. The statistics of each aircraft in this type of game specifically control what can be done with that aircraft and how it will perform against a set of enemies. I would consider this an omission of published, verifiable information. <a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdoAlphaOmega_dd09.html" title="User:IdoAlphaOmega">IdoAlphaOmega</a> 05:35, 11 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"furrowed brow" So the HPS of unit doesn't approach how i use it in an RTS? When it comes down to it, wiki is not a place to expound on game mechanics. Please, take a page from the Trek geeks, who've moved all their tech specs off to their independent wiki. Somebody should start a wiki rival to gamefaqs. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 05:49, 11 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Is the HP an integral part of your RTS that sets apart one unit from another? Is there a grunt in StarCraft with 10HP more than the regular grunt? If it is, please argue so and have it included where it is necessary. No game mechanics are being expounded upon here, merely statistics - similar to the statistics or real aircraft by the way - which even many Star Trek spacecraft have. There's even a Star Trek Template Project to unify how tech specs regarding the various vessels are presented. Sorry, but the GameFAQs analgy is only an attempt to attach negative connotation to the article in question, and I will not tolerate it. Wikipedia's own <a href="../../../f/a/q/FAQ_1fe9.html" title="FAQ">FAQs</a> states that GameFAQs articles <i>are often instead rather detailed descriptions of gameplay, including tips, secrets, and beginning-to-end guidance</i>, and, thus far, nobody has shown how the X-02 article has been any of those things. <a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdoAlphaOmega_dd09.html" title="User:IdoAlphaOmega">IdoAlphaOmega</a> 06:34, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Expand</b>. Although a fictional aircraft, there are quite a few articles on Wikipedia regarding fictional characters, places, events, which span barely three lines. The X-02 spans three different games, is a unique creation with <i>published, certifiable statistics</i> (games are published too, you know as well as information in several published player's guides), and appears as both flyable and enemy-controlled aircraft. Granted, it does need some work, but the majority revolves around updating the article and adding information and statistics from <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Combat_5_a1cd.html" title="Ace Combat 5">Ace Combat 5</a> and <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Combat_Zero_c50a.html" title="Ace Combat Zero">Ace Combat Zero</a>. It should be noted that the originator of this AFD has targetted several Ace Combat articles for deletion - many with detailed, succinct, and varied information all while giving the reason "Gamecruft" and no further explanation. <a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdoAlphaOmega_dd09.html" title="User:IdoAlphaOmega">IdoAlphaOmega</a> 03:52, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Upon review, it appears that I was incorrect in making such an accusation. I retract my statement and apologize. However, my statements regarding the X-02 article still stand, and there was an attempt to AFD the ADF-01, ADFX-01, Ustio, Belka, and Yuktobania articles related to Ace Combat 5 by the same person which led me such an erroneous conclusion. Just as an addition, the article differs from GameFAQ articles in a few significant ways A) it does not provide step-by-step (aka a guide) information on obatining the craft B) it does not give advice on how or when to use the craft, and C) does not comment about the plane's abilities except to mention that it, as many of the fictional super-fighters in previous AC games were, is a marginally and/or significantly better than its real-world digital counterparts. <a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdoAlphaOmega_dd09.html" title="User:IdoAlphaOmega">IdoAlphaOmega</a> 04:28, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I do not see how anything on the X-02 page can be related to gamefaq... During several years, Namco has created a whole universe with the ace combat series. That universe fly far away the ace combat games, as the background is deeply described in official sites (who keep being updated even after the releases of the games) and game books. So I think there is enought facts about X-02 to keep his page, as any Star wars fighter... Hirose 11:31, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Keep</b> or <b>Expand</b> "Gamecruft?" Honestly, if one starts to get irritated on topics such as this, the Wiki better go after everything. I know from doing a whole report on it that there is enough specs on it to make a convincing arguement that it could fly (simulations in X-Plane--yes, I know its a sim, and still only a game--have shown that it really could fly). Not only that, but unless similar articles on other games are put up for deletion, I find this unessecarry to even consider this. It's not cluttering anything as the only way to find it is when one researches Ace Combat, and if that's the case, why not keep it for those people actually searching for it? Kinda a no-brainer to me. (AceCombatSkies.com Admin "F22_Fan" posted 10:08 AM, 11 April 2006 GMT)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Why remove it? It may be a fictional aircraft, yes, but in that case everything fictional should be deleted from Wikipedia. The article itself is not bad. Keep, or at least make a big article about Ace Combat fictional aircraft. YF-23 17:02, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Although the article needs improvment, that is no reason to delete it. Concerning the X-02 being fictional: If that is a reason to delete the article, then why do the articles for such fictional craft as the F-302, X-Wing, F/A-37, and Starfury remain unchallenged? Tempest2</li>
