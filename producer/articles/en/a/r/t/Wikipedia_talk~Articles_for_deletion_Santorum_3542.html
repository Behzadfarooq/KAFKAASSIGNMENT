	    <p>Name should remain. The word has grabbed hold in the culture. It is clear why people want it to go away, but this is nothing more than knee-jerk linguistic stuffiness born from the idea that language stands still. "Santorum" has meaning, is generally used, and should remain at wikipedia.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> We might as well continue the discussion here as anywhere else, but it probably should be pointed out at this point the discussion is not really about whether or not there should be an article at the heading <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum.html" title="Santorum">Santorum</a>. IMHO there's a clear consensus to "keep" <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum.html" title="Santorum">Santorum</a> as an article title. The discussion has now morphed into a discussion which probably should have taken place at<a href="../../../s/a/n/Talk%7ESantorum_f6be.html" title="Talk:Santorum">Talk:Santorum</a> but might as well continue here, as to the <b>content</b> of that page. Everyone needs to remember that, formally, this AfD formally only advises the closing sysop as to whether or not <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum.html" title="Santorum">Santorum</a> should be deleted, and is not binding as to article content.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to try to establish a consensus about what happens next, I'm calling for a straw poll here. Add your name to <b>every</b> proposal that you find acceptable (i.e. you can put your name under more than one proposal. Add any comments you think might be helpful. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:58, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
While I appreciate the effort, I find this straw poll to not have the right options. For example, I believe that there should be a page, and that it should be moved from <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum.html" title="Santorum">Santorum</a> to Santorum (something) but this is not an option in the straw poll. At the end of the day, we need to decide two things separately here:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Do we want an article on the political act called Santorum, wherever we determine it should go (the topic of the AfD); and</li>
<li>If we do want such an article, how should it be disambiguated with respect to the other meanings of Santorum.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Can the straw poll be modified somehow to treat these things independently? -- <a href="../../../c/m/h/User%7ECmh_f246.html" title="User:Cmh">cmh</a> 00:43, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It seems pretty clear from the votes above that there is no consensus to delete, and that doesn't seem likely to change. I would suggest that there's no need for a straw poll on that. The name of the article is up for grabs, certainly. I've added two more options below that I hope address those. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> 00:54, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree with your view of consensus. However, I still think we have some trouble with the poll, there's two polls in one still. One is on the question of the article title, the second is on the question of the dab page and the dab link on the santorum article. What if we separated into two polls. Article in question should be at: 1) Santorum 2) Santorum (something) 3) Santorum (something else). Then a second poll for DAB: 1) Santorum is the political act 2) Santorum is a dab page 3) Santorum is Rick Santorum and there is a toplink to a Santorum (dab) page 4) Santorum is Rick Santorum and there is no toplink to other pages. For the record I would vote 2 for the first poll, then 3 for the second and I don't think I can do that in the current poll.-- <a href="../../../c/m/h/User%7ECmh_f246.html" title="User:Cmh">cmh</a> 01:20, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you can, unless I misunderstand your intent. You can vote in more than one place; dpbsmith above requested that votes be added to <b>every</b> acceptable proposal. So couldn't you put your vote down below under "<a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum.html" title="Santorum">Santorum</a> should be a disambiguation page, with its "traditional" content" and also under "The article on the Savage neologism should be titled Santorum (neologism)"? I've done something similar with my own votes below. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 01:39, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Notable enough as it is on it's own to warrant a small article, per the links/urls that were added. Also, add a reference on the disambig page that leads to <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum_%28sexual_slang%29.html" title="Santorum (sexual slang)">Santorum (sexual slang)</a> where this article will live after the AfD. Sort the various Santorums on the disambig alphabetically, with Rick Santorum first as he's the most visible/notable one. No one will have cause for complaint then. But "Santorum" itself should not be for the Senator, it's gotta be the disambig page. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 00:08, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If I understand the intent of Dpbsmith's straw poll correctly, it asks where the link <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum.html" title="Santorum">Santorum</a> takes you, not whether the article on sexual slang should exist at all. If I'm right, I think your last comment means you agree with one of the next two options, not this one.

<dd>After reviewing the site I linked, I note that while it does use the slang definition, it uses it in the service of a) promoting the definition and b) criticising the senator. I daresay that's evidence <i>toward</i> making the Senator the primary topic rather than evidence <i>against</i>. Ideally, supporters of making the slang term primary ought to be looking for sources that make use of the term as a slang term without reference (beyond perhaps an etymological one) to the senator. I doubt there are very many. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> <sup><small><small><a href="../../../l/t/p/User_talk%7ELtPowers_d522.html" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a></small></small></sup> 18:13, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Google shows 3,520,000 hits for "Rick Santorum" -fecal, and 30,700 for "Rick Santorum" +fecal. That seems evidence in support of the redirect. I assume this option still has a dablink to the current disambig page. There seems no reason to pick out this particular meaning from the disambig page and link it directly, instead of one of the other meanings. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> 00:17, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Santorum (neologism) - moved from its current position at <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum.html" title="Santorum">Santorum</a>. With <i>for other uses see <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Santorum (disambiguation)">Santorum (disambiguation)</a></i>.</li>

<dd>I agree this is a fairly neutral proposal. Before I support, can I ask why you don't suggest that <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum.html" title="Santorum">Santorum</a> should redirect directly to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Santorum_41a3.html" title="Rick Santorum">Rick Santorum</a>? I thought the standard for having a redirect not go to the dab page, but instead go straight to one of the possible answers, was that one of the answers was much more likely to be the intended target. The Google scores I quoted above seem to me to show a ratio of over 100:1 in favour of hits on the senator vs. hits on the slang term. The fact that the first hit is often the slang term seems likely to be a result of acknowledged Google-bombing. Wouldn't this imply the redirect should be to the senator? As I say, I think your solution is fair, but I'm curious about the standard for the redirect. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 14:48, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Based on the policy at <a href="../../../d/a/b/WP%7EDAB_f303.html" title="WP:DAB">WP:DAB</a> (see the <i>primary page</i> section) there does not seem to be a consensus among editors that one of the two pages should be primary. This is based on looking at the straw poll and comments on the AfD page. Therefore I propose that Santorum redirect to the disambiguation page per the <a href="../../../d/a/b/WP%7EDAB_f303.html" title="WP:DAB">WP:DAB</a> policy. This has the advantage of fairness and neutrality IMO because if you view the debate as a competition between proponents of Rick and the Neologism then neither is "winning" under this solution. -- <a href="../../../c/m/h/User%7ECmh_f246.html" title="User:Cmh">cmh</a>

<dd>If I may, your Google searches aren't accurate for what you're trying to show. "'Rick Santorum' +fecal" would only return results where the Senator is mentioned by name. Even "Santorum fecal" would return only results where the slang term was defined. It's difficult to show true currency with a Google search, because if it's really current, it's going to be used standalone, without reference to its origin or definition. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> <sup><small><small><a href="../../../l/t/p/User_talk%7ELtPowers_d522.html" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a></small></small></sup> 15:48, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Support</b>, except (neologism) is not a good disambiguation word. If the word does indeed become current, we'd have to change the article title! It should be (slang) or something similar.

<dd>That may be, but I'm not sure slang is right either. Perhaps it would be better to go with (political act) or something.

<li><b>Support</b>. Per LtPowers I'd prefer (political act) or something along those lines, but I don't want to muddy the waters. I also feel that <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum.html" title="Santorum">Santorum</a> should go directly to the senator; I think the evidence is all in favour of the senator's notabiity, and I'm not convinced that having <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum.html" title="Santorum">Santorum</a> going to the dab page as a compromise is the best answer, though clearly it does avoid anyone 'winning' the implied political debate. So I'm supporting since I think this is a reasonably fair and neutral way out.

<dd>I don't have strong feelings on whether the word deserves its own article or not. If it makes others happier for it to have its own article OK. There's enough material, and it will probably deserve ongoing updates. (e.g. if there has been a successful recent Googlebombing, that could be noted). I also don't have strong feeling on the title for such an article <i>as long as it is something other than <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum.html" title="Santorum">Santorum</a></i> and agree with <a href="../../../c/m/h/User%7ECmh_f246.html" title="User:Cmh">cmh</a> that there's no need to decide this now. I wouldn't oppose any reasonable move later. I don't have a problem with <i>either</i> Santorum (neologism) or <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum_%28slang%29.html" title="Santorum (slang)">Santorum (slang)</a> even though I do not think a good case has been made for its actually being current slang. I'll throw Santorum (coinage) into the pot just for laughs, because I'd say a word with a well-known origin traceable to a particular person remains a "coinage" even <i>after</i> it enters the lexicon, e.g. "<i>ecdysiast</i> is Mencken's coinage."
