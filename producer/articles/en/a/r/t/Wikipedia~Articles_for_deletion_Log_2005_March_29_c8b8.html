<p>I'd argue that <i>very</i> few bus routes, if any, are encyclopedic. I don't see how this one is any different from dozens of others in NYC, and countless others elsewhere in the world.

<li><b>Delete</b>, agreed with other arguments.

<li><b>Delete</b>.

However, just as you should never judge a book by its cover, you should neve judge a Wikipedia article by its title. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 16:52, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> since individual bus routes are not encyclopedic. I <i>could</i> support a list of bus routes in New York, but not an individual article about each of them. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 06:30, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> <s>or <b>Userfy</b></s> (I like that term). I started a <i>talk</i> page for this article on 27 Mar 2005 and explained to it's authors, especially User:Yangdav, the difference between <i>Article</i> and <i>User</i> namespaces. I suggested that either he move (userfy) it or that someone would do it for him.

<li><b>Delete</b>. No point making it his user page, he's not a user, having only come here once to create the article and never returning. He's not interested in contributing to Wikipedia, he's just spamming us with some self-promoting drivel. Make it a user page and we'll be providing him free hosting for his little bit of vanity. Just get rid of it. Amazing how many people blatantly ignore the warning: "Please do not create an article to promote yourself, a website, a product, or a business." — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">(Talk)</a> 20:36, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Weak <b>keep</b> and <b>expand</b> to establish notability as listed by Capitalistroadster. A memorial in St. Paul's with some vague peacock words does not automatically establish WP-worthy significance in my opinion, but it sounds like his actions, at least at Sevastopol, aroused considerable attention.

<p>"During the 1980's, a proposed animated series was in the works at Marvel Productions, then later moved to development at Hanna-Barbera. Series was similar in concept to "Muppet Babies," but with the crew of the original "Star Trek" series, reduced by a 'space cloud' to tots, though still with full knowledge and capability of running the Enterprise. Though concept sketches were undoubtedly produced, so far as TBTC has been able to determine, no actual footage or finished work was ever completed."

<li><b>Comment</b> not sure about Metagrobology (looks like someone just made up this word) but the study of puzzles is more commonly known as Enigmatology.

<li>There is now: <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/enigmatology" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:enigmatology">Wiktionary:enigmatology</a>. I suggest as a general principle that we <i>do not</i> construct dictionary articles in Wikipedia with the aim of giving them to Wiktionary. It is my experience that this <i>does not work</i>. In my experience, Wiktionary (with suitable prompting) can come up with dictionary articles <i>from scratch</i> in <i>days</i> that are far better than what Wikipedia can grow in <i>months</i> or even (in some cases) <i>years</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:25, 2005 Mar 29 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wiktionary would classify this as a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:protologisms" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Wiktionary:protologisms">protologism</a>. If you think that people will look up the term, <b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../e/n/i/Enigmatology.html" title="Enigmatology">enigmatology</a>, where this subject is already (not) covered.

<li><b>Keep</b> It would be a mistake to delete this page. Even though not everyone in that community may have heard the term it is certainly used and I have seen it mentioned on various sites for a number of years now. The number of links with references to "encourages" in the article proves that the term is quite widely used and has existed for some time now. The gay male community of the fat admiration subculture or chubby and chaser community has many, many sites, which shows that it is very large and like the term Encourager will probably exist as long as the internet does. This term is also mentioned in the <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gainer.html" title="Gainer">Gainer</a> article, which was written by someone else, and has an observation in the discussion page about its use by gays in the fat admiration community. If the description of the community is disliked it can be changed without deleting the article, though I do feel that is the most accurate way to describe it. To delete this article would be denying the proven fact that Encourager is a used term. -- dannyzau <i>...Actually not by User:dannyzau (a WP impossibility) or User:Dannyzau (who doesn't exist, or anyway has contributed nothing) but instead created in a series of edits by User:210.49.177.42 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=210.49.177.42" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=210.49.177.42" rel="nofollow">contributions</a>), the same IP number that was used to create the article.</i>

<li><b>Comment</b>: 210.49.177.42, I think you'll agree that <i>discouragement</i> (let's say) is a widely used term in English, and indeed that it's vastly wider known than is <i>encourager</i> in your special sense.

<li>I've had second thoughts, he's sometimes known as John L. Bell, seldom by his full name, although we do need to disambiguate him from other John Bells on Wikipedia.

<li>We have an ongoing problem with a vandal who posts that image to dozens of talk pages (and other places). He's attacked a bunch of random people this evening. It presumably wasn't directed specifically at you, and so you shouldn't take it as a message at all. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Fader_67b5.html" title="User:John Fader">John Fader</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Fader_436f.html" title="User talk:John Fader">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_John_Fader_67c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/John Fader"><i>contribs</i></a>) 00:33, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As with Tradeoff between time-to-market and quality, there seems to be very little in this article that could qualify as original research. The author of both articles has written more articles on marketing, and while I have doubts myself whether marketing is a science it most certainly is encyclopedic. This article deserves a number of cleanup tags (and probably a name change), but I don't see VfD material here. <a href="../../../r/l/_/User%7ERl_43ae.html" title="User:Rl">Rl</a> 07:22, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>On 12 April, the article was blanked by the primary contributor. While this is an old management theory, <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristofurio_ba82.html" title="User:Christofurio">Christofurio</a>'s statement of balancing three objectives (cost, time and quality) is the normal formulation. This particular article strikes me as a student paper - sourced but not yet encyclopedic. Since the normal formulation would be a three-way balance, the title is not correct for the eventual article that we ought to write. I'm going to call this one as a delete, in part because of the author's page blanking. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 04:46, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Virtually every sentence comes with a reference from a peer-reviewed journal attached; how is this original research? I also fail to see how management science is not encyclopedic. The article certainly needs work, but VfD is not cleanup. <a href="../../../r/l/_/User%7ERl_43ae.html" title="User:Rl">Rl</a> 07:10, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> if not thuroughly overhauled. Reads like a painfully boring essay, and sort of a how-to. Don't really see how it qualifies as an encyclopedia article. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 07:13, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> -- heck, my father used to say, "there's cheap, there's quick, there's good. You can have any two of the three, but only by giving up the third." Thanks, Dad.
