<li><b>Keep</b>. Well-defined list, useful for a discussion of the perception of mental illness in society. And because it is divided by disorder, it would be difficult to duplicate with a category. However, the list should be limited to situations where mental illness is a major part of the story, not just films that have a mentally ill character somewhere in them. The other option would be for someone to move each sub-list to the article on each type of mental disorder. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 06:03, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Loose association. Could be categorised if required. A list is meant to have some sort meaningful entry data, not just a list of names, otherwise it is merely a category listing.--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacium_36db.html" title="User:Dacium">Dacium</a> 06:38, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Although I have edited the list numerous times myself, I must vote to delete. It is not maintainable. People will always insert POV and OR into the list. The list is not well defined at all. Inclusion criteria have not been clearly established and really cannot be. Most films have some characters who appear to qualify for a mental illness. Does the article define mental illness? Does it say it should only include characters presented as having been diagnosed with specific mental illnesses? Not at all. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 08:48, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The list looks better than most of these "List of movies" articles, as the movies listed actually seem to deal with mental illnesses as a major theme, at least as far as I am familiar with the films listed. However I ahve to agree with the above and go with deletion based on the arbitrary inclusion criteria. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 18:36, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or merge. This list is not like most of the other "List of films..." lists. Mental illness figures prominently in all or most of these movies as a major plot theme. And no, it is not OR to call something a "major plot theme" because it can be sourced by movie reviews. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 22:00, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Well-defined list as per above. Note that this is a specific and notable genre, and many actors casted in that role have received Oscar award or nomination, as in <i>Philadelphia</i>, <i>Rain man</i>, <i>I am Sam</i>, <i>Aviator</i>, <i>As Good as It Gets</i>. Suggest expand to add the actor/actress casted in the role, provide note on Oscar awards/nomination. --<a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> 05:08, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Also as listed by Vsion if there were any awards that the actors may have worn for portraying the illness. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehrams2020_121d.html" title="User:Nehrams2020">Nehrams2020</a> (<a href="../../../n/e/h/User_talk%7ENehrams2020_f40d.html" title="User talk:Nehrams2020">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nehrams2020_a58a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nehrams2020">contribs</a>) 05:35, 24 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but needs frequent <b>cleanup</b> to make sure entries involve a <i>major plot theme</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b> to those who want this list kept because it is "well-defined": How well-defined the list is is not under contention. The list could be the most perfectly-defined list in the world and that definition does not address the assertion of the nomination that the subjects of the list are too loosely associated. Yes, all of the listed films have a mentally ill character. That is <i>all</i> that the listed films have in common. They do not otherwise share sufficient similarity to warrant being listed together. There has been no refutation of that assertion. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:39, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply/Rebuttal</b>. Actually, if you look more closely at the list, that is not what they have in common. What they have in common is mental illness as a major plot theme or plot device. These are not movies that feature a mentally ill person in a bed while the camera is panning through a hospital hallway. In all of these movies, at least one of the main characters is mentally ill and the storyline is largely driven by the presence and/or characteristics of this mental illness. Your assertion "they do not ... share sufficient similarity to warrant being listed together" is your opinion, but I respectfully disagree. That a film's plot focuses on and/or revolves around the presence/characteristics of a mental illness is <i>more than enough</i> association. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 03:26, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Just looking at one subset of the list, that of AIDS-related dementia. I haven't seen The Hours so I can't comment on it, but "Philadelphia" does not hinge on any character's having AIDS-related dementia. The character doesn't get fired for having AIDS-related dementia, the plot is not advanced by his having AIDS-related dementia, there is IIRC no mention of AIDS-related dementia until very late in the film. "Angels in America" similarly does not feature a charatcer with AIDS-related dementia. The character has what are apparently divinely-inspired visions. Even if, though, both characters did indeed have AIDS-related dementia, the films are so diverse that listed them together as "films featuring mental illness" is ludicrous. Neither film features mental illness. They aren't about the characters dealing with mental illness. The stories are completely divergent in plot, development and tone. One is about a lawyer suing over AIDS discrimination. The other is about a man being used as an instrument of the Almighty. An article on how AIDS has been presented on film would be very encyclopedic and I would be very interested in reading it. A mishmash list of films thrown together because they's got the AIDS in 'em or any other illness (mental or otherwise) is garbage. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 14:52, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> if one film (or a few films) have been listed erroneously, then delete them from the list! By itself, that is not a reason to delete the entire article. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 18:31, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. If there are films on the list that do not belong, please go ahead and remove them. However, you make a <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasty_generalization.html" title="Hasty generalization">hasty generalization</a> to condem the whole list. Consider the films: <i>Rain Man</i>, <i>50 First Dates</i>, and <i>Radio</i>. Do you really intend to argue that these films don't feature mental illness? That they aren't about characters dealing with mental illness? That the entire storyline is based on the existence and/or characteristics of the illness? That the plots of those films could exist in the absence of the illness? If it will satisfy your concerns, I can modify the list as per User:Saberwyn/Films featuring the United States Marine Corps (adding additional information to the list, imposing stringent inclusion guidelines--actually, the latter should be done in any case if the list is kept). However, I suspect that you object to the entire premise of the list itself and are not willing to accept any modification or improvement as sufficient. I would be most happy to discover myself in error in this case, so please correct me if I'm wrong. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:57, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
