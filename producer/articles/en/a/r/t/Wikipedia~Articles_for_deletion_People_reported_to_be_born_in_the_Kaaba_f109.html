It is a zero sum game and either this article or that article should go. (unless of course you want both). This article combines two subjects that need not be combined. It is much better to discuss the Hakim part in the Hakim article and the Ali part in the sub-article of Ali since his article is too long.

<dl>
<dd>Name is NPOV in my opinion, but Zora does not like "reports" since it implies eyewitnesses. I do not agree with her, "reports" is NPOV. A "report" can be false, as Shi'a belive the Hakim "reports" are fabricated. Zora wants to remove the possibility of the "reports" even having the possibility of being true, and that is the POV of Zora and those believing all event related to it to be a fabrication. "Claim" is POV, implying "they claim it, but there is no evidence", "Belived" is even worse. There are documented reports of the claim, some people beliveing the reports to be false does not make the word POV, only needs to be represented in the actual article, as it already does.</dd>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> The point of the article is very muddled, it would seem that certain sects of Islam believe different things. I don't think that it really needs its own article since this could easily be covered by the bios of either Ali or Hakim, or in the article about the Kabaa. Perhaps there could be an article about how various Islamic Sects percieve the Kabaa. DeathThoreau 18:32, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I had this as a section in the Kaaba article previously, but it was sugested to be given a separate article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kaaba&amp;diff=29279074&amp;oldid=28925250" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kaaba&amp;diff=29279074&amp;oldid=28925250" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, since it would take to much space in the Kaaba article.

<dd>I'm reading Moojan Momen's history of Shi'a Islam right now (thanks to dgl) and it expands a fair bit on the various Shi'a sects and their conceptions of Ali -- some of them turned him into a semi-divinity. I don't think the discussion of this tradition belongs under Kaaba, it belongs under Ali and Shi'a Islam. It's a distinctive feature of Shi'ism. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 09:27, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're probably right. The way Sunnism and Shi'ism played off of each other in history is very interesting and something we fail to discuss well at all. The Safavid / Ottoman split where they formed their identities contra the other to an extent. In all honesty with the breadth of information we could cover I'm not sure how we can have it all in an orderly, readable, and well weighted fashion. Having millions of articles and not relating them is not the key. There needs to be some incentive for expertise around here. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 09:38, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Ali was born under unusual circumstances. On the thirteenth of the holy month of "Rajab", Fatima, the mother of Ali, visited the Kaaba for performing the pilgrimage. During the course of the pilgrimage while circumambulating the Kaaba, Fatima felt the pangs of childbirth. She retired to a secluded place in the precincts of the Holy Kaaba, and there Ali was born. Ali had thus the unique honor of being born in the House of God. This unparalleled honor has endowed Ali with a halo of sanctity, which has become the subject of many legends. A hundred years later, Zain-ul-Abidin a grandson of Ali (son of Husain) met as Arab woman at Najaf who told him that her grandmother had helped on the occasion of the birth of Ali. She narrated that according to the account of her grandmother, the child was beautiful, a smile played on his lips, it did not cry like other children, and its birth did not cause any pain to his mother. <a href="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/01_ali_bin_talib.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/01_ali_bin_talib.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></i></dd>

<dd><i>A bigot is a prejudiced person who is <b>intolerant of any opinions differing from their own</b>.

It doesn't right out say that it's Sunni -- in fact, it seems to be trying to reconcile Sunni and Shi'a, by accepting traditions from both. I can't find any information on who owns and edits the site. I'm not sure it represents a trend.

<p>Zora, stop your accusing it of "it seems to be trying to reconcile Sunni and Shi'a, by accepting traditions from both." Here is how you argue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Naration is for sure only Shi'a (Because i say so)</li>
<li>Anyone accepting it is Shi'a</li>
<li>hence, that site is Shi'a</li>
</ul>
<p>Try this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>From the source books that have come down to us, we do not have a proper account of the activities of Ali during the caliphate of Abu Bakr. Unfortunately most of the accounts that are available are colored because of sectarian and partisan considerations. It appears that Ali did not take the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr for some time and he remained aloof from the state politics. It appears that after the death of Fatima, Abu Bakr tried to console Ali in his grief, and win over his goodwill. It appears that Ali took the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr some time after the death of Fatima and got reconciled to him. When Abu Bakr died, Ali in the funeral oration highly praised Abu Bakr.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>would a Shia say "<b>It appears</b>" that Ali did not take the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr? Now, they would strongly claim that it was so, not try to smoothen it with some rant about "colored because of sectarian and partisan considerations", Both Shi'a, Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim are unanimous in that matter, the is no "appears" or "colored because of sectarian and partisan considerations", that site only gives a disclaiming rant since they dont like the consensus!</p>
<p>Would a Shi'a say "When Abu Bakr died, Ali in the funeral oration highly praised Abu Bakr."&#160;?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>The married life of Ali and Fatima did not extend beyond nine years. It was a happy union. Nevertheless there were differences between the pair occasionally. Once, after having <b>quarreled</b> with Fatima, Ali went to the mosque, and lay on bare earth. That made the Holy Prophet call Ali by the appellation of Abu Turab, Father of the earth. At one time, <b>Ali entertained the idea of marrying a daughter of Abu Jahl</b>. Fatima complained to the Holy Prophet. The Holy Prophet felt annoyed, and while addressing the people in the mosque he said that verily Fatima was part and parcel of him. <a href="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/35_ali_bin_talib.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/35_ali_bin_talib.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></i></li>

<li>Anyone accepting the narration is Shi'a, because Zora says so.</li>

<dd>Striver, I think you've seen me apologizing for mistakes numerous times. As to Witness-Pioneer -- I said that I'm not sure of what to make of it. I paged rapidly through the narrative looking for the usual points of controversy, and it seemed to me that the author of the work was trying to make nice-nice to both sides. Frex, here's a quote about Ghadir Khum:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When all people, over one hundred thousand in number had assembled at the pond in the Khum valley, the Holy Prophet addressed them. The exact text of the address is not available. There is a good deal of controversy about the contents of the address, and both the Sunnis and the Shias have their own versions of the address. <a href="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/32_ali_bin_talib.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/32_ali_bin_talib.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></dd>

<dd>And after that, the author doesn't take sides! If this is a Sunni site, it seems to me that it's not a typical Sunni site. Now that wouldn't at all be important if there were a dozen other Sunni sites, or books, anything, giving the Ali-born-in-the-Kaaba story. But I haven't been able to find them. That's not to say that they don't exist. I'm perfectly willing to believe that some Sunni accept this story. It seems utterly implausible to me (I'm religious, but I don't believe in miracles) but millions of Sunni Muslims believe other things that I'd regard as implausible. But it is really not clear just how widespread this belief is among the Sunni. I have a few books written by Sunnis (Zakaria and Lings) and they don't mention the story at all. More references would help. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 12:13, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Zora, you know that it is standard issue for the sunnis to not talk about that. They dont want to "take side", since there is only <b>one</b> side, only <b>one</b> version of the text of the event, the one saying that Muhammad left the Qura'an and Ahl al-Bayt and saying Ali is the Mawla of everyone. That is authentic by all Sunni scholars. Yet, Sunni biographies dont want to touch it. That is not NPOV, that is POV to the point that they dont even want to admit their own POV.</p>
<p>And further, you remeber this? <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.religion.islam/browse_thread/thread/1a0e8ae31161d9fe/c5bee68b4b1c1fdb#c5bee68b4b1c1fdb" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.religion.islam/browse_thread/thread/1a0e8ae31161d9fe/c5bee68b4b1c1fdb#c5bee68b4b1c1fdb" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>
<p>A Sunni answering "somone" that asked if Sunnis belive Ali was born ther with:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>Indeed Ali was born in Kaaba</b>, but he was not the only one born in Kaaba. From time of Ismael &amp; Abraham the <b>people born in Kaaba amount to 100 thousand</b>. It was the custom for pregnant women of high statue to spend the last days near Kaaba hoping they deliver there. <b>There were two people contemporary with Mohammad and Ali who was born in Kaaba.</b> He was an Infidel and ran from Mekka when Prophet entered the City. He was wanted by the Prophet. He was later pardoned and converted to Islam. Also, many many Arabs had the Name Ali at the time of Mohammad and before him. <b>So, I don't know what is the big deal about these two matters.</b></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Shi'a belive only Ali was born there, that sunni guy belived half the world, inclusive Ali, was born there. You know this, you have read this, yet you are doing something that can be nothing else than lying by writing thins like</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>"It's a distinctive feature of Shi'ism".</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>Zora, stop lying. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 13:30, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm tempted to say "A pox on both your houses." There is no room in Wikipedia for personal attacks <i><b>on either side</b></i>. It's clear we have divergent POVs here; so I'd suggest relying more on verifiable references that don't prefer one side or the other. If the protagonists in this soap opera can't take a step back, then the most prudent move to make is to <b>Userfy</b> until they can resolve their differences and work jointly on <b>ONE</b> article. If userfication is not an option, it might be best to delete both as vandalism magnets if the persons involved cannot show self-restraint. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 18:25, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
