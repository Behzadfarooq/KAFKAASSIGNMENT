<li><b>Merge</b>. <s><b>Strong Delete</b></s>. Even though I'm a 1997 Rasor Elementary School alumnus myself, I absolutely cannot see any use in keeping this article. As for the content, there is very little information regarding the school itself. Most of the information is about John Henry Rasor, his family, his properties, and related developments in the history of Plano, Texas. Sure, it's a nice backstory, but it has nothing to do with the school. We don't stick all our information about Todd Beamer under an article about the post office that was named after him. We don't put Martin Luther King's information under an article about one of the many streets named in his honor. If this information is relevant, it should stand on its own in another article. With regards to relevancy to Rasor Elementary, all but the first three and last sentences should be removed.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Those voting "Keep" will then argue that the content can always be changed, but that we shouldn't delete the article itself. I've seen the massive debates about school notability, and I normally side with those who want to keep as many articles as possible. I usually hesitate to delete most school-related articles. However, it's important to note the structure of Plano's school system - there are <b>45</b>, unindividual, non-notable primary schools, with more being built all the time. The secondary schools are big enough to justify an article, but this article simply does not - think 45 articles with no notable information except their location and founding date, unless you want to include the fact that, say, Mendenhall collected the most aluminum cans in such and such year.</dd>
<dd>Others want to go on "precedents" or "implied practices." The implied practice on Wikipedia is not to have a separate article on individual schools in a massive, bureaucratic school district. If you search for directories of schools on Wikipedia, the best listing you'll get is one of New York's high schools. Would we possibly want a listing of each of the hundreds and hundreds of New York City's primary schools? No! Primary schools are largely nonnotable when you single out one in a massive web of dozens or hundreds of completely standardized buildings.</dd>
<dd>Finally, when we look at the category it's listed in (primary schools in Texas), there's nothing that allows Rasor to stand out on its own. There's been no bombings or shooting, it doesn't cater towards a special group of kids, there's been no long history of tradition - it's not even unique within its own school district!</dd>
<dd>I believe that most of the school-related articles on Wikipedia should be kept. But there is a limit to me leaving a "Keep" comment when something is <i>this</i> nonnotable and the content is <i>this</i> offtopic. -<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a> 06:29, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with all of the positive feedback above. Plano is one of the few places I know where all of the schools are named for local heroes/pioneers/etc. so it would be nice to know about the namesakes. Maybe people will write about the others as well? If a student at say George Washington High School or Martin Luther King Middle School (i.e. those who are at the New York City schools mentioned above, most of which are simply named after numbers anyway) can look up more info about his school's namesake, why can't a student at Rasor? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.255.210.234 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.255.210.234_0296.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.255.210.234">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> I just looked at some of the other local school district's articles and there are several schools that have their own entries without even saying who the namesake is - simply stating BLANK is a high school in the BLANK Independent School District. The private school articles (check out Greenhill's) also don't add much. The Rasor article does say something. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.255.210.234 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.255.210.234_0296.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.255.210.234">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dl>
<dd>I went ahead and struck out one of the two preceding "Keep"s, as they came from the same person one after another. Regardless, they were unsigned by an anonymous IP user, so the votes technically shouldn't count. I'll go ahead and respond, regardless:</dd>
<dd>Your argument fits well with my vote for deletion. You're saying that a student should be able to look up the namesake of their school, which is precisely why I forked the information to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Henry_Rasor_ba70.html" title="John Henry Rasor">John Henry Rasor</a> as you were writing your comment. The article about the person should stay at the person's own article - not one about a school. Why don't we create an article about "Rasor Boulevard," then, and stick his biography in there? We don't because it's irrelevant and in the wrong place.</dd>
<dd>Finally, you argue with other examples of school-related articles. Greenhill school, for example, is notable because it is "the region’s first co-educational independent school." It isn't much of an article, especially with lines like this, "Philip Kafka - Graduated in 2005 with a major in women studies and a minor in throwing parties.," but it has at least a very minor degree of notability. -<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a> 06:52, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I don't see how merging this article shows a complete disregard for the category system. When this article was first put up for deletion, it mostly contained information about the person, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Henry_Rasor_ba70.html" title="John Henry Rasor">John Henry Rasor</a>, rather than the school. After the massive debates at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>, many contributors now automatically vote keep to school articles. I am often an inclusionist when it comes to school articles myself.</dd>
<dd>As a result, it simply comes down to the debate about whether we should delete schools - NOT a debate on how categories work in Wikipedia. <b><a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> argues for the merging of this article.</b> I've followed many of the recent talk pages in WP:SCH and Schoolwatch, and they often agree on keeping high school articles as they are. However, the <i>custom is to merge schools like this into the district page.</i> <s>You will see that many of the often knee-jerk "Keep" voters here have agreed that this article <i>should</i> be merged with the district article</s> - this is all in accordance with WP:SCH and all of the customs we have seen on Wikipedia thus far. -<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a> 20:39, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>imiatating is a necessarily pejorative word. If it were "Impacts of Star Wars in film" that would be encyclopedic, as the word impacts shows that the matter is not concrete- not to mention that the article talks about older movies being re-released when starwars became popular. And hey, I just changed the title, and am editing the introduction to make it clear that the article does not mean that these films were made soley to be like starwars.

It could just as easily be argued that the original <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_the_Worlds_a459.html" title="War of the Worlds">War of the Worlds</a> film, or even the original radio broadcast, started the science fiction craze that spawned Star Wars, Star Trek and the like.

<li>My only hassle with the article, Durova, is the long name -- no one would type that into the search box to find it.

<li>When it's completed it will have redirects from other formulations such as 614th commandment. People usually paraphrase the concept, which makes the title a challenge.

We are commanded, second, to remember in our very guts and bones the martyrs of the Holocaust, lest their memory perish. We are forbidden, thirdly, to deny or despair of God, however much we may have to contend with Him or with belief in Him lest Judaism perish. We are forbidden, finally, to despair of the world as the place which is to become the kingdom of God, lest we make it a meaningless place in which God is dead or irrelevant and everything is permitted. To abandon any of these imperatives, in response to Hitler's victory at Auschwitz, would be to hand him yet other posthumous victories"..... etc. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonabop_c15d.html" title="User:Ronabop">Ronabop</a> 04:07, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: this is one reason why the title is not <i>614th commandment</i> although Rabbi Fackenheim did propose it by that name. The introduction explicitly states that this is unofficial. If you can find a reference that adds it to the 7 Rabbinical commandments I'll add a mention to the article. I welcome suggestions and contribution that would add to balance and NPOV.

<li><b>Comment</b>: ripped from my reply on my talk page: You misunderstand me, I was saying this couldn't be added to the 613 (thou shall not add or remove). The only thing possible would be to the 7 (I do asume you know what the Sunheadren is). And that in itself is not that possible. It can't even be called unoffical, that is a clear violation of "thou shall not add or remove." This person you call Rabbi, has not got Smicha (Rabbincal Degree). Do you call some wacko on the street doctor, just because he calls himself a doctor and use him as a doctor? Do I hear a no? Why do people make weird exception for the title Rabbi? Don't give a person a title that needs a degree that they don't have. <a href="../../../2/2/0/User%7E220.233.48.200.html" title="User:220.233.48.200">220.233.48.200</a> 22:45, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Unless I'm mistaken, he was a Reform Rabbi as well as a professor of philosophy. I would gladly change any relevant reference if that proves to be false. Your criticism appears thoughtful and I would like to include it in the article. Please provide a reputable source that I can cite in the text. Bear in mind that Wikipedia has articles on ideas that aren't true such as <a href="../../../p/h/r/Phrenology.html" title="Phrenology">phrenology</a>. A good Wikipedia article doesn't endorse a controversial idea. It just reports both sides fairly.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Let's review what we have for a moment - it's a phrase which sums up the thesis of someone's book. Wonderful. Give the <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emil_Fackenheim_c4b5.html" title="Emil Fackenheim">author</a> a page, the book a page, but the phrase doesn't deserve an entry. (Heck - it's an admitted neologism for crying out loud). Secondly, the page is filled with things which are blatantly false - <i>Some Jews regard it as an addition to Jewish Talmudic Law.</i> - some Jews also regard <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis.html" title="Elvis">Elvis</a> as still alive, but that's not how we do things on WP. There is absolutely no normative claim under which this can be considered an addition to <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">talmudic</a> law. (For those of you don't know, the Talmud was written between 200-550 CE, and as such, it's a little hard for any 20th century person to be able to claim an addition). The claim that it's another <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitzvah.html" title="Mitzvah">mitzvah</a> is also nothing more than a misinformed joke. People frequently like to joke about the ""1th commandment" or the "614th mitzvah", but the truth is it's just that - a joke, or a phrase used to convey the importance of something with no real fact behind it. Take the worthwhile info and merge in <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emil_Fackenheim_c4b5.html" title="Emil Fackenheim">Emil Fackenheim</a>, but the rest of this page is poppycock. --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBachrach44_302c.html" title="User:Bachrach44">אריאל יהודה</a> 03:57, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That there are links to an article may speak in its favour, although not without exception, but the lack of such links may just mean that the area has so far been overlooked. I am sure there ar more links to any random pokemon figure than to Lutz, but that is just a result of some people's <s>obsession with</s> dedication and hard work on such matters, not an indication that the pokemon character in question is more important to the world at large. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 10:29, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>One of the explanations I've seen thrown around for the John Seigenthaler debacle <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/12/01/0030200&amp;from=rss" class="external autonumber" title="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/12/01/0030200&amp;from=rss" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> is that factually inaccurate information tends to go undetected in low traffic articles, and this article, in case you haven't noticed, is a low traffic article. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerraFrost_b968.html" title="User:TerraFrost">TerraFrost</a> 10:51, 25 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is an obvious problem, which at some point (soon I hope) will be remedied by moving new articles, as well as hopefully old articles displaying certain characteristics, into a holding area for fact-checking and cleanup, but it is not really an argument for deletion. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._a659.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr.">Seigenthaler</a> may not be as significant as the whole scandal has made him look, but the reason the article was little edited and the murder allegations went undetected for so long was not his lack of notability. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 11:39, 25 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Although I suppose it doesn't really, now, I believe the above does constitute cause for deletion because I believe that having no article is better than having a factually inaccurate article, and as I've already attempted to show, an article with as little traffic as this one is ammong the most likely of articles to have factually inaccurate information. It doesn't enrich the experience of most wikipedians (ie. it doesn't add anything), either, due to the low traffic this article garners. So, basically, I don't believe it really adds anything and I believe it actually has the potential to do harm, since it is, as I said, among the most likely of articles to have factually inaccurate information added to it (and since factually inaccurate information can, I believe, be harmful). <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerraFrost_b968.html" title="User:TerraFrost">TerraFrost</a> 23:47, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Aren't "not notable" and "not enough people edit this article" pretty much the same thing? Imho, if and only if an article is notable will it be a hub of activity. This article is not a hub of activity, and thus, pursuant to the previous statement, it isn't notable. Of course, since this guy passes per the "Professor test", I suppose further discussion ought not necessarily take place here, but rather, in the talk page for the "Professor test"... <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerraFrost_b968.html" title="User:TerraFrost">TerraFrost</a> 07:49, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No, "not enough people edit this article" is very often just a result of <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a>. I also think your argument confuses notability with current fame or celebrity status. A few weeks ago I created a stubby article on the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coll%C3%A8ge_de_Montaigu_11a6.html" title="Collège de Montaigu">Collège de Montaigu</a> in Paris, a college where <a href="../../../e/r/a/Erasmus.html" title="Erasmus">Erasmus of Rotterdam</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Calvin_f3ea.html" title="John Calvin">John Calvin</a>, and <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignatius_of_Loyola_8402.html" title="Ignatius of Loyola">Ignatius of Loyola</a> were students. Nobody had created that article in the previous five years of Wikipedia's existence, and nobody has edited it after me. Would you say that an educational institution which (at least partly) educated three of the most important individuals of Early Modern European history is <i>non-notable</i>? In a hundred years, Erasmus, Calvin, and Ignatius of Loyola will <i>still</i> be considered among the most important people of European history, while many of the favourite hockey players of today and everything having to do with <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">pokemon</a> is likely to be long forgotten. I'm not saying Mark Lutz is another Erasmus, and I <i>may</i> be wrong about the pokemon, but I think you get my point. While we have a systemic bias favouring Western over non-Western topics, there is also a systemic bias disfavouring many Western classical and academic fields, except in some small areas where we have a few dedicated users. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 09:57, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A Wikipedia article on "Asian fetish"ism? Please. Blatant racism, and does not belong on Wikipedia. -- Riscybusiness 03:21, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Really? I read over the article, and while it needs to be normalized and reference scholarly debate on the issue, I don't see this article as being racist. An article on this topic needs to exist, perhaps with a different name, because there is at least a widespread perception of the racist objectification of asian women. If this article is deleted, it will neccessarily be created again, and at least a portion of it is cited and well written. Keep and improve citation would be my vote at this point. I'm curious- what do you think is racist or outside of NPOV in this article?<a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 03:39, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Delete</b> - I myself would be the subject of a purported "Asian fetish" but there is no such thing. A <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetish.html" title="Fetish">fetish</a> refers to an inanimate object, such as clothing, that is the source of erotic feelings. By claiming that an Asian fetish exists, the author of this article is dehumanizing people from those countries. He provides a number of citations to back up his theory, but it still amounts to a neologism and original research. <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndomion_ea7e.html" title="User:Endomion">Endomion</a> 04:34, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>I suggest reading up some more on sexual fetishism. A "fetish" is indeed an inanimate object; however "sexual fetishism" is not a mere sum of the two parts, but has its own distinct meaning. There are plenty of sexual fetishes that are not inanimate objects. Say, there's the amputee fetish, in which people are attracted to a specific mutilated body part; an asian fetish is exactly the same, where people are attracted to specific types of body parts, i.e. those that make asians look distinct from other races. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyboy_Will_540f.html" title="User:Flyboy Will">Flyboy Will</a> 04:43, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Strong Keep, comment</b> some sources are probably overrepresented, I don't think there's been a phenomenon of distaste for the interracial relationship in Harry Potter, but you are antagonizing the issue by calling multiple editors that have overloaded this article "the author". To delete this article is to say that A. There is no sexual stereotyping of asians in American culture or media, B. There is no exploitation or harrassment of Asians because of sexual stereotypes and C. There is no controversy about perversion in men who either seek out or fantacise about Asian women. This article deals with this issue well, and if it is deleted, it will be created again- perhaps with a less careful analyzation of the issue. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/t/User_talk%7ELotusduck_3798.html" title="User talk:Lotusduck">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lotusduck_c661.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lotusduck">contribs</a>) 05:11, 25 December 2005.</small></dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> The article contains not one word about actual love and intermarriage. This is a startling omission. Such a union exists within my extended family.

<dd>The article is about fetishism, not about love and intermarriage. I don't think that the article charactarizes anything but the debate on the Asian sexual fetish. If the article cited instances as being true cultural understanding not fantasies based on some quintessential hollywood sexy Asian, if it pointed out a couple as being in love and not obsessed with how Asian women are different in bed, then it would not be neutral point of veiw. I do believe the article implies that any man who dates or marries an Asian is accused of being a fetishist, of being shallow and living out a racist fantasy.

<dd>This is true. I am known by my first name, say 90% of the time, and I'm sure someone you know is known by their first name most of the time too. Wednesday is almost never called Wednesday Adams, so the list should have her and almost every other character ever concieved of. By other rules, maybe this could be a list of characters that viewers never learn more than one name of. But again, that could be accomplished by adding a category tag to the end of each characters article, much as the "Fictional archaeologists" category works. -And hey, come to think of it, I have a question. Can any list be justified without supporting text, when cateogries will be far more updated and function exactly as well?</dd>

<dd>I liked this topic, and put a lot of work into it, and into trying to define it. I suggest supporters of this topic try and edit it, just a little. You may realize how many hairs can be split that can be used to include any character at all in this list, or how no information or enjoyment can be derived from this list. I see both of those as distinct and likely possibilities. Information can be added to lists, but it isn't. The only information added to a one-word name is the other names they are known by, aka why they shouldn't be on the list. Then we can sit down and add every villain on Stargate SG-1, every god from the show Hercules, every third character in any Shakespear play, all the miscellaneous dwarves from the beginning of The Hobbit and contemplate why anyone would want to see their names mixed together in alphabetical order. That's an impossible list even using the most stringent definitions and exclusions ever discussed in the talk page for this article. I helped nurse this baby to health, and I haven't yet heard a good reason not to kill it. I'm not making fun of supporters, I genuinely want somebody to explain it to me how this is useful, encyclopedic or even neat.<a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 07:05, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes they are. But how closely associated are they? Any work of fiction whatsoever will have a character whose name is suucint and easy to remember. You could write an article about the significance of such eponymous characters as you think are obviously important, but the issue of contention is that Mr.Spock and Anubis and Gimli contributed in some significant way together to naming conventions, and even that would be better served by an article.

<dd>I don't mean to challange the validity of anyone's opinion, but since this is meant to be a debate, what's your take on the guideline "Wikipedia is not a list repository of loosely related topics"? If this article could be a list of actually closely related topics, then the best way for you to defend it is to edit the article so that it somehow is not a collection of barely related persons.<a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 19:17, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You don't <i>have</i> to do anything. I just want a discussion, because I don't understand what you mean by useful. I've read the previous VfD, and all anyone ever said was that it wasn't the least useful list or that it was useful. Now, delete voters have agreed other deleters that have quoted policy and generally explained, or maybe in my case ranted away exactly what we mean by useless and incompletable. I'm glad that people can be bold, but I'm not ridiculing people by asking them to have some sort of discussion here. What is this list useful for? If you think that the "what this list isn't" section narrows the category enough to make it completable, I have to say that I wrote that section in it's entirety, and I don't think it makes the list completable at all.<a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 18:57, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Maybe, but most good articles on wikipedia have at least a possibility of becoming nearly comprehensive in their topic. When I see that most fictional swearwords start with an F, I have some reasonable expectation that this is based on a popular sample of fictional swear-words taken from reputable sources. When I get a sample from "List of fictional people known by one name" I can be sure that it is based on original research that is not verifiable or referencable by outside sources. You and I may agree that Scrooge, Mr. Bean and Spock are fictional characters known by one name, but when someone removed Mr. Bean, there was no criteria, no outside source to verify that he did belong on the list. The only applicable rules are the fairly arbitrary ones I created that allow for honorifics like Mr. That is why Wikipedia is not for original research. Can you cite a source that verifies whether Sideshow Bob is a one named character or a two named one? You could prove it by the ruberic at the beginning of the page that defines one name as literally one word- but that's not a trustworthy source- that's a un-reveiwed unedited tirade by me. So if anyone can site a newspaper or other real source to prove whether acronyms like ALF are really one word names or if The Cat is a one word name or two, then that will certainly make me re-think a few things. If this list could be something other than original research then someone should change it to that to save it, because right now it's original research, which will probably lead to it's deletion, I think.<a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 21:33, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>On the talk page, people have suggested that ALF does not belong on "List of fictional people known by one name" on the basis that ALF is an acronym, and that this means that it is more than one name in and of itself. What can we reference to determine the validity of Alf or names with "the" in them? Currently, even Sideshow Bob is on the list, (I think that's two names as much as Peter Parker is two names.) what source can we cite to settle whether or not he should be? We could come to a consensus, but that still amounts to original research, which is what wikipedia is not. To be legitimate we must be able to cite a source that comments on the one-named-ness of given characters. <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 03:24, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What you need to do is define the criteria, like you have done, and then use footnotes for those troublesome cases like Sideshow Bob, drawing on the abundance of good sources like newspapers. We need careful documentation of fictional characters' first names. This is the type of question that always comes up, and given the level of misinformation out there, we need to set people straight. Personally, I think the list should have two parts: 1) fictional characters that have no documented second name, such as Spock; 2) fictional characters that have two names but are most commonly known by just one, such as Scrooge. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 04:08, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But the topic of the article "fictional people known by one name" itself does not have a source to be cited. There are sources that can tell us that there is a Simpsons' character named sideshow bob, but the actual topic of the article is purely original research. List of fictional Gay Lesbian Bisexual and Transgender people can have an actual source citing the importance of certain characters being on the list, even going into the obscure. For fictional people known by one name, we might be able to find someone, somewhere writing an article on Spock's ubiquity as it relates to the show not using his last name. We're just as likely not to find such an article, even given the widespread discussion of his popularity. So while characters first names and last names can be carefully sourced to ensure accuracy, can the significance of a characters' only having one name be sourced? Can the significance of all of these characters only having one name be sourced?<a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 04:28, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Questions/Comments</b>: Even within the article there are conflicting/ambiguous descriptions of what qualifies for the list. In the lead to the article, it says the fictional character is to be <i>"known unambigously by one of the following ... first or last name, one word nickname, only known name."</i> Then under the description of what the list is not: <i>"Characters that are usually called by one name but their full name is easily recalled, like Wednesday Adams, are not included in this list...One example of this would be Radar from M*A*S*H, who has a real full name comprised of several words, but that name is very obscure information within the show... This is not a list of people with a one-word nickname, or a one word name that they are often called. Only characters with a one word nickname and an unknown or very obscure full name or other names. So Superman is not on the list because all of his names total three: Superman, Clark and Kent."</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>— These descriptions are ambiguous. If a character has a title, e.g. "Mr." or "Captain", do they still qualify? Spock or Mr. Spock? Captain Kirk or Kirk? In the case of Radar from M*A*S*H, he is well-known as Radar O'Reilly. Frank Burns most commonly called him "Corporal O'Reilly", so how does he qualify? How does "Holmes", aka Sherlock Holmes, qualify? The "Fonz" — Mr. &amp; Mrs. Cunningham always called him Arthur (his given name). "Neo" from the Matrix — Mr. Smith was always calling him "Mr. Anderson". I'm not an avid fan of any of the shows, but I knew these off the top of my head. — <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> @ 05:12, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree - this is my point. What really qualifies? If Radar qualifies, then Capt Kirk does because he is known unambigously as Capt. Kirk (like "Mr. Spock", the title doesn't seem to count). In the case of the others, there are multiple names that they are well-known by, not all being one word.:</li>

<li>ERcheck, I am tending away from arguing that this is a sprawling, unrelated article, and trying to explain that this article is original thought, not a documentation of a real reported phenomenon. But you are right: The names currently on the list set a precedent that all names of all characters ever concieved of should be on this list-</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, if there were some pressing need for a list of fictional people known by one name, it still would need to be a documented concern in newspapers, books or scholarly journals. For instance- there is, I think, a pressing need for a documentation of movies with a dream-self discovery theme, like The Wizard of Oz and The Labrynth- but if I can't find a source that ties these films together as important besides the movies themselves, I should not make such an article, even if I think the connection is clear, sure and important. Because wikipedia is not a lazy persons' publisher. If we say that names with honorifics can be included on this list based on my opinion that is baseless gratification of me, that is me pushing my ideas onto wikipedia with no base in verifiable sources, and that is wrong.<a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 18:04, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>This still amounts to original research, so while my rubric dictates some of what qualifies, my rubric is not a real source. If I were some really strange kind of reporter, and the beginning description about what should and shouldn't apply to a list of fictional people was an article in a real newspaper, and then said article became really popular for no reason and someone thought to make a wiki article on it, then this would all be legitimate.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> The argument is very common these days, and there can be plenty room for both sides in the article. To use reductio ad absurdum, there's an article on holocaust denial and the wikipedia is not actually denying the holocaust. (I'm not stating the view that the two are equivalent; I am just making the point that the subject is very relevant, and it's existence does not imply the support of the belief that Christmas is under attack.)</li>
<li>The article is a morass of POV garbage - it's initial creation was someone making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>* The Anti-Christian groups are trying to hide the facts that they are suing us over Christmas. I received threats to not put up Christmas lights on my house, or else I would be sued. Check court records and see how many lawsuits are filed over Christmas, then you will see that there is a real war on Christmas. Ironic that the vote to delete this article was made on Christmas, when most Christians are busy and not on Wikipedia to defend the article. You can really see the bias there by the Anti-Christians and their hate. --Charles Schram 01:23, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

The only people who ever want information on this are the people who already know everything on them. Most importantly, this all falls under the Original Research label. I don't suppose there have been any legitimate literary studies of Kell Tainer as a character. I know the precedent so far has been in favor of Pokemon characters and video game weapons keeping their articles, and I couldn't disagree with that more. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyboy_Will_540f.html" title="User:Flyboy Will">Flyboy Will</a> 05:17, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Well, when we begin talking about every person on death row, my only objection is a number problem. Plenty of folks spend only a little time there, before being commuted, retried, or killed in prison. The advantage to sticking only to the executed is that those cases have proved enduring and compelling enough for the state to go forward with the sentence of death. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 21:19, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've never really heard of a lengthy capital murder conviction that <i>hasn't</i> had ample state-wide press (at least), prompted commentary on crime and criminal justice from public figures, and motivated legal response through attempted reform.

<li>You seem to be arguing that everything that makes the news should end up in Wikipedia and that therefore we had no reason to split off Wikinews. Other than providing an occasion for the pro-DP and anti-DP activists to make their commentary, I find zero evidence of any lasting impact here and this case is far less noteworthy than the December 2005 South Carolina ice storm which does not appear to have an article, nor should it, despite receiving far more press coverage and causing the deaths of more people. <span style="font-family:cursive"><a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a></span> <a href="../../../c/a/e/User_talk%7ECaerwine_f9c2.html" title="User talk:Caerwine"><small style="font-family:sans-serif;color:darkred;">Caerwhine</small></a> 19:53, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The difference between a Wikinews only topic and a Wikipedia topic is one of depth, scope, and importance of the topic. Personally, I'd argue that "Sam, the world's ugliest dog" is why Wikinews exists separately -- that is "news of the day"-type story. As it happens, I think Sam is in WP too. Sigh. In any event, serious affairs of law and state (which every US execution is) are exactly why encyclopedias were made in the first place, and they still form the very heart of what I call encyclopedic. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 21:36, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Well then, I think we have reached an honest, very deep, impasse of meaning. To me, if an encyclopedia exists for anything, it exists for to cover significant topics of philosophy and history, of which state executions (and those so executed) are a chapter. Sincerely, I cannot see how an ugly dog meets notability requirements, where state executed fail. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 23:01, 27 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The execution of condemned criminals is encyclopedic. With rare exceptions, the story of each person executed is not encyclopedic. Questions of philosophy and history are best addressed in general articles, not in articles about individuals that do not provide any point on which to hang a unique argument that could not be repeated in every other article about an executed individual. (this seems to be from Dalbury)
<ul>
<li>There, I also disagree. Each executed individual is a worthy subject of criminological (or, if they are wrongly executed, sociological) study. Researchers who study crime do not develop generalized patterns simply from the Ted Bundys and Charles Mansons of the world. Even the simple facts of their childhood are of scholarly (and, often, macabre popular) interest. Additionally, each capital murder is certain notably to affect its community, region, or state, as discussed above. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 00:17, 28 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps, but this is an encyclopedia not a compendium of all human knowledge. The mission of an encyclopedia is to provide a concise crystalization of the details and pointers to where the detailed information of limited interest can be found for those seeking greater knowledge about a narrow topic. A pointer to the minutiae of Mr. Bates' case in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_individuals_executed_in_North_Carolina_f1e0.html" title="List of individuals executed in North Carolina">List of individuals executed in North Carolina</a> article would more than satisfy that requirement. <span style="font-family:cursive"><a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a></span> <a href="../../../c/a/e/User_talk%7ECaerwine_f9c2.html" title="User talk:Caerwine"><small style="font-family:sans-serif;color:darkred;">Caerwhine</small></a> 04:47, 28 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't oppose that idea in theory, but I would wish to see it applied consistently across the 'pedia. As I'm sure you'll agree it isn't, and my concern is that I don't want the executed given less extensive treatment solely on the basis of their "<i>evil</i>". I strongly believe that an encyclopedia should cover the best and worst of human deeds in equal measure. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 15:19, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>To clarify my position, I have seen editors contend that executions in the United States are more notable than executions in the Third World. I reject that argument as inherently biased. It is neither possible nor wise to catalog all capital criminals everywhere. If Wikipedia repeats an error about a school, little real harm is done. If we insert the wrong name or remain unaware when a conviction is overturned, then anyone in the world with an Internet connection may read false and damaging information about an innocent person. Even posthumous vindications matter for the sake of the surviving relatives. I find more potential encyclopedic value in death row inmates than in executed prisoners. To judge by the comments of some editors, it appears some people's time would be better spent writing for <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesty_International_6202.html" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty International</a> than for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 22:11, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

<p><b>Support</b> I don't think so. He is very well known in Canada for his extensive work on the BlackBerry wireless communication system and solutions that he developed in collaboration with independent software vendors, universities, and carriers. I would like to see mention of new technical standards as well, if an authoritative source can be found for this information, but I do not have this. I fixed some grammar and added mention of the publication of the developer journal to the article, though this may be less significant.216.9.243.104 08:53, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Delete</b> Virtually every google hit is some comment by this guy on other people's blogs. A Proquest literature search, including the ABI/INFORM database, returns 0 hits. <a href="../../../u/u/c/User%7EUucp_ab6c.html" title="User:Uucp">Uucp</a> 14:58, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Support</b> I wrote the original article. I disagree with using the number of google or proquest hits as a basis for notability for this subject. Four reasons: 1. The fine details of much engineering work is not published on the web because of companies' tight control over trade secrets and patents, so most google hits return pages dealing with his personal views and not professional work. Perhaps others can provide more data in this area. 2. Some third-party publications, such as development of technical standards for wireless communication through the IEC (international engineering consortium) to which he is known to have contributed, is published in conference proceedings but not picked up by proquest. I'm pretty sure I have print copies of these proceedings and if I can find them will cite them in an edit to the article. 3. Nor are the contents of print publications, such as Resource magazine and the blackberry developer journal, picked up by google. I am omitted references to these articles until I could find a suitable source for citation. I did however use google as a search for the quotations. 4. Where he has been employed by RIM since 1996 when it was a tiny company means that he was an early and influential player in wireless data communication, as they did not even release the blackberry until 1999, now there are around 4 million users of this device and the historical significance of the subject in this area alone should qualify this as a worthy article, certainly not vanity. This was my first draft of this article and I was hoping other contributors could fill in more information. - Frank R.Fragnal 17:22, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The subject could very well be notable, but the article in its current form does not prove the importance of the subject. The subject may be connected to the BlackBerry device, but the article fails to explain how. Yes, I agree that Google isn't always the best place to look to prove notability, but the article has no other references or publications posted, so it is my only source. I don't want to imply anything by this but I think it should be mentioned that the only editors to the article were Fragnal and 216.9.243.104, who both posted within 12 hours of each other.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sassan_Sanei&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sassan_Sanei&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> I have not voted yet, but plan to when I have made my decision.&#160;— <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheKMan_941b.html" title="User:TheKMan"><b><font color="#0000FF">The</font><font color="#FF0000">KMan</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheKMan_98f4.html" title="User talk:TheKMan"><font color="#000000"><sup><u>talk</u></sup></font></a> 17:45, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Support</b> I have worked in the wireless industry in Canada for several years, and in landline communication before that, and can affirm the importance of Sassan Sanei's contributions to wireless data communication standards including the BlackBerry system. 65.93.23.84 01:18, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Neutral</b>. <i>Reasons For:</i> While many of Sassan Sanei's Google hits refer to his blog, he is mentioned in a CNN article from 2001 <a href="http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/ptech/08/28/RIM.wireless.developements.idg/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/ptech/08/28/RIM.wireless.developements.idg/index.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>, another article from 2001 <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/hn/xml/01/08/24/010824hnrim.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/hn/xml/01/08/24/010824hnrim.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>, and there is a short description of him on a technology conference page <a href="http://www.iec.org/events/2002/supercomm/attendees/t41c.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iec.org/events/2002/supercomm/attendees/t41c.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>. The article is well writen, and might have some importance. <i>Reasons Against:</i> The few significant references to Sanei are from archived/old internet news articles from 2001. The only page linking to the article in question is the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Waterloo_4517.html" title="University of Waterloo">University of Waterloo</a>, and the addition was made by the anonymous contributor to this article. I think I should also note that there is a possibility of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">sock puppetry</a> or <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html#Meatpuppets" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">meat puppetry</a>. May the "let several people know" comment by Fragnal be noted.

<p>Thanks for the suggestions. If I find more references I will add them to the article. I included the quotations which came up on various Google searches to give some insight into Sassan Sanei's views on things that have to do with more than just blackberry (personality insight). I have no objections if others want to edit or remove the others as TheKMan suggested and I can see that 65.93.23.84 already deleted one as "irrelevant" which I thought was actually an interesting one but I will not argue over it. Have we reached a consensus on whether to keep or delete?Fragnal 19:12, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Comment: Every Wikipedia article (except protected ones, of course) can be edited by anyone with a working web browser, but the policy still stands that Wikipedia is not a place to write articles about oneself or one's own work. I'm a published poet with a book available for sale, but there's nothing on Wikipedia about me, because no one has cared to take enough note. I can't start an article with my name or the name of my book, just because others can edit it.

<li><b>Conflicted</b>. Sounds like an extraordinarily interesting project, and verifiable, to boot. But I suppose "interesting" isn't enough to establish "notable." An interesting project <i>idea</i> doesn't deserve an article in Wikipedia, but an interesting ongoing <i>project</i> with some discernable progress toward success does. To me it all comes down to the fact that the person who started and runs the project probably does <i>not</i> have standing to judge notability for Wikipedia. So what I'd really like to see is, either the article is deleted and if it is truly notable presumably some other, unrelated Wikipedians will create a new article on it, or else said Wikipedians will rework the article so that it's not written by someone with a vested interest in promoting the project. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> (<a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jdavidb_e085.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jdavidb">contribs</a>) 22:06, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Having looked at this, I would find it more likely to be considered notable if some of the longer books were completed, such as one of the five books of Moses, or one of the Gospels. As it is, it's difficult to truly answer the question "Will this project still be around in a few years?" and "Will it actually be completed by 2009?" Wikipedia does not need to look like sourceforge.net, full of pages for every incomplete project concept. That's not to discount the value of the work already done; that's just to raise the question of whether or not enough work has been done to justify calling it "notable." If CPDV has enough value to stand on its own without needing Wikipedia to bring attention to it, then it should be in Wikipedia. If it needs Wikipedia in order to attract enough attention that the project will succeed, it does not belong here. Kind of a catch-22, I know. It should be up to the project itself to establish merit with its track record. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> (<a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jdavidb_e085.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jdavidb">contribs</a>) 22:12, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This article on the CPDV differs substantially from someone writing an article about themselves or about a book they wrote because it is a version of the Bible. It is 23% completed by a count of the verses. The Book of Psalms is completed; the Psalms is the one book of the Bible that is perhaps most often published on its own. Also, I read somewhere in Wikipedia that some articles are accepted by someone writing about their own work (can't find it now). Therefore, I suggest instead of deleting this article, changing it to a stub, so that other persons can begin a new article from that point. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonconte_1841.html" title="User:Ronconte">Ronconte</a> 00:03, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It isn't a value judgment on the work, which may well be fantastic, on the level of St. Jerome himself. Should anyone who starts his own translation of the Bible get into an encyclopedia? Wikipedia's policy answer to that question is "no." Just as claiming to be God (a much more important sort of claim than making a Bible, don't you think?) isn't enough to get one put into an encyclopedia, making a version of the Bible is not enough, either. <b>Notability</b> has to be established, and it cannot be established by the fiat of the writer/translator/worker in question. Wikipedia records notability. It doesn't create it. It's not a place to get press for one's work. If your work truly is notable, making some sort of verifiable impact on Biblical studies/religion/etc., someone else will start the article. You suggest changing the article to a stub rather than deleting it, but is that because you fear that it wouldn't otherwise see the light of day? If so, then that even more proves the point about the need for notability to be established by someone other than the one with a personal interest. —<a href="../../../a/s/d/User%7EASDamick_bcf2.html" title="User:ASDamick"><font color="blue"><b><i>A.S.

<li>For what it's worth, I found this article while looking for a public domain Catholic Bible for a software project. The CPDV is exactly what I was looking for. Well, it will be when it's done anyway.&#160;:-) But Mr. Conte has more than enough done for me to get started. I'd like the article to stay. Or I would also consider writing a repleacement article once I am more familiar with the project. --LawfulGood 08:48, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>thanks for popping in and clarifying a bit, Perfecto. Unfortunately, I can't do that. Asides from the entry in WikiPedia, we've kept a low profile until now intentionally, however we will be posting a new website in the next few days, and perhaps that will help clarify some things for you guys from our side. I think that, from a 'uniqueness' and 'utility' standpoint, Thothica deserves mention, and will likely will soon for other reasons, as well. If I may make a suggestion for a compromise, perhaps removing the notice and putting the article on 'probation' for a few months would be fair - if by then we don't meet guidelines and someone wants to, reconsider deletion then. Thothica IS unique, it's more significant than it currently appears to be, and does serve a very useful purpose to a number of people...and it is an interesting project and informative article, according to those who have contacted us based on the information in the article. and again, as I understand it, the guidelines are just that - ONLY guidelines that editors/moderators can use IF they so choose, but they are not requirements articles are "required" to meet. thanks in advance... <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbyray_a7bb.html" title="User:Bobbyray">BobbyRay</a> 04:57, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>sorry u look at it that way. that's not the correct interpretation - i said it was the 'only' exposure we had, not that that was the goal of having the article there. we've not promoted the thing *at all* and i posted it here at the suggestion of someone else who felt that, due to the nature of what we were up to, it would be appropriate. That you choose to interpret my being open into an admission of improper use and conflict of interest, well, sorry. poor choice of words, i guess. Anyway, i can see i'm wasting my time and your time. Do what you will. I can only hope you will reconsider, but i can see which way the wind's blowing on this subject. Anyway, good luck with wikipedia - as i say in my user description, i think this is a great idea, and i'm sorry that for some reason someone's decided we don't belong. but i have to say, i'm perhaps not the only one 'conflicted' - but at least i admitted sensitivity to the issue and tried consciously not to step over the line. peace. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbyray_a7bb.html" title="User:Bobbyray">BobbyRay</a> 05:19, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Metacomment</b>: Irrelevant comment, Quarl. Anyone, including me starts somewhere - posts a first comment/edit somewhere, probably (as was the case with me) anonymously. The number of contributions to WP of anyone has no bearings on the relevance or right to voice one's opinion. And obviously, if someone feels s/he's been wronged, s/he'll muster support from other community members. That's normal and natural. And if I am not entirely mistaken, this very same principle that you now call sock-puppet was the base of Wikipedia itself, not? Think back a little before applying different measures for the same thing. Helmar 10:06, 27 December 2005 (GMT+0200)

<li>Quarl, please understand: all i am trying to accomplish here is to prevent what i STRONGLY feel, as a long time wikipedia user, the unfair deletion of the article. I don't think it takes up unnecessary space, i do feel it is informative and appropriate here, and i think it is not necessary to delete it. i do not control what others say. and i do not control what happens here. however the article in question was posted in good faith, and i believe it deserves to be here. the guidelines on the WP WEB page are just that - guidelines, and not policies, so they do NOT need to be interpreted as if they were. Plus, they seem to be more or less arbitrary - certainly not based on any research? i'm not sure i understand why ur so vociferously opposed to it, however for me, it seems quite an inoffensive article at worst, and at least interesting to a certain subset of users. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbyray_a7bb.html" title="User:Bobbyray">BobbyRay</a> 04:10, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Greetings, all! I am one of the co-founders of Sonork, the IM Thothica is based on. I'm new to WP (except for one anonymous change some months ago). As one of its pilot phase members I am not new to Thothica, though. I find the discussion here utterly irrelevant if not downright absurd. If WP aims to be a representative and relevant source of information, entries like these IMO form the very backbone. The entry may not be encyclopedic at this very moment, but it's also a Catch-22, because it never may attain this goal if it gets deleted here. Given that the search engines don't yet list the site itself, most of the members have come via the WP listing itself - at least according to my ad-hoc 'survey' among the Thothica members on my list, while doing some research about online communities. Also as a result of the notice on the Thothica page and the subsequent mud-fight on this page, I have taken the liberty to edit the entry, removing spelling mistakes, restructuring the content, thus making it more readable. I have also removed those parts that may be 'self-promoting'. That said, from what I have read above, it seems it's not entirely clear to the editors themselves which rule (?) the entry violated. I at least hope to have removed any remaining issues other than that the entry on Dec 27th, 2005 is not encyclopedic. If this is the KO criterion, then remove the entry, otherwise keep it up and monitor its hits, plus the continuous editing and extension of the entry itself. I certainly advocate the latter option, hence my editing of the entry itself. As the entry doesn't violate any rule other than possibly being a little premature (official launch happening in a few weeks), why not keep it for now and revisit it at the end of January - I am sure the Wiki has a feature for this, not? - <a href="http://www.helmar.org" class="external text" title="http://www.helmar.org" rel="nofollow">Helmar Rudolph, Cape Town,RSA</a> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Helmar org (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Helmar_org_5218.html" title="Special:Contributions/Helmar org">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li>Helmar's point is rather spurious. Wikipedia is WP:NOT not an advertising venue. Period. End of discussion. Down that path lies madness and spam. Re-list the site if and when it becomes notable for itself; in the interim <b>delete</b>. 24.71.91.173 08:20, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The I'd say that in the interests of fairness, other similar articles should be deleted. "Notability" is not a fair criterion, IMHO - it's just an indicator of longevity and/or size, and as guideline, the 'Notability' criterion is itself under review for deletion. Our project is interesting for other reasons, and it wasn't posted here for promotional purposes, period. It was posted because it was different, unique, and interesting - and possibly significant. You should look at this with a Big Picture view, too - what does it say when large, established corporate sites and services are included, but small, unknown private ones are excluded, regardless of their uniqueness or utility? But I've stated the case in case for keeping the article too much already. It goes or stays based on a decision made by whoever will make that decision. Maybe it gets reposted later, maybe not. I'm just sorry it's been such a big issue. Partly my fault, but I think largely not. In any case, I propose ending the discussion here. I've had my say. Regardless of how this comes out, wikipedia is still one of the best resources on the internet for information of any kind, and my opinion in that sense won't change. And in case someone wishes to twist THAT comment into having some self-serving, unintended, intent, please don't - it's just an honest and sincere comment I felt compelled to make...as all the rest of mine have been, regardless of the editorializing that has accompanied them. peace... <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbyray_a7bb.html" title="User:Bobbyray">BobbyRay</a> 09:37, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>go for it. Nice to see that 'voluntary' guidelines with arbitrary conditions (themselves under re-evaluation) are now written stone and 'must' be adhered to. Yeah, sour grapes, and I know it. But just so you know, I'm not about to go running around nominating other articles for deletion. It's not worth the effort, really, and I'm sure would enamour me even less to those In Charge here. I also won't repost the Thothica article, as - despite the stated 'reasoning' used here to the contrary - I'm certain that the motivation for removing it, if not at least 99% percent of the reason for the antipathy towards it, is because i happen to be both the article's author as well as the project's founder. Lack of foresight on my part, I guess, and I'm guessing some here have long memories. Perhaps someone else one day may deem it worthy of inclusion post something, but I'm not going to hold my breath - it's not our goal to become "famous" or a "household name" outside of the limited subset of people who'd find it interesting. Perhaps it may, eventually, become large enough by some of your 'guidelines' for inclusion - ironically enough, guidelines that I now (and likely will then, too, if they're not changed in the meantime (which at least in the case of notability appears likely)) object to.

<li><b>Delete</b>, fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and the contributor seems to think wikipedia is an advertising vehicle. Bobbyray, that Wikipedia is the ONLY place you've advertised doesn't make it any better; it makes it much worse. I don't go to Encyclopedia Britannica to look for something that has never been published anywhere else. That's what the Yellow Pages are for. Longwinded responses aren't going to help your article, it's doomed. Perhaps you need to refresh yourself what wikipedia is, rather than attacking everything it is. The reason for removing it has nothing to do with you being the founder, and here's a tip: Martyrdom <i>never</i> works here.

<li>golbez, as you eloquently demonstrated, i've come to realize that no matter what I say, it will be misinterpreted and used against keeping the article. I know what wikipedia is and what it's for. My intent wasn't to advertise. My objections are related to fairness, mainly related to the standards being applied and how. But due to me being the author and being the founder of the project that's the subject of it, my position as defender of the article is untenable - nothing I can say can help, and anything I say can be turned around to appear self-serving. There are also bigger issues, but I won't go into them here. The most frustrating thing is my integrity being called into question and being unable to defend myself. Anyway, I accept the decision - that doesn't make me a martyr, just a realist. As you said, 'it's doomed', and I see that. Delete it.

<li>Sorry, I posted it in its present state just to see if I had the formatting correct so far. Needs improvement, I haven’t figured out how to do internal or external links yet. Thanks for catching the Rouge/Rogue error, I never have been able to figure out how to spell French words (they seem to relate to vowels in a way entirely alien to me) and I did run it through a spell checker (though not for God's sake). FYI, I went out of my way to leave out any POV, I hated playing warrior and enjoy playing Warlock, so looking at he article now I can see accidentally put a reverse bias in instead. Expected to have time to develop the article as I learned how Wiki articles are formatted (was just happy to figure out to use three equals signs for subheadings on this go), and wasn’t expecting such a strong ire, nor such an immediate reaction. I use Wiki all the time and figured the first article I wrote should be about something fairly innocuous and uncontroversial (like a silly video game) and one that I am relatively familiar with from all the articles/post I’ve read on the subject. Had no Idea that I would be befouling such sacrosanct and hallowed ground with my “fancruft.” Much thanks for so swiftly pointing out the error of my ways. Wiping article now, you guys have fun.

<li><b>Keep.</b> I suggest other voters look into this more carefully before discussing what to do. Believe it or not, World of Warcraft is a category at Wikipedia with three subcategories. Obviously it's impossible to merge all of that with the main article. If some of it belongs at Wikibooks then it ought to be studied systematically, not done piecemeal. Most of these articles have an active base of contributors. This isn't the mad project of one individual. There are issues to be addressed, such as the overuse of screen shots. However since none of the rest of this material is under challenge and this particular article fits within a framework that's being accepted, my opinion is to let it stay. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 19:10, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Verifiability for this character is very sketchy: the only real verifiable information about him is that he existed and owned land in Dorset in 1086.

If it is due to start in January 2006 then I would presume that all the auditions have now taken place making the article out of date. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 16:01, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

So, when voting note only 500 members are claimed<a href="http://www.calgarydollars.ca/about.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.calgarydollars.ca/about.html" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. Even this number isn't verified. A google doesn't seem to reveal info not provided by the group itself. I lived my whole life in Calgary, and I've never heard of this thing. It's just some little groups project, with no signficance. I think the article gives quite a false impression that this stuff is actually accepted currency. It seems this article is just an attempt at free advertising for an unheard of program. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 17:17, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There is the precedent of many other local currencies (or "community currencies", "complementary currencies") with articles. See, for example, <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_currency.html#Modern_Local_Currencies" title="Local currency">Local currency#Modern Local Currencies</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7ECommunity_currencies_0eb2.html" title="Category:Community currencies">Category:Community currencies</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Canadian_community_currencies_407e.html" title="List of Canadian community currencies">List of Canadian community currencies</a>. Whether or not someone living in a city of about a million people has heard of everything that's gone on in that city is not a measure of it's validity for inclusion. I haven't heard of every single thing mentioned in the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary%2C_Alberta_79e8.html" title="Calgary, Alberta">Calgary, Alberta</a> article and I've spent most of my life living here.

<li>Well, I haven't heard of everything in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> either, but I sure heard of the currency mentioned there. I'm sure every single person (even tourist) in Canada has heard of the Canadian dollar. One attribute of currency, is it tends to be known where it's used. But, I concede the mere fact I personally don't know of something, doesn't mean much, and we have to g--<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 17:36, 26 December 2005 (UTC)o by published sources. So, I'll wait and see. But, when you do have time to update the article, I would urge you, as somebody familiar with it, to rewrite it completely with the non-Calgarian, even non-Canadian in mind. Consider the reader who's just learning about Calgary, knows nothing of our economic system, and could be misinformed by this. While I am certain you wrote this in good faith, and the program is operated in good faith, I fear allowing an article like this, and its precident, opens the door to others to make similiar articles, about a "currency" that aren't in such good faith. When you have time, I request the first two or three sentences make explicitly clear exactly (or as much as possible) what scope/utility this "currency" has (how many people use it, how many organizations accept it, how widely known it is). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 23:04, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The "local currency" means the currency that's generally accepted in a local area. A (clueless) foreign tourist coming to Calgary, who asks their travel agent "What's the local currency" would be told of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_dollar.html" title="Canadian dollar">Canadian dollar</a> (assuming they had of an honest travel agent). No travel agent would mention <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Dollars_de1a.html" title="Calgary Dollars">Calgary Dollars</a>. A tourist asking the same question of Hong Kong would be told of the <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_dollar_2a8b.html" title="Hong Kong dollar">Hong Kong dollar</a>. Now, if you read <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Dollars_de1a.html" title="Calgary Dollars">Calgary Dollars</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_dollar_2a8b.html" title="Hong Kong dollar">Hong Kong dollar</a> (in their current state) both give the impression that the currency is real and fully useable. Of course only one of those two articles is factually accurate. Here's a quote from the factually correct article "<i>The issue of local currency was then resumed by the Hong Kong Government and the authorized local banks after the emancipation.</i>". Here's a quote from the misleading article "<i>Calgary Dollars is a local currency ...</i>". Notice how both assert they are a local currency, yet they use the term in quite a different manner. Also, I just removed Category:Currency of Canada, as there's actually a law that says nobody can claim something to be the Currency of Canada without authorization of the Canadian government. This is really going to far. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 17:36, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree with you about Category:Currency of Canada; Calgary Dollars are not currency over the whole of Canada and thus obviously don't belong in that category. However, your insistence on an overly narrow meaning of 'currency' and 'local currency' make the rest of your point false. Yes, in the case of your question to the travel agent 'local currency' means the Canadian Dollar, but 'a local currency' also has a well-attested specific meaning which applies in the case of Calgary Dollars: witness the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22local%20currency%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22local%20currency%22" rel="nofollow">top Google hits</a> for the phrase. 'Currency', similarly, is not limited to nationally-issued monetary units: as <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=currency" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=currency" rel="nofollow">the dictionary</a> has it, currency is 'money in any form when in actual use as a medium of exchange.' Calgary Dollars, though not widely used, certainly fit within that description.</dd>

<dd>Note also that your use of the <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_dollar_2a8b.html" title="Hong Kong dollar">Hong Kong</a> article is not the clearest example: Hong Kong is actually a part of China, and therefore the fact that Hong Kong dollars exist seperately from <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_currency.html" title="Chinese currency">Chinese currency</a> means that they are much more likely to be termed a local currency than, say, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Dollar_585c.html" title="Canadian Dollar">Canadian Dollars</a>. - <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquibix_398c.html" title="User:Squibix">squibix</a> 19:04, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You're making the false assumption that geography/locality means the same thing for <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Dollars_de1a.html" title="Calgary Dollars">Calgary Dollars</a> that it does for <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_dollar_2a8b.html" title="Hong Kong dollar">Hong Kong dollars</a>. It doesn't. <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Dollars_de1a.html" title="Calgary Dollars">Calgary Dollars</a> (like apples) are worth something to whomever wishes to accept them, anywhere on Earth. They are worth no more, and no less, in Calgary, Edmonton, or Hong Kong for that matter. Nobody must take them, and most people won't take them, even in Calgary. The word "Calgary" exists in their name, but they have no *legal* tie to Calgary. Hong Kong dollars are legal tender and *must* be accepted for certain purposes by certain persons in certain situations in a certain place (the exact rules of when/where is beside the point, and I realize other currencies are used). By the same token the Canadian dollar *must* be accepted as settlement of certain debts in certain places in certain circumstances. If I eat at a Calgary resteraunt that advertises a meal for ten dollars, but doesn't say what type of dollar, and I leave ten Calgary Dollars at the table, and walk off, I've just committed a criminal offense. If I had left ten Canadian dollars, I would have legally settled the debt, and the resteraunt could not legally demand any further or alternate payment.</p>
<p>Also, I suggest the growing mistaken use of "local currency" has resulted from the fact there are so few *real* local currenies, like that in Hong Kong, and people just don't know real ones exist. But, our articles are supposed to inform, not misinform. Nobody's explained what beneficial knowledge this article provides. We don't write artcles for those in the know, but for those who don't know. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 23:06, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>Comment</i> I would like to point out, that the web notability rules state that a website can be proven notable if it mantains an Alexa rating of at least 10,000. You yourself stated that SSS's Alexa rating is 144,750. That's well above the minimum requirement of 10,000. Even if you try to dodge the issue by considering SSS a webcomic it even beats the webcomics' minimum requirement of 100,000. Not only that, but SSS is also an established website (seven years old, with a fan base of hundreds) that has set a trend (inspired dozens of other SSB fanfictions and spinoffs). Not only does SSS pass the web notability rules, it passes them with flying colors.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only real thing that should be discussed here, I think, is wether the Superpowers section is vanity. (I don't believe it is, but even if it was that would only be reason to edit it out, NOT to delete the entire page.) Believe me when I say I do understand why it may appear as vanity, since it is a section written about the writers themselves. But what you need to realize is that the Superpowers ARE SSS. I don't even mean just the notable Superpowers who did really big things, like Lemmy Koopa. All of the Superpowers are an extremely important part of the SSS storyline. SSS is a website that is defined not only by what the staff members add but by who the staff members are and how they interact with each other. Trying to say we can't talk about the Superpowers in an article about SSS would be like trying to tell a history book writer that they can't talk about the Presidents in their discussion of the history of the United States. Sure, we could do it but it would result in an incomplete article that doesn't tell even half of the story. Knight9910 5:14, 26 December 2005</p>

<li><i>Comment</i> Actually, Alexa rank is backwards. That is, for a site to be notable, its Alexa rank, according to Wikipedia, should go from 1 to 10,000, and in case of a web comic, from 1 to 100,000. An Alexa rank of 144,750 fails to both goal. As for the fan base, notability requests a forum with at least 5,000 members. Remember that AfD is just a test to see if the community believes the page is notable enough to stay in Wikipedia. If it fails now, nothing prevents it to come back in a year to see if, by then, it becomes notable enough. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 11:26, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Even so, this article deserves to be here. First, I double-checked Alexa. That 144,750 is for SMBHQ, <i>not</i> SSS. SMBHQ is SSS's parent site. It is not SSS. Second, the web notability rules state that a website can be listed on wikipedia if it is an established site that has set a trend. (Actually, someone took that out, but it should be there for obvious reasons. And no, not just because I want it there.) SSS is an established website. It has been on the internet for seven years, having gone through three seasons and acquired a fanbase of hundreds, if not thousands, although admittedly most of said fans do not post on the message board. It has also set a trend, having been the first massive SSB fanfiction, and having single-handedly spawned hundreds more.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I am saying to you is that Alexa ratings and forum members aren't an accurate gauge of a website's notability. For example, <a href="../../../n/e/g/Neglected_Mario_Characters_3f59.html" title="Neglected Mario Characters">Neglected Mario Characters</a> is also a child site of SMBHQ, meaning it has the same Alexa rating as SSS. NC also has only a meager forum population of a couple hundred at best. If ratings and forum members are the only things that matter then NC's wikipedia entry should be deleted as well. You know, nevermind the fact that NC was THE FIRST SPRITE COMIC EVER and was the very beginning of that trend, having inspired almost as many sprite comics as Bob and George. Well, guess what. SSS was ALSO the first of its kind and single-handedly inspired HUNDREDS of other websites. SSS is a great site that has had a HUGE impact on internet culture. If that's not "notable" then frankly I don't know what is. Knight9910 15:00, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>Comment</i> In regards to the assertion that the SSS Superpowers section of the entry could be considered Vanity, having read the guidelines on what wikipedia considers "Vanity", I would like to point out that the SSS Superpowers section does not refer to the personal lives or activities of the people referred to in it, but rather, refers to their impact on the site as a whole, as well as referring to the place in the fiction of the site of a character based on them. This does not meet the guidelines of vanity, in the context of the website the entry refers to, any more than the page on <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> is vanity in the context of the United States history.

<li><i>Comment</i> on the Superpowers section. If anything, it portrays me in a negative light. (Yes, I wrote it too.) I'm not quite so sure on the other entries, but my short and not-so-productive reign resulted in negative vanity. At least the entry on me isn't vanity. However, like the other articles I have seen in my short time here, it seems clear that you have to have a certain amount of popularity to be here. My comment is thusly filed for reference. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetal_Man88_fccb.html" title="User:Metal Man88">Metal Man88</a> 05:52, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> One of the major arguments in favor of the deletion of this article is the claim that SSS lacks notoriety, as well as its parent site, SMBHQ, which features a link to SSS on the front page and has since its creation 7 years ago. However, SMBHQ has clearly established itself within the popular world as a well-known resource. Proof of this can be found at <a href="http://www.smbhq.com/npad.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.smbhq.com/npad.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a>, which contains a scanned section of <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_Power_90d1.html" title="Nintendo Power">Nintendo Power</a>, a national gaming news outlet, clearly mentioning SMBHQ. And because SMBHQ has garnered national attention, it is not obscure, and neither are any of its subsections, especially one that has been clearly linked to on the main page for seven years.

<li><i>Comment</i> Thank you. I would just like to point out that thus far I have given Verifiable Evidence as per the template you posted: The grounds on which this discussion began, the claim that SSS lacks notoriety and the claim that the Superpowers section could be considered vanity, have both been essentially proven incorrect by me, as can be seen above. It would take quite a stretch of the imagination to claim that national media attention does not prove notoriety.Pdusen 01:24, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Comment</i> I disagree. <i>Nintendo Power</i> just barely mentioned SMBHQ and said nothing about the Super Smash Stadium portion in particular. That's not enough for me. I don't think it's that much of a stretch of the imagination at all. As for vanity, I consider this a secondary issue to notability in this case, but I'll say this: For me personally, I feel that anytime anyone writes about himself, he is treading on thin ice as far as vanity is concerned, regardless of how notable he is. I'm sure many others will disagree with me on this and that's fine, but that's my personal Wikipedia style -- I err on the side of caution with vanity. --<a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagrashtak_1a5a.html" title="User:Pagrashtak">Pagrashtak</a> 02:21, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Comment</i> For a magazine to be able to publish such a reference, particularly in the case of <i>Nintendo Power</i>, they must recieve submissions regarding such links on the internet by, not only one reader, but enough to garner notice by their letter filters. Nintendo Power has quite enough articles to try and squeeze into one issue every month, without giving a full-page free advertisement to a website that sends them little in the way of profit incentive. So why mention the site at all if not for demand? As for the lack of mention of the SSS itself, because they were doubtlessly strapped for space as I previously suggested, it makes no sense to link to a specific subsection of a website when the entire site is equally relevant (as well as having a shorter URL.) As well, Super Smash Stadium is a main section of SMBHQ: It has a link on the main page that every visitor goes to and has had that same link for eight years. I agree that one must be cautious in the case of vanity. However, I think only mentioning what about onesself is essential information in regards to a topic (For example: I built that stabel) does not qualify for vanity.Pdusen 02:42, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Comment</i> Now you're making false claims. That is not a "full-page" advertisement by a long shot. The <i>entire</i> text of that page that relates to SMBHQ is this: "If it's news about Mario that you crave, you can log on to smbhq.com, where information and opinions about our favorite video game plumber flow freely." And don't claim that NP was strapped for space - the top third of the page is a graphic of Mario at a computer. The editors would have had ample room to mention SSS if they really wanted to. The rest of the page is taken up with graphics, several other fan sites, and one third of the page is devoted to marioparty.com. Does one sentence about a web site whose Alexa ranking is not enough for <i>per se</i> notability really entitle a <b>subsection</b> of that site to an article? --<a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagrashtak_1a5a.html" title="User:Pagrashtak">Pagrashtak</a> 23:23, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Actually one sentence is a big deal when SMBHQ has not even given any money for advertising. I happen to subscribe to Nintendo Power and there are almost no fan websites ever mentioned. I remember being surprised at the time that they had this. For Nintendo Power to personally recommend a website shows a lot of trust on their part that everything on the site is important enough for them to state the website. If there was information on there that was not important people might blame Nintendo Power. With this amount of trust if they could have they probably would have loved to write a long article based on the website. However then their advertisement purchasers would have felt that this devalued their own article because why should they pay money when this website is getting it for free?--Nodal 00:23, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I didn't say that it was a full-page article. You misunderstood. What I said was that Nintendo Power wouldn't GIVE a full-page article to a website that does not ask them or pay them to. Pdusen 00:25, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Expand and Clean up I should point out that I have a vested intrest in this article, as my brother came over and wrote it on my computer after attempting to show what you can use Wikipedia for. He knew that I have a fascination with really bad forms of art, such as Biz Markees "you got what I need" or Plan nine from outer space. While it is true that the nature of these things are subjective I doubt you could find ANYONE to actually make an argument that Biz Markees singing was really good on that song, or that Plan Nine From Outerspace, was actually a cinimaitic masterpiece. On other notes Andy Kauffman and Neil Hamburger were intenionally bad as part of their comedy, so it was in effect their desired result(although this is ussually not the case in other art forms. Mystery Science Theater 3000 was a television show that capitalized on some peoples love of humourly bad cinima</li>
</ul>
<p>the reason for my brother creating the site was so that (hopefully) others would contribute to it. I had pointed out other examples when I was talking to him GG Allen, whom apparently has SOME real fans according to the article from wikipedia, was left out for said reason. Sammy Terry(a local cheesy horror TV host) was left out for being not well known enough. But in actuallity he hadnt put a great deal of thought into the article, as he was mostly hoping that others would add to it, and I could find reference to other "gems" of entertainment that are "so bad they're good"</p>
<p>Please keep this article and expand on it, as it could prove a valuable link to lesser known works for fans of bad art and I dont know of any other source to find these links... 152.163.100.73 16:58, 28 December 2005.</p>

<p>If good art is meant to provoke a reaction, art that is "so bad it's good" certainly meets the standard, although the reaction it provokes is usually not the intended one. Amusement at the blatant lack of talent,or wide-eyeyed looks of disgust are often common. This form of media often gains cult-like status esspecially among younger veiwers or listeners and VH1 has done several programs on songs or videos that are "awesomely bad"</p>

<li>Hi fellow Wikipedians (I'm considerably calmer now). I could expand the article as a discussion of "search engines use in medicine" rather than focussing on Google or the notion of something specific like Google Medicine. P.S. My suggestion is to be vigilant about fairness. Some of the comments at the top of this page seem, well, odd and from "left field". 24.82.179.182 05:14, 26 December 2005 (UTC)DMfigaro</li>

<p>See <a href="../../../a/s/c/Talk%7EASCII_b30d.html" title="Talk:ASCII">talk:ASCII</a>, the current article there (which has no incoming links) is basically a poor article on ascii. However since the term is not normally used to reffer to ascii and apparently is used to reffer to something else so it should not be simply redirected to ascii. Therefore the article needs to either be replaced with one covering the term in set theory or deleted. Since i am incapable of the former i am submitting for deletion. <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a> 22:43, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

I think it is not uncommon or surprising for imprecise language to refer to ASCII as "binary alphabet" so we need this for those looking for ASCII and to prevent them from writing another "poor ASCII".

<li><b>Keep</b> If the 'delete' voters will look into the five electronic weapons I describe in the article, they will see that I am making no claims about these readily available weapons which do not legitimately arise from the technology. Simply saying these weapons don't perform as claimed is not sufficient. For example, the Dr. Joseph Sharp voice-to-skull (Army V2K) technology is described in the 1975 issue of the journal "American Psychologist", article titled "Microwaves and Behavior" by Dr. Don Justesen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The LIDA machine, together with its U.S. custodian, the late Dr. Ross Adey, at the Loma Linda, California Veterans Hospital research wing, is shown in an Associated Press photo. Was demonstrated some years ago on CNN.</p>
<p>I have personally built ten copies of the Dr. Oliver Lowery Silent Sound device, which anyone with moderate electronics skills can do. The U.S. patent, 5,159,703, amply provides backup to the silent sound technology.</p>
<p>The fact that hypnosis works I don't need to provide backup for. If you can feed speech into someone's subconscious without them hearing it, many people can be hypnotized that way.</p>
<p>I telephoned a manufacturer of through clothing (and through non-conductive wall) radar and was told that I could purchase a unit if I had the cash (at that time the price was around $100,000 which I could not afford, but the unit was available to anyone.)</p>
<p>Such technology can be had by anyone with the money, and that it can cause extremely debilitating effects. I do not specifically claim "mind control" with this equipment. One does not need to do "mind control" to destroy a target's ability to earn a living and quality of life.</p>
<p>The sheer importance of the public's need and right to know about this technology outweighs the arguments of the objectors above.</p>

<p><b>KEEP</b>There are plenty of people claiming to be targets of this technology and there are plenty of patents proving that, in fact, these weapons are available to anyone with the know-how to build them. If you look on www.mikrowellenterror.de/english you will get a better pro argument than any I have the time or space to give you here. There is now a book by noted author Gloria Naylor which tells one persons story of this type of crime being perpetrated on an innocent person for no good reason. That book is called "1996". Here is a webpage with alot of technical references to the types of equipment that are declassified -www.geocities.com/free_united_states</p>
<p>And I agree with the above statement which states the importance of these weapons being exposed to the general public in order to give people a chance to defend themselves in the future. Knowledge is power and at the moment only the perpetrators of the crime and their victims are aware of this crime activity.</p>

<p><b>Keep</b> In books such as "How to get Even with Anyone" harassing electronics may be ordered for as little as $25 (acoustic devices). To imagine that such devices are on sale and NOT in usage is inane. Man has never invented a weapon he did not use. They 1. EXIST 2. Are easily available to the public, either for purchase or through instruction on how to make your own and 3. in ever growing, common usage. Since these devices are designed exclusively to harass, it follows that harassment is therefore being done with them. V.

<p><b>Keep (read again: KEEP!!!) - message from John Allman, UK</b></p>
<p>The "electronic harassment" Wikipedia entry a few people apparently want deleted (offering their feable reasons so tersely and ill-informedly that it's simply not worth my effort refuting them) strikes me as quite a reasonable introduction to the underpublicised topic of "electronic harassment", though I'd galdy have helped the author prepare something even MORE scholarly, if she'd been aiming at printed publication in (say) The Encyclopedia Britannica.</p>
<p>Removing Wikipedia documentation of the "electronic harassment" topic can only help to keep this tort/crime as underpublicised as it has been, ever since citizens first began to report it, more decades ago than much of the general public is aware.</p>
<p>Whose interests would be served by suppressing or reclassifying this information in the manner which a handful of people are now proposing? Not those of anybody who wasn't up to some kind of mischief, that's for sure! Would the interests be harmed of anybody whose interests deserved to be protected, by "letting sleeping dogs lie"? Of course not! The threatened Wikipedia status quo is utterly HARMLESS, except to those bent upon inflicting harm on others, with enhanced deniabilty and impunity.</p>
<p>Since there are present political moves afoot to introduce legislation in the USA on the very subject of "electronic harassment", and legislation is already in place in other jurisdictions, it would be unaccetably politically partisan on Wikipedia's part to suppress publicity of the electonic harassment topic, as proposed. After all, USA Senators and Congressmen (or, say, their European counterparts - France presently taking the lead in its Parliamentary opposition to electonic harassment) and (more important) voters in every demnocracy in the world, will be bound to want to look up what "electronic harassment" is, or is claimed to be, every time the phrase is used in draft legislation in their own jurisdictions.</p>
<p>A decision on Wikipedia's part implicitly to take one side rather than another in the ongoing and imminently to be escalated political debate, in such an obvious way, is not the sort of decision that any self-respecting "encyclopedia" in a free society should take, however great the pressure exerted from proponents of one side of the political debate. Such a decision would jeopardise Wikipedia's public reputation for political independence. It would infringe freedom of speech. As Augustine of Hippo put it, AVDI ALTERAM PARTEM - hear the other side - of EVERY contested issue.</p>
<p>Besides, perhaps those clamouring for deletion of "electronic harassment" and "gang stalking" entries, their derogatory renaming, or their merging (as though the original author of both entries claimed the phenoma were INVARIABLY linked, which she didn't), are acting, knowingly or complicitly, on behalf of those with contrary vested interests. (Mine is not the only mind which this sinister possibility has crossed.)</p>
<p>I happen to be somebody deeply concerned about e-harassment, but that does not invalidate the following primary argument - an OBJECTIVE argument - for retaining the status quo. It is essentially the same argument that I used when defending the retention of the Gang Stalking entry, just a few days ago.</p>
<p>On principle, I would cheerfully oppose, for the identical primary reason, the censorship of a Wikipedia article on so-called "Astrology", if I learnt that this was proposed, meaning in this case micro-Astrology, the form that modern Astrology usually takes, and which is peddled commercially as an effective means of personal fortune-telling.</p>
<p>I regard Astrology in this sense as a hoax and a pseudoscience. I wish that so many people weren't silly enough to believe in such "Astrology", especially far too many recent world leaders guilty of making some very poor decisions during past centuries, after consulting so-called "Astrolgers". But I would NEVER seek to defend a decision on the part of Wikipedia to obstruct members of the general public from discovering on Wikipedia what those daft enought to believe in this so-called "Astrology" meant by the term! That's simply not a job for an encyclopedia to take upon itself, much as I disbelieve in such "Astrology" MYSELF, with all the conviction that I have reluctantly come to believe, and to engage in militant opposition to, so-called "electronic harassment".</p>
<p>I offer for your consideration the following quote from a politician opposed to the class of weaponry that is within the class most plausibly deployed during electronic harassment, and which falls squarely within the general class of "manipulation" weapons, which the European Parliament specfically said it wanted banned (development AND deployment thereof!), six years ago, in Paragraph 27 of Resolution A4-0005/99 - q.v. at <a href="http://www3.europarl.eu.int/omk/omnsapir.so/pv2?PRG=DOCPV&amp;APP=PV2&amp;LANGUE=EN&amp;SDOCTA=8&amp;TXTLST=1&amp;POS=1&amp;Type_Doc=RESOL&amp;TPV=DEF&amp;DATE=280199&amp;PrgPrev=TYPEF@A4|PRG@QUERY|APP@PV2|FILE@BIBLIO99|NedUMERO@5|YEAR@99|PLAGE@1&amp;TYPEF=A4&amp;NUMB=1&amp;DATEF=990128" class="external free" title="http://www3.europarl.eu.int/omk/omnsapir.so/pv2?PRG=DOCPV&amp;APP=PV2&amp;LANGUE=EN&amp;SDOCTA=8&amp;TXTLST=1&amp;POS=1&amp;Type_Doc=RESOL&amp;TPV=DEF&amp;DATE=280199&amp;PrgPrev=TYPEF@A4|PRG@QUERY|APP@PV2|FILE@BIBLIO99|NedUMERO@5|YEAR@99|PLAGE@1&amp;TYPEF=A4&amp;NUMB=1&amp;DATEF=990128" rel="nofollow">http://www3.europarl.eu.int/omk/omnsapir.so/pv2?PRG=DOCPV&amp;APP=PV2&amp;LANGUE=EN&amp;SDOCTA=8&amp;TXTLST=1&amp;POS=1&amp;Type_Doc=RESOL&amp;TPV=DEF&amp;DATE=280199&amp;PrgPrev=TYPEF@A4|PRG@QUERY|APP@PV2|FILE@BIBLIO99|NedUMERO@5|YEAR@99|PLAGE@1&amp;TYPEF=A4&amp;NUMB=1&amp;DATEF=990128</a></p>
<p>As recently as 2004, Dr Caroline Lucas MEP (UK, Green Party) wrote, on her own behalf and that of her British colleague Jean Lambert MEP, as follows, here quoted with implied permission, since she made her comments in the public domain, and has been aware often (without objecting) that I have been quoting her comments as I have abridged them, since shortly after the 2004 Labour Party Conference in the UK.</p>
<p>"Electro-Magnetic (EM) weapons are one of the newest and most serious military developments in the world today. Enormous secrecy surrounds their development … Unless this development is stopped, we are entering an Orwellian '1984' type scenario, which could potentially permanently transfer enormous power to those in control of the technology. … We regard the unsuccessful attempts in the 70s … to have these weapons controlled by a UN Convention as having been a major missed opportunity, which has now led to a new arms race in this field. We have sought to renew the attempt … to outlaw these weapons and the research that leads to them, primarily that concerning external manipulation of the human central nervous system."</p>
<p>Dr Lucas documents, in a quote I have abridged above only slightly, and without distorting her meaning at all, a problem about which thousands of people worldwide have been campaigning for decades now, politically and otherwise. A number of such complainants fall victim to psychiatric stalking, merely for holding beliefs that might not even be mistaken to any extent, which they adopt to create a framework that makes sense to them of tangible experiences ton which they are able to testify, under oath if called upon to do so, that they actually experience, some of which experience is physically painful, and almost all of which is psychologically distressing.</p>
<p>I have recently founded a charity primarly to conduct resaerch into this very topic and to provide help for alleged victims of new techniques of torture and harassment, such as are documented in the "electonic harassment" entry that some would like Wikipedia to remove, if it succombs to such pressure from the victims' adversaries and their complicit or ill-informed advocates.</p>
<p>I have stood three times for political office this year alone, in part to get the subject of "electronic harassmanet" discussed rationally, in the public arena, as an electoral issue, and in part to challenge the failures of supposed "democracies" that have made it necessary to make such stands. Please see <a href="http://www.AllianceForChange.co.uk" class="external free" title="http://www.AllianceForChange.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.AllianceForChange.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p>"Electronic harassment", the phrase some would like Wikipedia to delete, is rapidly becoming the de facto most-favoured phrase for the genre of abuse which the general public has been using increasingly, when attempting to describe succinctly a problem with thousands of alleged victims worldwide, most of whom have no classical symtoms whatsoever of any mental illness.</p>
<p>A phrase such as "electronic harassment" this much in vogue surey merits an encylcopedia entry, if only because of the ubiquity of the use of the phrase, even amongst sceptics as to the phenomenon's very existence, whose scepticism ought to be cured easily enough by more open-minded research. It is the favoured phrase we used during seventeen meetings last October in Washington DC, with Senators, Congressmen, and their Legislative Assistants, eleven of which meetings I was privileged to attend personally, despite not even being a USA citizen myself. We were invited at every meeting I attended to draft legislation that addressed the very problem spme would like Wikipedia no longer to document, "electronic harassment", whose Wikipedia entry some people would co-incidentally like you to delete, barely a week or so before the date by which the draft legislation we were asked to draft is expected by those US legislators amd their aides we aproached. Go figure!</p>
<p>Wikipedia will discredit itself totally by failing to remain strictly neutral in the cases of contentious issues now in the political arena in the USA, France, Russia, the European Parliament and so-on, like e-harrassment and gang-stalking (which sometimes coincide, but not, in my experience, always) that our present day political activism is proving effective at making political "hot potatoes", worldwide. Adequate neutrality here consists of letting the deletion-candidate entry STAND, as is, without any disruptive or implicitly derogative name change, and allowing those who dispute the facts asserted in the entries that they want you to delete to have their own dissenting say, without empowering them to silence US.</p>

<dd>Apoligies; I never saved my changes when I was filling out the AfD "paperwork". And this is not a bad faith nominatiuon. I see that the list of "songs considered the greatest ever" was kept as "no consensus", although the delete votes outnumber and (as far as reasoning) outweight the keep votes. Nominating two lists isn't "continually nominating lists". But, in all honesty, there's really no reason for a list like this, besides the inherent POV that will result from lack of geographical scope, lack of genre variation, and lack of factuality (<i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chronic_a1e7.html" title="The Chronic">The Chronic</a></i> popularized sampling? <i>Really</i> now...)--<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 00:40, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, it wasn't just you who nominated the articles.

<dd>This may sound cold, but the amount of time users put it working on an article has no bearing on whether or not I list it for deletion or have it merged. Someone could write a perfectly formatted, 23K article on the contents in the platic cup on my desk, and spend months working on it; if it needs to be deleted, it should be deleted. Since we already have the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Rolling_Stone%27s_500_Greatest_Albums_of_All_Time_746b.html" title="List of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time">List of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a> and similar lists, all this is really going to do is either (a) apre those lists or (b) introduce personal preference and POV, as shown currently. As such, I don't see the neccessity for it (or the similar list of films, songs, etc. Wikipedia is rapidly becoming into a teenage fan portal. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 01:00, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well those lists are very different...but the bottom line is that you want this list cut, the part about <i>lack of geographical scope, lack of genre variation, and lack of factuality</i> is really not the issue for your nom.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't see why the state of the article can't go into the afd discussion when it isn't at all likely that that state is going to be changed. This article will continue to be only pop albums, it being "fixed" will only be the result of all of the biases common on wikipedia being added to this list. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 03:30, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rename/move</b> to something a little better sounding, I have issues with the term <i>considered</i> being in the title, but I'm not coming up with a better alternative (writer's block!) Barring that, I would say <b>Keep</b> based on the fact that these albums have indeed been named "Best Ever" by some credible body at some point. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 00:29, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is possible to write an NPOV article on this topic, though it will certainly be difficult. But see for instance <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_that_have_been_considered_the_worst_ever.html" title="List of films that have been considered the worst ever">List of films that have been considered the worst ever</a>, which in my humble opinion is a very good article and an example of what lists should be. The article should be constantly reviewed and further entries should be included only when they were considered the greatest ever by someone notable (mainly music magazines, I think). No "it is widely regarded as" and no "it is the favorite album of singer X". <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a><sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 02:23, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article is deserving of its entry on Wikipedia because it provides an overall picture of the most renowned albums in history - it cites a number of other articles such as Rolling Stone and provides a birds-eye view. The article title could be better named perhaps Most Renowned Music Albums Ever or such-like (the article seems to be divided into Best Selling, Genre Defining, Best Ranked) so perhaps an all-encompassing title such as Most Renowned would be more apt than the current title. The intentions of the article are fairly clear but I agree with others that the title requires renaming jgianni 00:22, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> We have similar pages for <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_and_video_games_that_have_been_considered_the_greatest_ever.html" title="Computer and video games that have been considered the greatest ever">Computer and Video games</a> as well as films (both <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_that_have_been_considered_the_greatest_ever.html" title="Films that have been considered the greatest ever">best</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_that_have_been_considered_the_worst_ever.html" title="List of films that have been considered the worst ever">worst</a>).

<li>Since certainly more albums are made than films or videogames, can we agree that this should be moved to "Pop albums which appear consistently in top rankings/reviews"? Certainly the eventual mixing of comedy albums and folk albums would only confuse the article. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 03:51, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>I was trying to come up with a useful way to clean up this article but came to the conclusion it probably should just be deleted. No other country has a 'Places of interest' article, and it seems to be an arbitrary list. Some of the items in the list may be noteworth enough for their own articles, but without being able to come up with a better solution for this list I'm going to have to nominate it for deletion. I would happily support something like a merge if someone can think of a useful way to do it, though. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 00:24, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
