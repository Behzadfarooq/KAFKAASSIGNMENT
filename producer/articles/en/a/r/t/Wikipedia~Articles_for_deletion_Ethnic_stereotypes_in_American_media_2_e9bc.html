<li><b>Keep</b> So that means that a person searching for a compilation of stereotypes has to go through all those pages? I believe the main page is still useful. And "Stereotypes of Jews" is redlinked. Also, I'm not sure which policy the deletion is supposed to go under. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 21:17, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> I'm concerned about the verifiability of the content and conclusions in this article. For example, it's not difficult to verify that a particular character is Asian, but it is very difficult to verify objectively that they are portraying a stereotype. Indeed, the article just about covers every personality that an Asian woman could be. If this article is permitted to stay, then <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> should be cited for <u>every</u> claim that a character is portrayed stereotypically. -<a href="../../../a/e/d/User%7EAED_76b1.html" title="User:AED">AED</a> 23:35, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - per <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a>. The article should link to the subsidiary articles using the {{main}} template. FYI, I believe Stereotypes of Jews was deleted. I believe I participated on the losing (Keep) side of that AfD discussion. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 07:07, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Because of the creations of those various articles, this particular article should change direction and talk about ethnic stereotypes in American media in general, without going in depth into the stereotypes for each ethnic group, and linking to those other articles that were split off. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">--- Hong Qi Gong</a> 15:21, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - We should keep this article to discuss the phenomenon of ethnic stereotyping in American media in general. That intro paragraph doesn't really belong in any of the off-shoot articles, so it needs to stay here. I created the other articles to deal with article length and focus, not to eliminate this main article. At the very very least it'd serve as a useful page to consolidate all the off-shoot links for convenient navigation (also because the off-shoot articles don't come up in search for some reason). Furthermore, as others have pointed out, stereotypes of Jews was deleted (people took it the wrong way out of context), and there is no page for "Mixed" ethnicity stereotypes; this page would be a good umbrella page to give a good overview and cover any and all groups that don't have enough content to warrant their own pages yet. --<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrenched_2204.html" title="User:Drenched">Drenched</a> 03:17, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's mostly that the artcle is based on loose impressions of stereotypes, and lends itself to bias. There have been THOUSANDS of destinct representations of African Americans. Who can decide which of them are stereotypes? There is no authority on this matter. It's purely subjective. Yes, there has been plenty of scholarly work on the subject, but that doesn't mean it's not subjective. This article will never be definitive enough for wikipedia. A stereotype is an oversimplified representation, this article is filled with contributors that claim to know the difference between a representation thats "overly simple" and one thats "realistic". I'm saying its impossible to distinguish those two objectively. Its a matter of taste. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowyCaballero_078e.html" title="User:ShadowyCaballero">ShadowyCabal</a> 23:46, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> article is not obsolete, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewie_Griffin_46b0.html" title="Stewie Griffin">Stewie Griffin</a> still links to it to talk about stereotypes of the British. Even if there were subpages for every race imaginable, I see no reason why this can't stay as the master article. I also see this has a few references and other verifiable material. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 06:03, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as fails <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, is a soapbox, and advocacy. The article is still filled with sweeping generalizations which appear entirely to be original research. Despite sweeping claims the article is "needed", "useful", and "not obsolete", none of these noms address questions of WP policy and guidelines. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 08:53, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. NPOV by itself is not a reason to delete. There is a lot of material on stereotyping in the media out there. Unfortunately for such a large (and probably neglected as people keep adding in their own opinions of stereotypes) article it'll take quite a bit of time to fix (Drenched's splitting of the articles is just a start). If you believe the articles are NPOV, tag them with NPOV and steps should be taken to start fixing. (For example, the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotypes_of_Asians_417e.html" title="Stereotypes of Asians">Stereotypes of Asians</a> section above is very well-sourced.) <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 17:30, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Even though this article does contain original research and unverified claims that need to be addressed, it also contains a lot of published legitimate research too. Even if you choose to disregard arguments that this article is "needed", "useful" and "not obsolete," it still stands that it contains published, statistical, factual information regarding media trends in America in addition to academically acknowledged ideas and theories regarding ethnic stereotyping. Therefore, weeding is needed, not indescriminate deletion of all contents. --<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrenched_2204.html" title="User:Drenched">Drenched</a> 05:50, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'll buy that. The article can't give examples of stereotypes, but it can list research and scholarly work. - <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowyCaballero_078e.html" title="User:ShadowyCaballero">ShadowyCabal</a> 06:46, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
