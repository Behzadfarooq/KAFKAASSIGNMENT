<li>Research turns up lots of different lists of "four good habits". Almost all of them are simply the expressed opinions of individual people, and the number four is entirely arbitrary. The only possible subject for an encyclopaedia article that research turns up is a source that states that <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahatma_Gandhi_e9af.html" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a> had a famous list of four good habits. However, I have not found a second source to confirm this, and such material would belong in <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandhism.html" title="Gandhism">Gandhism</a>. This isn't what <i>this</i> article is about, anyway.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. Everybody please take note that <i>this</i> is what we call a debate! Obviously, much has changed and been (dis-)agreed upon during the debate and the only reasonable outcome is no-action since we are not at all clear on what to do. I would make one comment however: I <i>will not</i> count 'votes' such as Klonimus's which explicitly says he has no feeling at all on the article and is merely (and literally) <i>voting</i> to force things in one direction. That seems inappropriate and very unnecessary to me. Admins can judge for themselves whether there is consensus or not: we do not need spurious 'votes' such as that to help us out. Also note that a poll on extending the debate has no useful precedent and is largely unnecessary anyway since the backlog in closing AfDs is usually at least several days beyond the 5 stipulated and much of this discussion doesn't really deal with deletion-or-not and could be carried to the Talk: page of the article.

<li>Though thinking about logic, process calculi, quantum mechanics and everything else is an exciting activity (it is useful to brainstorm) I can't figure out the unifying theme, if any of this article.</li>
<li>I think the article contains statements which are...bizarre: Consider the following statement</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Further Comment</b>. Though this is not a judicial process, I ask Carl to rely on a more "progressive" dialogue strategy. Please try not to respond to questions with questions (it sounds Socratic, but in fact is a very "regressive" strategy--it does not advance the dialogue). To answer the questions implicit in this page, could you please say: "Such and such published papers discusses the relation between actors and quantum mechanics in the following way". Moreover, your rhetorical response
<dl>
<dd><i>Try reading ... Then ask the following question: "in terms of quantum mechanics, how does an arbiter work"?</i></dd>

</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>is not helpful, to me at least. I don't know how arbiters work in terms of quantum mechanics; am I supposed to figure this out? Please tell me. But the article in dispute sure does no such thing (nor does another article in which I disputed another quantum claim of yours. I can't remember it now). Instead the article in dispute provides quotes from Einstein, Thomas Kuhn, Hawking, Penrose.

<li>I don't see any connection based on the Sutherland and Ebergen article. Their methods of handling asynchony and arbitration are based on deterministic circuits, while QM is nondeterministic. The conference proceeding that you reference I would need to look up, but as you are a co-author it fails to overcome the concerns of NOR and self-promotion. Beyond that, saying "<i>There are references ...</i>" is most unimpressive. Please list them (preferably in <a href="../../../a/c/t/Talk%7EActor_model%2C_mathematical_logic%2C_and_quantum_physics_a608.html" title="Talk:Actor model, mathematical logic, and quantum physics">the talk page for the article</a>) as CSTAR has requested. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 05:36, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Reads like an odd mix of computer science and QM. Replicates a pile of stuff that the same author put into Quantum uncertaintly. Looks more like OR than a proper article. Also: CH says "The connection between the Actor model and quantum physics has been published many times, e.g., there is discussion in the following proceedings of a refereed conference: Carl Hewitt and Gul Agha. <i>Guarded Horn clause languages: are they deductive and Logical?</i>". Which makes me think (a) if this is even vaguely mainstream, he should be able to cite someone other than himself; and (b) something more recent than 1988; and (c) a proper paper not just a discussion from a conference proceeding. Nonetheless, as per C*, if CH can come up with some defence, I'll reconsider. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M.

<dd>If you look at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_case_for_quantum_mechanics_being_incomplete.html" title="The case for quantum mechanics being incomplete">The case for quantum mechanics being incomplete</a>, you will find that the text relevant to that subject is now there.

</dl>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: the article should be moved to a more appropriate name, but it is not now clear where the best home for the article is. One point in particular: is it best to treat the relationship of the actor model to logic and physics separately, when there is a tradition of considering the relationship of computation, logic and physics to each other that dates back to Turing, and passes through such distinguished thinkers as Robin Gandy, Dana Scott and Robin Milner? I'm inclined to think that the contributions of the actor model to this discussion are best placed within a section of a broader article. Until it is clear what the right fate for this material should be, I regard a delete outcome as premature. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 18:56, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A broader article would certainly be welcome as well.

<dl>
<dd>The Gandy article I had in mind was his 1980 ‘Church’s Thesis and Principles of Mechanisms’, in Barwise J., Keisler J.J. and Kunen K., eds., The Kleene Symposium, Amsterdam: North-Holland, pp. 123–145. It's on the limits of computation and the possibility of hypercomputation and has inspired a significant literature. Scott&amp;Milner's work developing the classical automata-theoretic idea of transducer is what I had in mind: offhand I can't name references, but it is what leads into the work of Abramsky that CSTAR mentioned elsewhere. This work, while it takes physics seriously, is definitely computer science, but the IJMPC article I cited elsewhere is physics&amp;agents. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 18:59, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What remains documents no connection to physics now, and indeed seems to lack a thesis at all. So I retain my vote to outright delete this article.

<dd>I have clarified the article to make more clear the relationship to physics. More clarification is welcome.</dd>
<dd>There is a great more published material on this subject that needs to be reported in the Wikipedia. Therefore the article should stand by itself since there will not be room to fold it into another article.</dd>
<dd>Note that as I have said before: <b>There is no attempt in this article (or others) to impose the Actor model on theoretical physics.</b> Instead it seems that you cannot accept that the Actor model is <b>dependent</b> on physics.</dd>

<ol>
<li>IMO, you have failed to document an actual dependency. Certainly the actor model can deal with pheonomena caused by quantum and relativistic effects, but to say that it is "dependent" on those effects is not appropriate.</li>
<li>Even if said dependency exists, that would not justify the tight concpetual connections that you keep attempting to forge. You may as well say that walking is a major branch of physics since walking depends on physics.</li>
<li>You have (most importantly) utterly failed to establish that these connections to theoretical physics are accepted as an inate attribute of the actor model in the field of computer science.</li>

However, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> a billboard, and in the context of theoretical physics this connection is very much <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>. This article exists in both the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model.html" title="Actor model">actor model</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> realm. In the former realm, it is permissible (or at least worth the benefit of the doubt), but in the latter it is original research. For an article like this to be acceptable, it must be acceptable in all of its realms. For this article, that is not the case.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. A <i>theory</i> of walking certainly depends on physics. In fact the physics is quite intricate.

<dd>First of all, you have missed my point, which is that the linkage (if present) is having its significance totally overblown. I can accept the claim itself too, but as a claim and not as an established fact or speculation worthy of an independent article. Beyond that, I 100% agree with you about the intent of this VfD. If you can show that I am mistaken on my point #3 above, I will change my vote, and encourage others to do the same. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 21:02, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> It seems to be that this AfD is an ambush because there was no talk page before it got brought up for deletion. This does not seem to be the way Wikipedia is supposed to work. Most of this discussion should be moved to a talk page and the disputes resolved there. That said, here is why I think it should not be deleted.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The relation between the actor model (AM), mathematical logic (ML), and physics has not been stated clearly in the article. That does not mean that it doesn't exist, or that it's original work. Carl's ideas have been out there in the literature for decades. He's taught this idea for decades, so the idea is out there. He and other editors should be given time to state the connection more clearly before it gets nominated for deletion. Doing it without a talk discussion is unfair.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Here is how I understand the connection: the semantics of computation traditionally has rested on ML, but because of indeterminancy in arrival order of messages in concurrency it cannot rest on ML. It has to rest on physics. A semantics based on physics is crucial and fundamental to the AM.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The goal post keeps getting moved in this deletion discussion. First it was claimed that the idea was original. When Carl gave references, it was claimed that these were not refereed journals. I can plainly see that some of the references are in refereed journals. Then it was claimed that AM does not contain a physics result. When Carl said he's not claiming it does, that what he is claiming is that the model crucially depends on physics, it was claimed that no one in computer science (CS) accepts it, with no substatiation. If there is a controversy in CS, someone should come up with a story in the talk section with references and contribute the alternate point of view to the article. All the claims against the AM not being related to physics are orignial claims. The deleters should be held to the same standard of substatiation and non-originality that Carl is being held to.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>And finally, no one holds other articles to the same standard of acceptance by the scientific community that this one is being held to. The result may be obscure and may have been ingnored by most of CS, but that doesn't make it original because the idea has been out there for decades. It doesn't make it non-notable just because people haven't taken enough note yet or haven't understood it's significance yet. Some people in CS have taken note, and making technical things understandable to more people is the job of the WP.</li>

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Now if this was just an "ancillary article" associated with the actor model, I'm not sure that the AfD would have been initiated. However, Carl has been very persistent in assuming the because things like <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relativity.html" title="Relativity">relativity</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> are (in his estimation) relevant to the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model.html" title="Actor model">actor model</a>, that the actor model in turn is relevant to relativity and quantum mechanics. In reality, nothing could be farther from the truth. In these fields, the actor model is completely unknown, and the purported connection is totally OR.</dd>
<dd>More to the point, Carl brought over here a bunch of text that was inappropriate to <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_indeterminacy.html" title="Quantum indeterminacy">quantum indeterminacy</a>, turning this article into a medium for maintaining a strong connection between the QM articles and the actor model articles. It was so out of line that myself and another editor felt obliged to initiate this AfD. The offending text is now off elsewhere (in a wholely QM context) where hopefully it can become the basis for an encyclopedic article. (That text describes the case for QM being incomplete and has some value in or as an article on that topic.)</dd>
<dd>What now remains is a category link to <a href="../../../q/u/a/Category%7EQuantum_information_science_c7c4.html" title="Category:Quantum information science">category:quantum information science</a>, which as best I can tell is a restatement of the same OR connection to QM. Given that this title calls for that link, I say that the article should just be deleted, and this inappropriate connection severed.

</dd>
<dd>In the meantime, given that it is germane to the actor model, Carl is free to mention the logical connection between the actor model and physical theory in the actor model article. However, if he wants to reference any physical theories, then he should do so <b>only through links in the actor model article</b>.</dd>
<dd>To summarize: <i>In the context of physics, the actor model is unknown</i>, and the mention of the actor model in any physics article or category is therefore a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/NOR_11d4.html" title="NOR">NOR</a> no matter how many respected and/or peer-reviewed CS journal articles that connection may have been mentioned in. Carl has by his actions turned this into a de-facto physics article, and so rendered it OR. I will therefore be happy to see it go.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am mostly in agreement with Charles Stewart. The people arguing for deletion have valid concerns, which I share. Indeed, while it may well be true that the actor model is inspired by a (possibly misguided understanding of) relativity and quantum theory, I haven't seen any evidence that it uses these physical theories, and it certainly is not an interdisciplinary subject stradling computer science and physics. However, it is not yet obvious to me that the only way to resolve these concerns is to take the radical step of deleting the article instead of a discussion. In fact, I think the article has improved in that the questionable statement have been removed. Finally, I wish to note that I know some of the history of the conflict with Carl Hewitt, for instance the category on relativistic information science, that Carl is difficult to deal with in the context of Wikipedia, and that CSTAR, Linas, EMS, and others have reacted with a lot of patience. I hope that Carl also realizes this and that he will be cautious if he wants to continue contributing about his own work. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 13:11, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

He has pushed this topic in other articles, if the lack of proper citations here was an oversight, he could dip into one of those for a link or a journal reference, but of course there none there either. <a href="../../../d/v/8/User%7EDV8_2XL_8587.html" title="User:DV8 2XL">DV8 2XL</a> 23:25, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's a good deal of reason to be unhappy with CH's behaviour as an editor, and I think the voting pattern on this page reflects exhausted patience. However, I'm not at all happy with the way things have been argued on this page. For NOR to be a reason for deletion, it is not enough to establish that the contents of the article qualify as original research (which has not conclusively been established), but one should also show that the topic does not support a good WP article. To paraphrase what CSTAR said, the intersection between computation, logic and physics is a fascinating one, and even if no case can be made that the actor model gives an interesting perspective of quantum physics, there may still be a worthy article here. Without intending to make personal criticism, I don't think this AfD was well put together (ie. the AfD was assembled without so much as a question being asked on either CH's talk page or that of the article's): giving CH a bit more time to put his case together (and allowing him access to his literature, etc.) can be seen as some sort of remedy for the AfD's defect. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 00:06, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Same text, but I take the application of NOR to AfD to mean that one should repair the article if possible, and delete it only if that cannot be done.

<dd>For example: I have created a modification to <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">general relativity</a> (GR) which I refer to by the acronym FBGR, which is unpublished except in the proceedings of an unrefereed conference, and is in any case mostly unknown amongst physicists.
<ul>
<li>Case 1: If I create a article on FBGR, it would be totally <a href="../../../n/o/r/NOR_11d4.html" title="NOR">NOR</a>, and would be deleted.</li>
<li>Case 2: If I add a section on FBGR to the GR article, then what is OR is only that section, and the article can be repaired by reverting out my work.</li>
</ul>

<dd>I submit to you the proposition that the connection between QM and the actor model <i>as claimed in the title of this article</i> is wholely undocumented except in the writings of Carl Hewitt.

What he has is a start for the article, and in the context of its title the POV is almost bearable.</li>
<li>Carl made a great effort to attached the Actor model to general relativity a month or two ago, which I was a part of beating back. He has no sense that "<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> a propaganda machine". I see this as part of his propaganda, which is how is ends up being NOR. (OTOH as best I can tell the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model.html" title="Actor model">actor model</a> article is legitimate and benefits from Carl's expertise in the model itself. It is these odd connections to areas that Carl obviously is not very experienced in that are the problem.)</li>

<p><big><b>A possible solution</b></big><br />
Again I apologize for now being able to participate more fully. I had to stay up til 4:30AM yesterday to finish a conference paper which was due. Today I spent 7 hours driving. But I do want Wikipedia processes to work, so I stayed up late tonight even though the conference starts early tomorrow constructing a possible solution which is explained at <a href="../../../a/c/t/Talk%7EActor_model%2C_mathematical_logic%2C_and_quantum_physics_a608.html" title="Talk:Actor model, mathematical logic, and quantum physics">Talk:Actor model, mathematical logic, and quantum physics</a>.</p>

Since I do not have expertise in these other views, hopefully soneone else would supply them.</p>
<p>Eventually I will dig up the citaton for the indeterminacy of Arbiters being based on the indeterminacy of quantum mechanics, but for obvious reasons I can't do it now.

<p>Also please note that the citation that I most need to dig up is not just a citation to my own work.

<dl>
<dd>I have a better idea: If this article is kept then call it Actor model and mathematical logic. Just plain leave physics out of the title. If there are ways that the actor model and related paradigms are analogous to physical theory, then you may describe them, given that they are documented in the area of computer science. However, <b>you cannot treat the actor model as being a part of physics</b> due to this association. I repeat what I wrote above: The actor model is unknown to phsysicists and Wikipedia is not the place to introduce it to the physiscists. Any attempt to do so goes against NOR. However, if indeed the connection is now known to computer science through your efforts then in that context it is encyclopedic.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps the case for not mentioning physics in this title is best made in the name of Newton's book introducing classical mechanics to the world: "<a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophiae_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica_06d6.html" title="Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica">Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</a>" (latin which in english means "mathematical principles of natural philosophy"). So both physics and the actor model are examples of mathematical modelling anyway, and the purposrted connection can be described or not (and currently I notice that it is not described in the article) as is appropriate.</dd>

The dependence of the Actor model on physics is accepted in Computer Science, <i>e.g.,</i> see "The Challenge of Open Systems" in a standard reference <i>The foundation of artificial intelligence---a sourcebook</i> Cambridge University Press, 1990 and other references in the artice. <b>The published work reported in this article crucially depends on physics.</b></p>

<dl>
<dd>This is irrelevant to me. Look at it this way: You may know of President Bush, but that does not mean that President Bush knows of you. That the actor model knows of or utilizes physics does not mean that the actor model is known to physics.</dd>
<dd>I realize that it may seen wierd that something can be established in one venue and be OR in another. Perhaps this is a sign of how specialized the fields have become, but my own read is that the CS field has permitted itself to accept your claim without first demainding that it be validated in a physics context. However, done is done. I will respect the CS reality re the actor model is you will accept the physics reality for the same.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>FYI - I do not see a true physics connection however. In the contested article, it is stated that
<dl>
<dd><i>Instead of observing the internals of arbitration processes of Actor computations, we await outcomes.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So the physics of arbiters is not the issue, but instead the unpredictablitity of their results. If you are not concerned about the "internals" (and I don't see why you should be), then you are not concerned about the physics. This is not to say that you should not be curious about it, but rather that that physics is not fundamental to the actor model. Instead the resultant indeterminism of the outputs is. I encourage you to think about this. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 15:25, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. However, the actor model IMO is concerned with the outcome being indeterminate and not the physical cause itself.

I wish that I could get it through your thick skull that indeterminism forms the "junction" between physics and the actor model.

<dd>I'd say that referees for computer science journals cannot be expected to validate claims made about physics, nor would I expect referees for physics journals to necessarily do a good job validating claims made about computer science. It's a question of the editors ability to select the right referees for the claims made in the paper, and these doubts go double if the claims are not featured in the abstract, but appear as remarks in the course of the main claims made in the paper (I'm not saying this is what happened with CH's paper, just noting a problem with WP's black-or-white policy that claims made in peer reviewed journals are accepted as sufficiently backed up). There are journals that somewhat straddle the divide between computer science and physics, eg. World Scientific's <a href="http://journals.wspc.com.sg/ijmpc/mkt/aims_scope.shtml" class="external text" title="http://journals.wspc.com.sg/ijmpc/mkt/aims_scope.shtml" rel="nofollow">International Journal of Modern Physics C</a> published <a href="http://journals.wspc.com.sg/ijmpc/16/1601/S012918310500698X.html" class="external text" title="http://journals.wspc.com.sg/ijmpc/16/1601/S012918310500698X.html" rel="nofollow">this article about the simulation of physics by agents</a>; see also <a href="http://gort.ucsd.edu/newjour/i/msg02590.html" class="external text" title="http://gort.ucsd.edu/newjour/i/msg02590.html" rel="nofollow">their announcement message</a>. But it's a thin crowd. I don't know what to recommend as a general line here, only to suggest that CH's case would be helped if he were to publish in a journal with credentials in physics, and that otherwise we are voyaging in not very well mapped territory. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 18:44, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It will be interesting to see what other physicists, <i>e.g.,</i> Chris Fuchs, make of all this.

</dl>
<p>I disagree. Which scientific community accepts a result is irrelevant to whether it's original or not. Carl is not claiming a physics result? Note something being a <b>result in physics</b> is not the same as having a <b>relationship to physics</b>. <b>Depending on physics</b> does not put it into <b>the physics realm</b>. Physicists are free to read the CS literature. They just haven't. Encyclopedias, like this one, can aid this process.</p>
<p>Here is the argument in a nutshell. This result is crucially dependent on physics. It's significant in the CS community that it <i>does</i> depend on physics and not logic. It should be indexed in <i>physics</i> terms in the WP so physicists can find it. That's what encyclopedias do. They make results accessible across disciplinary boundaries.</p>
<p>I notice a whole lot of other categories listed under other categories when they're not inside them, such as <a href="../../../p/s/e/Category%7EPseudoscience_c4dd.html" title="Category:Pseudoscience">category:pseudoscience</a> as a subcategory of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Category%7EScience_11a2.html" title="Category:Science">category:science</a>.</p>

More recently, he took over the article on <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_indeterminacy.html" title="Quantum indeterminacy">quantum indeterminacy</a> and when his higly POV <i>physics</i> text got removed from there it ended up here!

<dd>To achieve that placement, explicit action is needed, and Carl has been all too happy to do so. My point is that not only does a dependency on physics not place something into the physics realm, <i>but it does not justify such a placement either</i>. I repeat: <b>The actor model is not known to physics.</b> That is why it should not even be indexed there. Because it is unknown to physics, such a placement is novel to the physics realm, and therefore is a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.</dd>

<dd>Every time someone want to put their own (usually original) research where it does not belong, I see a grand redefinition of Wikipedia to suit themself. Carl's redefining categorization is no different. Categorization is a means of grouping related articles, so that people can explore a field with ease. It is not meant for trivially related or unrelated topics to use as a means of advertising. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 06:02, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The primary reason for my dissatisfaction is that an RfC would have been better suited to make specific proposals and suggestions to Hewitt on how to make this article and other articles better. Unless you are planning on banning Hewitt --bad idea, we are going to have to do this eventually. With an RfC Hewitt would be encouraged to be more willing to follow certain guidelines of cooperation. For example, one particularly infuriating characteristic about Hewitt's style is that he makes dozens of edits each one of which is miniscule -- it makes it very hard for other editors to see what he's done or where he's taking the article (I don't care about the strain on servers -- that at least gives Jimbo Wales something to do getting more resources).

Maybe the RfC/RfA route is what is needed, and should be tried next time. As much as I hate to say it, I know that there will be a next time.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Carl, I think the basic issue with many of your Wikipedia articles is their lack of <i>intellectual maturity</i>. You have had a long career in a certain area of <i>computer science</i>, but it seems you want to branch out into <i>physics</i> in your retirement. Nothing wrong with that in principle, and your recent activity could be valuable as long as you are very careful to honestly and fairly judge the intellectual maturity of your speculations, and are thoughtful in which venues you chose to explain your ideas. Taking the time to try to familiarize yourself with the physics literature would also be wise. I think you also need to be more sensitive to possible "cultural differences" between theoretical physics and computer science regarding judgements of maturity. Remember that theoretical physics is a subject with a long and distinguished pedigree, while computer science is still comparatively young but appears to have developed significantly different time scales/criteria for publication.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I feel that your physics-related ideas are currently at a stage which are just barely sufficiently mature to <i>perhaps</i> be worth sharing in some form with others. They might merit discussion in <i>speculative essays posted at your own website</i> (perhaps you can set up also set up a blog there to make it easier for interested readers to comment). Wikipedia science articles should however focus on explaining well-established topics in science, such as <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_dilation.html" title="Time dilation">time dilation</a>, or much discussed speculations such as the <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_censorship_hypothesis.html" title="Cosmic censorship hypothesis">cosmic censorship hypothesis</a>. In all cases, articles should fairly and accurately describe the current status of the ideas under discussion. Sometimes this will be difficult or contentious (e.g. <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_theory.html" title="String theory">string theory</a> evokes passionate debate), but in these cases the article can explain fairly and accurately the nature of an contemporary controversy within scientific circles.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>More generally, I don't deny, of course, that speculations regarding connections between mathematical logic and fundamental physics have been much discussed for many decades in the physics literature and elsewhere. But what strikes me is the enormous breadth and variety of the ideas which are "out there"; it would be very difficult to find anyone who is sufficiently expert to provide a comprehensive review of this material, much less judge the relative merits of various speculations. So anyone attempting to discuss such issues should approach the task with humility and good judgement, and in particular, should avoid making strong claims unless one is really aware of (and ideally familiar with) all the relevant literature.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In this article, to judge from the title, you are nominally attempting to address a relatively tiny portion of this enormous literature. Your qualifications to discuss <i>computer science aspects</i> of your own actor model are not in dispute, but the rest of us might well wonder whether you are capable of doing so in an unbiased manner. This is particularly true because those of us with more physics/math backgrounds seem to agree that you don't seem to know very much about the relevant physics or math literature. I think the fact that so many users have been warning you that there is much you don't appear to know should induce you to pull back and move these speculations to your own website, where you should probably label them as preliminary. In any event, I urge you to voluntarily stop trying to use Wikipedia as some kind of venue for promoting highly speculative personal views, especially since some many here feel you that while you may know a great deal about some aspects of computer science, you don't yet know enough about physics to write usefully on such a vastly complex and subtle subject.</dd>

<dd>I have a suggestion about that (I note again that my initials happen to be the same as Carl Hewitt's, so newcomers shouldn't confuse us). I propose an RFC on Carl as an example of how one user (who is surely sufficiently saavy to know what he is doing) is devoting great ingenuity and persistence to using Wikipedia in order to promote his own highly personal and speculative views, which most of us seem to agree do not appear to yet be sufficiently mature to warrant the amount of attention which he obviously thinks they deserve in this encyclopedia. Quite a few users with considerable expertise whose talents and knowledge should be devoted to higher callings, like writing new material on established technical topics of which they have expert knowledge, have (in my view) <i>wasted</i> quite a bit of time in discussions like this one. I think a fair summary of these discussions is that we have encouraged Carl to try to develop his ideas further, but we've also repeatedly asked him to voluntarily confine his proseletyzing for his speculations to a more appropriate venue, such as his own website or blog. This makes him, in my view---and I think of others here--- something of a problem user.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 00:01, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There is a lot of ill-feeling going around CH's edits, and an RfC can hope to (i) clarify what other editors are upset about in CH's editing, and (ii) put together some rules of engagement that should avoid these conflicts. The RfC then is about avoiding similar conflicts in the future. Simply listing the pages where CH's edits have not observed core WP rules would be a good start, the RfC can then establish details by examining the most significant of these. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 18:21, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><big><b>What should be the title of the article?</b></big><br /></p>
<p>The question has arisen as to what the title of this article should be. The subject matter of the article is a particular relationship between the Actor model, mathematical logic, and physics: <i>Indeterminacy in the physics of arbiters produces indeterminacy in Actor model computations such that they cannot be implemented using mathematical logic.</i> Thanks,--Carl Hewitt 22:36, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you are wasting a lot of people's time with endless discussions like this one. You are an academic with an established reputation (in CS) and with institutional backing, so I feel that you should recognize that you have both the oportunity and the responsibility to polish your interdisciplinary ideas to the point where you can begin to publish some of your speculations in reputable non-CS journals. For example, by showing that you can use ideas from the actor model to solve some open problem which has been discussed in the physcis literature. This alone would not, in my view, immediately promote your ideas to the status of deserving encyclopedia articles here, since solving open problems is the bread and butter of ordinary science, but it would at least put them in the marketplace of ideas. Instead, I feel you are trying to circumvent peer review by posting articles here which describe your ideas as if they have already led to an established interdisciplinary field, which as far as I can see is absolutely <i>not</i> the case. This demeans the efforts of users like EMS, who do not have the institutional backing which you enjoy, but who are attempting to pursue the traditional path of peer reviewed publication. This process can be time consuming and frustrating, but I think is still, in the long run, the best path for science and indeed for your own intellectual legacy.</dd>

If you devoted the same degree of persistence and ingenuity to working out your ideas properly, you might actually contribute something of interdisciplinary value, but if you persist in proseletyzing immature ideas here, you will only alienate individuals who might otherwise assist you in developing your ideas in directions which might one day turn out to be useful.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 00:19, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>If you are not concerned about the "internals", then you are not concerned about the physics!

<dl>
<dd><b>Actually the article states:</b>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Actor model makes use of arbitration for determining which message is next in the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor_model_theory.html#Arrival_orderings" title="Actor model theory">arrival ordering</a> of an Actor that is sent multiple messages concurrently. For example <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbiter_%28electronics%29.html" title="Arbiter (electronics)">Arbiters</a> can be used in the implementation of the arrival ordering of an Actor which can give rise to <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbiter_%28electronics%29.html#Arbiters_give_rise_to_indeterminacy" title="Arbiter (electronics)">physical indeterminacy</a> in the arrival order. Therefore mathematical logic can not implement concurrent computation in open systems because of the impossibility of deducing arrival orderings since they are indeterminate. Note that although mathematical logic cannot implement general concurrency it can implement some special cases of current computation,</i> e.g., <i>sequential computation and some kinds of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_programming.html" title="Parallel programming">parallel</a> computation including the <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lambda_calculus.html" title="Lambda calculus">lambda calculus</a>.</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>In concrete terms for Actor systems, typically we cannot observe the details by which the arrival order of messages for an Actor is determined.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>No Consensus</b>--Default--KEEP.</p>
<p>Also, note that: "[The M16] has been the primary infantry rifle of the United States military since 1967, and is in use by 15 NATO countries, and has been the most produced firearm in its caliber." Also, the AK47 was widely used in the Iron Curtain and it was "produced in greater numbers than any other assault rifle in the 20th century". The widespread military use and the relations to the Cold War make this a noteworthy comparison. Comparing these two rifles is hardly a crime, as this is one of the most notable gun comparisons you can make; this is not imply a "random" gun comparison. However, the article has been moved to "Comparison of the AK-47 and M16" and proper tags have been added. The difficulties in merging having been well noted.

<li><b>Keep</b>, though the article would do well to add sources. If you want sources for the very idea of comparing the two items, consider as a first example the "Rifle Evaluation Study" published by the Army Combat Developments Command in 1962 (I believe at the behest of McNamara), which focused on the AR-15 and AK-47 (as well as the now largely bypassed M14). We don't need to worry about having totally absurd comparison articles because we include this notable comparison, any more than we need to worry about having totally absurd people articles because we include notable people. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 07:00, 19 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My point is that the objects being compared are arbitrary; it's not surprising that a study written in 1962 about a new assault rifle would compare it to the AK-47; it is then and now the most popular assault rifle in the world. Any article about any assault rifle, on Wikipedia or off, will not be unlikely to make reference to the AK-47, mentioning how it was influenced by the AK-47 (or why it wasn't) and/or comparing it to the AK-47 as a baseline.<br />
If you don't like my (admittedly silly) example, would you want to see FN FAL vs. AK-47 and Sig 550 vs. Heckler-Koch G41 and every possible comparison thereof?

<li>That's simply not true. There is a laborious but straightforward procedure for doing a "history merge" which provides a GFDL-compliant merge-and-delete. And it's easy to improvide GFDL-compliant merge-and-delete since the GFDL does not require any specific form for the attribution so long as it is done. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:51, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> (a copy is also in the discussion for <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paulo_Ramos_00f1.html" title="Paulo Ramos">Paulo Ramos</a>): I am not sure that <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD8</a> applies here. A copyright violation is when someone who is not the copyright owner tries to use a document outside of what is permitted by its copyright owner. In this case, the author of the article has implicitely authorized the Wikipedia to use the article (by placing it here). The problem is that the Wikipedia does not allow authors to retain all rights (articles must be released under the GNU doc license). I am not sure what happens in this case. I think that the first step is what Walter did, that is, warning the author.

<li><b>comment</b> I don't know, but there are some student associations/governments in Wikipedia.

<li><i>Comment</i> ETS is a large and notable university in Montreal. This would be the student's association with elected members, therefore important in the context of the university. Whether or not we want to include such trivial groups on the wider scale of things in Wikipedia is what we should really be discussing here. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComics_5b1d.html" title="User:Comics">Comics</a> 01:36, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>The discussion of whether university student unions should have articles or not has been through VfD before, and sawed off at a no-consensus keep-by-default. If you <i>seriously</i> want to pitch for the mass consensus again, my own vote would be to delete all. But if you're not prepared to open that can of worms, I have to vote <b>keep</b> here, on the grounds that this student union is not inherently any less notable than any other student union that's allowed to stick around. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 02:28, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>Non notable? It's only the largest dark-side telecommunications enthusiast community in Australia. That forum is a forum, but the people under there are a real community. I'm not even from there, and I know that. Beleive it or not, there are telecommunications outside of the United States. Just because you don't know about something doesn't make it non-notable. Being from Canada, myself, I've actually had contact with those folks on quite a few occasions.</p>

<p>tim makes an extremely valid point, just because you dont know about it doesn't make it non-noteable, If you had any clue then you'd know the differences (or moreso advances between australia and america's telephone companies) these advances making phreaking 'harder' and the fact that Ausphreak is bringing in a large group of people is a more then enough reason to have it mentioned, its that even through the difficulty people manage to find a way showing to people that where there is a will theres a way, this ausphreak article is somewhat inspiring and it would be a great loss seeing it go.</p>

People are constantly seeking the history of our boards, and there is no where else, to my knowledge, that is it documented, So what better place than Wikipedia? The place where most people go to find the information of which they seek? Just because the acts detailed and the information contained within ausphreak's community is albeit "shady" does that mean the people should not be able to access informaion about who they are, what they have done etc?</p>

With 1420 current members, and almost 10,000 hits a month its more then a website it's a community. We have meets and people traveled from all over australia at the start of this month to attend the annual Ruxcon conference (including myself) in Sydney. The diveresity of the group is huge. We're are not just phreakers, or hackers we're people from all walks of life with a common interest. To learn.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Well let's look at Wikpedia's guideline for the inclusion of web sites on <a href="../../../w/e/b/Wikipedia%7EWebsites_fbda.html" title="Wikipedia:Websites">Wikipedia:Websites</a>. Having an Alexa ranking of 10,000 or better". Hmm, Ausphreak has an Alexa rating of 1 480 365 <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.ausphreak.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.ausphreak.com" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> -- you don't meet that one.</li>
</ul>
<p>-&gt;<i>Whilst true, our other domain, networkpunk.com, has a rank considerably lower. It's more than just a web address, if that wasn't clear within the article itself. Furthermore, websites/communities such as Phone Losers of America do not meet this magical 10,000 number, yet are left relatively alone.</i></p>
<p>"Having been the subject of national or international media attention within the last 2 years". I don't know about that one.</p>
<p>-&gt;<i><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=onY&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=gmail+hack+ausphreak&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=onY&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=gmail+hack+ausphreak&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google GmailHack</a> - I'm sure you'll see it gained international media attention nonetheless.</i></p>
<p>"Having a forum with 5,000 or more apparently unique members". According to someone else in this AfD you only have 1420 members which is quite some way off 5000. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowells_4fc9.html" title="User:Chowells">chowells</a> 09:14, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>-&gt;<i>Just because we choose to cull off inactive (yet still unique) members, does not mean we have not had over 5000. Nonetheless, Ausphreak should not be judged solely as a website as it is more a reference to Australian hacking and phreaking in general.</i> IdleFire 12:26, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Non-notable. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 10:38, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> It's a well enough written article, but it's <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> what Wikipedia is for. Host it on geocities if you think it needs a place on the web. (I see the Ausphreak website seems very proud of its Wikipedia entry, even bold linking it. Someone commented above that the history of the boards is not documented elsewhere -- well, why not document it on your own website?) Lastly, non-notable. <a href="http://www.underground-book.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.underground-book.com/" rel="nofollow">Underground</a> is an actual book that covers Australian phreakers &amp; hackers from the late 80s-early 90s in Australia. None of the topics in that book have Wikipedia articles and they're actually somewhat notable (appeared in the media at the time, set some legal precedents). <a href="../../../p/f/c/User%7EPfctdayelise_e220.html" title="User:Pfctdayelise">pfctdayelise</a> 12:51, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>-&gt;<i>One of our community members is Electron, who has stressed that the book is not something to be taken as gospel - we offer a non-biased perspective on issues related to the Australian hacking and phreaking scene that can not be seen in any other forms of the media. It was simply felt that people could gain from such information posted here on wikipedia, and was never meant to serve as an advertisement for ausphreak.com itself. The link was only to allow members to add things that I may have missed when writing the article initially.</i></p>

<li><b>Your Parent Wikimedia, on its main page, hold the saying "Imagine a world in which every single person is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing."</b></li>
</ul>
<p>I have read your policies into your website inclusion policy, and yes i agree with it, <b>TO AN EXTENT</b>.</p>
<p>Google is, disputably, the largest search engine of its kind in the world, and it is noticeable. Ausphreak is the largest community of its kind in Australia, so why is it not like noticeable? It may not be the world, but it sure as hell is noticeable for the 1000s of Australian members who use it everyday. The website hits are not the whole picture here, you seem to be looking towards Ausphreak as a website, but it is a community of entusiasts behind the screen of the domain and forum who everyday submit and share new information.</p>

<dd>Sometimes it takes more than 7 hours (time before nomination) for an article to be improved to "show notability".

<dl>
<dd>There's a speedy criterion for people who's article doesn't assert why they're notable. It's only logical to extend this to buildings and organizations. We're already deleting unremarkable bands. While a bad article <i>may</i> be improved, it's a fact that a lot of school articles remain hideous stubs with a complete lack of encyclopedic information (Wikipedia articles are not placeholders). The best way to avoid these discussions is to write articles which assert notability to those who don't think high schools are inherently notable. Listing notable alumni and well-known school sports teams is a good way to start on this. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 07:42, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There is really no need to do this. If you feel the school article is a very small stub, and somehow that irritates you, then simply merge them up into the next level of school district etc until you have an article that satisfies your aesthetic.

<li>It is not my responsibility to improve articles that others have started and then dropped. It is my contention that if a school is important enough to write about, then bloody well include some important information. If it's not, then don't waste useful CPU cycles and server space.

<li>Comment: I think it's not so much a matter of the debate leaning to keep, it's that it was the nominator themselves who retracted it. If I or others "keepers" removed it, that would be bad, but if the nominator does it, I think that's widely accepted. But, if there's objection to removal (as there is now), then it should now stay. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 07:09, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>These were written by the same person, and are likely vanity or a hoax. Moises got me 1 google. Leal got me quit a few, but I can't tell which are her. Laura, combined with just about any other thing mentioned in the article, didn't get any hits either. Either way, the claims of notability are pretty meager. It's very easy to call you work "important" or "groundbreaking", but I can't verify the claims made. For a "well-known economic theorist" Leal didn't have any books at amazon. Perro-Palero (0 googles) is basically nonsense. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:58, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Addressing the deletes: Those older entries were likely created by individual users of the message board and should not be taken seriously. This article is now under construction and will be brought up to speed quickly. "Cheap Ass Gamer" is the site's actual name as indicated on the site itself. The management has never used the name "Cheapass Gamer" in any context. A 13,000 Alexa rank could just as easily be 5,000 (and it has) as we all know Alexa is not accurate in these ranges. As a comparison, the above mentioned "<a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheapass_Games_4c2f.html" title="Cheapass Games">Cheapass Games</a>" has an Alexa rank close to 350,000. Thanks, -CD

<li><b>Comment</b> However, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheapass_Games_4c2f.html" title="Cheapass Games">Cheapass Games</a> is a real-world company that happens to have a website to promote its business.

<li>Is Wales now part of England? I need to pay more attention to the current events page. In answer to your question about who might be looking for articles on schools: if and when wikipedia rises to the level that it hopes to attain, (where people use it as a reference tool containing useful, reliable and detailed encyclopedic articles on important topics), then I could think of any number of situations where a researcher may need to gather information about public schools.<em>—<a href="../../../g/a/f/User%7EGaff_a634.html" title="User:Gaff"><font color="Indigo">Gaff</font></a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../g/a/f/User_talk%7EGaff_697b.html" title="User talk:Gaff"><font color="MediumSlateBlue">ταλκ</font></a></b></small></sup></em> 20:25, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I can't think of a single non-contrived situation where it would be easier or more useful to read an encyclopedia to find out about a local p[ublic school than to simply call that public school. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 23:31, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>There may be no "policy" per se, but there certainly is a <b>precedent</b>. 85%-90% of all schools nominated for VfD/AfD in the past year are not deleted. See: <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Votes_for_deletion_archive_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Votes for deletion archive">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Votes for deletion archive</a>.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 06:05, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>True but they haven't been "keep" either. There is no consensus on school articles as 90% of the VFDs show.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 07:21, 19 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Depends on the school type. Elementaries almost always lack consensus. High schools, are usually kept with a clear majority, and often consensus, especially if complete articles. Also, lets not forget the delete counts include unverifiable schools, including out and out hoaxes by vandals (so the real school keep rate is possibly higher than suggested). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 07:34, 19 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One thing I think the "keep" crowd has glossed over is the fact that a large majority of the schools that are "no consensus" at closure are actually being voted around 60% for delete. The only reason they are being kept is that there is no supermajority, but the vast majority of schools do have a majority of delete votes.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 23:51, 19 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Irrelevant. AfD policy and guidelines are clear that when there is no concensus to delete an article, it isn't deleted. That is the standard, the policy and the precedent. The important aspect of all this, is that as a matter of <b>precedent</b> derived from the practical application of the AfD policies, is that almost all school articles are not deleted.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 01:49, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, there's a massive majority for deleting fake hoax schools, like the one you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FRollings_middle_school&amp;diff=25962390&amp;oldid=25961992" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FRollings_middle_school&amp;diff=25962390&amp;oldid=25961992" rel="nofollow">admit</a> to making. School articles with a reasonable amount of content (even if not famous) are likely to get a majority to keep. Sub-stubs are likely to have a majority to delete. That shows people do in fact want school *content*, they're just not happy with articles lacking it. If you look at votes, you'll often see the first few are delete based on a one-line stub, and then keeps after modest improvement. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 01:18, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You act as if debating on AFD somehow prevents people from contributing to Wikipedia. It isn't a zero-sum game; discussing and debating on AFD doesn't detract from work on the encyclopedia.<br />
I'm uncomfortable with this theme of "Stop arguing about this!" The only was consensus is going to be formed is by discussion and debate, and, ideally, AFD is the place for this debate to begin. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 10:00, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Then by all means, start expanding some of those stubs and show it's actually possible. School articles that already survived an AFd discussion are likely not to be deleted anytime soon, so if you're scared of your work getting deleted, start there. Also, take a look at our featured school articles and just do it. A lot of the discussion would be moot if there was a real article instead of a substub to begin with. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:53, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Unlike some keepers, I don't mind (don't love, but don't mind) a limited number of selective school AFDs each month. At some point the line does have to be drawn. For instance, I don't support pre-schools or home schools (which have had articles, that had to be deleted). I respect those who use reasonable means, even to delete schools I think should be included. However, a small number of AFDs a month, does a perfectly good job at this. It picks the "worst" for attention. Such limited cases are more likely to either be deleted (though I oppose that) or cleaned up (which is a fine result). However, with masses of schools are nominated, then everybody just repeats the same vote, same words, and nothing is acocmplished. It's interesting how a couple months with the highest nominations actually resulted in the fewest deletes. Huge numbers of nominations is disruptive and pointless. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 10:37, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>What B.S. The claim from "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles on the basis of being non-notable" that being called "deletionists" is a personal attack is the biggest load of horse manure that gets spewed all over these school AfD pages. It simply is not a personal attack to refer to "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles on the basis of being non-notable" as deletionists, any more than calling some of us "keepers", "inclusionists" or "weak" or any of the labels your side comes up with. There <b>are</b> deletionists who <b>routinely</b> vote to delete school articles.

<li>Aha. Somebody else who's rushed in on their high horse to make a comment without bothering to investigate the reasons for nomination thoroughly. Well done! This article was a heap of drivel that hadn't even been given the correct title. I too disagree with deleting schools.

<li>From the article in it's current stae, I can see no reason as to why it has bee nominated, nor why anyone can now deem it suitable for deletion. Maybe in a previous formate the article wasn't what some people thought acceptable, but surely rather than nominating for deletion it would have been no more or less work to have edited the article of the 'offensive' sentences or to have done minimal research to have made the article suitable for inclusion. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 01:01, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is an excellent illustration of the reasons why encyclopedic overviews of interchangable sets are more valuable than overly-specific individual articles about the members of those sets.

<p>I heard someone use the word "fran" a couple months ago but I did not know what it meant. And this past week I have heard the word used on several occasions, so I decided to look it up to see what it meant. Of course, it was not in the dictionary, but I decided to do a Wiki search and I was overjoyed to find the entry. I now understand what people are talking about when they say "fran". (Also, I have heard "fran" used in different contexts and the definitions provided in the Wiki article seem very accurate.)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
I knew this was a word!!!! i used to hear it on this TV show i watched when i was a little kid, but none of my friends had ever heard it! they didn't believe me either! i was relieved that i found it, and know i am going to print off several copies of this page and paste them all over my school and give them to my friends and family so everyone will know i wasn't crazy!! Thank You Wiki for believing in the small hidden words that the dictionary doesn't acknowledge.....you are wonderful.</p>

<li>Hello, I'm the main admin/owner of GlitchSeekers and I'm currently adding the History of the site. The site isn't very small, just not many registered users, as we don't know require a user to be registered to use any service or feature on the site. I do request you keep this document up, but I do understand if you want to delete it. I had orginally planned to link from my site to here for information on Glitch Seekers, but its up to you guys.</li>

<li>You're entirely correct that it doesn't qualify for a speedy deletion, as a speedy deletion is something that is carried out instantly, without debate. It is, however, a valid candidate for deletion, because it's not a notable site. I hasten to add that that "notable" and "good" are not the same thing; your site may be very good indeed, but to be included in Wikipedia, it must make a significant impression on the world at large (or, more properly in this instance, the gaming community)... and frankly, 70 registered members and 250 unique hits a day is a clear indication that it does not have such an impact. If you guys think that's a lot, I'm sorry, but it really isn't. Also, the article is blatantly unencyclopedic and reads more like an advertisement of your site, which doesn't help things any (though you should not infer from this that if you rewrite it, it will not be deleted). -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 21:59, 20 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree with you, that 70 registered and 250 unique isn't a lot at all, and why I understand if this is deleted, I would understand. I still think its neat having this article up here, but I would understand if it were to be deleted. I'm a little new to Wikipedia, and I'm wondering, would it be ok, if this were to be deleted, if I posted this in my profile as it seems users here have their own little article/profile area. I don't want to break a rule though, that is why I'm asking. Thanks for your time. -urmomma 21:06, 20 October 2005</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> it is sufficiently notable, with over 250 unigue hits per day. thats a lot. god_gs 03:39, 20 October 2005 (CST)</li>

<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>How can we determine what will become significant and what will not. We do not mean to advertise our site. It just comes out that way because all we do is talk about our site. If we talked about the many drawbacks we had and bad things about the site, would that make it seem less like an advertisement. Also, on the note of it not being sufficiently notable, who determines whether something is notable or not. To me, this sight is more than extremely notable because i have contributed the better part of the past 8 months helping to build this site to what it presently is. Many sites do not even come close to making it this far. Isn't that some indication that one day our website will be notable. Bloodysaint
<ul>
<li>How can we determine what will become significant and what will not? Now you're getting it -- we can't. And that's why we don't. In fact, there is an official policy about that: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. If the site becomes notable, well, at that point someone who is <i>not</i> actually involved with its administration will probably write the article. If the site is not notable, then no article is required. (As for who determines whether or not a site is notable, editors like you and me do. And yes, that often involves quite a bit of debate, but in this instance, when you guys quote as usage statistics of 70 registered users and 250 unique hits per day, and even you yourself admit that the website is not yet notable, it's really pretty easily determined... and in any case, notable gaming sites likes Gamespy, IGN and Adrenaline Vault have <a href="http://www.alexa.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com" rel="nofollow">Alexa</a> rankings of 1,360, 211 and 19,084, respectively, Glitchseekers gets 5,141,707. My personal blog, which is pretty damn far from notable, is ranked at 2,181,859. I'm sure you can tell the difference. Guys, really -- let it go. If you believe in your site, keep working at it; if it makes it big, trust me, there'll be an article on it. Right now, it's not yet notable. The sooner you accept that and the more realistic a view of where you are now at is, the better your chances of making an impact are.) -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 00:48, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>In the prior deletion discussion, it was mentioned that there was an on-line "dictionary of profanity" that listed this word with a wholly different definition to the one being deleted. This is that definition. Since this isn't re-creation of deleted content, here we are again. The on-line dictionary (linked to by the article) is currently lacking in content. This article is a dictionary article about a word, that has been placed in the wrong project. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. It was marked for transwikification, but Wiktionary almost certainly doesn't want it, because it is not attested that this is in fact a word at all. An encyclopaedia article by this title would be about hamtouchers, whatever they would be. But since there's no such word, there's no such thing as a hamtoucher for an encyclopaedia article to be about. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:48, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The article (before the very good edits by rob) was nominated because it didn't establish the notability of the school and was mostly nonsense. I don't think that schools should be extempted from the policies about notability and nonsense, as the last two comments seem to suggest.

<dd>I agree with half of that. The nonsense warranted deletion, and effectively that's what I did, since I simply deleted all the old text, and wrote something new in it's place. If I had admin powers I would have speedied it, closed the AFD (consensus speedy delete), and then created the new article. Perhaps a kind admin could now delete the older history, and close this AFD early (keeping the new version obviously). This would respect the votes of every participant. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 23:36, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The main issue here was the nonsense. I admit I was wrong in raising the issue of notability (which has never been my primary concern anyway). If the page were simply a one-line description of the school, I wouldn't have nominated it for deletion. What I don't like of some of the comments above is the idea that articles about schools should <i>never</i> be nominated for deletion even if they violate other policies beside notability. As Mgm suggested, keep in mind that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hillfield-Strathallan_College&amp;oldid=25918616" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hillfield-Strathallan_College&amp;oldid=25918616" rel="nofollow">the version that was nominated</a> was mostly nonsense.

<dd>User:Paolo Liberatore deserves thanks for dealing with vandalism (which is what an article with pure nonsense and a semi-attack is). With a minor edit to the article name, not a single thing of the original article article is left.

<li>Well, the article is obviously very incomplete. But, there is ample sources of the history (and the school in general). I'm sure when someone has a chance to wade through the 200 newspaper articles mentioning the school's name, the 278 unique sites in google hits, 668 total Google hits, and the history on the school's own web site, that it will be better explained. We shouldn't expect articles to be made instantly perfect from the start. The potential for expansion/improvement has been clearly shown here. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 22:46, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I like that it has been rewritten and is now an informative article. I still wonder if the title is useful as it seems rather too specific. It seems a topic of importance, don't get me wrong. But I wonder if it would not have a more useful place either as a section under the respective planets that you cover, or in the article on hydrocarbons, or as somebody above suggested exogeology.

<li>I'm sorry you think this is nonsense, but it's something I am very serious about.What is wrong in trying to change your life&#160;?</li>
</ul>
<p>I am putting Jagism into practise everyday and have several interested parties willing to try Jagism.It ain't a religous thing, just a simple philosophy where you make your own decisions. I am currently in the process of trying to write a pamphlet about Jagism and the positive benefits it can have on your life.Cheers.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why is it less notable than Buddhism? Maybe because Buddhism has millions of adherents worldwide whereas a google on Jagism yields 12 hits including one speculating on a particular foible of his Jaguar being a "jagism"&#160;:-) That and it sounds like a vanity name for something which people already did anyway. So, either demonstrate notability (e.g. list of notable adherents) or delete. (later) checked some more: I really can't find any credible evidence that this exists outside of a very limited circle - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> 12:22, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Everything starts from a small beginning - even Christianity started with just 12 disciples. Perhaps if this Wiki was available to the Roman Empire, they could dismiss any articles from Christians as having no "credible evidence that this exists outside of a small circle" or has any "notable adherents." Does the endorsement of someone 'notable' give credibility to an idea?</p>
<ul>
<li>When Christianity had 12 adherents it was probably not notable. It now has 2.1 billion, so is. What verifiable external evidence of notability has been presented for Jagism?

<p>Isn't "jagism" a legitimate offshoot of the <i>Marxist</i> / <i>Trotskyist</i> dialectical method of apprehending nature, which regards the phenomena of nature as being in constant movement and undergoing constant change, though applied to personal choice, i.e. more akin to the discarded <i>Hegelian</i> idealistic shell? <a href="../../../d/i/z/User%7EDizietSma_2eb8.html" title="User:DizietSma">DizietSma</a> 14:21 19 October 2005</p>

<dd>This is a huge concept to grasp. People always tell me, “I’m going to make some major changes.” My response to that is simple: Certain aspects of your life might need a significant overhaul, but I don’t need to know about those big changes. I’m more interested in the minor change you plan to make today. Personal improvement starts when you change something you do daily—a routine, a habit, a way of working, or interacting with other people."</dd>

<p>Thanks for the support guys. There will be a web-site up shortly dealing with Jagism in more depth.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The purpoose of wikipedia is to be a compedium of verifiable, encyclopedic articles. Something need not be noted on google (many of our historical topics are not) but there must be <b>some</b> verifiable evidenece of the existance of the subject, and some reson to belive that it is significant, i.e. notable. if this can't be found on google, where <b>can</b> it be found. Have any books been published about Jagism? Have any newspapers or other media reported on it? are there large numbers of people devoted to it? It may be an admirable and valuable concept. We don't oppose it. Neither do we foster it. Wikipedia is not a soapbox, it is not the place where new ideas get promoted. Go out into the world and convice people of the importance or value of Jagism. Get them talking and writing about it, in one medium or another. Then come back here and we will report on what they say. (If people are already doing this, tell us here. Give us citations.) <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:37, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Message from Jag; Fellow disciples of Jagism, do not despair.Let the greedhead non forward thinking have their way. We know Jagism works and will continue to work it's way into a society that is, thanks to folk who refuse to try and change, gonna end up disappearing up its own ass.</p>

<li>Contrary to what some people say, the Mischief Masters, Jordy and Jan-bouke <i>do</i> exist and therefor deserve a spot in the Wikipedia. The Mischief Masters haven't reached national fame yet, but they're working very hard to do so by producing products like their movie A New Master. People who don't believe it should check their IMDB page. For further proof they could look at the biggest Dutch DVD site <i>DVD-home</i> since they devoted a artikel to the Masters. Doubters will see for themselves that there IS a movie made. The page is written in Dutch, but does contain screenshots. I do agree that there isn't a Mischeif Masters series since there is only one movie made with a second production coming. The url to the article mentioned: <a href="http://www.dvd-home.nl/nieuws/oud2004.htm#8" class="external free" title="http://www.dvd-home.nl/nieuws/oud2004.htm#8" rel="nofollow">http://www.dvd-home.nl/nieuws/oud2004.htm#8</a> The Masters are displayed just above the "Augustus" (August) banner. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Unstoppableforce (<a href="../../../u/n/s/User_talk%7EUnstoppableforce_7b36.html" title="User talk:Unstoppableforce">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Unstoppableforce_2db9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Unstoppableforce">contribs</a>) User has 4 contributions, 3 for these AFDs.</small>

<li><b>Delete</b>. To repeat what I said in the AfD for the article on his colleague: I'm sure the movie exists, I just don't think it's particularly significant in the grand scale of things.

<dd>But the interest in John Nelson is not that he was written about by Hakluyt. The interest is that he is the first recorded instance of an English convert to Islam. Hence, he is more naturally merged to the List. The fact that the list primarily contains 20th century figures is a problem of the list. If it was supposed to be restircted it should be List of 20th century converts to Islam. --best, kevin <font color="#BBBBBB">·</font><font color="#666666">·</font>·<small><a href="../../../k/z/o/User%7EKzollman_a660.html" title="User:Kzollman">Kzollman</a> | <a href="../../../k/z/o/User_talk%7EKzollman_107b.html" title="User talk:Kzollman">Talk</a></small>·<font color="#666666">·</font><font color="#BBBBBB">·</font> 15:19, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Contrary to what some people say, the Mischief Masters <i>do</i> exist and therefor deserve a spot in the Wikipedia. The Mischief Masters haven't reached national fame yet, but they're working very hard to do so by producing products like their movie A New Master. People who don't believe it should check their IMDB page. For further proof they could look at the biggest Dutch DVD site <i>DVD-home</i> since they devoted a artikel to the Masters. Doubters will see for themselves that there IS a movie made. The page is written in Dutch, but does contain screenshots. I do agree that there isn't a Mischeif Masters series since there is only one movie made with a second production coming.

<p>My hoax sense is tingling, but only weakly. There are eleven <i>million</i> hits for the string "JR Hunter", but it looks like most of those are references to "junior". Google turns up <i>nothing</i> for the names of some of her alleged works, and nothing for the names of the others when they're combined with the string "hunter".

<hr />
<p>I took a peek at the Icelandic Wikipedia. It would appear that the term <i>Kerfissíða</i> is the Icelandic equivalent of the English word <i>Special</i>. For example, see <a href="../../../../is/a/l/l/Kerfiss%C3%AD%C3%B0a%7EAllpages_e6dc.html" class="extiw" title="is:Kerfissíða:Allpages">the Allpages page</a>. Therefore, "Kerfissíða:Contributions/Dabbidj" would translate to "Special:Contributions/Dabbidj", meaning that <b>Dabbidj</b> is the user in question and not <b>Kerfissíða</b>. Is there a <b>Dabbidj</b> registered on the English Wikipedia? --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian">Merovingian</a> <a href="../../../m/e/r/User_talk%7EMerovingian_28b5.html" title="User talk:Merovingian">(t)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Merovingian_5415.html" title="Special:Contributions/Merovingian">(c)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza">(<font color="green"><i>e</i></font>)</a> 02:12, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>That's irrelevant; a copyright violation is a copyright violation, regardless of who the copyright is owned by. However, as it happens, I <i>don't</i> think this is a copyright violation, since the article is copied from opensource.org, and they state that the contents of their website are licensed under <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/afl-2.1.php" class="external text" title="http://opensource.org/licenses/afl-2.1.php" rel="nofollow">Academic Free License v. 2.1</a>, a quote of which is as follows: <i>"1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the following: A. to reproduce the Original Work in copies; B. to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original Work; C. to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public; D. to perform the Original Work publicly; and F. to display the Original Work publicly."</i> So I think that's actually quite acceptable to display that... (Well, as it were, not quite, because the article didn't include proper attribution and whatnot, but I just added the missing copyright notice just to keep things simple.) <strike>Anyway, I don't think there's any way an article like this is going to be rewritten into a non-copyrighted form, so I think it should just be <b>deleted</b>. This is pretty damn far from encyclopedic material and should be deleted</strike>, but a copyvio it isn't, as far as I can tell. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 07:27, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Borderline <b>keep</b> . Rochester isn't a huge media market, but it isn't insignificant either. Seven years is a pretty long time for a wrestling show to go on. Article also needs to be cleaned up to remove vanity POV. Also needs to be disambiguated.

<li>First off, <b>lets avoid hazing the newbies</b>, even if they are here trying to get a somewhat self promotional article published. Not every one is familiar with wiki-ettiquette. My first experience on wikipedia was so negative that I nearly left altogether. If this radion show is in fact notable, then it should be kept regardless of who initially posted it. It is now part of WP and can be freely edited by anyone.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is... bizarre, really. I'm going to have to call this a hoax; it just doesn't make any sense to me, and I think it's fair to say that I'm rather well-informed on the games front, both in digital and pen and paper formats.

<li>I do think this is a hoax. <i>First of all</i>, the article refers to the "now obsolete 'Graphical Adventure' genre of computer games"; that genre is not obsolete by any means, and anyone interested enough in games to write an article about this and knowledgeable enough to mention various adventure games by name would most likely be aware of this. <i>Secondly</i>, I can't find any meaningful Google hits for "Chris DeLuca", "XaQ", "BronzeCo", "Elven Publishing Inc." "Till Time Do Us Part" or any other terms mentioned on the article that aren't Wikipedia mirrors. If this was a notable game, it'd be just about guaranteed that someone would talk about it on the net; even if it wasn't, I should be able to get at least one hit that would refer to one of these companies or people. <i>Thirdly</i>, there is absolutely no reference to how these games are supposedly played. Are they like pen and paper RPGs? Do they have rules? Are they like "choose your own adventure" books? The plotlines and whatnot seem extremely convoluted and complex, yet we are given absolutely no information on how these games supposedly work. I find this significant because there's no way it would work without a very elaborate and thought-out setup, and that in itself would have to be such an inherent part of the game that not referring to it at all in any way makes me suspicious. <i>Fourthly</i>... seriously, man, just read the article -- most of the stuff is just nonsensical. And <i>finally</i>, looking at the article's history, I see that when the article was first created, someone from the same IP address added typos on purpose to another article just a few hours later. It's possible that the IP was acquired by another Wikipedia editor in that time, but still it's something to think about. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 22:36, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This - 'one of the highest traffic boards on the internet' - is an opinion with no substantiation. People from that forum will edit the message with vulgarities and obscenities on a 24 hour basis to degrade other people. That is the sole point of the article. No academia, only petty wars. User:65.33.8.89 I was responsible for one of the early (18:55, 12 October 2005) edits of the Passion Pit article. That said, I now think it's a strong candidate for deletion.

<p>As DJ Clayworth mentions, vandalism alone is no reason for deletion. Anyway, had a look around, and it appears that IMDB has approx. 4 million users<a href="http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:IY-t-NSOo90J:www.big-boards.com/board/926/+imdb+statistics&amp;hl=nn&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external autonumber" title="http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:IY-t-NSOo90J:www.big-boards.com/board/926/+imdb+statistics&amp;hl=nn&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, which I would say is enought to make it a notable bbs, although I don't know the specifics about this particular board. One option might be to create an article for the IMDB bbs, if it doesn't already exist, and then merge this into that article, or to create a Category:imdb-forums, and list any other (if they exist) notable IMDB forums. Although this won't help regarding the vandalism, the article would be placed in a better context. Any comments to this?</p>
<p>BTW: please remember to sign the posts, even if you are an anon user. <a href="../../../b/j/e/User%7EBjelleklang_549f.html" title="User:Bjelleklang">bjelleklang</a> 19:45, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

I support keeping the page as a valid reference (The Passion of the Christ message board is one of the largest and most frequented on the IMDB), but support locking it to prevent contentious changes. -JK 11:02 PM EST, Oct. 14 2005</p>
<p>Though it is heavily trafficked by a limited number of users, it is not one of the largest on the IMDB. In fact, the IMDB administrators have limited its size. The board was certainly a phenomenon in the year leading up to and during the time of the movie's release, and that might make an interesting subject for an encyclopedia entry. But to give it an entry such as is currently composed is again, simply an sop to the vanity of a number of people who continue to post there.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At the moment, people on that forum are affraid to edit the article, because a user there posted on the Passion forum the IP Addresses of all the people debating here on this Wikipedia page. IMDb took action and removed the thread (IMDb protects privacy), but obviously it proves the people on that forum will do ANYTHING to hurt other people, including invading their privacy. User:65.33.8.89</p>
<p>Lastly, there are at least 75 forums that not only have heavier traffic than the Passion forum, but also have at least 5x the messages. The Passion forum has an average of 100 threads daily, whereas at least 75 other forums have 500 daily threads. The Main Boards (general topics) of IMDb alone eclipse the Passion forum in traffic rate and number of messages, not including the boards for newly released films and soon-to-be-released films.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I am not sure that <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD8</a> applies here. A copyright violation is when someone who is not the copyright owner tries to use a document outside of what is permitted by its copyright owner. In this case, the author of the article has implicitely authorized the Wikipedia to use the article (by placing it here). The problem is that the Wikipedia does not allow authors to retain all rights (articles must be released under the GNU doc license). I am not sure what happens in this case. I think that the first step is what Walter did, that is, warning the author.

<li><b>Move to correct spelling, keep and clean up</b>. (I will actually touch it up a bit in the current namespace after I do this AfD.)

<li><b>Keep</b> i'm the creator of the article. Age: 11. Firstly, well done for the others who have decided to add more. It'll be a shame to lose that article in it's first fortnight. But, let me note, i don't know a awful lot about him, so it's up to you to keep it going. What makes NO sense at all is that the people who have voted to keep this article on wikipedia HAVE NOT CONTRIBUTED AT ALL! O.K, sorry to get over the top there, but you get the point. Anyway, here are a few ideas:</li>
</ul>
<p>Add ALL the questions he answered. Sure the big questions that helped him win a million is good, but i'm sure that everyone wants to see all the questions. Also, i heard that it took him 2 shows to win it so put that in as well.</p>
<p>Put in some info from that show after he won the money. Add in there some comments from the physcic and his family (if nessecary ask for permission first).</p>
<p>And lastly, if possible, add a few comments about his early life. So lets pick up the pace and add a few more things in this article!</p>

<li>As to keeping all schools, thus begins the slippery slope of keeping <i>anything</i> that exists. What about every business? What about every church? I'm not a deletionist, I simply believe that only if something is noteworthy do they belong here.
<ul>
<li>When AfD is revised such that keeping anything that exists is the norm, I promise to donate enough money to cover all of the extra disk-space, processing power and bandwidth that having a couple thousand stubs that are rarely accessed without any dynamic content will take up, as long as all of the wasted disk space, processing power and bandwidth of AfD (accessed all the time, with a massive amount of dynamic content) is sent to a charity of my choice. I have made my check out to the Wikipedia Foundation in the amount of $100, covering the cost of those stubs for ever.

<li>So, why did you create the Clovis Oceanview article entirely with misinformation. Then, when you switched it to a real school in Albany, you kept misinformation about the school's construction.

<li>Well, now that you've decided to confess to being a vandal, will you also admit you used sockpuppets with the pre-school and Clovis Oceanview hoax (for nominations).

Also, I enjoyed creating two valid articles about real "Ocean Vew Elementary Schools" (editing the Albany one to be correct, and another one in Virginia).

<li>Sure, Kappa, sounds good to me.

<li>An interesting statement. I do not nominate schools, so how could I be "punishing" you? I, like you, merely come here to vote. And "right thing" is a matter of perspective.

<li>You encourage nominations, and vote to delete when you know there is no consensus to do so. Nominating schools doesn't get them deleted, and takes us further away from any chance of consensus.

I'm not sure how notable it is; it wasn't very popular or successful, but it was one of the first games to integrate advertising into the gameplay. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 09:10, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Myself along with countless others are big fans of this NYC based band. I just saw them play at a huge festival in Amsterdam at the "Melkweig". It was a two day festival which included some of the most famous punk bands to ever exist. This band is definitely up and coming. To delete them would be an injustice</p>
<p>Just because they're not on ALLmusic.com just means that their record company has forgotten to send a copy of their latest album.

<li><b>DON'T DELETE</b> She-Put is most definitely not a hoax. It is a group of law students committed to radically reforming legal pedagogy as we know it.

<li><b>DON'T DELETE</b> She-Put is not a hoax.

<li><b>DON'T DELETE</b> As for the allegedly "non-encyclopedic" nature of She-Put, query, what is the entire point of having a resource like Wikipedia? Wikipedia taps the collective knowledge of anybody who cares to participate, in order to assemble a comprehensive information source not subject to the limitations of traditional information markets. All law students currently involved in She-Put are augmenting the information base about the movement. The society running it is semi-secret, but it's activites are already public amongst law students. That publicity is currently local, but growing. What good reason is there for deleting this entry? Again, this cannot be a hoax - that just doesn't make sense - and what harm inheres in providing more information at virtually no cost? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.148.60.121 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.148.60.121_305a.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.148.60.121">contribs</a>) 05:02, 19 October 2005 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>DON'T DELETE</b> She-Put is categorically NOT a hoax. Rather, it is a very real organization of law students dedicated to its tenets and determined to ensure its success throughout future generations of law school students in search of an organization designed to provide meaning and substance to an otherwise banal law school career. As to its verifiability - members of She-Put have a First Amendment right to expressive association and the mere existence of the organization renders it inherently verifiable. The organization likewise has a First Amendment right to the freedom of speech, and the informative article currently under consideration for deletion on Wikipedia harmlessly describes this critically important organization using no offensive, untrue, or unencyclopedic descriptors. An encyclopedia serves to provide information about a wide range of topics, and this article merely provides information about this burgeoning and exciting law school movement.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Yes, the viral marketing campaign is aimed at spreading popularity of the organization to other law schools, and the Wikipedia entry is simply not a part of that. Compare my prior comments on the necessity of this not being a hoax: any information source that mentions a viral marketing campaign is, by definition, not a part of any viral marketing campaign. Note finally that - if Wikipedians deleted everything that has been promoted at one point or another by a viral marketing campaign - this would require deletion of articles on many consumer products, e.g. likely everything made in the last 10 or 15 years by an apparel company with brand recognition, for starters. This would also include soft drinks and the like. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.148.60.121 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.148.60.121_305a.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.148.60.121">contribs</a>) 14:24, 20 October 2005 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. First, re claims that the no "no harm" argument is a desperater, it is not. It just highlights the fact that the article bears no substantial risk of providing "bad" information to Wiki readers. Moreover, its inclusion amongst several better arguments precludes desperater status; it's just thrown in there to make an additional, albeit weaker, point. Additionally, it just doesn't follow from the presence of even a terrible argument that no good argument exists. Weak arguments are often used to support strong conclusions. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.148.60.121 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.148.60.121_305a.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.148.60.121">contribs</a>) 15:48, 20 October 2005 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Second, as to verifiability: When numerous people claim to have organized for a particular purpose, that they have is inescapable, unless of course they are lying. In this context, the only real reason that we would have to lie is to perpetrate a hoax and, as noted above, that just doesn't make sense, here. Thus, for the purposes of this article, our claims are self-verifying. We do admit, however, that there is a distinction between the goals of an organization and its actual effects; thus, if it would make other Wikipedians more comfortable as to the quality and accuracy of the article, we have no problem with removal of the segment on viral marketing specifically. That we intended to use such a campaign is one thing, whether or not it is substantial is another, and so we concede verifiability problems, there. Finally, we aren't trying to abuse Wikipedia but to add information to it. That something like She Put could be documented here is a testament to the advantages of this particular sort of information source. Let's not overstate Wikipedia's policies: much of the information included herein is not verifiable in the traditional sense, but references obscure phenomena, such as trends in the tastes of comic book aficionados etc. If the policies were as stringent as those used by traditional information sources, the benefits Wikipedia would be very attenuated. Rather, these policies aim at preventing the spread of "bad" information - certainly a worthy goal - but the content in the She Put article really doesn't pose a risk of spreading "bad" information. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.148.60.121 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.148.60.121_305a.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.148.60.121">contribs</a>) 15:48, 20 October 2005 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. We have met the requisite criteria. It sounds like you are strictly interpreting the policy that "One of the keys to writing good encyclopedia articles is to understand that they should refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have already been published by a reputable publisher"; if that is truly the case, then about half of the material on here should be nixed. This may have been official policy at the inception, but is clearly not adhered to, at all. See, e.g., <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doom.html" title="Doom">Doom</a> for the wholly unsupported and unverifiable proposition that "The development of Doom was surrounded by much anticipation. The large number of posts in Internet newsgroups about Doom led to the SPISPOPD joke, to which a nod was given in the game in the form of a cheat code. In addition to news, rumors, and screenshots, unauthorized leaked alpha versions also circulated online. (Many years later these alpha versions were sanctioned by id Software because of historical interest; they reveal how the game progressed from its early design stages.)" This is only the first example that came to mind. It is a canon of construction that, if one interpretation of a rule leads to absurd results, that interpretation cannot be used. Likewise, if one possible meaning is systematically ignored for a long period of time, that also suggests that the interpretation is unworkable and not worthy of adopting. For instance, it is well accepted that - strictly speaking - it is unconstitutional for the federal government to print paper money. Because of the history of this practice, and the absurd results that would inhere in reverting to a strict interpretation, no commentators today seriosuly suggest that the practice is actually unconstitutional. Similarly, you are asserting a strict interpretation of the policy that is clearly not followed at all, and that nobody really takes seriously, here. --J-Bizzle 16:54, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>How do you know that it's "truly unsupported and unverifiable"? Have you looked through all the references cited in article? Wikipedia does not contain academic articles where every claim needs to be cited, but all statements made in the articles should be verifiable somehow. The verifiability policy is enforced through edit corrections in the case of existing articles, or the AFD process for new ones. Additionally, just because a policy isn't always strictly enforced doesn't mean it should be ignored. For example, eBay prohibits the sale of counterfeit goods, but there are a large number of auctions for fake purses or bootleg DVDs. eBay relies on its users to police its auctions, just as Wikipedia relies on its users to police its articles. There are upwards of 800,000 articles on the site; editing/deleting the ones that violate policies takes time and effort, but it doesn't mean we shouldn't be doing it. --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-weight: bold; color: #33C;">howcheng</span></a> <small>[ <a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Howcheng_7e82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Howcheng">contribs</a> • <a href="http://www.howcheng.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.howcheng.com/" rel="nofollow">web</a> ]</small> 17:59, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment.</b> I understand the need to police Wikipedia, but given the strength, seriousness, and sheer volume of the arguments below, query whether these voices are really worth silencing. Pages for deletion are typically jokes, vanity references to people's names, or a mess of sheer incoherence: nobody bothers to defend. We are vigorously defending She Put, not for vanity but to have good information about it available. As for verifiability, please see my comments below [now located above --hc] regarding the absurdity of an overly strict interpretation of Wikipedia policy.--J-Bizzle 17:23, 20 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Strength" is in the eye of the beholder here. In terms of criteria for inclusion in Wikipedia, the arguments your group members have made are not particularly strong, as evidenced by all the delete votes from experienced Wikipedia editors. "Volume" is also a non-issue, as <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_democracy" title="WP:ISNOT">Wikipedia is not a democracy</a> and meatpuppets' votes are essentially ignored. Also, you seem to misunderstand "vanity" as used here; please see <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_guidelines_9511.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity guidelines">Wikipedia:Vanity guidelines</a> for what we mean by that term. Nobody here is arguing that your group is vain or unworthy of existence, only that it does not merit inclusion in the encyclopedia. If She Put becomes at one point a big enough movement that it transcends multiple law schools and has an influence on a large number of students, <i>then</i> it deserves an article. Also, please place your comments at the end, or directly below other items you're commenting on, not above the nomination itself. --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-weight: bold; color: #33C;">howcheng</span></a> <small>[ <a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Howcheng_7e82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Howcheng">contribs</a> • <a href="http://www.howcheng.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.howcheng.com/" rel="nofollow">web</a> ]</small> 17:59, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Obvious Keep</b>. Do not assume everyone in the world knows what "steak sauce" is just because it is common in North America and the UK. There are places in the world where it is virtually unknown, even though steak is common. This is an encyclopedia, after all.

<dd>In my experience it's pretty much unknown as "steak sauce" in the UK, in fact. US "steak sauce" is pretty much exactly what we Brits call "brown sauce" (it being sauce and, er, brown...). I feel a redirect from [[Brown sauce]] coming on, except that's already a redirect to <a href="../../../h/p/_/HP_sauce_68ee.html" title="HP sauce">HP sauce</a>. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> <a href="../../../p/e/n/Image%7EPentacle.svg_e6ae.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b6/Pentacle.svg/15px-Pentacle.svg.png" alt="" width="15" height="15" longdesc="../../../p/e/n/Image%7EPentacle.svg_e6ae.html" /></a>&#160;| <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywalton_f58c.html" title="User talk:Tonywalton">Talk</a></small>

<dd>That is a bad redirect because HP is not the only brown sauce in the UK.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Needs improvement. Cultural universal. Valid U.S. folklore. Probably as universal as playing Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance March #1 at graduation. Present article weak but can be researched and improved. In a suburb of New York circa 1960 lyrics were ".../We have slaughtered all the teachers/We have broken every rule/We made pies of Mandy/And they came in very handy/Our class goes marching on/Glory, glory, Hallelujah/Mandy hit me with a ruler/So I bopped her on the bean/With a rotten tangerine/Our class goes marching on!" "Mandy" being one particular teacher, of course... In a suburb of Boston circa 1980 I have it on good authority that the lines were "/Glory, glory, Hallelujah/Teacha hit me with a ruler/So I hid behind the door/With a loaded .44/Now our teacha don't teach no more." Now, how about Never laugh when a hearse goes by/For you may be the next to die/They rap you up in a big white sheet/And drop you down about fifty feet? etc. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:46, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, but seeing as how other posters here have heard of it, without a definition on wikipedia, fewer people will know what it means.

<li>I'm sorry, but labeling all terms you've not heard as "neologism" seems to rule out what one would think Wikipedia is. Sure, it's not urbandictionary, yet the wiki editors have failed to slay "bling bling" as "neologism" and are worried about a term now circulating in the broadcast booths of ABC and Fox? Come on now. And the attempted witch-hunting of those that have found this term by random and wish to validate it is a bit out of touch. -benine <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.99.211.31 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.99.211.31_7094.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.99.211.31">contribs</a>) 00:49, 20 October 2005.</small>:

<li><b>Keep</b>: If the entry about "the endless november" Usenet phenomenon gets to stay, then I'll be damned if I'm not going to vote a hearty KEEP for "whoo-ride". There exist many subjects on wikipedia that are esoteric, arcane, or seemingly silly. Having them in a collected place is valuable. Anyway, "whoo-ride" apparently isn't just a slang term, but a phenomenon similar to a Clutch Underdog Victory, and such and such. Jeff Reardon comes to mind, and that kicker for the new england Patriots. They both showed the "right stuff" at the right place at the right time when everyone dismissed them as having the "wrong stuff" at the wrong place at the wrong time. I rest my case. KEEP.
