<p><s>Added a new AFD for this article. Despite being based on <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, it does not meet it:</s></p>

<li>Has not had a charted hit on any national music chart.</li>
<li>Has not been certified gold in any major country.</li>
<li>Has not gone on an international concert tour. Has performed in other states in the US, but does not qualify as a full national tour.</li>
<li>Has not released two albums, hasn't released anything on a major or indie label.</li>
<li>No reliable cited sources. There is a minor mention in a <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_New_Times_0639.html" title="Phoenix New Times">Phoenix New Times</a>, a local paper, but this is not a major article. The AZNightBuzz link is a blog, therefore not reputatable. The eCollegeTimes has only 50 unique hits on Google, not reputable. The State Press is a bigger article, but is only a small college paper and part of a news page . Does not hit "Has been featured in <b>multiple</b> non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media". No national press whatsoever</li>
<li>No major members from other bands</li>
<li>Not a notable style for a city or a local scene of a city. If it were, they would have received more verifiable press mentions.</li>
<li>Has not won or been placed a major music award. Won one "Best of Phoenix" award from a local paper, and was nominated for another. These are nowhere near "major".</li>
<li>Not performed performed music for a work of media that is notable, or been on radio</li>
<li>172 hits on Google, 126 listeners on last.fm. Does not pass either as notable. Also isn't mentioned on AllMusicGuide.</li>
</ul>
<p>This does not fit <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, it isn't notable. This is an article that should be <b>deleted</b>.</p>
<p>Previously <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Andrew_Jackson_Jihad_b47b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Andrew Jackson Jihad">deleted</a>, but it was readded and the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Andrew_Jackson_Jihad_2_3b24.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Andrew Jackson Jihad 2">last AFD</a> closed with "No Consensus" despite 11 delete votes (including nom) and 5 keep votes (I believe that lack of consensus is debatable). Please see the last AFD for more discussion about this article.</p>
<p>I'm trying to get a fair AFD _with_ a consensus this time, since I think there's arguments towards <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue">Parsssseltongue</a> vote canvassing during the last vote which I would like to avoid this time. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 00:32, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Please explain my bad faith? You were the one who showed me towards the article in the first place, and as I've previously stated, I believe the previous AFD wasn't done correctly. I firmly believe that this does not meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and I've explained this using Wikipedia policies and beyond. -<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 00:46, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>All the reasons it meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> were explained on the talk page and cited with reliable sources in the article. You feel they aren't notable sources, but others disagreed. No consensus could be reached, so that's why the article was kept. You are assuming bad faith in the admin who closed the AfD by saying his/her decision was unsound, and you are re-opening an AfD a mere <b>TWO HOURS</b> after one has closed! <i>Has gone on a national concert tour in one large country. Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media. Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style and the local scene of a city. Has won a major music award. Has won or placed in a major music competition.</i> AJJ has met these requirements. The article needs to be kept and allowed to expand as more coverage takes place. As far as the vote canvassing allegations, I have remedied this by leaving messages on ALL the voters' pages, regardless of "keep" or "delete" vote. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 00:53, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For a start - I didn't mention bad faith, and I don't like the fact you said I did, I said that the AFD result of <i>No Concensus</i> was debatable, which it is and I'm trying to establish a firm consensus by renominating, seeing if it does establish it this time. I've explained my reasons why they haven't been mentioned in multiple verifiable articles in my nom.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pars, accusing someone of bad faith means that you're saying that you think they're doing something for a reason other than wanting to improve the encyclopedia. It's a pretty serious accusation, and a tad baffling when there's no other apparent motivation. Are you absolutely sure this is what you mean? - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Blâ™Ÿck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 00:58, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes. If Halo were looking out for the benefit of the encyclopedia, he/she would respect the decision that was made and not open an AfD mere hours later. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 01:05, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No decision was made. No decision exists that needs to be respected. I would personally have put this on <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> as an improper close (consensus existed, that consensus was to delete, admin misjudged) but this works as well. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 01:09, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>There's also the issue of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. A bad-faith nomination is like nominating Bill Cosby as a non-notable performer, or George W. Bush as a non-notable president. Something clearly ridiculous. There's nothing ridiculous or inappropriate about this nomination, and speedy keep doesn't apply when others beside the nominator feel the article should be deleted, regardless of how many times it's been nominated in the past. --<a href="../../../n/m/c/User%7ENMChico24_74ee.html" title="User:NMChico24">NMChico24</a> 01:03, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>But I have shown how AJJ is notable, per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and it has been argued out already in an AfD closed mere hours ago, so this is ridiculous and inappropriate. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 01:06, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>There is a disagreement between editors as to what constitutes "trivial" and not here. That's why there was a "no consensus," that's why it defaulted to "keep," and that's why the decision should be respected, and the article should be allowed time to expand. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 01:08, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> the AfD just failed...why is this being nominated again? The article was deemed worthy earlier, so why would it be deleted now when improvement work has been done to it? How is the article supposed to meet your standards if you are just going to renominate immediatley after the AfD fails?
