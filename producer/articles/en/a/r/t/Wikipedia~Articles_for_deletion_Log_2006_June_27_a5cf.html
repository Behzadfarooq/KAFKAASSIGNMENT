<li><b>Keep</b>. Very useful list, and has been around since June 2005. But it could stand to be cleaned up a bit - way too many red links.

<li><b>Comment</b> - At least in my ernest opinion, lists of any type on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> should be mostly of articles that DO exist, and for lists like this, why not simply use <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> for that very purpose? --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicAgent_9df0.html" title="User:NicAgent">NicAgent</a> 02:13, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have already used the list to dab some links found by looking at the list. Most law enforcement agencies merit an article and this is one area that editors have not gotten around to yet so the article will appear.

<p>little encyclopedic value. This issue doesn't need separate article I think. This can be also a dangerous precedence.

<li><b>Comment</b> I've just spent 3 hours trawling through numerous New Age web sites concerning the "Law of Attraction". They are fairly consistent in their use of this term and mostly refer to Hicks. There are <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Law+of+Attraction%22+Hicks&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Law+of+Attraction%22+Hicks&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">79,900 Ghits</a> for "Law of Attraction"+Hicks. The argument that this is "mumbo jumbo" is not grounds for deletion. It is at the moment pure <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> on behalf of editors saying it. Verifiable sources should be provided that say it is mumbo-jumbo, and this viewpoint can then be included in the article.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. Without <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a>, the "57,000" claim may as well be 57. This article suffers from total verifiability failure. The top result of a Google search for '"helena jaworska" -wikipedia' is a genealogy website. '"TÄ JednÄ Noc" helena jaworska', a search for what was supposedly her one 'hit', turns up nothing, the less specific '"TÄ JednÄ Noc" helena' turns up 6 unique non-Wiki hits, none of which appear to be talking about a song (note that Helena is supposedly the name of the album). Arguments to keep based on those claims to notability consequently carry little weight.</p>

<p><b>Pardon the lengthy nom</b> If you just take a cursory look at the page, it may seem full enough to warrant it's own article. The fact is though, that "Non-canon" is merely a word that has no inherent encyclopedic value. This article is a dicdef--when I found it, the article claimed that "non-canon" is a term used only for anime, but I knew this wasn't true so I attempted to add some information about Biblical non-canon texts, and, reluctantly, Star Wars. But then I realized that I am merely adding examples to a dicdef. The section about anime and manga is merely an explanation about how some stories or comics are "non-canon". It's as if I edited the article for <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green.html" title="Green">green</a> and added a section about how grass and dollar bills are green. This makes no sense, becasue that information belongs in their respective articles (<a href="../../../g/r/a/Grass.html" title="Grass">Grass</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dollar.html" title="Dollar">dollar</a>). Correspondingly, the anime information belongs in the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">Anime</a> article. (Or perhaps <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragonball_Z_726c.html" title="Dragonball Z">Dragonball Z</a>.) Articles about words (as opposed to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proper_nouns.html" title="Proper nouns">Proper nouns</a>) should explain the definition, nature, and intricacies of the word, and not its existence or occurence in outside phenomena. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 01:09, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: So far, it has been proven that a few people use this program, but I'm not so sure it qualifies as notable, as it seems to be tied to a mostly underground community. The main problems with the article center not around its fame, but around its poor presentation (which TF0RCE, to his credit, has done a good job trying to fix) and its shameless namedropping of online monikers.<br />
I think it would be possible to salvage it in some way, but it would take a lot of work, starting with changing the title to something that doesn't look like it was typed furiously by an impatient ADD child. It should probably just be merged into a more appropriate, comprehensive Runescape article. And when I say "merge", I mean strip out the bare essentials and incorporate them quietly and humbly into the new location. -- <a href="../../../o/m/i/User%7EOmicronpersei8_71da.html" title="User:Omicronpersei8">Omicronpersei8</a> (<a href="../../../o/m/i/User_talk%7EOmicronpersei8_2291.html" title="User talk:Omicronpersei8">talk</a>) 00:09, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK, OK. I could be missing something, but in my first comment I have stated that this company passes both <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, and no one seems to have addressed this. For one, the company, Move Inc, is traded on NASDAQ (that's a pretty big deal). WP:CORP says "The company or corporation is listed on ranking indices of important companies produced by well-known and independent publications". Now mind you that I'll work to fix it up so that it is not so spammy. Now as far as passing <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, my case isn't as strong, but I have two websites above that mention the site independently. Please address the issues I have raised before simply voting "delete". <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 11:43, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The parent company Move is indeed listed on the NASDAQ but that does not suffice for keep especially sice the article is clearly targeted at listing the services offered by the company. See the relevant section on <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. This is also my reasonning for having the page protected against future spam if the AfD result is to keep. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 12:44, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Undoubtedly Move, Inc deserves its own article, but for whatever reason it does not have one. The company's primary manifestation is its website, just like <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahoo%21.html" title="Yahoo!">Yahoo!</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a>. So, I was thinking of this article as a page for Move, inc. In any event, this article isn't terribly important so I'm gonna throw in the towel. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 13:08, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Reread the guidelines. <i>"The company or corporation is listed <u>on ranking indices</u>..."</i> Being listed on NASDAQ is not notable, nor is it a "big deal"; thousands of companies are.

<dd>Just to restate my reply from my talk page, every Survivor tribe probably <i>should</i> redirect to their appropriate season's article. Even if you feel the chances are low that a person would search for the tribe instead of the season itself, the benefits of keeping the redirect far outweigh any negatives.

While I'm among the group that beleives that <i>no</i> individual episode of any television show (unless it changed history in some significant form or fashion) deserves an encyclopedia article, fanboys obviously beg to differ. However, articles for episodes of <i><a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Guy_f6a0.html" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i> ususally have at least some sort of encyclopedic information on production, referecnes, etc. These articles do not do such (they read very much like cut and paste jobs from TV.com or somewhere similar). Although I've loved <i>Scooby-Doo</i> cartoons since I was a baby, there's no way (without serious reaching and/or original research) that anything sufficiently encyclopedic could ever be drummed up for individual articles for the show's episodes. There's nothing to distinguish each episode from another on any artistic or scholarly level, and therefore there is no point in writing seperate articles for them. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 01:28, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yes, somewhat unfortunately. To thnk that it's seriously an issue with episodes of <i>Scooby-Doo</i>, however, is somewhat hard to swallow. It's not like we're talking a little-known <a href="../../../s/h/o/Showtime.html" title="Showtime">Showtime</a> series or some incredibly minor actress. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 02:10, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>...but this is supposed to be an <i>encyclopedia</i>, not a repository for episode synopses. If that's the case, I'll quit right now and contribute my writing skills elsewhere. I beleive that <i>Scooby-Doo</i> is, of course, a notable enough show to deserve an encyclopedia article here, but sepearte articles for each episode of this particular show, to be nice about it, absurd. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 02:18, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Two wrongs don't make a right! There are probably many articles that warrant deletion, are you suggesting until someone comes up with a full and complete list, NO article should ever be deleted?

Some people may think that popular topics somehow "deserve" to have a lot of distinct articles. They don't: what they deserve is <i>high quality</i> articles, of whatever number is needed to provide that quality. Where an article is so long that it becomes awkward to read it, it is an improvement to break it up; when articles are so short that it becomes awkward to navigate them, it is an improvement to merge them. It's not like merging these would even result in any information being lost, let alone any knowledge.

<li>Amazon has books listed that have sold only a few copies, if that many, so the listing in itself is not a criterion. I believe we like to have about 10,000 copies sold, and for that the Amazon rating would have to be much higher than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0595265200/ref=sr_11_1/104-4764228-2537558?ie=UTF8" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0595265200/ref=sr_11_1/104-4764228-2537558?ie=UTF8" rel="nofollow">this book</a>, which is 1.9M. If you look up the correlation charts, you will see that much better Amazon ratings are needed and that 1.9M translates into just a few copies sold. Of course any non-Amazon proof of notability would also be acceptable, but the Amazon rating is a good start. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 00:22, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Although not the topic of this guideline, the question has been asked whether every book deserves a separate Wikipedia article. For example, not every book somewhere cited in a references section of a Wikipedia article will necessarily get a separate wikipedia article for itself. Nonetheless there is no dictum against any book that is reasonably spread or otherwise well-known or remarkable. Ask yourself if several libraries or bookshops, or a no-subscription website have a copy of the book, so that other wikipedians can easily consult the book, or at least have access to on-line or press-published reviews of the book. Usually, books with an ISBN-number and/or availability in a couple dozen of libraries and/or a Project Gutenberg type website, and with a notability above that of an average cookbook or programmers manual would qualify. On the other hand, if a Wikipedia page can only survive if a "(book)" qualifier, not needed for disambiguation, is added to the page name, this might indicate there is a problem with the notability, in Wikipedia context, of that book.</dd>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>merge</b>. If content from one article is moved to another, the first article must be kept as a redirect to the second to preserve attribution in its page history. The page cannot be deleted, in most cases. Therefore, you don't need to bring merges to AfD.

<dd>I think it has potential. Using a 'Strong Keep' to push a marginally notable person will not gain you any extra votes here. Quiet and reasoned persuasion works better. I think some of the previous references have dropped out and the ones there are not all functional or do not have her name. My recommendation is to work on adding as many good references as possible to neutral reliable sites, such as news media, UNICEF, etc. that show her name. I will switch my vote to Keep once the refs have been added/fixed up. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 12:16, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am still not comfortable with sufficiently proven notability based on the current references to change my mind.

<li><b>Keep</b> this device has a significant set of open source software communities behind it developing software for it and is particularly of interest to those interested in embedded linux. I request that the moderator considers the kurobox and linkstation wiki communities listed in the article and its popularity as a novelty piece of hardware (Wikipedia is full of noteable articles on interesting computing devices) before deciding the course of action.<small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.34.49.94 (talk â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.34.49.94_afb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.34.49.94">contribs</a>) 20:22, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> I feel that this product is very notable, as it is one of the few network-attached-storage devices available on the retail market that can easily be hacked into a very versatile Linux appliance. These are sold at practically every Best Buy and Comp USA in the country, making it probably the only such device with these characteristics available at retail, and its small size and inconspicuousness make it a very attractive platform for this. Buffalo doesn't even advertise this fact in their packaging when they sell these - in fact it almost seems like they do their best to conceal it to the average customer, and it requires intermediate Linux expertise to hack, so I strongly doubt that they are using this site to garner a few more sales. Please don't remove the Linkstation, as there are thousands of things on Wikipedia less notable than it. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EReswobslc_c142.html" title="User:Reswobslc">Reswobslc</a> 18:23, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I have pretty much re-done the page, removing all of the information that is otherwise worthless to the person asking "what's a Linkstation" and describing Linkstation to the average browser.

<li><b>Comment</b> I added a few hardware specs snippits back in at the top (sorry) that I thought would be of general interest. And the Kanji for Kuro-Box (it took me forever to index the two characters&#160;:-). But you're right probably too technical before for the average joe. Ramuka 19:18, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It was me that started all this&#160;!!! The article was reported here, because the original was "Blatant advertising" It has changed completely since its creation (it does seem to contain far too many Japanese language links - why are they on English Wikipedia&#160;????) The argument has now changed to "Notability" as apposed to "Advertising", so maybe the delete should be a "No" . Then if anyone wants to report it as un-noteworthy, then so be it&#160;!!! <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Humphreys_2f91.html" title="User:David Humphreys">David Humphreys</a> 02:02, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The reason for the Japanese links is the nature of the device (I happened to have bought mine in Japan) the hacking community for it is much MUCH more developed in japan. Many of our pages are direct translations of the Japanese efforts. In the same fashion that english papers on Organic and other chemistry cite german papers from prior to 1950's we cite the Japanese sites because of the sheer depth of thier community. By the way, thanks... I worked hard not to make it look like an Advertisement. Raumka 02:13, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Somewhat reluctant afd. I first came across the article when links to it were being spammed across any and all 9/11 film articles. It asserts notability for the film, but I can't find much about it. The IMDB article doesn't even list a running time, and it only appears to have been exhibited once. Only six users on IMDB have rated it, and there's only one imdb user comment that appears to be from a shill. There are only 209 hits on a Google search. Many contributions to the article have been self-promotional in nature, and there has been resistance when I attempted to get contributors to back up their claims with references. Note also that an article on the production company, was deleted in October: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Parivision_Entertainment_3ece.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Parivision Entertainment">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Parivision Entertainment</a> -- <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterHand_55c4.html" title="User:MisterHand">MisterHand</a> 03:20, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I have no idea why this is deemed non-notable. The google search means nothing - only a cultural preponderance towards certain topics, or topics of interest to the computer literate etc. Given that this encyclopedia has endless articles on fictional characters from American TV and sci-fi - it seems ridiculous that an article about an actress who has starred in a multi-award winning movie should be deleted.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well there's not much I can say to your accusations, except they aren't true, but that's besides the point. Thank goodness, the status of the article will be determined through well reasoned discussion based on the principles of Wikipedia. And thankfully every editor's opinion and insights are respected. This discussion is a very good example of how the nomination process works on Wikipedia. As you can see, everyone has an equal say. Remember this is not a vote of any kind just a discussion of the merits of the article. Which I'd like to add, has basically only a single source, and many details that are practically impossible to easily verify, which goes against <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">wikipedia's guidelines on verifiability</a>. I don't think you read my comments, I did not insult the subject of this article at all. Also, comments about "sour cereal" and "asanas" are best left on users talk pages, since many particpants in this discussion will have no idea what those terms might mean. Ditto for mailing lists that would have no appeal to fellow Wikipedia editors. Please leave any personal comments of that nature only on my talk page.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 00:33, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> TheRingess, I did post this message on your talk page, and you deleted it. Although you didnât delete some of the other entries accusing you of acting in bad faith, which I would also echo. You have arrogantly declared this article to be vanity and self promotion â do you think that headshaker from the UK who started this article is the author trying to promote herself? Ridiculous. He is probably someone who appreciated this authorâs work, as I also am. This page is just a normal biography of a fairly accomplished and interesting filmmaker and author, with the information probably based on the authorâs memoir and website. Again, if it is not in line with Wikipedia, fine, delete it, but there is no need for you to do so with such disrespect and maliciousness.Jaime234 02:11, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

To TheRingess: Thanks for the welcome and signature info. I've been looking through wikipedia over the last couple weeks, and noticed your comments on the Siddha Yoga page, also remember you writing on the SGMKJ newslist, so know that you are or have been a devotee, as I've been. I disagreed with some of your changes on the Siddha Yoga page, and saw that you went after a link to the website of Sharon (Kumuda) Janis, also a devotee, on that page, which led to a free reading of her book about living in the South Fallsburg ashram for ten years. Although I've never met Sharon, I've read her books and spent hours upon hours going through her massive webpage of chanting, videos, writings, photos, etc. Looked up Sharon's page on wikipedia and saw that you are adamently sponsoring a movement to remove her page, while making unnecessary and untrue insults about her career history and her website, obviously with a flavor of venom. That is when I decided to step in and point out your obvious bias toward this person -- maybe she stepped on your asana or something? Took the last bowl of sour cereal? I don't know much about how to use wikipedia talk, so may not be using it perfectly properly, but I don't think you are using it properly either. Jaime234 18:50, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> I have gone ahead and edited this article. My basic intent was to make it more encyclopedic in tone. I removed material that I thought might be very difficult to verify. Basically I believe that she is notable enough to warrant a Wikipedia article. I think that the emmy information might be possible to reinstate if the category and date information is supplied. Personally, I just think that the article needs a lot more specific details. I also chose to delete the information about here ashram background as that is basically very hard to verify without contacting the ashram.

<li>Yes, but sometimes the nominator's vote is keep. I have in fact seen this; it usually happens when they disagree with a prod tag on the page or notice that a prod tag has been taken down. Also, you don't know whether my delete "vote" was strong, weak, or neither, of if I had no vote at all (seen this happen too).

<li><b>Delete</b> Heh. I started the article, but upon further review, I don't think that there's enough info out there to make it more than a stub. Two out of the three groups with this name meet one of the criteria of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> (namely, the band contains at least one member who later joined a band that is otherwise notable), but I don't think that's going to be enough to sustain an article. I've merged some of the info on the L.A. glam band to help expand the article for its singer <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Van_Dahl_724c.html" title="Chris Van Dahl">Chris Van Dahl</a>. Perhaps the Gail Greenwood info could be merged into the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belly.html" title="Belly">Belly</a> article.

<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I would assume good faith if I had any reason to. A little history: Ste4k first came to my attention on the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles_7511.html" title="Authorship of A Course in Miracles">Authorship of A Course in Miracles</a> article. He/she placed a tag at the top of the page that said the topic wasn't "notable" and that the article didn't assert any notability. Another editor, who was completely neutral, said that the contesting of the article's notability was not valid as you can find plenty of evidence that the article is about a real topic and is notable. This editor was met with a rather defensive and hostile response by Ste4k, which can be read on the talk page of that article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Because I was tired of all the arguing on the talk page, I sent Ste4k a message on his own personal talk page. I was met with a rather nasty reply about how it was inappropriate to talk to him/her on his/her talk page about some comment he/she had made about (and I quote) "some article". I was informed that he/she contributes to many pages on Wikipedia and doesn't remember any of them. I was then informed that I was too "attached" to the article, the suggestion being that if I were not "attached" to the article then I wouldn't make a statement that completely neutral editors agreed with.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And from there it just snow balled.... This person is on a campaign now to rid Wikipedia of every ACIM-related article, and is even slicing and dicing aspects of the main <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_In_Miracles_1d56.html" title="A Course In Miracles">A Course In Miracles</a> article, and doing so on the same flimsy grounds: that a few sources are not "verifiable". That is basically this person's only complaint: that some of these articles have sources whose verifiability does not meet with his/her approval. On the talk page for deletion proposal of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles_7511.html" title="Authorship of A Course in Miracles">Authorship of A Course in Miracles</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> wrote: <i>"The disputes about particular sources mentioned in the article don't undermine the notability of the controversy itself."</i> This is the only point I'm making in contesting all of Ste4k's deletion nominations of ACIM-related articles: disputes over particular sources do not warrant deletions of entire pages. It appears to me that Ste4k is simply looking for excuses to rid Wikipedia of ACIM-related articles. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 03:54, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Addendum</b> I would also like to add that in the course of this edit war between the two of us, Ste4k has made inaccurate accusations that I am involved with "some advocacy group" and has suggested that I am in some way making money off of ACIM. Somehow, though he/she claims to love verifiability so much, Ste4k has made these statements without a <i>shred</i> of evidence. He will never find any evidence to support such accusations, because such accusations are completely untrue. I can assure that the frustration I have felt with this situation emanates mostly from the "editor" in me, not the person who reads ACIM. You are aware, aren't you, that I first encountered Ste4k on the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles_7511.html" title="Authorship of A Course in Miracles">Authorship of A Course in Miracles</a> deletion proposal page; that is, I met him/her on the page for the <i>second attempt</i> to delete that article. The Wikipedia editor in me finds it very frustrating that after having worked hard to improve that page, it is facing yet another deletion attempt, and then in addition to the deletion attempt I must contend with Ste4k saying that the whole topic doesn't even exist at all. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 04:05, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Just to inform fellow editors: it appears that the nomination of this page by Ste4k for deletion is a âbad faithâ deletion attempt. Ste4k has recently submitted deletion nominations for all of the following <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_in_Miracles_e1cf.html" title="A Course in Miracles">A Course in Miracles</a>-related articles: <a href="../../../a/c/i/ACIM_church_movement_7dd6.html" title="ACIM church movement">ACIM church movement</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Schucman_99ad.html" title="Helen Schucman">Helen Schucman</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Thetford_8a2e.html" title="William Thetford">William Thetford</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attitudinal_healing.html" title="Attitudinal healing">Attitudinal healing</a>, Foundation for Inner Peace, <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation_for_A_Course_In_Miracles_a5a3.html" title="Foundation for A Course In Miracles">Foundation for A Course In Miracles</a>, Community Miracles Center, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Renard_560c.html" title="Gary Renard">Gary Renard</a>, Kenneth Wapnick. And in the article <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles_7511.html" title="Authorship of A Course in Miracles">Authorship of A Course in Miracles</a>, Ste4k will not accept ANY websites as âverifiableâ websites with regard to ACIM, including <a href="http://www.acim.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.acim.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.acim.org/</a> and <a href="http://www.facim.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.facim.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.facim.org/</a>, both of which are the official websites of California-based non-profit organizations. This editor's deletion attempts are merely personal bias masquerading as adherence to Wikipedia policy. And it appears that this editor has a history with this kind of behavior.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE ALL</b>.</p>
<p>This was a tricky case. Doing some google searches does turn up, among other things, the fact that MadamimadaM does exist, according to their myspace. However, they went on indefinite hiatus in February, which makes the statement in that article that their next album is due out in April 2006 rather improbable. Strike 1.</p>
<p>All the external links in Skar and MadamimadaM's pages are broken, most of them just not returning anything and a couple returning domain-squatter pages. Strike 2.</p>
<p>When I found Skar listed in the track list for the Saw II soundtrack, I was about to declare the case closed, until I went over to Amazon and found zero mention of the band in their tracklist. Strike 3.</p>
<p>These articles provide no verifiable proof that they're notable at all. No information was brought forward to contradict this claim, so therefore, all of these articles are now deleted.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Just a little background here. The editor in question who started this article is not in any way a "close friend" of Kenneth Wapnick's. He is a "student" of A Course In Miracles (which means that he reads the book), as well as a "student" of Kenneth Wapnick's (which means he reads books by Kenneth Wapnick, books about ACIM interpretation). To my knowledge, the two men have never even met.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't believe that anyone should be tampering with Articles for Deletion discussions. The act is contemptable, and makes the entire subject matter suspect.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Thank you for finally using the word "believe". That is all I interjected into your above statements, that you <i>believe</i> this page should be deleted because.... That is hardly "tampering". And I did not understand that those comments were viewed as your own "personal" comments, as they are largely verbatim transcriptions of Wikipedia policy. Therefore, all I felt I was doing was copyediting Wikipedia policy which I felt was incorrectly displayed. My apologizies. And you fail to recognize that when you nominate more than half a dozen ACIM-related articles for deletion, <i>you</i> begin to look suspect. The only thing I could assume is that perhaps you are a conservative Christian who doesn't like ACIM. Thankfully, I've been enlightened to the fact that you have a history of behaving this way with articles. You simply don't understand that there are better ways to resolve content disputes than to nominate an article for deletion. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 23:01, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment by nom</b> There aren't any sources in any of the "Course in Miracles" category that have any biographical information on Wapnick. Merging this information without any references will compromise the integrity of the newer version of the article on the book. Any of the other superfluous information on Wapnick's biography (this article under consideration) is already present in <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_in_Miracles_%28book%29_25fc.html" title="A Course in Miracles (book)">the newer page</a> and would be redundant in a merge. The picture from this article has already been merged to the newer article on the book. I'd like everyone to reconsider their votes here since many changes have occurred over the entire category. Thanks. Ste4k 15:58, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_in_Miracles_e1cf.html" title="A Course in Miracles">A Course in Miracles</a> itself is largely unsourced and unverifiable, and appears to hope to establish notability by being listed in this encyclopedia rather than being notable in the first place. Most of its articles were written by two people who suffer from too much information looking for a topic. The creeping-artikalism of such a category in itself required at least six speedy deletes for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Actually, there is a great deal of verifiable evidence about A Course In Miracles. You simply will not accept this. I wish you would stop wasting everyone's time and stop trying to call attention to yourself and get everyone's approval. As per the large amounts of Google hits and its Amazon.com sakes ranking, it is obvious that ACIM hardly needs Wikipedia to establish its notability. ACIM was notable BEFORE the invention of Wikipedia. And the authorship of the book is indeed established, and is in fact discussed on the pages <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles_7511.html" title="Authorship of A Course in Miracles">Authorship of A Course in Miracles</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Schucman_99ad.html" title="Helen Schucman">Helen Schucman</a>, pages which, if you had your way, others would not be able to read because they would be deleted.</dd>
<dd>The issue is not whether ACIM is notable or not, but that you <i>don't want</i> ACIM to <i>be</i> notable. I find this fascinating. I find you fascinating. Please share more about yourself with the rest of us. So far, we know that you are new to Wikipedia and don't like ACIM.

<li><b>Important Comment</b> I think that my contributions page is available for anyone to look at, and it can speak for itself. Per the acronym "ACIM", the cited sources, specifically the court case, show that the other cited sources are all one board of directors and three different names for the same group. The logo "ACIM" is also a registered trademark. As an editor concerned for the sake of the encyclopedia, I believe that using registered trademarks is a means of gaining brand acceptance. I don't feel that it is necessary to provide a brand name in an article, but most especially since the book itself is out-of-print and in the public domain. That in my opinion is providing a severe POV and can be construed as a means of attracting business to the owners of the trademark "ACIM" which are listed currently as the other cited sources. Those cited sources should also be considered as primary sources rather than secondary sources since the court case points out plainly that they are all of the same association which failed to establish copyrights for the book in the first place.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I hope everyone is aware that Ste4k has a personal vendetta against all ACIM-related articles on Wikipedia. In addition to supporting the deletion attempt of the article <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles_7511.html" title="Authorship of A Course in Miracles">Authorship of A Course in Miracles</a>, this user has initiated deletion attempts of the following ACIM-related articles: <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Thetford_8a2e.html" title="William Thetford">William Thetford</a>, Kenneth Wapnick, Foundation for Inner Peace, <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation_for_A_Course_In_Miracles_a5a3.html" title="Foundation for A Course In Miracles">Foundation for A Course In Miracles</a>, and <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Renard_560c.html" title="Gary Renard">Gary Renard</a>. And on the main ACIM page, this editor will not accept anything, not even the official sites of Foundation for ACIM and Foundation for Inner Peace, as acceptable sources. Personal bias masked as attempt to uphold Wikipedia guidelines (all the while ignoring Wikipedia guidelines by trying to deprive Wikipedia of articles about a notable topic). -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 18:54, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The conduct of an editor with respect to an article has no logical connection with whether the article should be kept (with the possible exception of an editor writing a vanity article). I have looked at some of these articles and think that while Wikipedia should have an article on ACIM and on each of the authors, the other articles should either be merged (if they contain useful information) or deleted outright as, to use a wikilogism, <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">vanispamicruftisement</a>. I was not aware of the existence of some of the articles on your list and will review them too. Thinking that crappy, POV articles should be deleted rather than improved is a common mistake for new editors to make, so let's not bite the newbies, assume good faith and be civil. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> 19:43, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

I tried to work out our disagreements on his/her talk page, to no avail. This editor has repeatedly, and erroneously, given the false implication that the only reason I am interested in keeping these pages from being deleted is because I am making money off of ACIM.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_In_Miracles_1d56.html" title="A Course In Miracles">A Course In Miracles</a> can hardly qualify as a cult when it is only a book. I am a "student" of the Course, which means that all I do is read the book. I attend no meetings, and do not interact with anyone (aside from the Internet) on a daily basis who reads the Course. I have altered no behavior in my daily lifestyle as a result of reading the Course. It isn't a cult. Just a book. And I'm not saying you said this, but just to clarify, I didn't create all of these ACIM-related articles. I agree that some of them are of dubious importance, such as the ACIM church movement one, and a few others (come to think of it, <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attitudinal_Healing_eb20.html" title="Attitudinal Healing">Attitudinal Healing</a> may not be of note either).

And in the article <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles_7511.html" title="Authorship of A Course in Miracles">Authorship of A Course in Miracles</a>, Ste4k will not accept ANY websites as âverifiableâ websites with regard to ACIM, including <a href="http://www.acim.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.acim.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.acim.org/</a> and <a href="http://www.facim.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.facim.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.facim.org/</a>, both of which are the official websites of California-based non-profit organizations.

<dd>The other thing that makes me think that this person does not like this genre and is attempting to rid Wikipedia of it, is that this person will not accept ANY verification that these topics <i>exist</i>. If you offer this person the official sites of these organizations, he/she cries "spam". If you offer the link to the Amazon.com or Barnesandnoble.com listings to demonstrate notability by way of high sales rank, again, he/she cries "spam". If you offer an article that discusses the notability of the topic, he/she contests the qualifications of the person who wrote the article. And then, after all of this has failed, the person turns around and accuses you of being "too close" to the article, in my case alledging that I'm making money off of this (all without evidence, I might add; I make NO money off of ACIM). There is no winning with this person. It becomes evident that he/she just doesn't like this topic at all.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> or, fail that <b>merge</b> per jzg. Seems like a few committed sould running around filling up WP with diverse content spun from the ACIM to give the fringe movement a reputable web presence and then preying upon the good faith assumptions and consensus approach of WP editors. Bringing an article to AfD is designed to promote <i>discussion</i> and certainly does not entail automatic deletion. Insofar as this debate helps clarify the value of such articles, accusations of bad faith are unhelpful and come across as contrarian. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 13:04, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Talk about a lack of good faith.... I am not the one who started this article or most of the other articles that Ste4k is nominating for deletion. They were mostly started by another guy whose intentions you are not aware of. I think they were started by him because he truly believed these were notable topics. To be honest, I myself, a student of the Course, was surprised that he thought certain things about ACIM deserved pages. But on the other hand, I think it is wrong that Ste4k (or whatever) is attempting to have all these pages deleted simply because he/she doesn't like this topic. That's all any of this is really about. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 21:25, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article says that no such processors exist, and discusses in detail how you'd need a computer the size of the universe for such an architecture to be necessary.

<li><b>Comment</b> Most guides on GameFAQs begin with lists of items/weapons/powerups/combos, that's why it reads like a part of a strategy guide.

<li><b>Keep</b> - It certainly needs some tweeking regarding punctuation and grammar, perhaps a shaving or rephrasing of some information, too, but this is hardly a strategy guide. Granted, it is large, and the only reason my only contribution to this page has been the addition of the names of the actual weapons these models are based on is because I'd probably end up making the article even larger if I started on the descriptions. Regardless of its shortcomings, this article is informative to those interested in the "Outbreak" series.

<li>An unverifiable assertion is still an assertion. The Speedy criteria only applies to articles that don't bother to explain <i>why</i> the editor feels the subject is notable. CSD states that <i>If the assertion is disputed or controversial, it should be taken to AFD instead.</i> This assertion is clearly disputed (not least because, even if true, it's nowhere near WP's Notability guidelines), but it's still an assertion, so AfD is the right place.

<li>I had put Dayton in my original search because the name is common and could refer to other people. There are lots of human interest stories done by ESPN and Sports Illustrated done just to get away from the mainstream, that doesn't mean that they are all intitled to an article here. With all the publicity aside, I'm sure he's far from the first player in high school football to have a major physical disability. And the ESPY awards, they are a set of awards given by a cable network based on fan votes, I don't think that qualifies as a very ligitimate award. When all is said and done, he's just a high school football player with no legs, that's it, that's not even close to notable, ESPY or no ESPY. --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgwerworldz_a32c.html" title="User:Burgwerworldz">Burgwerworldz</a> 01:43, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Larry Pravecek attracted a crowd at the 30th anniversary celebration and people were asking for his autographs.

The stub can be enhanced by discussing Pravecek's long career, his relationship with the Canadians that led to the ceremony invitation, the interesting story behind the Skycrane, or the cultural significance of his participation in the event.

<p>The article is under a POV title at the moment as "New Labour" is a campaign slogan and a description of a particular faction within a party (if faction is not too solid a term). It is a point of view that the Acts passed since 1997 are those of this faction, and indeed most of the provisions were those requested by the security and police services. While a discussion of the provisions of anti-terrorist legislation is encyclopaedic, it should be done in a single article on Terrorism laws of the United Kingdom, not split up by government. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 10:18, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

(Curiously, the legal narrative to do with that campaign has continued to progress over the years entirely independently of these laws, Terrorism (Northern Ireland) Act 2006.).... This particular terrorism policy is deeply implicated with the current administration -- however you name it, and it does need a useable name -- and any inputs from the security and police services have been virtually overwhelmed by the political machinations. It begins with the first very broad definition of "terrorism", and some of the laws had to be rushed through Parliament in a hurry when previous versions were ruled over the mark and unconstitutional. There is a self-contained story here. <a href="../../../g/o/a/User%7EGoatchurch_66eb.html" title="User:Goatchurch">Goatchurch</a> 12:15, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../p/r/e/Prevention_of_Terrorism_Act_%28Northern_Ireland%29_b1c6.html" title="Prevention of Terrorism Act (Northern Ireland)">Prevention of Terrorism Act (Northern Ireland)</a> is incorrectly named.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, the article has already been renamed (which was a serious objection). The article covers a burst of legislation covering Terrorism in the United Kingdom that is different in kind and form from the previous Northern Ireland related terrorist legislation. It is certainly noteworthy. The article itself (now renamed) does not seem POV to me (a lawyer based in the UK) and is pretty accurate. It doesn't do the same job as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-terrorism_legislation.html" title="Anti-terrorism legislation">Anti-terrorism legislation</a> and can be seen as the complement of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prevention_of_Terrorism_Act_%28Northern_Ireland%29_b1c6.html" title="Prevention of Terrorism Act (Northern Ireland)">Prevention of Terrorism Act (Northern Ireland)</a>. Previous governments (of both persuasions) did not make discrete anti-terrorism legislation in the same way -- the PoT being the mainstay of the law in that area, hence (in my view) the present compass of the article should stay -- though with a bit of supplementation. That isn't a political point -- it might be that a Tory or Old Labour government would have legislated a good deal in the same situations. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Davey_cdfc.html" title="User:Francis Davey">Francis Davey</a> 16:57, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Another article that was prod-warred about. Contested prods should be taken here per <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a>, so here we are. The prod rationale was: "Google hits below 50, incl. WP &amp; mirrors - too low for a modern writer". Personally, I believe this rationale is invalid: this is not an author of the "western world", so the number of Google hits is not necessarily relevant. If the claims reported in the article are correct, this author is notable enough. On the other hand, the article is still unreferenced.

<dd>Comment: I was the original prod-der; I don't see any prod war - war in WP context would be repeated actions undoing others' actions (edit war, wheel war). There are some articles that are borderline cases. When I prod them and someone who I perceive to be more knowledgeable about the subject than me de-prods them, i let it be. No point in bringing to AfD and wasting the community's time. Contested Prods <i>should</i> be brought to AFD and not <i>must</i>; So, if the Prod-der feels that the de-prodding is correct, he can remain silent. --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 05:11, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I have read through the Guide to Deletion and note that it states, "Articles about companies and products are acceptable if they are written in an objective and unbiased style." The style of article is also comparable to many other articles in the same category, that being Internet_forums. Whilst I do not deny that Bardic Web is not as large as other companies such as <a href="../../../e/z/b/Ezboard.html" title="Ezboard">Ezboard</a>, for example, it is still perhaps notable for the duration of continuous activity as noted in the statement that "Bardic Web includes within its Scrolls both new and original ideas, as well as communities such as the Cagliostro that are seven years old and counting, which makes them amongst the oldest RP/Writing communities around with continuous activity." Is it possible, therefore, that rather than deletion, this article could instead be proposed for clean-up if fellow Wikipedians deem it necessary? And if this was so, what alterations would they feel would satisfy the requirements of this community?</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This was no retaliation, only the Ritz Carlton was, along with another.

<dd>(I was the one that AfD'ed two of Krytan's articles on hotels, hence my reply here): when I feel that for some article a rewrite won't help, I just ProD or AfD (and when a ProD is removed, I almost always move it to AfD as well). I usually check if the subject of the article has the potential to become a decent Wikipedia article, even if the current one may not fit into it. For those articles (as for my other nominations), I din't think the subject had a sufficient claim to notability to be included here, so I put them in AfD. Still, this gives you and anyone else the chance to have a discussion (normally for some 5 days, I believe) and to convince others that the potential for a good article is there. I haven't seen any evidence that asking for a rewrite instead of putting the two articles on AfD would have done any good. Krytan, I think it's best if you want to discuss this further that you either take it to our user talk pages, or that we have this discussion at the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28hotels%29_6fb8.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (hotels)">notability guidelines for hotels</a> Pascal has started. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 14:37, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe this article qualifies for deletion based upon the "completely idiosyncratic non-topic" reason. It has no redeeming qualities and verges on patent nonsense; I tried checking all the other pages it linked to, to see if I could merge it into one of those pages, but it only links to disambiguation pages and pages which have absolutely nothing to do with the topic at hand (if there is one).<br />

If it was only known by people who "seeked" it, then presumably no verification of its status as "one of the most notable" can't be, erm, "seeked". No verification, no notability.

<li>Yes, that is to say it was known amongst people who used warez sites, similarly a website about birdwatching however prolific, would generally have its userbase limited to birdwatchers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The statement <i>yet at the same time was known only to people who seeked it</i> is simply a play on words referencing the quote on the main page. Furthermore there are references to Gintor all over the web, more notably to its file format which is referenced on several File Extension databases. If it is deemed not to be worthy of a wiki entry then thats just my opinion vs wiki's and there is nothing i can do or say about that.

<li>Gintor had many millions of hits and achieved cult status amongst certain circles. It was notable to people who downloaded pirated material... and today people who illegaly download software/media ARE the general public. The question is not whether Gintor is worthy of note but if the history of internet piracy is worthy of note. Believe it or not we, as internet users have a lot to thank internet piracy for. This page was created as a subentry of the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warez.html" title="Warez">warez</a> wiki page. If you know nothing about warez in the given time period then i shouldn't think you would have heard of Gintor, however i assure you many others have. Also please note this is a work in progress. --<a href="../../../n/0/_/User%7EN0_m3RcY_1d98.html" title="User:N0 m3RcY">N0 m3RcY</a> 13:25, 27 June 2006 (UTC).

<li>You will need to show some published references to establish notability. That is what I mean when I say the public in general; the New York Times isn't doing stories on you. A few news stories about it on major news websites might suffice, but not forum posts and probably not specialized warez news sites, if such a thing exists. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 14:45, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article is not about Gintor.com as much as it is about warez history, and therefore internet history. Considering how high profile software piracy has become, i believe that alone makes Gintor notable enough for a wiki entry. If you doubt its poularity, search for gintor on google and you will find many thousands of forum posts around the internet referencing gintor.com. Furthermore gintor established its own recognised file format which is veryfied upon following the link referenced in the article. If someone could suggest how i could improve the article instead of simply pointing out faults then im sure we can resolve this. Again, please note this is a work in progress that went up just over an hour ago, i am not trying to spam wiki, nor is the article offensive, so please if you think the article can be improved to better meet the wiki guidelines then suggest away --<a href="../../../n/0/_/User%7EN0_m3RcY_1d98.html" title="User:N0 m3RcY">N0 m3RcY</a> 13:56, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, the article <b>Isn't</b> about Gintor.com, because i wrote it, and i'm telling you that it isn't.... Gintor was an entity which existed across the website, file format, hub and forums (which as mentioned were seperate). Again, if you have no objection to the subject matter itself you could just as easily suggest how to improve the article as criticise it (if you feel strongly enough about the article to comment). Since this is my first ever wiki article you could show the common courtesy of helping me improve it instead of calling for its deletion before i have even hada chance to work on it. If you are upset that not enough information is given on filext.com then you could direct your grievances at them. --<a href="../../../n/0/_/User%7EN0_m3RcY_1d98.html" title="User:N0 m3RcY">N0 m3RcY</a> 14:25, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>/\ partial attack was not meant as such, but has been fixed. As for vanity, i was simply trying to demonstrate the notability of Ginter within the article, as i was instructed to further up in this discussion. It would help me if people could point out specifically how to improve the article so that it falls in line with the guidelines, as i am a new user i can read the guidelines but dont know to what degree they are enforced... e.g. 'how notable'. I have provided references to gintor from around the web, should i include 'more' references? Because they exist, i simply have not included them because i did not feel they added anything to the article. I am getting the feeling that i am being picked up on technicalities, there is no agenda behind this wiki entry, its simply something i felt was worthy of some sort of record on the net, and i have tried to make it as complete as possible. The criticism i have recieved so far amounts to 'gintor is not worth an article' though i would wager that most of you never heard of it. I figured wikipedia would be the perfect place to publish an article on Gintor, i still would like to persue this but with so much criticism i feel like my efforts have been completely futile, and that wikipedia will indeed delete it regardless of what i do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, if you feel strongly enough about the articles hosted on wikipedia to call for the deletion of said articles despite other people's time and effort, then surely you could lend a hand and make a few constructive suggestions. It is obvious that i am struggling to meet the guidelines. Throw me a bone huh?</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. I think there is some evidence of notability here, which I'd like to see worked up. Are there stats on the number of users, rather than volume of downloads?

Its difficult to find references to gintor.com, since with the death of HTTP most of the sites in the category went down, though it may be possible to find cached toplist sites etc...

<dd>It's not so much a question of noteworthiness (which is not a policy) as of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. Wikipedia can only keep information which anyone can prove to be true; it doesn't matter how well-known or important something was, if we cannot confirm that the article is accurate, unfortunately we cannot keep it. As you say, it's hard to find sources for dead sites, and unfortunately that means it's hard to meet Wikipedia's policies when writing on them...</dd>
<dd>Were there perhaps any controversies relating to this site offline? Was it targeted by any anti-piracy campaigns, for example? If you can find anything like that, any mentions in books or newspapers or magazines, then your case will become much stronger. â <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 22:24, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>For the record, I agree that the guideline, as it is, is too vague, and support changing it to be more appropriate for individual sports.

<li><b>Comment</b> If these individuals meet WP:BIO and you want to make the articles and the requisite disambiguation pages, then have at it (avoiding <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, of course). However, I would prefer to see the notability guidelines changed instead. While I understand that the guideline is not policy and does not necessarily dictate that these players be kept, I am concerned that articles are being nominated without regard to the guideline at all. My preference would be that the guidelines be modified to be more specific about baseball players, and then we deal with the ones who do not meet the consensus. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 12:27, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Seems cheesy to claim <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> when that guideline is so weak for athletes that it's spawned a new proposed guideline. These particular articles were nominated for the total lack of notability assertion other than they've played A and AA baseball. Some of them are even very low-round draft picks like Sean Smith (baseball player) who was drafted in the 16th round and took almost four years just to get to AA. -- <a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 12:51, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I suspect that if we were discussing changes to the guideline, you and I would have a lot more to agree on.

<p><b>Comment</b>. Thank you, Fan1967. I think that the previous debate was closed too early, without mentioning some important facts, i.e.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is one-man company;</li>
<li>Starting in Spring this year;</li>
<li>Without media coverage (1 independent hit in Google, not 28 hits as asserted);</li>
<li>Extremely small turnover;</li>
<li>Nobody asserts notability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore I decided to revoke the case and try to reach a decision. --<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 15:57, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a nonprofit organization rather than an investor-owned company, so <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> doesn't apply. Text from site: "Fight 4 Kids, Inc. is a membership based nonprofit organization designed to provide parents throughout the United States with the convenience of internet-based support. We do this through providing information regarding relevant topics for parents and by presenting our members with opportunities to get involved in online discussion forums and small group coordination."

<dd><b>Another Comment</b> Whether the company is non-profit or for-profit or investor-owned is totally irrelevant. Corporations do not have to be for-profit. To be incorporated just means an organization is defining itself legally in certain ways, it does not imply it is necessarily for purposes of profit or commerce. TruthbringerTornto, please see <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-profit_corporation.html" title="Non-profit corporation">non-profit corporation</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm sure that this is a very well-meaning organization, but indications appear to be that it's brand new, barely off the ground, and hardly seems to have attracted any attention at all. It may assert notability, but I don't see that it's achieved any. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 16:22, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Spam, but at least well meaning spam. Seriously though, very small organization ($1700? Most charities lose that much playing craps) thats pretty new. Yet to establish any notable imo. With regards to Truthbringer's arguments, that would be quite a stretch to call that a claim of notability. A company/organization can't be considered noteworthy just because they have a well-meaning goal. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 18:57, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> A whole raft of new "external references" have ben added to the site. As far as I can see they are links to all the various linkfarms that webmasters use for search engine optimisation, and that search engines probably ignore.

<li>The Design Firms award appears to be an award which causes people to click to their (Designfirms) website and see 4 google adsense adverts. I am discounting that award as simply an award to make money for designfirms (that was 2005). The AA of W award (2006) has more substance in but it is also a direct moneyspinner for AA of W with banner adverts, so I regret I am discounting that as well.

<dd><b>Comment</b> you haven't believed or listened to a single thing I've had to say since I started working on the project, and I object to your insistance on referring to peoples' gender incorrectly. I spent hours cleaning up per policy and I refuse to participate in revert wars. There is nothing wrong with putting up an article for review by its peers. And it is clear to me that you prefer the vanity of the article rather than its encyclopedic value. Removing tags for maintenance is a manner of keeping other editors from joining it. The only possible reason you could have for reverting maintenance tags which were placed in good faith is to protect the aesthetic value of a yet to complete web page. I purposely call the entry a web page rather than an article for one specific reason. <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_D._Roosevelt_eea3.html" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">This is an article</a>. And <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_series_1_8e27.html" title="Big Brother Australia series 1">this is a disgrace</a>. The content belongs in a transwiki project that may or may not exist. But it certainly isn't encyclopedic, cannot pass any of those policies listed above, and in my serious opinion is that it's a candidate for speedy delete based on item one. The amount of time that one wastes creating an aesthetically pleasing list of unnotable people hasn't anything to do with the reason that it belongs in an encyclopedia. Ste4k 16:53, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> The tense decision was decided by consensus of the people working on the project and can be noted in green. The overall outcome of that decision was to have an encyclopedic tense. (past) Ste4k 17:05, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You're being very hypocritical. The tense was agreed upon, but the closer made quite clear that things that will never change, relationships being an example, should be written in present tense. Despite this, you still went ahead and changed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_Brother_Australia_series_6&amp;diff=60579297&amp;oldid=60537963|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_Brother_Australia_series_6&amp;diff=60579297&amp;oldid=60537963|" rel="nofollow"><b>everything</b> into past tense again</a>. If you really want to be the guy that trys to put me down by making me look like a fool and the person that wants only what he wants, go ahead. But I will always tell the facts, as they are.<br /></dd>
<dd>And as for the <a href="../../../b/b/0/BB01_c0d0.html" title="BB01">BB01</a> article, I've already told you; that article was made earlier this year. You can't possibly expect perfect information for a television series that happened 5 years ago; especially when there's next to no chance of re-runs. --<font face="verdana"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small><sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">talk</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font> 17:44, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>This seems to confirm my fears. AfD is not for "putting up an article for review by its peers."

As far as I can tell there is no way this AfD nom will pass. If you nominated for deletion knowing this then it is certainly bad faith. If you were genuinely confused as to the purpose of AfD then I understand and apologize.

<li><b>Comment:</b>I am in charge of PR within Faceo. We thought that it could be interesting for Wikipedia users to know of Faceo, a company created only six years ago, and which is one of the few players in our field to have a presence across several countries in Europe. Our intention was to be informative, and not to advertise; if you read our article, we put some facts on our company and gave some definition on what the terms mean. You may not share our viewpoint, but we did not put the same information as in our website: www.faceo.com. Frankly I wonder how we should speak about ourselves in a more "neutral" tone.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Thanks for the disclosing your relation with Faceo, though it does pose a significant conflict of interest problem. <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_guidelines_9511.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity guidelines">Wikipedia policy</a> frowns heavily on individuals/organisations writing about themselves and for good reason. For example, your current article sounds too much like an advertisment since there are too many biased first-person statements such as "Faceoâs expertise in the management of soft services allows our customers to optimize cost reductions within a building."

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Speedy Keep</b>, absolutely. Obviously not everything in the article is POV, and to the extent we do find POV there, on which issue I disclaim opinion, an AfD is not the proper remedy.

<p>Blatant NPOV violations. Article is almost entirely produced using views of controversial authors such as Bat Ye'or. WP:NPOV policy on not giving <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">undue weight</a> to a certain perspective goes totally ignored in this article. Much of the article lists 'facts' that are supported by the writings of Bat Ye'or, a highly controversial writer who has been critisized often for being more of a polemic than a scholar (see talk page on <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">Dhimmi</a>). There is very little, if any, trust between editors, with all sides pushing their own view on the subject. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 15:48, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Reasons for deletion: From <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>&#160;: <i>All text created in the Wikipedia main namespace is subject to several important rules, including three cardinal content policies: Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, Wikipedia:Verifiability, and Wikipedia:No original research, and the copyright policy (Wikipedia:Copyrights). Text that does not conform to all four policies is not allowed in the main namespace.</i></p>
<p>The reason for which this article is a prime candidate for deletion from WP main namespace is primarily the first one, NPOV. WP:NPOV lists various rules in regards to keeping articles fair and objective. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#A_simple_formulation" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#A_simple_formulation</a> makes the distinction between a 'fact' and an opinion. A statement can be termed a fact if no serious dispute exists as to its truth. The entirety of this article presumes the views of highly controversial writers as being facts. An account from Stillman's or Bat Ye'or's book regarding a historic occurance that could be percieved as oppressive (say, restrictions on clothing or inability to bear weaponry), that has been seen to have occured at any point in history, is reproduced as fact and as a generic trait of the Dhimmi system, followed by the citation link.</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue_weight</a> speaks to the need to give a balanced account of all significant sides on the topic. This article is entirely based on the perspective of several orientalists. An overwhelmingly large proportion of the article is founded on Bat Ye'or's works. Bat Ye'or's credibility as a scholar has been critisized by other, more reknowned, scholarship (Bernard Lewis, for example). She has been critisized for her polemic tone and selective gathering of sources for her work. She has also been critisized for her lack of academic training in the subject she speaks and writes so frequently about. She is an activist.</p>
<p>Other points soon to follow.</p>
<p>All other means to correct this problem have been exausted (read talk page) <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 16:22, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Like Fiddle Faddle said. I've just never seen a nominator post a separate vote before, so it doesn't seem to be the convention. And if it isn't the convention, I'd say it's misleading, since it will be interpreted as a second vote for deletion after the nominator's. Anyway, I'm sure someone knows the official policy on this. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_L_Rattigan_f48b.html" title="User:David L Rattigan">David L Rattigan</a> 16:37, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>When votes are counted at the end, how often is the nomination counted as a vote? Never. If there's a rule that suggests nominators of an AFD forego their right to vote, I've never heard of it. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 16:40, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps the word "vote" is misleading. As we are reminded so often this is not a ballot. It is an expression of an opinion backed by facts. The community judges the facts. I have a strong suspicion that "the greater the rhetoric the less valid the point", but that is a wholly personal view. Expressions of anger or bewilderment do nothing here. Hard and attributabel facts are the things which carry weight. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 16:47, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> to Teslafieldmachine. The main grounds for our opinion that this article should be deleted is that it constitutes <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original Research</a>. As you say yourself, it's your own speculation about a possible method of UFO propulsion. There are plenty of sites which will be more than happy to publish your article, but Wikipedia is, or should be, restricted to verifiable facts from secondary sources - your article is a primary source, and therefore not acceptable here.

<p><b>Delete</b>, although given the number of law schools in Canada and how easy it is to verify, I donât see how maintaining it would be âerror proneâ. Lists are not encyclopedic unless they are a <i>necessary</i> part of an article (to better explain or describe the significance of the article or to contribute to a greater understanding of the article). If including such a list in the article itself would make the article itself unwieldy, then creating a separate "article" for the list is fine. In this case, the list simply duplicates the function of a category that already exists. This list does not do anything to help better understand the main subject matter or the significance of the subject. As it serves no such purpose, I consider it listcruft. Just because <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not paper</a> does not mean it is a place for trivia or indiscriminate lists of things, per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">WP:5P</a>. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 17:33, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The concept of subjugation is a broad one. The further reading implies that there's a lot to write on the subject, because people already have written a lot on the subject.

<li>Wrong. It is a stub encyclopaedia article. Your idea of what constitutes a dictionary definition is erroneous. You also need to familiarize yourself with the idea of cooperative editing.

<li>Far too many editors appear to have the wrong idea of what constitutes a "dicdef". <i>An article is not a dictionary article simply because it is short.</i> (Indeed, many dictionary articles are rather long. I recommend editors that think that dictionary articles are short go and read some of the non-stub articles in Wiktionary.) A dictionary article is an article about a word or a phrase. It provides meanings, translations, quotations, etymologies, usage notes, pronunciations, inflections, synonyms, antonyms, and cross-references. An encyclopaedia article is about a person/place/concept/event/thing. Please read our articles on <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedic_dictionary.html" title="Encyclopaedic dictionary">encyclopaedic dictionary</a> and the <a href="../../../u/s/e/Use-mention_distinction.html" title="Use-mention distinction">use-mention distinction</a> if this still isn't clear.
<p><i>This</i> article is about the <i>concept</i> of subjugation. It is currently a <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">stub</a>, a sociololgy stub no less. It contains a further reading section that indicates that there is much to write on the subject of subjugation, because <i>other people have written a lot on the subject</i>. We don't delete "dicdef"s. We delete <i>stub articles that have no potential for expansion</i>, i.e. articles for which there is no source material available that can be used to expand the article beyond stub status. Clearly, there <i>is</i> source material in this case, and there <i>is</i> scope for expansion beyond a stub. That that expansion has yet to take place is not grounds for deleting the article. Deletion is not the way to improve the encyclopaedia in this case. Expanding the article is. Our <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> explains this pretty clearly.</p>
<p>It's sad to see that so many editors are of the opinion that we should delete <i>short encyclopaedia articles</i>, even when there is apparent scope for their expansion from many sources. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:39, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>An article is not a dictionary article simply because it is short.</i> Agreed. An article is a dictionary article because it contains nothing but a definition. Dictionary definition + external links does not make an encyclopedic article. It doesn't even make an encyclopedic stub. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 14:53, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Uncle, please remember to <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">be civil</a> and not lecture us at to what constitutes a stub and what constitutes a dictionary entry. A number of the editors commenting here have been around long enough that it's safe to assume they know the difference. I don't see any of them advocating to "delete short encyclopaedia articles". I see them advocating deletion of a dictionary definition.

This one, though, appears smaller than the others.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Just to inform fellow editors: it appears that the nomination of this page by Ste4k for deletion is a âbad faithâ deletion attempt. Ste4k has recently submitted deletion nominations for all of the following <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_in_Miracles_e1cf.html" title="A Course in Miracles">A Course in Miracles</a>-related articles: <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Schucman_99ad.html" title="Helen Schucman">Helen Schucman</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Thetford_8a2e.html" title="William Thetford">William Thetford</a>, Foundation for Inner Peace, <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation_for_A_Course_In_Miracles_a5a3.html" title="Foundation for A Course In Miracles">Foundation for A Course In Miracles</a>, Community Miracles Center, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Renard_560c.html" title="Gary Renard">Gary Renard</a>, Kenneth Wapnick. And in the article <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles_7511.html" title="Authorship of A Course in Miracles">Authorship of A Course in Miracles</a>, Ste4k will not accept ANY websites as âverifiableâ websites with regard to ACIM, including <a href="http://www.acim.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.acim.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.acim.org/</a> and <a href="http://www.facim.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.facim.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.facim.org/</a>, both of which are the official websites of California-based non-profit organizations. This editor's deletion attempts are merely personal bias masquerading as adherence to Wikipedia policy. And it appears that this editor has a history with this kind of behavior.

<li>This is not necessarily the case. There is little or no cited evidence of significance in any of these articles which comes from outside the ACIM movement itself, as such it appears to constitute a <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wikipedia%7EWalled_garden_a64f.html" title="Wikipedia:Walled garden">walled garden</a> and this is a legitimate reason for nomination of multiple related articles which does not constitute bad faith. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:48, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I authored this stub. A google search of "socialism for the rich" returns 14,700 results. There is a growing understanding that social programs are often designed to benefit the wealthy as opposed to everyone. It is important to document the recognition of this abuse. I have heard the term oligosocialism two times, but I cannot find a google hit for the term either. If the title is the main objection to the article, I do not mind changing it. For some similar terms, please see terms "oligarchy" and "oligopoly." I can easily add substantial documentation of cases where social programs have been structured to benefit distinct portions of the population. I don't think that too many examples would add to the general idea, however. Nevertheless, if others want to add examples, I am not opposed. I quote an internationally recognized author and historian in the article: Gore Vidal and I would like to add a quote from Noam Chomsky - please see below. I don't really see how this could be considered personal musing. Indeed, I believe that the article needs to be "beefed up," and I have no objection to doing so. If others have direct proof that there is no such thing as socialism for the rich they should add the information to the article rather than to label the article as pov, personal musing, protologism, or some other negative attribute. I see too often the same types of phrases thrown about to silence contributors. As I said, I consider the objection to the term oligosocialism as a valid concern. I do think however, that it very quickly conveys the foundation of the subject in question. Nevertheless I requested assistance in moving this article to another title - please see the discussion pages. Here is a section from a wikipedia article that I would like to add or link:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"In a different critique, the notable political activist Noam Chomsky, argues that the wealthy use free-market rhetoric to justify imposing greater economic risk upon the lower classes, while being insulated from the rigours of the market by the political and economic advantages that such wealth affords.[11] He remarked, "the free market is socialism for the richâ[free] markets for the poor and state protection for the rich."[12]</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, if there are any critics who believe that the phenomenon of "socialism for the rich" does not exist, please make your case. --24.206.125.213 09:08, 1 July 2006 (UTC)BMIKESCI</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Let's see if I'm getting this right: Eighternity is a (presumably patented, if you can patent such things) way to cut a diamond, and also the name of a company that holds the patent and makes jewelry. At least I think that's it. It's all rather confusing, and the two concepts are mushed together. Eighternity the <i>company</i> doesn't seem notable; it's another jewelry company. Eighternity the <i>cut</i>... well, first of all, only one company is (or, presumably, can) use that cut, so how notable is that? And there are a lot of ways to cut a diamond; can't we include them in <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond.html" title="Diamond">diamond</a> or all collected into one article?

<li><b>Please Save</b>: I'm Stephen Cassady, the Publisher of Spank!, and here's a few bits we'll add shortly. Other than being the longest running Youth Website (and I have references from books to confirm)(launched almost 11 years ago, we're older that Bolt.com - which has an enty), and we've been running constantly since launch. The WaybackMachine should show some early shots of the site. We continue to run, and exist. Our name (11 years old) comes from "brand spanking new", and the use of "fresh" associated with it. We've worked with most major record companies, IBM (on thier World Avenue Project commerce project back in the 90s, and even on the cover of their promotional magazine, we've won awards from numerous people including the New Museum of Art in NYC.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Criteria: I'll see if I can dig up the citations refering to Spank! in the books, and some of the awards to help back this. Stephen.</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>KEEP</b> There have been multiple requests to keep by editors who have made no edits other than to this AfD or the Haris Cizmic article. However after ignoring those I looked at the fact that most of the delete comments came before the changes to the article were made and the nominator withdrew the AfD. Plus a review of the article and the references lead me to believe that it should be kept. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambridgeBayWeather_aa30.html" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">CambridgeBayWeather</a> <a href="../../../c/a/m/User_talk%7ECambridgeBayWeather_e92a.html" title="User talk:CambridgeBayWeather">(Talk)</a> 15:45, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The temp page is indeed much better. But the complete lack of sources (newspaper reports about the awards or the design jobs (especially for <a href="../../../b/m/w/BMW_bcb4.html" title="BMW">BMW</a>), for example) is still a problem. IMHO the greatest claim of notability would be his <a href="../../../a/x/a/AXA_%28band%29_4538.html" title="AXA (band)">musical career</a>, which is barely mentioned at all. The copyvio tag seems strange to me, since the user who added it didn't state whose copyright was supposed to be violated. The page isn't listed at <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems</a>, either. <a href="../../../h/u/o/User%7EHuon_18c0.html" title="User:Huon">Huon</a> 20:34, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>the problem is that no one lists awards online after 5-6 years. (There is no award for the BMW, just a magazine ad designed for them, available for preview on www.theaxart.com I did not post that ad, because of their logo on it). I am not sure about Memorex, if they still keep old awards listed, but i can provide some scanns and screenshots. Musical awards are just some big paper things with hard cover. I could probably provide around 60 magazine and newspaper articles, but majority of them is not in english and they are just old scans. To post them - it would probably look ridiculous and funny. Shouldn't be enough to swear on the bible or something...&#160;:)&#160;? --<a href="../../../d/j/e/User%7EDjedamrazuk_5c10.html" title="User:Djedamrazuk">Djedamrazuk</a> 20:47, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Usually, an AfD is open for five days. In the end, an admin takes a look and decides wether the arguments for deletion outweight those for keeping the article. (The quality of "votes" is taken into account, not just the quantity.) I assume that DarkAudit's retraction of the AfD will count heavily in the article's favor, but it might happen that Cizmic's notability is still considered insufficient (see <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> for notability guidelines).

<dd><b>Comment</b>. No 17 films is nothing for porn actors, which is why the standard of 100 has evolved. While a conventional actor may make 17 films over 17 years, porn stars often make many more than that in a year. Here, for example, is John Holmes listing at imdb, [<a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0001360/" class="external autonumber" title="http://imdb.com/name/nm0001360/" rel="nofollow">[67]</a>].

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Just because 15 articles link here doesn't mean that the content on the page is relevant to the topic. As I'm new on WP, I suspect I may have inadvertently recommended that the entire article be dropped - which is not what I mean when I say that most of the contents of the article ought to simply be removed. I wish I had better research done to put in its place. I personally feel drugs should be legalized, but I am not adding my opinions about it to the <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organic_chemistry.html" title="Organic chemistry">organic chemistry</a> page, nor the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_2f44.html" title="White House">White House</a> page, or the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Law_School_e417.html" title="Harvard Law School">Harvard Law School</a> page. A page about Demand reduction should focus on explaining what Demand reduction is and perhaps talk about what governments may be doing to implement Demand reduction. Instead we have multiple uncited references to what "many" or "most" think (4x), vague uncited statements to what "can be described" and what "can be argued", as well as multiple uncited statements about what "seems to be" . None of these statements talk about Demand reduction. All these need to go, at least in favor of something that talks about the topic of Demand reduction, or at the very least, cites some source other than the author's opinion. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EReswobslc_c142.html" title="User:Reswobslc">Reswobslc</a> 23:25, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>The entire contents of an article can be changed without its deletion, in fact it is preferable to boldly change an article than to delete it entirely.

Merge is a type of keep, and incompatible with deletion (due to attribution requirements of GFDL). You can implement a merge/redirect without an AFD (or after a keep result). Then, editors can do, and undo, a redirect as appropriate (e.g. based on level noteworthy information available, which may change). There really are only two options for BB bios, keep/merge or keep/stand-alone. A true delete is basically ruled out (except for attack and copyvio cases). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 14:19, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> It was indeed a notable incident and it is probably a good idea to seperate out from the main article. And it survived an AFD in which is was agreeded upon being noteworthy.

It is highly informative and offers much more detail than the brief coverage in the ECW lawsuit section. It is not totally redundant. It is appropriately linked to by other articles. It is not advisable to link to sections, so even if this article's information were merged in to the ECW article there would still be a problem of linking.

<li>'incivility/personal attack'?

<li><b>Keep.</b> Well, I'm the biased East Iowan author. As far as I'm concerned, the film is notable enough to be on wikipedia. Not only is it listed on IMDB and other film databases, but the film has a strong following in the eastern Iowa area. I know you might not think much of us, but that's still a whole lot of people. It has an especially strong following at <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornell_College_e2bf.html" title="Cornell College">Cornell College</a> where there is a special showing once a year. Also, it was released on VHS and DVD, a feat that a lot of the films I've researched on this website never accomplished. All I ask is that you keep an open mind, the amount of hits it gets on Google doesn't mean it's not notable, it just means more needs to be written on the subject. <a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmopkisn_365a.html" title="User:Tmopkisn">tmopkisn</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmopkisn_1dc1.html" title="User talk:Tmopkisn">tlka</a></sup> 05:30, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. If you are referring to the inclusion of the subtitle in the article title, that is one thing. But if you are referring to the main title, "Absence from Felicity", I don't think that dislike of a book title can be legitimate grounds for deleting a page.

If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart, <i>Absent thee from felicity</i> a while (italics mine, AP), And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, To tell thy story." Shakespeare was Helen Schucman's favorite author, and Hemlet was her favorite Shakespeare work.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wow. You guys really don't like ACIM, do you? I would think that being the ONLY biography of this woman, a woman other editors have said is notable, would make this book notable. My mistake. I'm really starting to think I need to exit Wikipedia entirely because I have apparently missed something here. I thought that notable meant, um, notable ... and I thought that meant that it deserved its own page. As for this being a "walled gate", I'm not even sure that that means. But if it means that others can't edit it, that's incorrect. And if it seems that most ACIM-related items are self-referential, that is simply because it is a very new movement that only began in 1975. So, will we have to wait until 2020 before we can make more pages about ACIM-related material? -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 09:06, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
