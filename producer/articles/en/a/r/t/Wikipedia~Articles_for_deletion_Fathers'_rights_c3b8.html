<p>This article is a lengthly non-NPOV screed (carefully couched so as to appear neutral) in support of a particular British antifeminist movement. The primary authors of the article have a history of reverting changes made with the intent of neutralizing the non-NPOV content. I see no hope that this article can easily be reduced to a form that will pass for NPOV, or that the individuals who are responsible for this state of affair will cease their non-NPOV-introducing edits. Hence, I recommend the deletion of this article. —<a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> 19:54, Feb 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If 'anti-feminist' means oppossing the view that children are women's property to do with as they please regardless of the father's wishes, then I am most definitely anti-feminist, but I haven't heard any feminist spokespeople express this view, presumably because they would in their hearts be ashamed to, though there are women in the family courts every day who actions support that view exactly. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Stannard_9e17.html" title="User:Matthew Stannard">Matt Stan</a> 07:47, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If the wording is so carefully couched as to appear neutral then how can one reasonably claim that it is not, and surely one needs to cite some evidence to support that view? And what can one do about text that is believed by some not to be neutral but appears so? Perhaps we have a new category of problem in wikipedia, something which is in fact expressed in NPOV terms that accord with wikipedia's policies but which some readers find offensive because it calls into question their deeply held prejudices. All I would say to them is, don't read it then, and go somewhere else where you can preserve your prejudices and ignorance intact, OK? <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Stannard_9e17.html" title="User:Matthew Stannard">Matt Stan</a> 07:37, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'd like to see evidence of any reversions and who is alleged to be doing it. I've generally only added to the article, and corrected anomic contributions.

<li>I sympathize with Kelly Martin &amp; Fennec's exposition of the problem. However, the "fathers' rights" movement is a highly notable topic internationally, and Wikipedia articles are never just the product of one "author", but of the community.

<li><b>Weak keep.</b> This is a strongly POV article with an unproductive editing process. Nonetheless, it is a notable topic. I suggest that <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> or other editors go forward with removing the considerable amount of un-referenced and POV material.

<li>Keep. Notable topic in several different contexts. POV problems should be worked out through normal means. The topic and title are not themselves inherently biased. Comment: I object strongly to <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a>'s crack about censuring the nominator. While I disagree with the nominator, the nomination was politely worded and fact-based.

<li><b>Keep</b>, but only if the article is almost entirely rewritten. As it stands, the article is hopelessly biased, and unworthy of inclusion in the Wikipedia. However the topic is important, and it would be nice to see an article that talked about the "Father's rights" movement as a particular reaction on the part of some British men to feminism. As it is, it's extremely parochical, assuming that the world revolves around the UK and is essentially just a rather tiresome tract for this movement. If the article is not fundamentally re-written, <b>Strong Delete</b> though this would be unfortunate, as the topic itself is a good one for an article in the Wikipedia.<a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZantastik_9813.html" title="User:Zantastik">Zantastik</a> 02:18, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> <i>if cleaned up</i>. Agree with Samaritan, Sean Curtain, Plek, and particularly Zantastik, but especially with Rossami.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This very accurately reflects my knowledge having progressed through this system in an ultimately unsucessful attempt to maintain a relationship that can only be to my children's benefit. Just because the predominant viewpoint is that the system is unfair to fathers(and therefore children), doesn't necessarily make it anti feminist. Fathers going through this process generally only want equality of care and status with the mothers, surely feminism is about equality, not the superiority of women over men? --DanDav 22:13, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am very interested that perhaps one or several of the detractors, whom a UK Appeal Court judge has recently referred to as a "small group of obdurate women", might have surfaced in wikipedia, ostensibly on a NPOV tirade, though at least one of them has demanded the removal of all the facts from the article and no one here or elsewhere has identified specifically what it is about my and others' writings here that they find objectionable on whatever grounds. (I can only conclude they don't like my up-front style, which is why I maintain this is an <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> attack, rather than a genuine NPOV argument.) That is a pity, as I was hoping to hear expressed a reasoned set of counter-arguments to the fathers' rights cause. I imagine if anyone were to consult the leading sisters in the womens' movement they would be told to keep quiet and just hope that outlets like wikipedia don't get wide enough exposure to contribute significantly to the downfall of their, it can be reasoned, hitherto quite powerful clique. Has it not occurred to you that what is written in the article just might all be true, regardless of whether you like the people who wrote it? <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Stannard_9e17.html" title="User:Matthew Stannard">Matt Stan</a> 07:27, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>I agree, and I would like to warn people that it is ok if the Father's rights movement is anti-feminanist in so far that it seems, from their perspective, feminism is not about equality but in many cases becoming about promoting women at the cost of men's rights SO LONG as the article states that this is what these groups SAY/THINK, then that is NPOV. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaunMacPherson_703f.html" title="User:ShaunMacPherson">ShaunMacPherson</a> 17:46, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Shaun, I think you have misinterpreted the "anti-feminism" argument I have made in my earlier comments. My view is that the movement can only be regarded as anti-feminist if feminism is NOT about equality between men and women. If feminism is only about this equality, then the fathers rights movement cannot be said to be anti-feminist as fathers are seeking only equality in care &amp; status with mothers when it comes to their parenting. I hope this makes this clearer? --DanDav 18:11, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
