<p>The result of the debate was <b>Keep</b>. Whilst many editors seem to be convinced that this is either a game guide or "cruft", it actually has the form of a glossary of the type that is quite common on Wikipedia, and there is significant evidence that the bulk of the terms are in common use and are referenced on relevant gaming sites. The popularity of this particular game and the sheer size of the population of players is also a factor here. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 13:48, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. World of Warcraft is a major game, and a glossary over terms used in it is useful for the coverage.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>... What is unencyclopedic about it? This is not a video game 'guide' specifically... this is a glossary as well... i mean, i'm sure we don't have to mention that the finer points of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly.html" title="Monopoly">Monopoly</a> are a game guide... or even yet <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dungeons_and_Dragons_fd83.html" title="Dungeons and Dragons">Dungeons and Dragons</a>... also a game guide, that explains the game to only the depth that wikipedia can... the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glossary_of_firefighting_terms.html" title="Glossary of firefighting terms">Glossary of firefighting terms</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contract_bridge_glossary.html" title="Contract bridge glossary">Contract bridge glossary</a> are well constructed glossaries of terminology that have outgoing and incoming wikilinks that further can assist broad topics... as far as section 8 goes... "This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes." this is none of the above. This is not a guide to the 'game'... not in any way shape or form... it's a guide to the language surrounding the game... to get the VfD you need a broad consensus that <i>wikipedia is not a place for glossaries</i>, do not go after each individual instance of glossaries based on the content... go after the concept of them and shut them down from the top... as opposed to re:VfD for lists... which already has a consensus... This should not be a VfD without regards to the separations between a list and a glossary... This article is an encyclopedic <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glossary.html" title="Glossary">Glossary</a> of information as opposed to a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List.html" title="List">List</a>, as opposed to <b>Common School Pranks</b> (which i don't know if it exists anymore)... which was a list without many outgoing wikilinks... this is a comprehensive list of redirection and a compilation of more than just 'items', but a glossary of items that are contained under a very large topic with very specific nuances... see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_glossaries.html" title="List of glossaries">List of glossaries</a>... this is there too... this is not a manual by any means, but more of an <a href="../../../i/d/i/Idiom.html" title="Idiom">idiom</a> and <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slang.html" title="Slang">slang</a> glossary that has not a loose base of topics (it's easy to see that it's focused on just WoW specific terminology just like ... while the common mmorpg termonology has a very focused role as well)... which doesn't violate 2... so, with both of those covered... i apologize with the verbose nature of this entry... --<a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvesummernight_8002.html" title="User:Evesummernight">evesummernight</a> Edited at 15:54, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Sorry to buck the tide, but Wikipedia is studded with glossaries, as this article is. I can't see where this is a "game guide," which while people are waving around WP:NOT, is not in fact specifically excluded. By the way, I have a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> quote myself: "Wikipedia also includes glossary pages for various specialized fields."

<li><b>Comment</b>. I completely understand your point.

<li><b>Comment</b> While video games may be set in fictional "worlds", they, themselves, are <i>not</i> fictional - I'm looking at one sitting on my desk right now. Also, video games and computer games are a billion dollar world-wide industry and in that sense do deserve a tad of respect. Neither of these things justify keeping the article necessarily, but just some food for thought.--<a href="../../../n/a/h/User%7ENahallac_Silverwinds_91cc.html" title="User:Nahallac Silverwinds">Naha</a>|<sup><a href="../../../n/a/h/User_talk%7ENahallac_Silverwinds_c8bb.html" title="User talk:Nahallac Silverwinds">(talk)</a></sup> 22:00, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My apologies, I realized after I wrote "fictional" the way I did that it could be misconstrued as negative; I didn't mean it that way. What I meant was that while the video game industry itself is a specialized(and lucrative) field, I don't think the product itself is deserving of that consideration. Users of the game may specialize, but to me that is fandom. Once again something I have no problem with, but that's in NOT too. <a href="../../../t/k/e/User%7ETKE_5ab7.html" title="User:TKE"><font color="maroon"><b>T</b></font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>e</b></font></a><a href="../../../t/k/e/User_talk%7ETKE_bf64.html" title="User talk:TKE"><font color="gray"><b>k</b></font><font color="maroon"><b>e</b></font></a> 02:08, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Here's the breakpoint, though -- hundreds of thousands of people play this game, avidly, probably many more than practice some of those specialized academic fields.

<li><b>Keep</b> as a valid, non game-guide glossary. At the very least, the crustophobes should realize that having a single page to put all of this stuff is better than having people create and recreate all the items on this page over and over as separate pages. As stated above, glossaries are perfectly acceptable on Wikpedia, and (like it or not) more people play WoW than play <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contract_bridge_glossary.html" title="Contract bridge glossary">contract bridge</a> these days. Further, having the information on another wiki or external site is not, in and of itself, a reason for NOT having it on Wikipedia. Rather, that argument is more appropriate for deletion of things that do not belong on Wikipedia in the first place. This clearly does not fall into that category, unless you want to remove all glossaries, and this is not the place to do that. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 23:16, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was thinking mnore of an anti-video-game. Whether conscious or not, people often have a POV about video games that they are less respectable(and therefore something you'd less likely associate with an encyclopedia) than non-video games and I'm betting many people that voted delete here would vote keep should the bridge glossary go up for deletion(the fact that it hasn't seems to support this). If you have a good reason for how video game glossaries violate WP:NOT when non-video game glossaries don't, type it up and I'll change my vote. I'm not a fan of WoW myself, but I can't see how we can base a deletion on whether glossaries seem "encyclopedic" or "cruftish" and not be POV. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowoftime_3763.html" title="User:Shadowoftime">Shadowoftime</a> 02:04, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> but <b>Expand/Rewrite</b>. The bridge glossary is a precedent, but this article is mostly a list of abbreviations common in the game. Arguably, some of this information, i.e. defining corpse camping, is glossary fodder as much as defining various bidding/signaling strategies in bridge. Bridge has a larger number of players, but that does not make a bridge glossary more encyclopaedic than a WoW glossary.

<p>We need consistency.

<li><b>Comment</b> That is the most absurd thing I have heard in a long time. Almost everyone I know has a particular hobby or interest, be it sports, gaming, art, models, etc. For just about every hobby I can think of, there are terms used to describe various elements within the hobby, but they are rarely heard outside of the special interest groups in which they are used. There is nothing wrong with that.
