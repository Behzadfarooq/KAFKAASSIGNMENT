<p>Hoax or fiction. This was tagged for speedy delte, but IMO does not qualify. (Hoaxes are not a speedy criterion). There does seem to be a Paul Pattywho is a political figure in austrialia, If I have read a quick google scan correctly. But this isn't that person, although it may be satire. There are no google hits on "United Immigrants of Australia", and the only ones which are on "Paul Patty" + "United Immigrants" seem to be the sites liste at the end of this articel, all on fre host providers, and all looking very much like hoaxes or jokes. <b>Delete</b> unless reliable adn verifiabel sources are cited that this is a real person. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:25, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>As a member of the wikipedia community I find the above statement unnacceptable as it does not pertain to wikipedia's high standard of spelling and grammar. I would move to recommend that the user that submitted the recommendation for deletion proof-read their work thoroughly in the future to avoid such typographical assaults as <b>"speedy delte"</b> and <b>reliable adn verifiabel sources</b>. Also, the above article's arguments are now thoroughly rebutted with the testimony of Hahib further down this page. Finally in response to Mr Feyday's argument The Right Honourable Lord and Despot Hellenic Patriot 'Bane of the Communist Party' 'Scourge of the Working Class' Dr. Prof. Paul 'The Jackal' Patty PhD, AATP, NRMA, HIH, RER, RATP, TAB, SNCF, AC/DC, KFC, ADHD, ADD, RSPCA, USSR, ASIC, CCCP, ACCC, ATSIC, ACGS, PM, MP, ALP, ONP, AMP, JC, JP, DFAT, MoD, UK, OHP, PC, ICUP, QTC, QUT, NKVD, AIS, NYPD, LAPD, PCYC, YMCA, QPAC, QTIX, UQ, QUT, ACU, ADP, GDP, ADF, QLD, INXS- Leader and Founder of the United Immigrants <b>(It must be noted that these credentials are those stated by Patty, most of them are in fact false.)</b></li>

<p>The above is a most accurate account of the wonderful, exciting, and highly relelvant life of Dr. Patty. Dr. Patty is known as an inspiration to young teens throughout Australia, his deeds and great accomplishments are the reason for this. To even think that this wonderful account of Dr. Patty's life was to be deleted is proposturous. I for one, believe that this recount should not only be kept, but be immortalised for ever.</p>
<p>Habib the Pizzaman's thoughts</p>
<p>As a young boy growing up in Syria, life was very hard for me. From the age of 3 I regularly worked 17 hour days in my father's sweatshop, and I was one of the luckier ones. In 1947, my father sold his sweatshop to pay for an economy air ticket to Australia, which he gave to me on my birthday. Soon after, I left Syria, and I have never seen my parents since (by the way mum and dad if you are reading this, i say "Hello"). I wandered the streets of Melbourne for a year, although I never did come within 13km of the CBD - you must remember that I had no way of travelling from the airport except on foot.</p>
<p>It was with a flame in my heart that I heard of Paul Patty, the man who would later become the great political figure Dr Patty, and his role in the Brisbane Massacre. I began to believe (as did many others in the ethnic community) that I was actually worth something, and that there was someone who was prepared to stand up and fight for our common cause. So it was with cries of "Wogs, Lebs, Chongs, I-ties, Frogs, and anyone else of ethnic origin, let us unite!" that we marched upon Melbourne's CBD, inspired by the great Paul Patty and the Brisbane Massacre. However, from there nothing further happened for many years.</p>
<p>When the great Patty visited Melbourne with his cousins of the same name, he began to sow the seed amongst the marginalised and oppressed. Whilst not an active member of the United Immigrants party, I supported their views, and had decided to vote for them if a member stood for election in my electorate. I had also agreed to make pizzas for them at any party functions if they so desired.</p>
<p>I served as an NCO in Vietnam under Patty, and this further strengthened my conviction that he would one day be the voice of the oppressed ethnic community. After returning from Vietnam, I lost contact with Patty for some years, during which I established my now flourishing Pizza shop (which in fact gave the creators of SBS's 'Pizza' their idea).</p>
<p>In 1976, after the re-establishment of United Immigrants, I became the fourth most senior member of the Victorian branch of the party (after the three Asians Patty's cousin had met in a cab). Now I am an active member of the ethnic community, with such incentive schemes at my pizza shop as "Habib's Pizza - Ethnic Tuesday, all ethnics can buy one get one free" or "Present your ethnic passport for free garlic bread". That somebody accuses Patty of being a hoax is deeply insulting, because he rescued me from a life wandering the streets of Melbourne. It is a slur - a reflection of the cynicism of society today - that my friend and saviour, The Right Honourable Lord and Despot Hellenic Patriot 'Bane of the Communist Party' 'Scourge of the Working Class' Dr. Prof. Paul 'The Jackal' Patty PhD, AATP, NRMA, HIH, RER, RATP, TAB, SNCF, AC/DC, KFC, ADHD, ADD, RSPCA, USSR, ASIC, CCCP, ACCC, ATSIC, ACGS, PM, MP, ALP, ONP, AMP, JC, JP, DFAT, MoD, UK, OHP, PC, ICUP, QTC, QUT, NKVD, AIS, NYPD, LAPD, PCYC, YMCA, QPAC, QTIX, UQ, QUT, ACU, ADP, GDP, ADF, QLD - Leader and Founder of the United Immigrants, could be questioned as to the validity of his life story, because for the most of it, I was there with him.</p>
<p>Habib</p>
<p>By the way don't forget that Tuesdays are Ethnic Tuesdays, and, if you can prove you have read this document, you may have a free pizza to go with a 2L coke.</p>
<p><br />
I think ignorance is the cause of this movement to delete the honourable Paul Patty's page. I am an Australian and know very well the accomplishments, or lack there of, of Paul Patty, co-founder of the United Immigrants Party. This is an outrage, conjured by unintelligent people who obviously have no knowledge of syntax or correct spelling amongst other things, namely Australian history. Paul Patty is an Australian icon, the Che Guevara of Australian time. [Australian Citizen - K. Henderson]</p>
