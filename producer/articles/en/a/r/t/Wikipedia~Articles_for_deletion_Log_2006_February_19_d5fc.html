<p>No word is inherently funny, it is culturally constructed. This article is biased in concept and largely original research in execution. Plus, it doesn't include "pig" which I think is hilarious, but it does include "giggle" which is not even mildlly amusing, conjuring thoughts of vacuous gum-chewing schoolgirls on buses. If anyone can find me an article in any paper encyclopaedia, however big, on "inherently funny word" I will withdraw this nomination. Unless it's the Encyclopaedia Cruftannica. In which case we'll have found a copyvio.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Based on some of the references, it seems like this article could exist, albeit in a possibly different format. The fact that funniness if social constructed, for me at least, increases the need for an article which discusses that, provided it can be referenced. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 00:15, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I don't find the words in the list funny, therefore they are not <i>inherently funny</i>, therefore the article is false and it must be deleted. --<font style="background: #0000AA" face="verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndomion_ea7e.html" title="User:Endomion"><font color="white"><strong>Ruby</strong></font></a></font> 00:28, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Everything that is unreferenced should of course be removed, but the use of certain words as "inherently funny" by comedians (and the response of their audience) can be documented, and probably there is some more research on humor that can be cited to source this article better. The intro might need a complete rewrite, though. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 00:31, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep, but not as is</b>. This article is one of the centerpieces of wikipedia's humour section alongside <a href="../../../u/n/u/Unusual_articles.html" title="Unusual articles">Unusual articles</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_unusual_deaths.html" title="List of unusual deaths">List of unusual deaths</a>, but it's a messy article and needs work. Somebody needs to give it a thorough cleanup. Add some sources, and delete everything unsupported by references. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> 00:35, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - for some reason the idea of this article gets under a few people's skin. But it's a legitimate concept to discuss. Unfortunately, it's also a concept that draws a lot of fly-by edits (<i>I know something funny - let's add it!</i>), hence the messiness. - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidWBrooks_491e.html" title="User:DavidWBrooks">DavidWBrooks</a> 01:02, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Whether there is any such thing as an inherently funny word is irrelevant to whether the article should be deleted. Otherwise one could make the same case for deleting <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost.html" title="Ghost">Ghost</a>. The point is that certain words have been characterized as being inherently funny, as the article documents quite well. Unusual articles like this are part of what makes Wikipedia cool. <a href="../../../d/b/t/User%7EDbtfz_4176.html" title="User:Dbtfz"><font color="maroon">dbtfz</font></a><a href="../../../d/b/t/User_talk%7EDbtfz_3ffd.html" title="User talk:Dbtfz"><sup><font color="slategray">talk</font></sup></a> 01:19, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, and smak JzG will some inherently funny word like Pantyhose, bubbly or giggles... because he I feel he may have skiped a couple steps. You know, some wise men once said to me, if you think it need verifying, then put the verify sign on it. Don't just delete it. If you think it's NPOV then put that one on it too. And only delete it if you really want to. However I may be swayed for other reason to delete this. For example this may simply be an enumaration of several words.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It a number of people lack the required sense of humour. But I doubt even they can deny that, for example, banana is a word used often in jokes and the like (without a suitable context, just because of the word and nothing else). Basically the word has to be trivial in meaning (and thus it's meaning isn't funny at all), it usually sounds "awkward" or "foreign" or plain silly. And if you mention it at one point in a conversation for no reason at all it should be funny. Replacing it with textdocument or something equally mundane should not be (as) funny. In any case, there's comedians who believe in them...there are plenty of other people who "believe" in them, and hence it should be pretty obvious that an explanation is required for those that come across it without knowing what it is. Not to mention many, many articles reference it for good reason. Rygir 04:20, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It is neither Original Research - all of it is what other people have said are inherently funny words - nor POV.

<li><b>Delete with extreme prejudice.</b> This has to be one of the five worst articles I've read on Wikipedia, and I hated it before it was brought here. There's no excuse for this kind of garbage. It's original research, it's stuff made up in school one day, it's not notable, it aims to be a how-to on stand-up comedy. This is a pile of reeking garbage that would make Satan weep. It makes this encyclopedia look like it was written by moronic nosepicking fourth-graders. I can't emphasize enough how bad this is. BrianGCrawfordMA 15:11, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Conditional keep</b> - this article is highly misleading. If the article can differentiate between "inherently funny words" as an attempt to be funny. There is a huge different between that and scholarly language and psychology journals stating that this concept is true. So, I believe the subject may have been broached by enough comedians to merit its inclusion as a well known joke... but as a truly scholarly subject I have seen no evidence yet... and if this article doesn't differentiate between the two then it's seriously misleading. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 18:05, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but somehow this article needs to be 'steamlined' and broken into a few sub headings. Inherently Funny is a legitimate comedic concern and valid considertion for many comedians. Steve Allen has written on the subject and I recall Milton Berle mentioning it as far back as the 1960s. Cincinatti is a funny word, Dallas is not. Maybe "k" is funny by association: Shecky Green, Red Skelton, Danny Kaye, Ernie Kovaks. At any rate, the concept deserves some more research and citations. <small>John Sinclair, Salt Lake City (har!)</small></li>

<dd>I'm not quite sure what you're driving at here, but there are no sources attesting to the inherent funniness of words mentioned in the article, "weasel", for instance, which, IMHO, makes most of this article OR.

<li><b>Keep</b> but edit drastically. It should exist where 'Inherrently funny word' is a quote rather than a topic, as comedians have spoken on this subject and given examples. I suggest it should begin with something like 'An 'Inherrently funny word' is a concept which has been proposed by many comedians, including (etc), and featuring words like (etc)'. No word is inherrently funny, it's all relative. --<a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELuke44_0bb4.html" title="User:Luke44">Luke44</a> 21:41 22 February 2006 (GMT)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article holds a great deal of information on a concept which clearly has been addressed many times in popular media, as seen in the number of sources it cites. It doesn't try to establish a deffinative list of all "inherently funny" words, although the opinion of profession commedians could probably be taken as expert opinion, and thus qualify for inclusion, as has been done. If someone feels that the article is trying to create an inherently incomple and potentially POV list, then it could be cleaned up, but since it is clearly a subject that has been addressed there is no reason to delete it. After all, there are articles on consipracy theories, alien abduction and pseudosciences that may not actually physically exist, but the idea is prevalent enough that in can be reasonable addressed. After all, all of these quotes are verifiable. I've read Dave Barry's piece where he claims weasel is an inherently funny word, for instance. He certainly qualifies as an expert, and thus it's not OR. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcelight_76ef.html" title="User:Icelight">Icelight</a> 20:31, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am not a member of Wikipedia. I'm pretty sure I signed up for an account before, but I don't remember my user name or my password. I have to say that I have the <i>exact opposite opinion</i> on this article that Mr. Brian G. Crawford has. The argument here seems to be that, if this article concerns the subject of silliness, then the article itself must be silly. Nothing is empirically funny, at all, ever. It is -ALWAYS- culturally constructed. That is the nature of humor itself. The fact is that humor is difficult to analyze because you don't know whether something is funny until it makes you laugh. "Inherent funniness" is the concept by which something is simply considered funny, and therefore preferable to things that are not funny. In the satirical online game, The Kingdom of Loathing, the clothing choices for player characters are "pants" and "hat". I am not aware of an official stated reason for clothing being limited to those items, but it is my opinion that experts on humor will agree that "pants" and "hat" are the funniest names for articles of clothing. Certainly, some people may argue that "socks" is funny or that player characters should be allowed to choose "galoshes" or "underpants" or something similarly silly. In this respect, humor can be considered entirely objective. Some people may not find any words to be inherently funny at all, just like how I am fairly sure I have not laughed at an episode of "Seinfeld" at all, not even once. Those who want this article deleted seem to be convinced that humor is not worthy of intelligent analysis because of its subjectivity or its strong ties to the culture of those involved with both producing the humor and laughing at it. I myself firmly believe that it is because of these things that humor is a worthy topic of discussion. There won't be articles discussing in detail every form of humor in legitimate mainstream paper encyclopedias, because humor is a very difficult topic. However, if this article ends up being deleted (being edited to conform to a higher standard of quality is quite acceptable) it will severely hurt my faith in humanity. I just thought I'd throw in my own two cents. --65.13.17.229 07:00, 24 February 2006 (UTC) [Some guy named Dave]</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>:<b>Yay!!!</b> It now appears as if this article will be kept, and of course I am very happy with that. For those who say it should be deleted, I can only state that the First Family of the United States has been a distinct institution for two centuries. Some First Families (in particular the Kennedys) had a significant inpact on the popular culture of the day. To those who support me in keeping the article, I must say that I agree with your assertions that more should be included about the security the First Family receives, the privileges they are privy to, etc. I would welcome inclusion of that within this article, because, frankly, I don't think I could cover it all on my own. However, I feel strongly that te biographical information as pertains to each First Family's time in the White House should STAY, and I will reinsert any biographical info that is unnecessarily deleted. The idea of a one-sentence summary of each First Family is a bit far-fetched. If people wanted mediocre knowledge on the topic, they wouldn't come to Wikipedia. We should be detailed. And for all the "editorialising" I have done, I feel that the article is very neutral. Based on my descriptions of two Republican and one Democratic First Family, can you really guess what my political views are? I note Clinton's infidelities and the Bush twins' binging in a purely factual manner. So, that is what I have to say, and I will check in here from time to time to see what everyone else thinks.

<li><b>Comment</b>: If you continue to expand it the way you're doing (there's even a note on the page "<i>NOTE: THIS ARTICLE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND WILL BE EXPANDED BY ITS ORIGINAL CREATOR."</i> which I don't think is usual practice), it's going to be <i>extremely</i> long <a href="../../../s/i/z/WP%7ESIZE_929b.html" title="WP:SIZE">WP:SIZE</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: What? It is a Brit, isn't it? And do you all refer to the Blairs as the First Family? Honestly, the idea that the American First Family could simply be included in an article that describes the families of heads of state in general is itself rather funny. I mean, come on, I don't really think anyone is pretending that Cherie Blair yields the same kind of inflence as Laura Bush. The American First Family, whoever its members are at any given time, is the most powerful and influential family on Earth. Let me put it this way: if George W. Bush does something notable, you all hear about it. If Laura Bush does something notable, you all hear about it. When Barbara and Jenna Bush go out drinking, you all hear about it. When one of the Blairs does something notable, NO ONE CARES. I'm not being arrogant, I'm just illustrating a fact. I don't even know who Tony Blair's children are! I couldn't tell you if Jacques Chirac even has a wife, let alone the woman's name if he is married. And yet, EVERYONE knows about the American First Family. That's just the way it is. As the most significant and powerful family on the face of the Earth, I think they deserve their own article, don't you? <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHistory21_c579.html" title="User:History21">History21</a> 00:50, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I agree it shouldn't have been redirected without this discussion being closed. History21 undid the redirect, and I've reverted it to the last most complete version prior to that redirect. The number of people voting to keep is not the sole basis of whether an article is deleted or not AFAIK. The main reason to delete it is that there are already articles covering some of the families and all of the individuals. Another lesser problem is a US-centric systemic bias overstating the importance of members of the "first family" beyond the President and First Lady. Another problem is length; if the article covers all the so-called "first families" as the intention was stated, it could grow to be about 40,000 words in length.<a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 18:58, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The article, as it presently stands, is repetitive of quite a few already well written, adequately sourced material on Wikipedia. From what I see now, in an attempt to have the article kept, the author is adding unsourced, inaccurate paragraphs every now and again to expand the article - not good news. A majority of keep votes are under "extensive rewrite" or "rewrite completely." I am not saying that an article of such a title should not exist, for the institution is rather important. I am just saying that as it stands now, the current article under the title "First Family of the United States," per all the delete votes and keep+rewrite votes needs to be scrapped, and rewritten from a much different approach. Deleting the article removes the histories, to prevent reversion - a rewritten article under the title "First Family of the United States" would have no need to be reverted to what currently sits under that name. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Jay_e6f4.html" title="User:Master Jay"><font style="background:black"><b><font color="white">Jay</font></b></font></a><b><font style="background:gold">(<a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Jay_a66f.html" title="User talk:Master Jay">Reply</a>)</font></b> 00:38, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: How's about using proper grammar? (Notice the apostrophe in "how's.") When referring to an <i>A</i>merican, we use capitals. Don't ruin a (I'll admit) fairly clever attack against me by using flawed punctuation. It just really, really upsets me, almost as much as the still silly assertion that the U.S. First Family does not merit its own article. By the way, I must commend you for using my own statements to demonstrate my "american [sic] nonsense," alluding of course to my own use of "anti-American nonsense." That was quick. Your astuteness however, does not make up for the fact that everything I said was true. Sorry. That it was true.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The absence of material on all the "first families" is not a reason to delete it, IMO. However, adding the missing families would not make for a reason to keep it either. It's still redundant, something that hasn't been addressed yet. How do you write about a president's significance <i>as a member of the "first family"</i> in a way that it covers things not covered by the article on that man or the one on <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a>? How do you write about a first lady's significance <i>as a member of the "first family"</i> in a way that it covers things not covered by the article on that woman or the one on <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Lady_of_the_United_States_1d2e.html" title="First Lady of the United States">First Lady of the United States</a>? How do you write about the significance of other members of the family <i>as members of the "first family"</i> in a way that it covers things not covered by the articles on those people? A more valuable endeavor, IMO, would be to create articles for the redlinked "Non-spouse 'First Ladies'" and "White House hostesses" from the FLOTUS page. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 21:30, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As I stated in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ruin_Mist_c572.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ruin Mist">AFD for Ruin Mist</a>, Stanek is an oddment. Stanek is infamous throughout science fiction publishing. What tends to happen is that a completely non-notable book is put out in the Stanek name, and then hundreds, if not thousands, of positive reviews begin to flood web-based reviews websites. Oddly, these reviews are all identical. Now, I'm not saying that Stanek himself has anything to do with these reviews, any more than I'm saying that the sudden flurry of Stanek-related articles on Wikipedia are anything to do with him personally, but the long arm of coincidence stretches only so far.

Terms like "hoover" are common currency in railway modelling and railfan magazines; these are not available online, but "teh Intarweb" is not the world, somethign we often forget when we can't find somethign on Google. Part of the point of Wikipedia, for me, is to bring stuff which you'd otherwise have to visit the library to find, onto the web. In this case the article is substantially <i>more</i> useful than things like the lists of hacker jargon, since there is already an authoritative source of hacker jargon at the Jargon Files, and all we're doing is mirroring it and sometimes adding unverified cruft.

<li><b>Keep</b>. There are several webpages dotted around the internet with slices of jargon, some with just one or two entries some with more. There is no central respository. As <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlambo_7b8d.html" title="User:Slambo">Slambo</a> said, other lists of jargon are accepted, even when we are duplicating effort. This and the US railfan jargon article were recently spun out from the main <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railfan.html" title="Railfan">railfan</a> article as the two lists were starting to take over.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think people are voting for keep for this because they like the article but it violates at least two Wikipedia guidelines.

<li>Believe it or not, we actually agree on part of this debate - pages that violate WP policy should be deleted. My vote reasoning points out established precedents for articles of this type. If they are deleted as well and the policy is evenly enforced (it doesn't look likely with the vote counts there right now), I will then change my vote. Yes, I am a railfan, but that in itself is not the reason for my keep vote. <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlambo_7b8d.html" title="User:Slambo">Slambo</a> <small><a href="../../../s/l/a/User_talk%7ESlambo_46ea.html" title="User talk:Slambo"><font color="black">(Speak)</font></a></small> 14:23, 23 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Precedents need to be changed and the articles need to be deleted. You have a vested interest as you seem to be a member of the Trains WikiProject, but the article should be deleted since it goes against policy, as all the other ones like it. <a href="../../../f/r/%C3%BC/User%7EFr%C3%BChst%C3%BCcksdienst_65f2.html" title="User:Frühstücksdienst">Frühstücksdienst</a> 14:29, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> As of right now this article has been greatly expanded to take on a different form. However, I am still unsure if it meets quality standards. My main point of contention is that even though the information is helpful and true, it is not encyclopedic.

<li><b>Keep</b> There are many people who would like to research this topic and who are courious what an ecyclopedia entry concerning it may state. It is useful and informative adn will cater to the needs of quite a few visitors. Besides the deletion request was based on a small dismbig I created. Since then, however, the article has evolved into a real article that is of use to Wiki visitors. <b><a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerdbrendel_cba6.html" title="User:Gerdbrendel"><font face="Arial" color="#1F860E">Signature</font></a><font color="#20038A"><sup><a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerdbrendel_cba6.html" title="User:Gerdbrendel">brendel</a></sup></font></b> 17:28, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This article has definitely improved since I nominated it. However, yes, it still feels like an extremely bloated dicdef ("Automobile Ownership is the sum of all the aspects associated with owning an automobile."?) Wikibooks seems like a good place for this article - it is more of an instructional manual or help page for those interested in the topic than it is a true encyclopedia article. This article also flirts with original research. If we allow this page, what it to stop us from creating pages on pet ownership, home ownership, or stock ownership? All of these seem like they would be either disambiguation pages, Categories, or Wikibooks. My vote (not a "real" vote since I'm the nominator) is transfer the material somewhere then redirect the page to Category:Automobiles. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticBacon_4090.html" title="User:CrypticBacon">CrypticBacon</a> 08:32, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Simply within my municipality I can think of much documentation that exist on vehicle registration. I myself have dedicated the last 2 years of my life on how to register a <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> in Ontario. I have official documentation (published and a lot un-published). There are government publications, books, official correspondances, etc. that exist on how to, what to. There are laws that exist (official publications). I think I could easilly make an encyclopedic article on vehicle registration here in Ontario let alone the rest of the world. Heck I think I could make an article on registration of motorized bicycles registration... oh wait I have made something like that it's called <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_bicycle_laws.html" title="Electric bicycle laws">Electric bicycle laws</a>. (not quite the same but it does cover registration!). Wikibooks may be an interest place to expand the article once it becomes to big. (they allow that!) They however don't allow original research (though they are less strick about it at the current moment). If you are interested in starting a book please contact me for I've started a book called <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/How_To_Ride_The_Bus" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:How_To_Ride_The_Bus">How To Ride The Bus</a>.

<dd>The problem I see is that the reference section just doesn't make sense to me. Follow <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>... And unfortunatelly, this seems to be an inherent problem for most articles here at AFD. If we simply put ""unsourced"" and guided new commer to wikipedia we would be developing a friendlier place. And we would be making much more productive and credible articles. The links that are provided, I feel, are no different than linking to google and then saying "search." It is imparitive to have a well sourced article. After that... you have to deal with notability. Obviously if your article is well sourced this shouldn't be so bad. However some less notable people have been removed from wiki. Good luck! --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 20:32, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>very strong keep</b>: This is out of process. Since when do we delete an article because it is bureaucratese. I've never seen that in valid reasons for deletion.

<p><b>comment</b>: I might not be able to prove that this article should be kept but I sure may be able to prove why it shouldn't be deleted. This article is sourced. This article respects <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No Original research</a> policy. This article is a true article not a hoax. This article is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">suitable of wikipedia</a>. This article passes the test of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>,<a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> because it doesn't fall within those categories. This article doesn't seem to be a copyvio. This is not a category gone awry. This is not a redundant stub or template gone awry. This can definatelly be more than a dictionnary article. (ie.: the addition of various historic military examples, other examples, etc, digrams, images. etc...), this article is not a source text either. Conclusion: This article doesn't need deletion... as per <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> it needs {{attention}} or perhaps, because there are already some excellent references and sources, simply some {{cleanup}} and {{stub}} to expand it! I think the nominator should be slaped for failling to notice that there are two collumns in WP:DP. One is delete nomination the other is "Problems that don't require deletion." Hastily jumping into such deletion process has not saved anyone here, any time. <b>Summary:</b>page doesn't seem to violate any deletion policy rules. This article should be kept (as per my above vote). --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 02:48, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. We do not have enough content for 2639 to be a stand-alone article. If it redirects to <a href="../../../2/7/t/27th_century.html" title="27th century">27th century</a>, the reader/editor will understand this and subsequent edits to significant predicted events in that year will be placed in <a href="../../../2/7/t/27th_century.html" title="27th century">27th century</a>, until 2639 grows near enough and/or gains enough information to warrant its own article. I'm a little uncertain why this redirect is considered "implausible".

<dd>Thanks for replying. It's implausible because there's not a significant demand for information on the year 2369 at this time, and it's unlikely that anyone will get to the target article through the redirect. That said, obviously your edit was in good faith, and I'm not adverse to having it stand, but consensus is running towards deletion, and speedy deletion at that. This is why I hoped you might come by and offer reasons why a redirect would be better than deletion&#160;:) <b><a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_9077.html" title="User:Adrian"><font color="#000000">A</font></a></b><font color="#646060">drian</font> <b><a href="../../../a/d/r/User_talk%7EAdrian_59cc.html" title="User talk:Adrian"><font color="#000000">L</font></a></b><font color="#646060">amo</font> <b><font color="#F660AB">··</font></b> 07:28, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First off, thank you for realizing the redirect was in good faith. Hypothetical: If the creator of 2639 were to have simply created a redirect, instead of posting a bunch of gibberish, what do you think would have happened? Would it have gone up for AfD or simply been left alone? I venture that if I were to go and created "8675" as a redirect to 87th century, no one would really have a problem with it. Sure, the chance of that redirect being useful is slim, but nonetheless it is a sensible redirect. It's not as if the redirect is misleading or unthruthful. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticBacon_4090.html" title="User:CrypticBacon">CrypticBacon</a> 08:16, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<ul class="noindent">
<li>Disagree slightly, as it is known around Nottingham (not just the university), and several of the speakers and organisers who have been there are notable in Christian and non-Christian circles at a national - and international in some cases - level. Many are prominent in international political, social justice and fair trade movements also. The scope of the network extends well beyond that of a "Christian club." I haven't yet had the opportunity to provide links for many of the organisations who have been represented by and at the network.</li>
<li>It has further novelty as - to the best of my knowledge - this is the first organisation of it's kind in the UK. A further reason it has been listed is as the name of the society doesn't immediately suggest what it is.</li>
<li>This entry mirrors those of some other UK Christian Student Societies in terms of its notability such as the Christian Union movements, or indeed the entries of churches or their pastors. I'd suggest that it needs to be considered at a similar level as all of them as it is just as arguable that they are not notable outside their immediate cachement area. I'll try and move it to a more appropriate category if someone can tell me how! Any further thoughts? irish_admiral 13:41, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>How does it compare to those others I mentioned?

The same is true of those others I mentioned, and they still appear to be here. Also, as I pointed out, it's more useful for that which it reports about rather than the name of the network itself.

The article is fine as it stands in my book; and I've listened and finally answered all of their requests for citation and <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> and they still aren't happy.

<ul>
<li>You have a good point Sam. My primary reasons are <i>original research</i> and it being the author's personal vanity page. It's extraordinarily POV and contains fictional content (see <i>story</i> on how popular the mud was with Gulf War participants on the page - hint Gulf War ended 3 years before the mud ever existed) for one example, which is very different in character from most of the other mud related pages I've read. Clearly it not very notable even in the sub category of MUDS. But I share your concern that all muddish pages would be excised and that's not my intent. It also contains baseless, bordering on libelous, claims against other mud coders...that is to say it is the author's personal repository of crank theories. <a href="../../../j/l/a/User%7EJlambert_01c0.html" title="User:Jlambert">Jlambert</a> 19:56, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Other MUD codebases have Wikipedia pages, but they also have more players and more running servers. Just take a looksee on mudconnector or similar at how many people are actually running this type of MUD server. Seems nonnotable to me (I even raised this on the talk page.) Also, I'm not anyone's sockpuppet (check user agrees!), unless we're just redefining that term to 'people who sometimes disagree with Young Zaphod. <a href="../../../e/h/h/User%7EEhheh_6717.html" title="User:Ehheh">Ehheh</a> 19:41, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b>: I'm not to familiar with the subject but it appears to an okay article. Assides from the very very poor reference... (or non comprehensible, or bizar references that link to an email adress!) This also smell like a plain old wiki disputes. This FUCKING pisses me off because no wiki deletion process should be started for a silly disputes. Try to find the source of the problem... write it down clearly. State it clearly. And if it's not a deletion process put that up. I.e.: verifiability template? Come back once you've solved that if you still have problems. I think it's proper to go through pre-deletion process before nominating.

<li>I agree, and that's why I nominated the article. Discussion, citation templates, and even mediation was attempted. Thus the basic problems with author's vanity pages in the first place. I especially agree with your comments on the other nomination about making wiki a friendlier place. I encourage you to review the talk pages even though the subject may not interest you itself.

<li>It is encyclopedic because it's very relevant as part of his radio show. Savage references them all the time. In fact, he's even in the process of releasing a new book which labels each personality with a disparaging (most anyway) name. Another thing...saying that they're "offensive slurs" is YOUR POV.

Most of the stuff on the page is punning nicknames, not new words. If the page survives on its own, and I really don't think it should, it needs a lot more context. When Savage uses these nicknames, how does he use them? Does he say something like "Rush Limbaugh, or as I like to call him, Hush Bimbo" or does he say the nickname without ever using the person's real name at all? Also, some of the names seem to indicate faults he finds in the person, but others don't convey any obvious meaning at all. What does calling Sean Hannity "Harvey Wallbanger" mean? That Hannity uses his fists a lot? That he drinks a lot? If his fans want to get really encyclopedic, they'd try to: (1) establish when the name was first used (2) what the name means (if not original research), (3) document whether the name was used more than once, and if so how often (otherwise definitely not notable), (4) whether the use of the name has spread beyond his fans (otherwise hardly notable), and so on. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 05:35, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep As-Is</b>, The <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Hyles_12fe.html" title="Jack Hyles">Jack Hyles</a> Wiki was originally hijacked by a small and dedicated group of anti-Hyles persons who want everyone to think that their accusations are "significant to this man's ministry" and that they are "well sourced and referenced". Their constant vandalism of the main Jack Hyles Wiki caused a wiki-war. A consensus solution was reached whereby this fork article was created. This solution is consistant with Wiki guidelines on article forking (POV fork) which states, "<i>As Wikipedia articles grow, they often need to be segmented, or branched, into manageable parts. This is an accepted premise for forking an article, and the nature of that split more often depends upon consensus — e.g. a "Criticism of" article may be justified if there is enough (or going to be enough) material to justify a separate article...</i>" Go ahead and delete this article and merge these outrageous accusations into the main Jack Hyles Wiki, but you will surely enter right back into the wiki war again, which no one wants. - GeorgeS <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.214.212.201.html" title="User:69.214.212.201">69.214.212.201</a> (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.214.212.201.html" title="User talk:69.214.212.201">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.214.212.201_0d2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.214.212.201">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Comment</b>, again... this seems to be a fork that is there strictly to create an "out of sight out of mind" scenario. The main article has not grown enough to merit a fork. To quote POV fork: <i>"The generally accepted policy is that all facts and majority Point of Views on a certain subject are treated in one article. As Wikipedia does not view article forking as an acceptable solution to disagreements between contributors, such forks may be nominated for deletion."</i> As I said above, if the criticisms of Mr. Hyles are If these claims are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and can be legitimately sourced without being <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, they should stay in the article and anyone who initiates an edit war by repeatedly deleting material should be warned and then banned if they continue. Conversely, if the criticisms are not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> then they do not belong on Wikipedia at all and anyone who repeatedly adds this information should be warned and then banned if they continue. Forking just to keep 2 opposing sides from having to work together is, in my opinion, not a supported reason for a fork and is bad precedent.

<li><b>Reply to Comment</b>, The point is that we came to a consensus solution here and most seemed to be happy with it, and most thought it was an equitable solution and it ended the wiki-war, or at least it was a temporary "cease-fire". The truth is that there is equal Wikipedia guidelines for BOTH positions (deletion vs. forking). The forking solution will work; deleting this fork will only add fuel to the fire on both sides of this issue. From the last wiki-war, it's apparent that banning IP addresses is not the solution, since both parties seem to have an abundance of methodologies at their disposal for avoiding such control schemes. Please allow me to ask for YOUR solution to this problem-- allowing the anti-Hyles people to place their extremely biased and unproven pet theories and character assassinations on the main Jack Hyles Wiki is NOT a solution that will work without major challenges. The majority of the anti-Hyles editors have proven time and time again that they CANNOT write in a Neutral Point of View on this subject. -GeorgeS <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.214.212.201.html" title="User:69.214.212.201">69.214.212.201</a> (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.214.212.201.html" title="User talk:69.214.212.201">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.214.212.201_0d2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.214.212.201">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>Wikipedia doesn't allow POV forks, you should familiarize yourself with the resource. If something is sourced and murder allegations are part of his past it should be included on the main article.

<dd>Arbustoo, perhaps YOU should familiarize yourself with the resource. A fork is clearly acceptible when there is enough material to support it. (Try reading the comments above and checking out the Wikipedia guidelines on forking) AND WHAT THE HECK is this stuff about "MURDER ACCUSATIONS"?? See folks, this crowd just keeps piling on false accusation on false accusation, tell a lie long enough and eventually it makes it into the Wiki.

<dd>There is not enough material to support a fork in this case, neither article is anything like big enough for that. Addition of rubbish is not a reason for forking (otherwise we'd have hundreds of articles on <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W_Bush_83e6.html" title="George W Bush">old smirky</a> by now) - and addition of verifiable material offensive to fans of the subject is equally not grounds for forking.

<li><b>Keep</b>, The main gimmick of this band are their song-titles, so removing them would be at odds with that. They're certainly offensive, but deliberately so, and anyway, perhaps extra info will be added at a later date, who knows. I don't think whether we think something is obscene/offensive though should affect its inclusion in an encyclopedia, particularly as these CDs can be openly sold here in the UK, despite us having the /very/ restrictive Obscene Publications Act, which would result in them being banned if they were actually seen as obscene in law. hajolyn 02:11, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> but rewrite, wikify, de-POVize, and check to make sure it isn't original research. I see no reason why this doesn't deserve an article.

<li>It's a <b>copyright violation</b>, apparently of a 1995 <i>Architectural Digest</i> article, as linked from the bottom of the page.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> and rewrite, per Skidoo. I thought it said 'reproduced with permission'. Since I suspect this is by an organisation (User:Capetown2020 sounds corporate), they might indeed have permish. And it hardly counts as an advert for the 2004 Olympics in, er, 2006. Am trying to engage with the editor on their talk page, as if nothing else they are well informed about a region with far too few Wiki contributors. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackyR_8980.html" title="User:JackyR">JackyR</a> 23:38, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - uh... think I'd go with Metropolitan90 here. Don't really think individual bids need their own articles, one page about bids per Games is sufficient. Delete current version as copyvio unless evidence is supplied that the copyright holder wishes to release it under GFDL (something I find highly unlikely), then create redirect.

<li><b>Reply</b> - It was only closed because I made the mistake of reopening the first AfD when it was closed down, rather than create a new one like I should've (I'm not used to the new AfD system). The first AfD resulted in no favorable position for either; keeping the article or deleting it (although there was a seven-to-five ratio in favor of deleting this article).

<li><b>keep</b> I see no problem with this. These are press release. seem verifiable. Article seem sourced. The only trouble you seem to have is whith the fact that it hasn't been release yet but if president Bush suddenly said on November 4th we will attack China and we will call it Liberty World War. Then I think we could start an article on Liverty World War and what is currently happening to support that. Same for here. Some plans are happening in the background.

<li>If I could jump in, the difference I see between this movie and the dime-a-dozen proposals is notability. (See my previous comments below.) This film will be the sequel to two already-released major films and is already connected to two famous people, and the plans and rumors surrounding it have received significant public attention; this is not true for all the other unconfirmed films out there. These facts are notable and verifiable, and Wikipedia should cover them. (This is the case even if the plans are tentative; facts of the form, "These notable people have verifiably made a <i>tentative</i> announcement that..." are still facts.) The central point of the crystal ball rule is that future events are unverifiable, but this article concerns verifiable talk <i>about</i> future events, so why not keep it?

<li><b>Keep</b>. This future project is being planned by notable people in a public and verifiable way. The article can and should describe what verifiable plans there are, <i>as they exist in the present</i>; we would be remiss if we omitted this noteworthy information by applying the "crystal ball" rule too broadly. (And should the film be cancelled, the article could then be changed to one about a film that was publicly planned to be made and then wasn't, and merged if necessary.) –<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESommers_4abf.html" title="User:Sommers">Sommers</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESommers_adb5.html" title="User talk:Sommers">(Talk)</a></sup> 00:32, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - By your logic, the deletion of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Begins_2_6070.html" title="Batman Begins 2">Batman Begins 2</a> article was unjustified, even though the producers have clear plans to do a trilogy, even moreso than <i>Resident Evil 4</i>. The information on the sequel is instead kept on the original <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Begins_16f4.html" title="Batman Begins">Batman Begins</a></i> page, since nothing is concrete about those sequels. Why shouls Resident Evil 4 get special treatment? Jonny2x4 15:32, 20 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not familiar with the content of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Begins_2_6070.html" title="Batman Begins 2">Batman Begins 2</a> article from before it was deleted, but I don't think my logic says that. Tentative information about the <i>Batman Begins</i> sequel, as you point out, is indeed kept at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Begins_16f4.html" title="Batman Begins">Batman Begins</a>. The "crystal ball" policy is about whether certain <i>information</i> should be included in Wikipedia at all, not whether articles themselves should be deleted or kept, so I ask: if those verifiable facts about plans and speculation for a future movie can be kept at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Begins_16f4.html" title="Batman Begins">Batman Begins</a>, why can't verifiable facts about plans and speculation for <i>Resident Evil 4</i> be kept here?
<p>If it's just a question of whether the article should be merged into <a href="../../../a/p/o/Resident_Evil%7E_Apocalypse_4089.html" title="Resident Evil: Apocalypse">Resident Evil: Apocalypse</a> or <a href="../../../e/x/t/Resident_Evil%7E_Extinction_73fb.html" title="Resident Evil: Extinction">Resident Evil: Extinction</a>, as <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Begins_2_6070.html" title="Batman Begins 2">Batman Begins 2</a> was, then it's only a matter of style and organization, rather than keep/delete. Personally, I think Resident Evil 4 (film) is already too long to be merged, but if you'd like to vote "merge and redirect", be my guest. Discussion is still welcome. Thank you. ndash;<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESommers_4abf.html" title="User:Sommers">Sommers</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESommers_adb5.html" title="User talk:Sommers">(Talk)</a></sup> 11:12, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>It might seem long at first sight, but if you view the actual content of the article, you'll notice half of it is unverified speculation and unconfirmed reports (<i>i.e: Capcom <b>might</b> create new characters, Leon Kennedy is <b>rumored</b> to be in the movie, the movie is planned for 2007, but <b>nothing official is confirmed</b></i>). It almost feels as the contributor is making half of the information up. It feels less like an encyclopedic article and more like a collection of wishful thinking and hearsay. If you cut it down so that it only contains confirmed info, you won't have much of an article.<br />
I think it would be ideal to merge all the confirmed info about the fourth Resident Evil film into the <i><a href="../../../e/x/t/Resident_Evil%7E_Extinction_73fb.html" title="Resident Evil: Extinction">Resident Evil: Extinction</a></i> page.

<p>The article provides no evidence that this bus route is encyclopedic, if such a thing is possible. For what it's worth, there is some precedent that individual bus routes are not inherently encyclopedic, barring specific evidence of their notability; see, for example, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_M4_Bus_Route_5994.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/M4 Bus Route">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/M4 Bus Route</a>. <small><a href="../../../c/d/c/User%7ECdc_936f.html" title="User:Cdc">CDC</a> <a href="../../../c/d/c/User_talk%7ECdc_878d.html" title="User talk:Cdc">(talk)</a></small> 17:06, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Actually bus routes are surprisingly stable, possibly because they have to go through a regulatory process. I've done some research on the bus routes in <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a>, and many of them are largely or entirely equivalent to the streetcar lines they replaced starting in the 1920s. Given that this article only gives a list of stops, I see no pressing need to keep it. However, the history of the route from its likely streetcar beginnings would make a good article. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a> - <small><a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_SFD_e111.html" title="User:SPUI/SFD">don't use sorted stub templates!</a></small>) 18:56, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article had been tagged for Speedy-deletion, which was subsequently reversed with the edit summary stating that it should go through the main AFD process. I am adding it here as there was no subsequent follow-up by the participants in that edit series.

<dd>EVERYTHING in this article is speculation. There is no confirmed director. There are no confirmed cast members. According to IMDB, there have been no announcements concerning this movie since 2005, when Greg Hoffman said in a forum post that the movie was being talked about by Lions Gate Films (as an aside, he passed away a month after making this announcemnt). We have nothing <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> about the movie at this point in time, making this, at least to me, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">a clear case of crystal balling</a>.</dd>
<dd>There is a duplicate article at <a href="../../../s/a/w/Saw_III_f7c4.html" title="Saw III">Saw III</a>, and I would like to see <b>both articles deleted</b>, until a point in time when <b>verifiable</b> information (ie: press releases) concerning the production of this movie can be provided. Failing that, I would have to support a <b>merge and redirect</b> of "Saw 3 movie" to "Saw III".</dd>
<dd>I have taken the liberty of adding a heavily edited deletion notice to the "Saw III" article. If someone else deems it appropriate, nominate the duplicate article for a combined deletion, and replace my edited notice with the proper one. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 04:49, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While this internet phenomenon has gained some popularity since its start the previous month, I think it will be forgotten by the end of February.

<li><b>Keep</b> We cannot delete articles based on whether or not their subjects will still be popular. We aren't psychics. The original nomination for deletion confuses me, and appears to either come out of boredom, spite, or both. It almost seems as if he/she is attempting to rule out any eligibility this video has for remaining in Wiki; how can you tell people not to consider the fact that it has 13,000 Google hits? Consider it this way: An actor or actress who appears in one or two small roles in major Hollywood films, or large roles in one or two obscure indy films, still qualifies for articles in Wiki (ie, Angela Bettis). Their "impact" is no greater than this kid. I also would like to point out that, since this article went up two days ago, nearly 2000 non-Wiki related pages have been added to his "resume" on Google. 2000 pages in three days should tell you something.TimmyBIsCool 23:39, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"...introduced the ability for the players to easily participate in creating the online environment..." Hum, the passage I found there yesterday is still there! My point is, there's no point in creating a separate article for a concept this simple. Whatever terminology different MUDs use for this should be covered in the appropriate MUD driver family articles (eg <a href="../../../l/p/m/LPMud_cd55.html" title="LPMud">LPMud</a>), or respective programming language article (eg <a href="../../../l/p/c/LPC_programming_language_60f0.html" title="LPC programming language">LPC programming language</a>). Though I may have been a little bit too harsh, now that I've woken up and had coffee; I'm not really mad if the article is kept. It's mostly the title and scope that jars me. So I'm only saying <del><b>Weak delete</b>.</del> I'm only swayed to Keep if someone comes up with a better, non-technology-specific title, like "On-line modifiability of MUD game worlds" but not clumsy like that. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 09:53, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, the reason it's titled "OLC" is because that's what it's known as in the MUD community - it's the term I use, and other than "building", it's the only other term I see used by others. Are you proposing a move to "Building (Online games)" or similar? That would include graphical MMORPGs' building systems as well - maybe not a bad thing, as it's basically the same scope, just flashier and less prose. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Pointon_24f4.html" title="User:Sam Pointon">Sam Pointon</a> 13:08, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, if that truly is a term recognized widely - it's just that I've never heard of it, but perhaps I'm just in wrong circles, which admittedly aren't too large =) I'm saying <del><b>Keep</b>,</del> then. Can't hurt much, and one blood-demanding voice isn't going to sway things much anyway.

<p>A band.

<li>Mmm, yes. I see. Alexa can have incredibly biased results, "<i>Alexa rankings do not reflect whether any source material for constructing an encyclopaedia article actually exists. A highly ranked web site may well have nothing written about it, or a poorly ranked web site may well have a lot written about it.</i>" I see what you mean. A poorly ranked website with a lot of notable history and information certainly isn't worth any value. I'm sure you've read our article so far and have obviously come to that conclusion. Even considering we're far from completing the article, you've jumped to the conclusion that it's unworthy. Very professional and cooperative. I thank you. Gordraf

<li>Okay, fair game. I don't want to fight here, I just want to document the accomplishments of the two people who run the website. Frankly, I'm tired. <i>So</i>, I'm just going to ask... is there <i>anything</i> that we <i>can</i> do to improve this article and make it work? I'm willing to cooperate on any level... and if there's nothing that can be done, then okay. You have my blessing to just wipe this whole thing. I've tried my hardest, and so have a few others, to give the article a neutral, fair point of view without making it look like an advertisement or what-have-you. We're not looking for visitors... we get enough of those every week on the forums. Hmm... if not an entire article, what about merging what we <i>have</i> written up with their respective games? And could we have forwarding links in <i>this</i> article to these games and their appropriate subsections? Would that work? So at the very least, if someone types in "The Rare Witch Project", they can still find things out in the linked game articles. Is that resonable?&#160;:) Gordraf
<ul>
<li>I'm just follwing the guidelines, I've no idea about the community surrounding RareWare, but I guess you could throw something in at <a href="../../../r/a/r/Rare_%28company%29.html" title="Rare (company)">Rareware</a>, under a "Fanbase" subheader, I think it would do much better there. <a href="../../../o/b/l/User%7EObli_4ce1.html" title="User:Obli"><font color="#FF0000">O</font></a><a href="../../../o/b/l/User%7EObli_4ce1.html" title="User:Obli">bli</a> (<a href="../../../o/b/l/User_talk%7EObli_47c1.html" title="User talk:Obli">Talk</a>) 21:56, 19 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hmm, not bad. Would it be a good idea to discuss it first on the Rareware page? I wouldn't want to just stick things in and start another dispute. I don't know... maybe we should just can this article and forget about it. --Gordraf 22:13, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is <i>the</i> site for anything related to the game company Rareware. This site is the only site that the game company has ever mentioned on their website. If the Rare Witch Project doesn't qualify for a wikipedia page then wikipedia isn't worth the space it takes up. --Dbzfan 11:27, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>From the article: "the site is famous within the Rareware community..." Okay, well, I do more gaming offline than online, but I've never heard of Rareware nor these games and mod tools. Neither has the most active online gamer and modder who I know. So I have to judge by the methods I have available, such as Alexa and Google. Neither can be used to deny notability, but in this subject matter, they're most likely to show notability if it exists. For Roman governors of Egypt in the second century, they're less meaningful search methods, but this is a website about online gaming. For The Rare Witch Project, they don't show enough to get my "keep" vote. Game-related fansites are generally not nearly as notable as their small community of fans would like to think. <b>Delete</b> per WP:WEB. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 20:44, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> Ruby, you bring up an excellent point that I brought up elsewhere, but didn't include here because it's not something that gets an article deleted on Wikipedia. To the contrary, the filthier and more degrading to humanity it is, the more likely it is to stay, <i>even after it has been transwikied.</i> What's relevant is that this is an example of what Wikipedia is not, and all of you who are voting to keep this are either appallingly ignorant of the promulgated deletion policies, too dense to understand them, or don't really know what an encyclopedia is. I'm guessing that you just don't know the difference between a slang dictionary and an encyclopedia. All of you who voted to keep this nonsense should be thankful to all the Latinos out there who have let this joke continue to exist. If this were called an "African Buttpicker" or a "Dirty Jewboy," or a "Faggot 'Stache," there would be no question about how inappropriate it is. What if this were your name attached to this act? Would you still think it should be included in an encyclopedia? I'm realizing more and more that dicdefs get saved from deletion all the time because they appeal to a certain mindset, and the policy on Wikipedia not being a dictionary probably needs to be changed to reflect common practice. Apparently, Wikipedia is one of the largest repositories of filthy jokes on the Internet, and editors of Wikipedia like it that way. Wikipedia is really a bloated and pretentious collection of advertisements, conceits, PR blurbs, wacky politics, ephemera, base perversions, and irrelevant pop culture with frequent delusions of grandeur. This, right here, is the biggest hindrance to Wikipedia ever attaining any widespread acceptance, so all of you had better keep it on the QT as long as you can. How are you going to feel when some concerned parents group finds out that Wikipedia not only condones, but encourages disgusting shit jokes? How would you feel if you wrote it? I hope you'll be very proud of your work. You have every right to feel special and righteous for letting the truth be told about the Dirty Sanchez. And don't forget the Tossed Salad. Type <a href="../../../t/o/s/Tossed_salad.html" title="Tossed salad">Tossed salad</a> into Wikipedia, and you get to find out that it's another phrase for licking someone's asshole <i>before</i> you find out what kind of salad it is! I can imagine there will be a strong unilateral decision made to purge this encyclopedia of ridiculous crap like the Dirty Sanchez when enough concerned parents object. Don't underestimate the ferocity and power of parents who think that their children are in danger. If they can get laws changed to reflect their fears, they can certainly ban Wikipedia from school computers. All they have to do is put the fear of God in school superintendents, and things will change. It's only a matter of time. BrianGCrawfordMA 23:50, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment.</b> I'm not advocating censorship. I'm arguing my case for deletion because "Dirty Sanchez" is clearly a transwikied dictionary definition, and this is why I feel it must be deleted. Maybe you let my hatred for gratuitous obscenity confuse you before you washed your hands of the matter and decided you wouldn't be responsible. It shows a special kind of well-developed hypocrisy to cite Wikipedia policy supporting your position while blindingly ignoring the policy about what Wikipedia is not.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Things may change, but it won't be because of the nominator, and it won't be today. Until such a time as things *do* change, Wikipedia provides a <i>very broad</i> strata of knowledge and information, which will never be acceptable to <i>everyone</i>. All we can do is make it as useful as possible, for now and for the future. I can appreciate what the nominator wants, but it's not consistent with the goals of Wikipedia, nor should it be. I hope they'll continue to edit Wikipedia though -- like any Internet community, Wikipedia has some callow people here and there, and balance is always welcome. <b><a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_9077.html" title="User:Adrian"><font color="#000000">A</font></a></b><font color="#646060">drian</font> <b><a href="../../../a/d/r/User_talk%7EAdrian_59cc.html" title="User talk:Adrian"><font color="#000000">L</font></a></b><font color="#646060">amo</font> <b><font color="#F660AB">··</font></b> 04:54, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I corrected a couple of things. You might want to reconsider deleting the article as it provides a proof of the formula used in the regression analysis article. Please tell me what you think. Regards, Deimos 28 13:58, 6 February 2006 (UTC).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It now says: "In this paragraph we first show that under the Gauss-Markov assumptions, the linear regression problem can be seen as a projection. This will give us a motivation for chosing an optimization criterion from which we will then derive the expression of the least-squares estimator." That looks to me as if it's intended to prove the <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gauss-Markov_theorem_195f.html" title="Gauss-Markov theorem">Gauss-Markov theorem</a>. But the whole thing is so badly written that it will take me a while to find out if that's really the intent. If it is, it's very badly done; the proof of the Gauss-Markov theorem is much simpler than any of what's written on this page. The parts that are clearly comprehensible seem written in a way that will make it incomprehensible to anyone who does not already know this material, and they bring in things that are not relevant to that purpose. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 21:14, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>No, the aim is not to prove the Gauss-Markov theorem. I actually give a link to the Gauss-Markov theorem article in the conclusion. I really don't know how to state more plainly what this article is about than I have in its introduction:</li>
</ul>

<dd>(1) give a motivation for the use of least-squares (why choose this particular criterion? What are its advantages?),</dd>
<dd>(2) derive the expression of the least-squares estimator.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have trouble seeing where you can see me making a proof of the Gauss-Markov theorem in either (1) or (2). It's true that the Gauss-Markov theorem gives the least-squares estimator one of its great strengths, but appart from that, I don't mention this theorem at all. As for the expression of the least-squares coefficients, it is not necessary to go through the proof of the Gauss-Markov theorem to derive it. If something is wrong with this article, I am more than happy to correct it. You say some parts are "clearly comprehensible": I am more interested in knowing what parts you think are not understandable. The article obviously makes perfect sense to me as I've written it: could you please pinpoint what you think is gibberish? Deimos 28 00:17, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Gauss-Markov theorem is often proposed as an answer to the question "why use least squares"? You stated the assumptions of that theorem. I don't see you "making a proof of the Gauss-Markov theorem" nor a proof of anything else, yet. But when you start with the Gauss-Markov assumptions, and say your trying to motivate this method, that sounds a lot like intent to prove the Gauss-Markov theorem. As for deriving the expression of the least-squares estimator, probability theory is not involved in that at all. It's just linear algebra. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 01:01, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I show in the article, the Gauss-Markov theorem is not the only motivation for least-squares. As can also be seen in the article, I do not use probability theory to prove the expression of the estimator. However, I do use probability theory to prove that the regression problem is equivalent to an orthogonal projection given the scalar product <img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/5/e/25eea50660a1f29d81c89edfcc4868ad.png" alt="\langle X,Y\rangle:=\mathbb{E}[XY]" />. This is, I think, a fairly natural way to introduce least-squares and the main aim of this article. The least-squares estimator is simply an estimation of an orthogonal projection, using the Euclidean scalar product in <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/0/c/30c28f76ef7517dbd19df4d4c683dbe6.png" alt="\mathbb{R}^n" /> instead of the one defined for random variables. The results of the Gauss-Markov theorem is indeed the main asset of this method, but it does not provide a way to construct the estimator. I state the hypothesis and refer to the Gauss-Markov theorem because it provides both a main asset and a main limitation of the leaast-squares estimator. Deimos 28 00:06, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I also wrote most of the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regression_analysis.html" title="Regression analysis">regression analysis</a> article. I made this a separate article because I think it is a special case of regression. Although the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linear_regression.html" title="Linear regression">linear regression</a> article is, I think, a good introduction, it does not provide a proof for the expression of the least-squares estimator and is not very rigorous: the random variables are not defined (indeed, I think the expression "random variable" is not mentioned once in the article), and it restricts itself to the case of first degree polynomial regression. I think it is fine for people with little mathematical knowledge and that the article should stay this way. However, nowhere else that I am aware of (be it in the <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gauss-Markov_theorem_195f.html" title="Gauss-Markov theorem">Gauss-Markov theorem</a> article or in the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linear_regression.html" title="Linear regression">linear regression</a> article) do we find a proof for the general expression of the least-square estimator. Also, I think it is very important to mention the geometrical interpretation (i.e. seeing the regression as an orthogonal projection): indeed, it is the same kind of reasoning as used in Fourier analysis for example. It shows why we are minimizing the sum of squares instead of (for example) the sum of the absolute values. I think it is important to distinguish between people who just need some simple formula they can apply without having all the theoretical details and those who wish to study the problem in more depth. This article (like some of the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regression_analysis.html" title="Regression analysis">regression analysis</a> article) is written for the latter.

<dd><b>Further comment</b>. The page under discussion for deletion contains numerous specific instances of celebrities who took part in Republican politics directly, as candidates, officeholders, party convention delegates, etc. If this page is to be deleted, let's at least give enough time to move that information over to List of celebrities with links to the U.S. Republican Party, so the data isn't lost. <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKestenbaum_5f93.html" title="User:Kestenbaum">Kestenbaum</a> 06:00, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Try looking at <a href="http://www.wikicities.com/wiki/Wikicities" class="external text" title="http://www.wikicities.com/wiki/Wikicities" rel="nofollow">Wikicities</a>. In wikipedia notability is an important condition, if we were not to limit the inclusion of articles the size of the project would grow beyond what we would be able to host and maintain, for instance every group of kids who decided to form a band, and there are many millions of books. The various projects in wikicities do not all have such notability requirements. There are many other sites on the internet which will be more inclusive of cookbooks than wikipedia. --<a href="../../../p/f/a/User%7EPfafrich_c43f.html" title="User:Pfafrich">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../p/f/a/User_talk%7EPfafrich_40ba.html" title="User talk:Pfafrich">talk</a>) 11:21, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Perhaps there should be a guideline for cookbooks? I have a great many cookbooks in my collection (I suspect it would be considered mid-sized) and altogether very few of them are notable enough for Wikipedia. Of those that I would say are, they are thunderously influential books created by cookbook authors who are not only influential but truly define the fields they work in (Escoffier, Julia Child, Irma Rombauer), or books of great historical interest (Art of Cookery). Others are books by people who in and of themselves are notable (Alton Brown, Craig Claiborne) but have not produced works that are notable in and of themselves. I can't see having in Wikipedia, not only a book about a semi-obscure regional American dish, but not even the best-known book on the subject. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 04:14, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nexis contains alternative newspapers as well, and it appears this isn't even getting non-mainstream press coverage. The OC Weekly, LA Weekly, Village Voice, Houston Press, Miami New Times and others even manage to get "steak" and "blowjob" into the same article, but unfortunately not in any way that involves this topic. For example, The OC Weekly printed the line "Saying Sid's is a great place because you can get a piece of crap steak for 10 bucks is like bragging about getting a $5 blowjob from a homeless crack addict with trench mouth (who happens to be a relative)." I doubt the reason they haven't covered this holiday is just because it has a naughty word in its name. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 07:09, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think the big question is, even as more people might hear about it, is anyone actually practicing this "holiday"? If no one, or barely anyone, is actually practicing it, then it can't be considered more than the slightly humorous joke it was meant to be. SteveJ2006 06:03, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have personally celebrated this day with my partner for several years now - hey, she would prefer a steak and some oral to a bunch of flowers too... As far as I am aware there is no restriction on (for instance) religious holidays to require a certain threshold of participants before it "sufficiently exists" to warrant inclusion and it seems highly dismissive to attempt to apply such arbitrary heuristics to this content. Secondly, even if only a very small group (or indeed no-one) observe this holiday then it still does not undermine the fact that this day was created and promoted by Tom Birdsey, has an independent website and a large amount of existing references - I would note the issues and disputes, but would not censor what I perceive as legitimate content. (An aside - Neologism is not an argument for deletion per se as the content guidelines acknowledge. Indeed wikipedias own definition states "Neologisms are especially useful in identifying inventions, new phenomena, or old ideas which have taken on a new cultural context."). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 61.95.35.98 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_61.95.35.98_6e35.html" title="Special:Contributions/61.95.35.98">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'd like to point out first I am of the female persuasion and am all for s&amp;bj day in general and as such feel it should be kept. It's definitely more fun (and generally cheaper) tha Valentines Day and instead of focussing on pointless poems, gives the reciever some sustenance and fun. Oh and there's noit can't be reciprocal, far as I know, so other women shouldn't be unhappy about it. Besides, the simple fact that it has incited so much conversation from guests as well as regular wikipedia peeps suggests that it does carry cultural significance and should be kept in some form, even if it is only as the S&amp;BJ Day Debate/Controversy.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Metropolitan90 makes a valid point. The school article may meet <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, but not in its present bundled form here (and also keep in mind that this should not be a primary source for information, such as for reports, as that is not a function of Wikipedia). Also, yes, Wikipedia does have articles on churches (see <i>Category:Churches</i>). I just randomly clicked on <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_of_All_Saints_Basilica_a491.html" title="Queen of All Saints Basilica">one</a> and saw that "[i]t was elevated to become a basilica by Pope John XXIII"... similar statements are made in the other churches' articles to indicate why most if not all of those are notable, whether it is number of members, status within the organization, independently notable pastor/reverend, historical value, or whatnot. This one, objectively, does not have this information, and it is likely because it does not qualify. (Ironically, there is another "Our Savior Lutheran Church" and attached school down the street from me... but of course that does not and should not deserve an article either.) --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 21:08, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, an administrator will review this discussion about 5 days after it began. He does not count votes as such, but he will try to assess whether the consensus of the wikipedia community is that this article should be deleted. If so, the article disappears, and thereafter it will be "speedied" (deleted on sight) if anyone tries to recreate it. At the moment I suspect he would conclude in favour of "delete" because almost all established wikipedians who have made a comment here are in favour of deleting. Most people voting keep appear to be new, which suggests that they are <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESockpuppet_ef0b.html" title="WP:Sockpuppet">sockpuppets</a>, or possibly members of the congregation who have come here to sway the ballot. There is no reason to be dismayed if the article goes. Everyone here is still welcome at wikipedia. It is simply that in building an encyclopedia you must must draw a line on what information is worthy of inclusion, and as a matter of practicality we cannot maintain an article for each of the hundreds of thousands of churches in the world. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyJones_d8f9.html" title="User:AndyJones">AndyJones</a> 23:05, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Parys Sylver was born Maurice Smith in the summer of July in 1987. A young prodigy who wrote his books before he was out of high school. One of his most noted books was High School Whore, which is a tale of a girl named Summer who is running for prom queen. Another, more erotic and daring books was the Blood Angel, in which Parys tells the story of Aryk Isaac Killen, a pre-Civil War vampire. Both books have gained minor success on Lulu.com. But another book which is getting a lot of attention is his poetry collection called Words Of Beauty. Parys is also known for writing music.</dd>
