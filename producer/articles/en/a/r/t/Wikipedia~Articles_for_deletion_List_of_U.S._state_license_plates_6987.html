<p>Just a collection of images and Wikipedia is not a repository for images. Also, most of the images are tagged incorrectly as PD-US or CopyrightFreeUse, whereas the design is probably copyright of the state that issues it. Several images have no source and try to claim fair use. Fair use would not apply for putting the image in a list. <a href="../../../n/v/8/User%7ENv8200p_b2e9.html" title="User:Nv8200p">Nv8200p</a> <a href="../../../n/v/8/User_talk%7ENv8200p_4d2d.html" title="User talk:Nv8200p">talk</a> 13:50, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Even if this article is image focused, doesn't mean it's not encyclopedic in nature. Images are used in print encyclopedias and on wikipedia to convey what words cannot. In the case of liscence plates no matter how detailed the description it's not as good as having a picture. Also, in the fashion that greek and roman coins have come to be culturally important so are liscence plates, they are a piece of human civilization with extreme longiveity and most definately merits this article. 67.119.124.137 00:45, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, each state can legislate whether their material is copyrighted or not. Most states websites and media they produce are copyrighted.

<li><b>Delete</b>. When the images are deleted for being copyvios, this will be a {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-empty_b1c9.html" title="Template:Db-empty">db-empty</a>}}.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I think the "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_mirror_or_a_repository_of_links.2C_images.2C_or_media_files" title="WP:NOT">Wiki is not a repository for images</a>" argument is being misused here. There are a lot of "repositories for images" on Wikipedia (like <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flags_of_the_U.S._states_e889.html" title="Flags of the U.S. states">Flags of the U.S. states</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seals_of_the_U.S._states_f4e6.html" title="Seals of the U.S. states">Seals of the U.S. states</a>, etc.) and these lists are certainly encyclopedic. Also, the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_mirror_or_a_repository_of_links.2C_images.2C_or_media_files" title="WP:NOT">IS NOT</a> policy states that wiki is not a "Collections of photographs or media files with <i><b>no text to go with the articles</b></i>." (emphasis added) This article has as much text as the flag and seal articles (in fact it has more than the seal article). Sure, I would like to have each license explained (and I'll probably add that when I have time) but not having a thorough explanation is not a valid reason to delete. Now, the matter of copyright is an ENTIRELY different discussion and it should be handled elsewhere and on a per image basis. - <a href="../../../e/k/t/User%7EEktar_4af5.html" title="User:Ektar">Ektar</a> 17:13, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is a useful resource and not an "image Gallery". Has any attempt been made to identify if any of the states consider their plate designs as being PD, or is there an assumption being made because somebody just wants to see the page terminated?
<div class="floatleft"><span><a href="../../../w/o/r/Image%7EWorldfair.jpg_27c8.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/b/b0/Worldfair.jpg/150px-Worldfair.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="142" longdesc="../../../w/o/r/Image%7EWorldfair.jpg_27c8.html" /></a></span></div>
I question the copyright issue: so long as the plate images are created by the uploader and dont come directly from the DMV's website - i.e. a photograph of a plate in situ etc. (admittedly most of these are not of plates in situ), surely they would be ok? With photos of issued plates the plate itself is going to be copyright, but is an image of it really a violation of that copyright? Is this picture I have included here in violation of copyright? The historical marker is was designed and made by the state, the text is surely copyright, but I took the picture of it and (if I hadnt donated it to this site) would claim full rights... <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickmaguire_79b7.html" title="User:Mickmaguire">Mickmaguire</a> 03:50, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The status of the images is not an issue in keeping this article. If an image has an issue there is a process to have it deleted and it can be replaced by one without problems. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 02:39, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. While this may well be a useful resource, that in itself is not a reason for it to be in Wikipedia. There are many types of useful resource which we do not include: telephone directories are useful, but we do not include lists of phone numbers; marriage registers are useful, but we do not list every wedding in the world; dictionaries are very useful, but we do not include mere dictionary definitions. The question is not "is this useful", but "is this an encyclopedia article?" And the answer is, "no, this is not an encyclopedia article, it is a collection of pictures". Therefore, we should not keep it. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 16:38, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
