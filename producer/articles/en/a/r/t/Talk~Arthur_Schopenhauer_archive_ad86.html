<p>Ahh, dear friends of philosophy,</p>
<p>I really do have problems to understand most of the discussions below. Does it really matter if Schopenhauer or Einstein were of German "origin"&#160;? Their mothertongue, and more important, their motherwit was German, but both their _thoughts_ were _universal_. So why should we quarrel about (histo-geographical) questions like "where did he come from" and "where did he go to"&#160;? Everyone expresses his thoughts in the language that he feels is the closest to him and his thoughts. So, please, calm down and start to think about your own language, and situation. (Guess what my closest language is&#160;;)</p>

<p>Which revolution? --MichaelTinkler</p>
<p>He might be referring to happenings in Frankfurt/Germany in 1848. I don't know much about this, but there was some form of revolts originating in the working class at the time. Among the demands were freedom of the press, freedom of assembly etc. I'm not sure about what Schopenhauer's philosophy gained from this, but he himself was strongly opposed to the revolution (and afraid of his possessions). Just had a brief look at Rudiger Safranski's "Schopenhauer and the wild years of philosophy". I'll try updating this entry when I get some time to freshen up my knowledge a bit. --LarsErikKolden</p>
<hr />
<p>Regarding the influence from Schelling, could someone please enlighten me? As far as I have read in a couple of biographies, Schelling was a member of Schopenhauer's hate trio, namely Schelling, Fichte and Hegel. It might be that Schopenhauer read Schelling and had some common views with the German idealists, but I'd be surprised if this influence wasn't mainly from Kant (and actually Plato, but that goes for most of the German philosophers, I guess). I see now that Schelling also had a conception of an irrational will, but only as a part of the Deity, which is something quite different than the role it plays in Schopenhauer's philosophy. --LarsErikKolden</p>

After the 1st partition of Poland, in which the Prussian seized the surroundings of Gdañsk, Joanna Schopenhauer, mother of the philosopher, wrote: "At this morning calamity has fallen like vampyre on my native city, deemed to disaster, and sucked its marrow for long years till the ultimate dilapidation".</p>

<p>His father, Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer, the youngest of a family to which the mother had brought the germs of mental malady, was a man of strong will and originality, and so proud of the independence of his native town that when Danzig in 1793 surrendered to the Prussians he and his whole establishment withdrew to Hamburg~ <a href="../../../c/a/u/User%7ECautious_0785.html" title="User:Cautious">Cautious</a> 13:47, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to the article on <a href="../../../g/d/a/Gdansk.html" title="Gdansk">Gdansk</a>, which is apparently the subject of a current edit war, from <a href="../../../1/7/7/1772.html" title="1772">1772</a> to <a href="../../../1/7/9/1793.html" title="1793">1793</a> Gdansk was a free and independent city, apparently governed by ethnic Germans, and surrounded by <a href="../../../p/r/u/Prussia.html" title="Prussia">Prussia</a>. It was not part of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a> when Schopenhauer was born. Whatever the city's relations were with the former Poland, that particular polity was on its last legs in the late 18th century, and disappeared for quite some time in 1793. The current phrasing that puts the city in "what is now Poland" strikes me as the best way to put that complicated business. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:58, 21 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, does it mean that we should name all people born in the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">USSR</a> after <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> as born in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> just because that country was on its' last legs? <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibutt</a> 01:02, 22 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My understanding is that Danzig had been governed by its German-speaking elites for centuries before the first partition in 1772. After the first partition, this situation continued, but the juridical position as officially part of the Kingdom of Poland remained unchanged. But this may be incorrect. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 02:15, 22 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem with the article as it currently stands is that to someone who is unaware that Gdansk is Danzig, it suggests that Schopenhauer was born in Gdansk, but that his family fled from somewhere else. I know I am asking for it by even commenting, or saying anything other than that I wish the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curse.html" title="Curse">accursèd</a> city would be swallowed up by a giant <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinkhole.html" title="Sinkhole">sinkhole</a> so that we can methodically blot out any records of its ever having existed, but it seems to me that a subtler solution is needed here than mechanically applying one name or the other based on the date. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 00:56, 15 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I concur. Personally, I think the city is essentially called "Danzig" for the whole period 1308-1945, and Wikipedia should refer to it as such. But I don't think that'll fly. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 00:59, 15 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, that's against the compromise we reached at <a href="../../../g/d/a/Talk%7EGdansk_7e23.html" title="Talk:Gdansk">Talk:Gdansk</a>. Also, you moved the article a year backwards. I suggest we simply added cross-links to both names (born in [[Danzig|Gdansk]], fled from [[Gdansk|Danzig]]). This way:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Anyone will have an opportunity to check what is the city in question</li>
<li>The explanation will be there, one would only have to point his mouse over the link to get a hint.</li>

<p>My understanding was that the compromise was that we use <i>both</i> names, but primarily "Gdansk". So what's wrong with "Gdansk (Danzig)" in the first use? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 01:56, 15 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>To say that Schopenhauer was Polish born and that he was born in Gdank is very misleading. He was an enthnic German and that area was dominated by Prussia and later controlled by it. When Prussia received it, the Schopenhauers didn't move to Poland, they moved to Germany. Schopenhauer was a German, he wrote in German, studied in Germany, was born of German parents, lived and died in Germany. Erwin Rommel's wife was also born in Gdansk, and I doubt that Rommel would have married a Pole. Was this article written by a Polish nationalist, if there is such a thing?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">big barrel o' POV</span></h2>
<p>The last section "Common Misconceptions" needs a going over imo.</p>
<p>It seems to gradually shift from NPOV, to that of a book review, and finally to what sounds like a desperate attempt to clear Schopenhauer's name.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Nietzsche seems to have made this misinterpretation and many gain a distorted view of Schopenhauer from reading Nietzsche"</li>
<li>"Nietzsche also claimed that Schopenhauer did not recognise that suffering had a redemptive quality, yet his recognition of this seems blatantly clear in part 4 of The World as Will and Representation."</li>
<li>"Russell produced a very poor article on Schopenhauer in his History of Western Philosophy."</li>
<li>"It has often been thought that Schopenhauer believed in solipsism. He actually said that solipsism could only be believed by those in a madhouse."</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>-- sidd</p>
<p>I've altered it a little bit, as regards the last two points. I don't think that the section was overly opinionated; Schopenhauer is someone who has been badly misrepresented for a long time. Perhaps, calling Bertrand Russell's article "poor" is inappropriate, but it is not wrong to say that his article was "inaccurate": check for yourself. As for the solipsism bit, I've added a quote to justify the fact that Schopenhauer was not a solipsist, which I always thought was an odd misinterpretation of him. Ed</p>
<p><br />
...this is mistaken. russell claimed that schopenhauer was wrong in equating his asceticism with christian asceticism, not that schopenhauer never equated them. reread the essay, if you like. anyway, i've deleted the section.</p>

<hr />
<p>During Schopenhauer's lifetime, the city in which he was born was a predominantly German-speaking city called Danzig, which is the name by which it was known everywhere outside the Slavic world until after the territorial changes of 1945. As a result of colonization begun by the Teutonic Order, the city had been predominantly German since at least the 15th century, although the original settlement in the 10th century was Slavonic or Polish.</p>
<p>The Polish-American historian Oscar Halecki, in "A History of Poland" (1992), discussing relations between the Teutonic Order and the Polish Crown, writes that in 1457: "The German element predominated in … the town of Danzig, in which the majority of the population was at this epoch already German...."</p>
<p>It is true that Danazig, though ethnically German, was under Polish overloardship in the 16th and 17th centuries, but this did not change its essentially German ethnic composition, which continued into recent history. During Schopenhauer's lifetime, Danzig was part of the Kingdom of Prussia, the north-German state that was to unite Germany in 1870. Before the Second World War, the Free City of Danzig, as it was constituted between the world wars, was 96 percent German, according to figures accepted by the League of Nations.</p>
<p>To say that Schopenhauer was "born in Gdansk, Poland," is totally erroneous, because at the time the city was not part of Poland and was not called Gdansk -- except by Polish nationalists. Schopenhauer himself, of course, was German and wrote in German.</p>
<p>One can no more say Schopenhauer was "born in Gdansk, Poland," than one can say Kant was "born in Kaliningrad, Russia," since during Kant's lifetime (1724-1804), and until 1945-46, the city was Königsberg, Prussia, part of Germany.</p>

<p>The basic problem with saying that he was born "in Gdansk, Poland" -- which seems to be what whoever edits this passage rigidly insists on -- is that English speakers are likely to get the impression that Schopenauer was Polish.</p>
<p>I fail to understand why an entry about someone who lived in a different historical era has to be written using geographic refernces that pertain only to the current era. This Wikipedia policy seems to be imposed on us English speakers by those who have an agenda that has nothing to do with historical accuracy.</p>
<p>If for some reason the name of my hometown, Minneapolis, were changed to "Water City," I would not stop saying I grew up in Minneapolis. Similarly, Schopenhauer was not born in "Gdansk, Poland," he was born in Danzig (like Daniel Fahrenheit, like Gunter Grass, etc., etc.).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Schopenhauer would have called himself German</span></h2>
<p>The problem with saying he came from what we now call Poland, is because Schopenhauer called it Germany. Schopenhauer was a German, he came from Danzig. Danzig, today, is called Gdansk, Poland. Just because things were drawn up wrong (yes, an opinion, but this is a discussion page) after the war doesn't change Schopenhauer's heritage.</p>

<dd>This is incorrect. In 1788, Danzig/Gdansk was, in fact, still officially part of Poland, although it was an enclave not connected to the rest of Poland. It would remain so until 1793, when it was annexed by Prussia in the 2nd partition. Since it was, even as part of Poland, inhabited by ethnic Germans who called it something more like 'Danzig' than like 'Gdansk', I think "Danzig" is more appropriate, but you're overstating the case. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 21:41, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Saying that Schopenhauer was born in Gdansk, Poland, is obfuscation, even though it may be argued that the city -- then populated by Germans and known as Danzig -- was "part of Poland" in legal sense, since it was not yet politically part of Prussia.</p>
<p>Old Danzig was within the geogaphic realm of Germanness -- what the Germans call Deutschtum -- at the time, and Schopenhauer and his family most certainly considered themselves German. If the Poles wish to say he was born in Gdansk, Poland, let them have their say on the POLISH Wikipedia -- thereby salving their nationalistic touchiness -- but not here. This is an English-speakers' page, and as has been noted repeatedly elsewhere on Wiki, the city in question was known throughout the Western world as Danzig until 1945-46, when it was transformed by the ethnic cleansing of war and expulsions, and the settlment of Polish newcomers, into the Polish city of Gdansk.</p>
<p>The fact that the Poles historically always referred to the city as Gdansk, even when it was inhabited by Germans, does not change the fact that it was generally known as Danzig during Schopenhauer's lifetime. Ditto for Kant and Königsberg / Kaliningrad -- though I don't think any Russians are so obtuse as to argue that Kant was born in "Kaliningrad, Russia." Good grief!</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Compromise attempt</span></h2>
<p>There seem to be a few points of dispute on this page: (1) Schopenhauer's nationality, (2) The name of his birthplace, (3) The ethnic mix of his birthplace. As with most disputes, if there is a controversy, it should be mentioned on the article page.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pretty much all references call him a German Philosopher, including <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9066208&amp;query=Schopenhauer&amp;ct=" class="external text" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9066208&amp;query=Schopenhauer&amp;ct=" rel="nofollow">encyclopedia britannica</a> and the polish wikipedia.</li>
<li>I am OK with calling it GDansk, if Danzig is also mentined in brackets or so. Danzig is still commonly used in English, this would help people googling for topics related to Danzig. Also, at that time the city was commonly known under that name.</li>
<li>The City seems to have a large german population at that time, of which Schopenhauer was most likely a part of. This should be mentioned in the article, maybe not necessarily in the intro paragraph, but maybe in the <i>Life</i> section. This would be helpful for other users to understand where Schopenhauer came from.<br /></li>

<dd>My preference would be that the city name be <i>Danzig</i>, everywhere, largely because this is also the <b>English</b> name of the city, contains no characters untypeable on a standard English language keyboard, and creates fewer pronunciation issues than Gdansk. The trouble would appear to arise with Polish nationalists, who are eager to impose their spelling. Besides, by rights the whole Baltic coastline should belong to <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> anyways. Schopenhauer's works suggest that he read English, French, Spanish, and Latin; they give no evidence that he read Polish, but then again I'm not sure that there was a great deal of Polish literature in print in the early 19th century. Still, it warms my heart that regard for Schopenhauer is so high that folks are eager to claim him for their ethnic group; for too long his philosophy was out of fashion.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Halibutt's sidenote</span></h2>
<p>Sorry but I can't resist commenting on Senor Halibutt's sly comment above. Dear esteemed Halibutt: I am quite impressed with your language skills, as I've said elsewhere, but not with your skill at logic. You are Polish not because you can write a thesis in Polish (nor does writing one in Spanish make you Spanish); you are Polish because you grew up speaking Polish with your parents -- it was the language you learned first and foremost, your mother tongue. Also, of course, you are Polish because you grew up in Poland -- BUT -- Suppose for a moment that you had grown up in an ethnically Polish city that for various historical reasons happened at the time to be part of Germany politically? Understand, in this scenario you still would have grown up learning Polish as your first language in the the environment of a Polish family, friends, school, etc., but inside Germany. Now, would that have made you German? Naturlich nicht -- not unless you decided on your own to adopt German nationality, speak German, Germanize your name, and so forth; at that point, you might be termed a Polish-German. (Not, of course, that you ever would do such a thing!)</p>
<p>In the U.S., we have a long history of Polish-Americans, German-Americans, Italian-Americans, etc. These are people who came from one culture and adopted, or adapted themselves to, another. By contrast, consider the case of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who lived in the U.S. for 17 years but never learned English and never adopted American ways. He remained Russian and ultimately returned to Russia.</p>
<p>Now, as far as I'm aware, Schopenhauer never adopoted Polish nationality, never wrote in Polish, and so on. (Ditto for Gunter Grass, also born in what then was Danzig; who was expelled from Danzig, and who today lives in ... Lubeck, I believe.) They both are obviously German personages, though both may be said to have been born in a place to which Poland had some political title at the time of their births (a less clear one in the case of Grass, who was born in 1927 in what then called itself the Freie Stadt Danzig).</p>
<p>But of course, this whole discussion really has nothing to do with Schopenhauer or anyone else born in Danzig; it has to do with the history of Danzig, a city which no longer exists, having been superseded by Gdansk, a different city in the same location. The insistence by some Poles that the Danzig that existed for roughly 600 years, until 1945, should always be referred to as Gdansk because that has been the name of its successor city since 1945 makes as much sense logically as your playful suggestion above that writing a thesis in Spanish makes you Spanish. Naming the city Gdansk and peopling it with Poles who call it Gdansk does not make the former city of Danzig Gdansk retroactively, before 1945. (And don't start in about how Poles always called it Gdansk; that's not the point.)</p>
<p>You yourself have acknowledged in communications to me that you realize old Danzig was predominantly German, even when part of Poland juridically before 1795. Why not tell it like it was in a supposed "encyclopedia" entry? Why obfuscate? Why obscure? It's history! What's done is done! Just be honest about it! Then move on with glorious Gdansk (pardon my lack of accent marks) into the glorious Polish future as part of united EUROPE! Which, by the way, includes Germany.</p>

<dd>Dear Sca, apparently I forgot to make it clear enough: I have no intention of joining this discussion. I have my views on Polish nationality (as opposed to Polish ethnicity), which are probably the results of my own background. However, I don't care much about how the nationality or ethnicity of Schopenhauer is explained in this article. I've read most of his works and I must say I didn't like his style.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My comment above was just another example of my favourite game: nitpicking. If you didn't like my example - here's another one. My great-grandpa was born in Poland, near a small town of Pułtusk (70 km north of Warsaw). He barely spoke Polish since he was a Jew, probably of Armenian roots. Also, the city at that time belonged to Russia. So, we can say that he was Russian-born. We might also say that he was a Pole. Finally, he was a Jew. Is there a contradiction between those statements? Not at all. In my humble opionion, the Polish ethnicity is not the <i>sine qua non</i> necessity to be a Pole. But this is getting OT.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to Schopenhauer - I believe his case is very similar to that of my grandpa: he was born in Poland (like it or not, the city's inhabitants themselves decided to join Poland). He was born to a German family. He was born to a family of Dutch descent. So he was a Pole and a German and, if he felt so, a Dutch as well. Or, if you prefer a different wording, to me he was a Polish-born German philosopher of Dutch descent. For me there's no contradiction between those statements.</dd>

<dd>Sorry that I wrote my two earlier comments in the "Grobian" Schopenhauer style, which he is famous for to have used in his works when writing about his favourite philosophical 'enemy' Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. I have a rather good idea of both Hegel's and Schopenhauer's works (in the original German language, which, by the way, may also answer the question which language is the most familiar and closest to me). A typo is also to be corrected: please read 24 "years" instead of "hours". As I am a fundamentally free mind, I will always have severe problems with "protected" entries within the Wikipedia, especially if such an entry is about Schopenhauer. Please note that even the entry about "Adolf Hitler" within the English Wiki is (as up to this moment) freely editable. (Nota bene: The entry about Hitler in the German Wiki is currently "protected", for which reason I have written a comment in the relevant talk page, which, of course, is in German...).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I ask you: How can it be that, in the English Wikipedia, the entry about Arthur Schopenhauer is _protected_, while the entry about Adolf Hitler is freely editable&#160;? Would you call this a problem of the contributors or a problem of the administrator&#160;? I leave the answer to the readers of these lines.</dd>

<dd>Apology accepted. Please be more careful in the future. As for protection: I don't like it either. But protection is sometimes necessary to resolve disputes. In this case, there was a constant adding and removing of the mentioning Danzig, which was not leading anywhere. Hence I requested protection to stop the revert war, and to force interested parties to join a discussion here on the talk page. A compromise is currently worked out, and hopefully in the near future the page can be unprotected. en:[[Adolf Hitler] is not protected, because there does not seem to be a revert war, only occasional vandalism. The german page may have gotten more vandalism and biased edits, making a protection necessary. A protection is always on a case by case basis.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">More compromise attempts</span></h2>
<p>Let me suggest a modest solution to this entire unfortunate and disturbing imbroglio: Let's retroactively declare Schopenhauer to have been a "Prussian philosopher." Poles could take heart in this terminology by thinking of Royal Prussia, while Germans could heave a sigh of relief by reflecting upon Prussia's German ethos. This solution has the added virtue of classifying him as a member of an entity that hasn't existed for some time, and from which there can be no futher expressions of vox populi, since the Prussians strictly speaking are all dead.</p>
<p>That Schopenhauer himself may have had little love for Prussianism as it later came to be understood, and was not an ethnic nationalist, seems to me irrelevant to this discussion. Indeed, who cares about his stodgy old philosophy anyway? What's important on Wikipedia is that everyone's prejudices, preconceptions and deeply embraced half-truths be pandered to in some way. If the result is confusing to the casual user attempting to obtain "knowledge," so what? Let him consult Britannica and a historical atlas.</p>
<p>I trust this meets with everyone's approval and accept your thanks in advance.</p>

<p>And all along I thought he was Italian! Didn't he write in Italian or something quite similar? On the other hand, he lived in some place called Frauenburg .... that doesn't sound very Italian. Maybe he was Danish, like Tycho Brahe? I doubt he was Prussian because he's always pictured with long hair. You know, those Prussians all had short, military-style haircuts. All a bunch of proto-fascists, of course.</p>

<dd>Everybody, please calm down. I would like to try to solve this dispute by discussion, not by hurling sarcasms at each other. As for another attempt at a compromise: All references I checked (including the polish Wikipedia) either refer to him as German, or do not list his nationality. I think it is safe to say that he is indeed German. If there is a dispute about it, then we could also add this to the article, i.e. <i>... although some see him as Prussian philosopher...</i> or something to that respect (but that would need a reference). I think the bigger problem is the Danzig/Gdansk mentioning, and to which country it belonged to at that time. Most English language references list his birthplace as Danzig, with Gdansk in brackets, I have not yet seen an English reference that mentions only Gdansk and not Danzig. A compromise would probably include both, possibly with a brief detailed explanation of the city having a German majority and being a rather independent part of Poland. I am pretty much open to include all viewpoints as long as there is a credible English language reference for it (i.e. no blog or newsgroup). -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">Chris 73</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_73_0282.html" title="User talk:Chris 73">Talk</a> 03:30, Feb 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">(1) "Influence" from Schelling; (2) Polish Question</span></h2>
<p>I am pleased that somebody, somewhere is discussing Schopenhauer; however, the issues being discussed are not quite as philosophical as I might like&#160;:-)</p>
<p>I hope the editors will take note of the following:</p>
<p>(1) Schopenhauer himself refuted the notion that his work was derivative of Schelling, and he writes about the issue in detail in the _Parerga &amp; Paralipomena_ --admittedly, the latter is an enormous book (thus, this is not a specific citation) but it is neatly organized and (as I recall) his comments on this issue can be easily found in the English translation. Incidentally, I don't think it's fair to say that Schopenhauer *hated* Schelling; if you read the essays on the history of ideas in the _Parerga &amp; Paralipomena_ you'll see that Schopenhauer gave plenty of "due credit" to other philosophers, including some he had little/nothing in common with (and, yes, plenty of overdue insults to Hegel!).</p>
<p>(2) About the Polish question, I believe what has been forgotten here is the existence of a pseudo-national/para-national entity called THE HANSEATIC LEAGUE (there's probably a Wiki article on it!). Schopenhauer's father was associated with the latter, and was without much national affiliation aside from the Hanseatic league itself. Both Schopenhauer and his father were anti-nationalists; incidentally, the name Arthur was selected for him by his father because it was the same in English, German, and French --and Schopenhauer's education and life shared in all three of these languages/nations. In any case, Schopenhauer's mother is strongly associated with Weimar (where she had her "Salon" of authors) but Schopenhauer himself had no strong attachment to any place in Germany, and rather claimed to detest the place --although he never followed his own advice and relocated to India!</p>
<p>I hope you've all enjoyed and learned from this rather strange dispute!</p>
<p><a name="One_more_point_for_clarification_.28Judaism_.26_Chr..29" id="One_more_point_for_clarification_.28Judaism_.26_Chr..29"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">One more point for clarification (Judaism &amp; Chr.)</span></h2>
<p>Just a note for the record: There's some vague mention in the article that Schopenhauer "Despised" Judaism, and despised Jewish elements of Christianity --this is problematic because it is vague, and therefore both misleading and partly inaccurate.</p>
<p>To be precise: (1.) Schopenhauer repeatedly reproaches Judaism as "no better than Protestantism" (including the use of the hyphenated word "Judaeo-Protestantism", to indicate that, philosophically, he thought the two had little difference between them!) (2.) Reciprocally, Schopenhauer reproaches Protestantism as not being any improvement on the old-testament doctrines of Judaism (3.) The reason for his different treatment of monastic Catholicism is clear: unlike Judaism, Protestantism, and Islam, there is an ascetic tradition among monastic Catholics.</p>
<p>Thus, while Schopenhauer was an atheist, his doctrinal endorsement of asceticism extended even to Theistic religion, e.g., Catholic monasticism --and, in the absence of asceticism, he regarded Judaism, Islam, etc., as worthless doctrines.</p>
<p>One can further point out that Schopenhauer was not an anti-Semite, that he favoured the legalization of inter-marriage between Christians and Jews, etc. --which is a bit spurious, but perhaps significant for the editor to consider.</p>
<p>All in the interests of "objectivity", I'm sure!</p>

<dd>However, he also praised the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakers.html" title="Shakers">Shakers</a> in America. I remember him saying "Protestantism is a degenerate Christianity and Catholocism is a terribly abused form of Christianity", but I have not read him say that Protestantism was no improvement on Judaism. Where does he say that? From all that I've read of him, he seems to insult Judaism an awful lot more than Protestantism. I do agree that S was not an anti-Semite in the racist sense and that is something which should always be made clear.</dd>

<p>We got already a compromise "German language philosopher born in Gdansk". But chris add the the "Danzig" thing. Im pretty sure that in some time, someone would try to remove "Gdansk". And after that users like Helga or Sca would try to add the information that he was born in Danzig from where germans were brutaly expelled... etc., etc.&#160;;).

<p>Ah, we do tend to globalize, don't we, Pan Emax?</p>
<p>The issue once again, for the umpteenth time, is that in Schopenhauer's day, it was called Danzig and inhabited mainly by Germans, i.e. people whose mother tongue was German. Sigh. And Schopenhauer, however universal his thought, was originally one of those German-speaking Danzigers.</p>
<p>I have no objection to saying something like, "was born in Gdansk, which is in modern Poland, but which at that time was generally known in the West by its German name, Danzig, and was inhabited primarily by Germans."</p>
<p>Anything untrue about that? If it makes you feel better, we could even lose the last clause, and end the sentence with "Danzig."</p>
<p>As to "users like Sca" -- what would they be like? Nazis? Fascists? I'm not even German. Look at my page. I looked at yours and it does seem to be that of a Polish nationalist. There's room for all of us if we stick to facts and don't try to rewrite history. Even Stalin didn't succeed at that. At least, not in the West.</p>

<p>In terms of the temp version, by 1788, Royal Prussia no longer existed - Danzig was an enclave, completely surrounded by (Hohenzollern) Prussian territory. It was still technically part of Poland, but that connection was essentially meaningless after 1772. Personally, I think the city ought to be referred to as "Danzig" in the early modern period, in any event. It was inhabited by Germans, and is generally known as that in English language historical works. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 01:03, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Firstly, do Turks have their own name for Kreuzberg? If not, the example is completely irrelevant. Even if they do, it's not especially relevant. Danzig was an autonomous German-speaking city-state within the very loosely organized Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The PLC was not a state in the modern sense, so analogies to the Federal Republic of Germany are not particularly appropriate. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 02:52, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

In the same way someone could claiming in 300 years, that Bavaria was not really Germany, but a autonomous <i>Bayrisch</i>-speaking state. You know how important Gdansk for the PLC was, and that Gdansk lost the importance (as a city) after the annexion by Prussia. And BTW "<i>city-state</i>" is not the right term to describe the privilages of Gdansk. And one more thing... is Bremen not part of Germany?

<dd>The people in texas call texas texas, as do the people in the rest of the US. Similar for bayern (bavaria), bremen, hamburg, etc, hence there is no need for any lengthy explanation. These places also have very little autonomy, and a very similiar culture to their surrounding states. Danzig/Gdansk, however, did at that time not really have any significant polish culture, rather it was a german city under the souvereignity of poland. In any case, the city is listed as part of poland in the current tmp version of the article. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">Chris 73</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_73_0282.html" title="User talk:Chris 73">Talk</a> 16:18, Feb 5, 2005 (UTC)

<p>By the way, I notice that the entry on Vilnius (ex-Wilna)- which seems to be written from a certain Polish point of view - contains in its history section, in the part dealing with post-WWII border and population changes, the following editorial comment:</p>
<p>"This way the city's population changed completely and most links with the city's past and traditions were broken. This fact is still seen by many people as unhappy, especially of its negative effect on city's community traditions."</p>
<p>Now, someone tell me, why is the Wilna situation different from the forced removal of the Germans from Danzig (now Gdansk) and all the other ex-German places in Poland?</p>
<p>The only difference I am aware of is that the Poles who were removed from then-Wilna apparently weren't subjected to the various physical atrocities the Red Army inflicted on the conquered Germans, about 1.5 mllion of whom lost their lives.</p>
<p>The point is not to raise another controversy (over Vilnius/Wilna) - it's that one can't have it both ways: Ethnic cleansing of another nationality can't be OK if you think it's bad when it happens to people of your ownnationality. Unless, of course, you're an ethno-racist, like the ardent Nazis were.</p>

<p>Thank you for making the article on Schopenhauer free for editing again. Don't worry about the "contributions" of some certain Emax, I think that we have more staying power than he. Keep in mind that Emax is only talking about the name of a city, while we are talking about the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, of which Emax seems to have not the slightest idea. So lets return to the important issues about Schopenhauer.</p>

<p>PS: If you don't have time to undo Emax vandalisms, I am happy to help out&#160;!</p>

<dd>There is a vote underway currently at <a href="../../../g/d/a/Talk%7EGdansk_Vote_6c4c.html" title="Talk:Gdansk/Vote">Talk:Gdansk/Vote</a> that should solve some of these problems. So far the vote is making good progress. Unfortunately for you, only users with a regular login can vote. Even if you would create a login now, it would be considered a <i>new</i> login and a vote would be ignored (This is to stop one user from voting multiple times using different just-created- logins). Sorry about that. In any case, there seems to be a strong support to list location names with both names, which is all I wanted for Schopenhauer, so I am happy about the progress of the vote. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">Chris 73</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_73_0282.html" title="User talk:Chris 73">Talk</a> 06:56, Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hope that everyone can regard the version below as a "Friendly amendment" --I have added two quotations (with citations!), a bit of balance, and a few extra words, as the former version of the article seemed to assume the reader had a pretty solid knowledge of Kantian jargon.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Philosophy</span></h2>
<p>Schopenhauer's starting point was <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immanuel_Kant_5dcb.html" title="Immanuel Kant">Kant</a>'s division of the universe into <a href="../../../p/h/e/Phenomenon.html" title="Phenomenon">phenomenon</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/u/Noumenon.html" title="Noumenon">noumenon</a>, claiming that the noumenon was <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Will (philosophy)">Will</a> and the most important since it is the inner content and the driving force of the world. For Schopenhauer, human will had ontological primacy over the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intellect.html" title="Intellect">intellect</a>; in other words, desire is understood to be prior to thought, and, in a parallell sense, "will" is said to be prior to "being". In solving/alleviating the fundamental problems of life, Schopenhauer was rare among philosophers in considering <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic.html" title="Logic">logic</a> less important (or "less effective") than <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art.html" title="Art">art</a>, certain types of chairtable practice ("loving kindness", in his terms), and certain forms of religious discipline; Schopenhauer concluded that discursive thought (such as philosophy and logic) could neither touch nor transcend the nature of desire --i.e., the will. In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_World_as_Will_and_Representation_ad39.html" title="The World as Will and Representation">The World as Will and Representation</a></i>, Schopenhauer posited that humans living in the realm of objects are living in the realm of desire, and thus are eternally tormented by that desire (The role of desire in life has a similar role in the religions of <a href="../../../v/e/d/Vedanta.html" title="Vedanta">Vedanta</a>-<a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, and Schopenhauer draws attention to these similarities himself).</p>
<p>While Schopenhauer's philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary, his <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodology.html" title="Methodology">methodology</a> was resolutely <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empirical.html" title="Empirical">empirical</a>, rather than "speculative", or "transcendental":</p>

<p>Schopenhauer's identification of the Kantian <i>noumenon</i> (i.e., the actually existing entity) with Will deserves some explanation. The <i>noumenon</i> was what Kant called the <i>Ding an Sich</i>, the "Thing in Itself", the reality that exists outside of, and the foundation of, our <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sense.html" title="Sense">sensory</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind.html" title="Mind">mental</a> representations of an external world; in Kantian terms, those sensory and mental representations are mere phenomena. Schopenhauer's assertion that Will is this <i>noumenon</i> might at first instance strike some as oddly as <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heraclitus.html" title="Heraclitus">Heraclitus</a>'s revelation that everything is made out of <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire.html" title="Fire">fire</a>.</p>
<p>But Kant's philosophy was formulated as a response to the radical <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophical_skepticism.html" title="Philosophical skepticism">philosophical skepticism</a> of <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Hume_69a6.html" title="David Hume">David Hume</a> and his fellow <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empiricists_636d.html" title="British Empiricists">British Empiricists</a>, who claimed that as far as we could tell there was <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solipsism.html" title="Solipsism">no outside reality</a> beyond our mental representations of it. When Schopenhauer identifies the <i>noumenon</i> with Will, what he is saying is that we participate in the reality of an otherwise unachievable world outside the mind through Will. We cannot <i>prove</i> that our mental picture of an outside world corresponds with a reality by reasoning. Through Will, we know — without thinking — that the world can stimulate us. We suffer fear, or desire. These states arise involuntarily. They arise prior to reflection. They arise even when the conscious mind would prefer to hold them at bay. The rational mind is for Schopenhauer a leaf borne along in a stream of pre-reflective and largely unconscious emotion. That stream is Will; and through Will, if not through logic, we can participate in the underlying reality that lies beyond mere phenomena. It is for this reason that Schopenhauer identifies the <i>noumenon</i> with Will.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Heraclitus</span></h2>
<p>Hello, I'm confused about the reference to Heraclitus' assertion that everything is made of fire, because I remember a similar assertion made by Thales, whereby everything was made of water. Perhaps Thales' statement was mistaken for Heraclitus'. - -_-</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article on <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heraclitus.html" title="Heraclitus">Heraclitus</a> says: "He disagreed with <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thales.html" title="Thales">Thales</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaximander.html" title="Anaximander">Anaximander</a>, and <a href="../../../p/y/t/Pythagoras.html" title="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a> about the nature of the ultimate substance and claimed instead that everything is derived from the Greek classical element fire, rather than from air, water, or earth." FWIW, Bryan Magee prefers to restate Schopenhauer's belief that the world is Will in terms of a belief that <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy.html" title="Energy">energy</a> is the fundamental substance: in which case it could be argued that Heraclitus beat him to the punch by a couple millennia. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:02, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../t/h/a/Thales.html" title="Thales">Thales</a> supposedly said that <i>water</i> is the basis of all things. He was important because he did not try to explain the world through the use of myths. <a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.101.14.html" title="User:152.163.101.14">152.163.101.14</a> 02:16, 12 September 2005 (UTC)Bruce Partington</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Immoral Moralist</span></h2>
<p>Buried somewhere above in all that Gdansk talk is the comment that Schopenhauer didn't follow his own morality; that he advocated asceticism but was a voluptuous <i>bon vivant</i>. Well. Schopenhauer answered that objection 185 years ago. In WWR I, § 68, he wrote: "...it is a strange demand on a moralist that he should commend no other virtue than that which he himself possesses."</p>
