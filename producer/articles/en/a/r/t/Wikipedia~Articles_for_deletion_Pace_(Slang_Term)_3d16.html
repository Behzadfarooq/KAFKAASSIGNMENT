<li><b>Keep</b> I think the page should be kept up. Though I don't attend Tulane, I do live in the New Orleans area, and I've heard this around town quite a bit. The character Turtle on "Entourage" has forcefully said "Pace" upon exiting a room and may have originated this usage. While "pace" is definitely a neologism, I disagree that it is a protologism because of this source. Furthermore, since this is a reaction to the growing, post-Katrina changes besetting New Orleanians--e.g., "My house in Lakeview got paced in the storm."--I think pace takes on an important cultural context and is thus just as appropriate on Wikipedia as UrbanDictionary. Admittedly, the definition is vague and needs to be refined. -- CBowes</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Pace is a slang term derived from esoteric Cajun/French vernacular. Only recently has it been resurrected by twenty-somethings native to the area and entrenched in Cajun culture and history. With the geographically diverse blend of undergraduates at Tulane University, the term has spread as far west as Bellevue, WA, and as far north as New York.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This unfounded criticism of Cajun jargon is a direct insult to the unique culture and lifestyle of Acadiana already diminished by two devastating hurricanes in August and September. Surely, one from across state lines, and certainly national lines, would not be able to trace its word-of-mouth origins. GoPaceYourself</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The term pace is a legitmate slang term originating in New Orleans, LA and has been adopted by people from Washington state, New York, Miami and Dallas. Just because you do not understand the significance of the term yet does not take away any of the merit of this entry. There are certainly people out there that do not know what bling bling is either but that entry is in wikipedia and has been for awhile.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am still very intrigued by this page. It is inappropriate for me to modify the original definition, but I urge the original poster to do so to reflect both a more specific denotation and the reasons we have defended "pace's" use. By the way, it is also possible that "pace" in this context could have originated from "hale and pace," the cockney rhyming slang for "face." Thus, the expressions "I paced my face" and "I have to pace myself before I *pace* myself." I would appreciate if the people pushing for deletion would be more descriptive in their reasons, instead of just insulting the people who are defending the listing. What exactly are you looking for in regards to "pace's" relevance, and what would satisfy your need for outside sources? No matter what verdict Wikipedia decides upon, it is entries like this that define its relevance. Either it is a democratic medium for the progression of knowledge and culture, or it is as pedantic and intolerant as a first grade teacher. I think deleting this entry would be a line in the sand pushing Wikipedia into the latter group.

<p>Keep- Although an annoying term because of its stunning popularity in Post Katrina New Orleans, "Pace" has certainly become terminology on par with such early 90's California surfer lingo as "rad" and "awesome." Urban Dictionary, while also an appropriate location for the terminology, doesn't provide enough credence for terminology being used by an entire culture's population. -WLW <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.81.125.59 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.81.125.59_031d.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.81.125.59">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Please don't get pretentious and pace, pace. At the heart of the matter for those of you shouting "delete" is that you do not live in New Orleans, where the term has its origins, and you have no compassion for just how paced your city can become when it's hit by a hurricane. Do you really feel any better when you kick those who are down? Is there a reason why we can't have our culture displayed in Wikipedia? I think not. Please, just give pace a chance. -Dgran</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I believe Pace is an important new term both for New Orleans and for all of Louisiana. As a resident of Baton Rouge I can attest to having heard the term Pace on several occasions which proves that it is not just a local phenomenon. Pace is becoming an important part of Louisiana culture and is proving its viability by spreading to different cities and even different states. To delete this term would be both close minded and intolerant. RockerBT 22:23, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
