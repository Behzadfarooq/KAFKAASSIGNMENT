<li><b>Delete</b> as hoax. You are not a political party in the UK unless you are registered with the Electoral Commission to stand in an election. This in itself isn't that hard if you enjoy wasting money (you need at least two party officers, a party constitution, a financial scheme showing how the party will comply with the financial controls and a fee of ¬£150). No Penis Party is registered (unless this is the most almighty of typos and they meant pensioners), no Michael Hale stood in any seat in the UK.<a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 22:02, 6 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> You're under no obligation to explain your vote, of course, but I'm wondering just why you say there's no comparison between Buffy and Trek or Dr. Who. They're all long-running cult TV shows with plenty of spinoffs, movies, mechandise, books, conventions, and strong fan communities. It seems there's a lot that's comparable between the 3 series as far as notability is concerned. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 00:18, May 7, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I second Andrew's statement. I don't even like Buffy but I agree that there is enough notability to warrant episode articles. Likewise other major cult shows like X-Files.

<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li>Comment: Speedy deleted, twice now, a little under 19 hours apart by different admins, dealing with completely different joke content created by the same IP (but as they have been deleted they no longer show on their user contribs page of course). While I'm quite confident that deletion was in order, ISTM that this violates our current policies and procedures. Maybe they need updating?

<li>You should raise this matter on the Talk page, citing this mess as evidence, and then it can be written up in a useful manner and added in.

<li>I have undeleted this because it does not meet any of the criteria for speedy deletion. In particular, no statement made in the body of the article can change the license that they have submitted the text under. It wouldn't hurt to propose amending the speedy delete policy to include articles solely created as threats though. <a href="../../../d/c/o/User%7EDcoetzee_a2a7.html" title="User:Dcoetzee">Deco</a> 00:03, 7 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>And *I* think you two need to go off and discuss this on the Speedy talk page rather than contradicting each other's actions.

<li>Comment: I'm fascinated. Those proposing this for speedy deletion seem to agree with me that it's <b>not</b> a valid candidate under the current policy.

<li><b>Delete</b>; I'm surprised this wasn't speedied, actually. List of nicknames? Star of Flash cartoons? Weaknesses include <i>potato pellets</i>? <i>I</i> think that's speedyable. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 08:50, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>(<b>Invalid anon vote</b>) Keep Hi I'm completely new to Wikipedia, however I came across this entry by legitimately searching from Google for this series of Flash cartoons. I know of the cartoon character and found the biographical stuff really interesting. I guess some of the entry isn't serious, but I think the article as a whole is useful. <small>2005-05-10 T 23:51 Z</small></li>
