<li><b>Strong keep, but with massive clean up</b> The article is rubbish. Pure rubbish. However, skate punk is absolutely a viable genre. Uh, a hoax? No. That would be quite an elaborate hoax, considering the two hundred edits made to the page and the fact that it's existed for over three years. Obviously, not all of them relate to the music genre (although most of the first thirty hits do), but "Skate punk" gets 317,000 total and 681 unique Google hits. The article undoubtedly needs work, but there's absolutely no reason it should be <i>deleted</i>. And if the nominator feels that the genre is recognized by a very narrow group, I'd ask him/her how many people recognize NOFX, U.S. Bombs, Pennywise, and pretty much every act that has ever been on the Warped Tour, which, of course, is a ludicrously popular tour- started by a skateboarding company- almost exclusively featuring punk bands. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 02:38, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> An essay detailing the trend of "military fiction by writers who are Indian by nationality" sounds nice, even if one anticipates subjectivity problems. I would support the effort. But the article clearly does not envisage any such structuring. The author's assertion that <i>these are the only works of military fiction ever written by Indians, and hence the article should be retained</i>, does not support the assessment that informs the last sentence of this well-meaning vote. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpuMozhi_e030.html" title="User:ImpuMozhi">ImpuMozhi</a> 23:59, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - While an item by itself may not be notable or interesting enough for an article, when grouped together with similiar items it becomes of interest. An article on one ordinary person from Portugal wouldn't be interesting, while an article on the people of Portugal would. Interestingly while just doing a quick search for Airavat Singh, one of the authors mentioned in the article, I discovered that he is used as a reference source for the <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamboja_Dynasty_of_Bengal_201b.html" title="Kamboja Dynasty of Bengal">Kamboja Dynasty of Bengal</a> article - so he does have some credibility. Also, I am tempted to be more patient to under-represented areas on Wikipedia. The majority of Wikipedians are young American males with an interest in comics, films and music - as such we are swamped with such articles, and it is right that we examine each new comic article carefully. However, articles on Indian literature are very rare and should not, I think, be hastily deleted. This article, as it stands, does no disservice to Wikipedia, and - given time (bear in mind that it was nominated for destru ction something like 9 days after first being written) - it may blossom into something that we all can be very proud of. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 08:25, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why, the other two authors are also eminent personalities, I don't doubt that their books are good. That's not the <i>point.</i> <i><b>What is the sanctity of a listing of military fiction, where the only point is that the authors belong to a certain nationality?</b></i> I can see that you have an interest in military fiction; will you take up the task of moulding the article into something worthwhile, on the lines indicated by you above? Otherwise, saying that the article should be retained on the vague off-chance of future improvement, when the creator of the piece states definitely that no such thing is on the anvil, make no sense to me. Anyway, it matters little in the great scheme of things. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpuMozhi_e030.html" title="User:ImpuMozhi">ImpuMozhi</a> 16:48, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I personally feel that this is indisputable in this case, but please respond if you disagree and I will try to provide demonstrative details.

<li><b>Keep</b> Patri is notable to quite a number of people, particularly in the libertarian and micro-nation community. His Seastead Project (which is now a book, the fact he doesn't sell through Amazon speaks only to his choice of commercial channels) proposes to replicate the SeaLand experience, and he is a noted performance artist, including his cluster balloon project at Burning Man. I live 3000 miles away from the man and I've known of him for years. That he is also a writer on the noted blog Catallarchy is also notable. It appears to me that there is a concerted campaign by some to delete from history persons of a libertarian bent. J.R. Hercules' own user discussion page exposes that he is an avid anti-gun anti-libertarian individual, and this AfD should be regarded simply as part of his vendetta against pro-liberty activists. I did a search of Amazon and other books use the term "seastead". User:Citizenposse69.173.98.243 17:42, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It is unfair that Wikipedia, which is supposed to be impartial, and without point of view (POV as you guys write), gives advantage to incumbents by allowing the promotion of their bio, election websites etc. - and not other candidates who do not currently hold elected office. If Wikipedia covers elections, it should not do so without providing a balanced view of candidates. Otherwise, Wikipedia should not even cover the elections at all. Candidates can not be non-notable - that is just completely biased language; the mere fact that a candidate is running means that they have obtained hundreds or perhaps thousands of signatures to get on a ballot - beyond that, whether or not they are notable is up to the masses; it should be up to the readers of wikipedia and the voters of a district to decide if a person is non-notable. They are all equal and must be taken seriously before the election - that is what democracy is about. There is no reason why an incumbent who is already elected should get even more promotion via wikipedia, when someone running against them (who already has more odds stacked against them), can not post a page without it being deleted. To many people (at least tens of thousands of people every election), the current State Senator is "non-notable" and they vote against him. In 2000, over 38,000 people found the current State Senator non-notable and voted against him, and he only barely won with 52% of the popular vote. The man who ran against the incumbent was well known and had done a lot of major things for his community - is wikipedia to say that only incumbents are notable candidates? Over 38,000 people a few years ago would disagree. I can understand if wikipedia only had a page about the current government and did not make mention of candidates on any of its pages - however, wikipedia does cover state and local elections, and all candidates who make it to the ballot should be allowed an equal forum. As a 501C3 non-profit organization in Florida, Wikimedia Foundation may not engage in politics (by choosing one side, whether it is a party or a particular candidate or even just choosing to support incumbent POV only during an election, that is in itself engaging in politics) - Wikimedia Foundation could lose its tax-free status; if Wikipedia does not provide a balanced view - then it can not allow election information on its website (government information is OK, but when you cover elections, you need to show balanced representation of candidates). "Non-notable" is a point of view - Wikipedia is a service for people who want to find information freely - please let your readers decide for themselves how notable a candidate is. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by JimmyMA (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JimmyMA_52b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/JimmyMA">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> JimmyMA's unsigned comment is ludicrous. The prohibition he refers to relates to US Internal Revenue Code Sec. 501(c)(3) organizations intervening in elections. Wikipedia contains a number of articles, some of which are on current and former holders of political offices. Some of the subjects of these articles may be currently running for office. The articles are not an attempt to intervene in the election. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> 00:12, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry - the intent was not to make any legal reference or to violate NLT; really, it is just a speculative comment (not "ludicrous" actually - current and former holders of political office are just that - however, it is when they are referred to as candidates as part of an election, that you must be careful to try your best to permit a fair climate for the other candidate information to be presented; this particular candidate in question is not "a current or former holder of political office" - yet his name appears on at least one wikipedia article/page) that someone may be able to make the case that a non profit organization which acts as an information source can not favor incumbent information during an election (even with the best intent to keep POV out of articles - it is hard to do that, because when you offer some information which then links to candidate campaign websites, the user clicks on it and sees almost 100% POV at that point)... Certainly, we are all regular users of Wikipedia or we wouldn't be here - Wikipedia is an important resource and I only bring this up so you can clarify your policies or find an amicable way to work with candidates to make the article work within your policies. The reason to bring this up is not to say that Wikipedia is outright wrong, but rather, that Wikipedia should modify its policies when it comes to such a fragile topic as equal rights to post information about CANDIDATES, not ELECTED OFFICIALS. It is just a matter of equality. The article can be rewritten, but it has been written 3 times and deleted 3 times... this time it was written much shorter and much more bland on purpose to try to fit your style requirements. At this point, we need your advice on how to make the article work - or in the style of wikipedia, it can be edited by your team of editors or the public anyway. It is offensive that you feel you can question if a candidate is credible - that clearly is a POV. I assure you, this candidate is a credible candidate, who regardless of whether or not he wins, will receive many thousands if not tens of thousands of votes (I am quite sure of this, given that he was required to collect 300 signatures to get on the ballot, yet he easily got over 600 in a few days; he is the top official in the state regarding building code, zoning and related rules, which means most people, elected officials and lawyers &amp; judges involved in construction contracts or building/property management know him - which is a lot of people, and in addition he is a well known community activist with public service background) - he is a well-known candidate statewide whose first campaign fundraiser was so popular that it was standing room only. At his first speaking event, he was introduced, with full support of the party, personally by the Chairman of the Democratic State Party - the same one who introduces Ted Kennedy and John Kerry at the convention. This candidate was one of the first people to speak at this year's South Shore Democratic Caucus - he was introduced and spoke before Governor candidates Deval Patrick, Chris Gabrielli and Tom Reilly; do a search on BelowBoston.com for confirmation. He has received the outspoken and/or televised endorsement of a number of State Representatives and other officials, and has received campaign contributions. (are these elected officials wrong in publicly endorsing a candidate who may or may not be "credible" according to Wikipedia? I think these elected, popular State Reps would not put their reputation on the line for someone who is not "credible" - see the website to see a few endorsements) The contributors range from retired people living on a budget to people in business - regardless of their means, the fact that they contribute their hard-earned money tells me they believe he is credible. So, on what grounds do you say he is not credible? At what point does a candidate become credible - only if he/she wins? If that is the case, nobody new could ever be elected to office; experience does not come from thin air - all elected officials at one point earlier in their life were not yet elected officials. If all of these details were put into a wikipedia article, it would surely be deleted as a self-advertisement. So, please feel free to modify the article to suit your needs, or perhaps I can try to modify it a bit myself, however it is only fair that if nothing else, you should permit this candidate, like any other, to have a few sentences attached to any link on your website with his name. And Wikipedia DOES allow other candidates to post a link to their POV-infused campaign websites - so it would be good if you could allow that as well, only because it is fair. I understand that Wikipedia's mission is to provide quality factual content to its readers - we agree and want to do the same - all we ask is a few sentences be permitted to describe the background of the candidate, so people have a tiny little bit better idea of who he is - as a credible candidate, who is already confirmed to be on the ballot.</p>
<p>I have read the Wikipedia Candidates and Elections Page (and WP NOT) - the first time I followed these instructions, and made modifications, the page was deleted... Again, I will attempt to fix the page, but please also make edits yourself too if it doesn't work for you, rather than just delete it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by JimmyMA (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JimmyMA_52b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/JimmyMA">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>A few points:

<dd>
<ol>
<li>You claim to be a regular user, yet your only edits are to the articles and to this AfD.</li>
<li>You seem to have confused the concepts of "credibility" and "notability."</li>
<li>You are confused on Wikipedia's policies regarding writing an article on oneself or the organization (or in this case candidate) one works for. Please read <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>. The article is a good example of the need for this policy.</li>
<li>The course of this discussion confirms my gut feeling about these things: A subject this desperate to get his article on Wikipedia should not have one here.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> That's probably why I couldn't find it then. I know it's a proposal, BTW. After all, guidelines are not set in stone either, and draft ones are cited in AfD every day, but we wouldn't get anywhere in here if we stuck to policies only, and went back to the first principles of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> every time we started a discussion. These things become adopted through use IMO. But thanks all the same.&#160;:-) FWIW, and in the absence of anything else that comes close, I believe <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_and_elections_9303.html" title="Wikipedia:Candidates and elections">Wikipedia:Candidates and elections</a> is a very workable and very equitable policy proposal, so I tend to use it as a guideline when assessing suspected nn non-incumbent candidate AfDs like this. As do, I believe, many other editors. I find it tends to sort the genuinely notable from the plain old electioneering pretty effectively, all things considered. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 09:03, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(In response to the clarification requested on my talk page by <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a>) Well, in my opinion high schools are of borderline notability. Usually high schools have tens of thousands of graduates, each one spending hours and hours there for a four year period with countless memories during a time of transition in their lives.

<li><b>Keep</b> Secondary schools (and the schools that incorporate them) are kept virtually <i>ab initio</i> and by virtue of their existence; notability in essence only helps and an absence of it really does not stop them. Whether this is good or bad is not for me to say, but I try to be pragmatic. Thus, because in spite of the cogent arguments for and against, very few AfDed schools are ever deleted, I will go with the majority.

<dd>OK I'm sorry, I first nominated this article for deletion, then thought of the redirect, but when I tried to implement that, it appeared not to work, so I thought I had to go through with the AfD process.

It's not really a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory.html" title="Theory">theory</a>, but a fanciful concept to help in thinking about a controversial and scientifically difficult subject. Notable as a challenge to orthodoxy from an increasingly important author. Notable because quotable -- thousands will read or hear about the giant raccoon and not know what it means. (It's defined only once in the book, but referred to several times.) Better for them to find it here than to try to find it in a 301-page book that they have to own or borrow to read.

<li>Once this has had its full time for comment, and assuming the trend to delete continues, the Raccoon should go to the article on the book, and I'll be glad to move it. Once there, it will be subject to twisting and distortion by those who see a commercial for whacko "creation science" in every Coulter word. While it's in its own article, it's hard for them to do that, since there aren't any "creation science" quotes to illegitimately tie it to. It's a fanciful/critical/controversial analogy of Darwinism, not a commercial for "creation science." Not a "political theory," either. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 17:27, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Possibly it could be merged with <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster_3e86.html" title="Flying Spaghetti Monster">Flying Spaghetti Monster</a>, since it seems to be a broadly similar theory with some weird POV crap attached. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtw_80b7.html" title="User:Artw">Artw</a> 20:33, 3 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have a <b>serious question</b> about the above comment. The Raccoon quote is parsed and its meaning is carefully explained. It illustrates the position of an important author about the origins of life on earth. Yet people call it "POV." And dismiss it on that account. I'm new to Wikipedia, and I see quite a lot of "I don't agree with it, so it's POV." Isn't the notion of "POV" that the <b>editors</b> should keep their points of view out of the articles? And isn't the point of <i>that</i> that the points of view of the <b>people covered by the articles</b> get a fair and unbiased hearing? <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 23:37, 3 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Seriously, it's not her position about the origins of life on earth. It's a catchphrase she made up to ridicule others' opinions. There's a big difference. The main point, though, is that it doesn't seem to be a particular method of ridicule that's caught on, even with the creationist movement in general. It's worth a mention as part of the article on her book, but doesn't seem to have achieved any notoriety separate from it. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 00:42, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Personally, IMNSHO, I don't see POV as being relevant here. Clearly, POV is a problem with anything about this person, but on this particular issue, I think the only relevant argument is that it's a phrase that nobody's picked up on, that hasn't spread, and doesn't deserve an article.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Nowadays he is known worldwide, thanks to the Evo tournament video and others. The video is watched even by people who doesn't have much knowledge about the game, due to this dramatic characteristic. A well research would evidence that others countries makes his fame also. Examples are communities in Orkut.com dedicated to him: <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=8410635.This" class="external free" title="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=8410635.This" rel="nofollow">http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=8410635.This</a> should be considered.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> That IMDB entry is for "Bang the Machine", an out-of-print documentary about the SF scene. I was the one who submitted the info on the players that appeared in that movie; otherwise he wouldn't have an IMDB profile, which is all kinds of ironic. And the GameSpot "article" is just rankings for EVO in 2003.

<li><b>Comment</b> Um...the last time I checked AfD are because people have A. Fake articles, B. Articles that are unverifiable C. Article of zero notablilty. Much of the information on Wikipedia is found randomly, mainly through the well-organized link process (ie hyperlink in a different article, and lists) this is what make wikipedia great. In fact this is what most people do. For example lets say a person interested in the "History of SF" accidently stumbles upon "Daigo Umehara" in the Street Fighter article. If you are stating that this is not random, or the person has no interest in "The Best Player in SF" then I can say with 100% certainty that you have no idea what you are talking about. SF has a large enough following of causal players that people not searching for the best SF player or even the SF tournament scene would be interested in reading about Daigo. Lets take another example: The other day I "randomly" stumbled upon <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kardashev_scale.html" title="Kardashev scale">Kardashev scale</a>. I came across this while reading "<a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy_economics.html" title="Energy economics">Energy economics</a>" which linked through the category to Kardashev scale. Now that was completely random, I also found Kardashev scale to be one of the most interesting reads in my life. Therefore, Lilithborne, you are done stop talking. 71.248.218.111 05:22, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is the last comment I'm going to make regarding this, because you obviously are not willing to listen to reason. The majority of articles that go through the AfD process are biographies of people considered not notable. This is just another one of them. I played SF for a long, long time and I'm pretty sure I know more about Daigo than you do. (A-Guy, anyone?) However, unlike poker, whose players have widespread popularity, SF remains, as MCB eloquently put it, an insular gaming community that rejects "newbies", ironically when they need new blood the most. "History of SF" on <i>Wikipedia</i> should be about the game in and of itself; the tournaments held, for the most part, failed to influence its evolution in any significant way. Now, as someone who has been playing SF seriously for about seven years, rest assured that you, like many other fanatics before you, greatly overestimate the influence of SF on society. So, since reason's lost on you, I'll leave it at this: Daigo Umehara is not notable enough for an encyclopedia entry and that, my friend, is that. What happens after this point is not up to you or me, but the admins. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 06:07, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I would like you to know that I am not part of the SF community. I rarely play SF and see it nothing more than a causal game. I found this article to be notable and interesting. I stumbled upon this article through the category, japanese people. Therefore if I find this article to be notable, it probably is, since I do not belong in the interest group. 71.248.218.111 18:38, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Also nominated are <b>Davis Tellman</b> and <b>Lorne Halladay</b>. To put it simply this is a bizzarre case. I originally wondered upon the Portland article when doing New page patrol and asked for sources and was supplied such. When I went to a library near where I worked I actually stumbled upon one of the sources and checked out the book out of curiousity. When I read the book (three times for good measure) I found no mention of these subjects. Confused, I picked the other source and, again, nothing popped up. Concerned, I e-mailed both the Chicago Historical Society and the Chicago Photographic Collectors Society, asking about all three subjects and the Chicago Photographic Society. The CPCS Vice President responding stating, he had no idea whom the people were and that he had never heard of the Chicago Photographic Society, stating that the CPCS (which the article claims was the Chicago Photographic Society), was formed in 1971. After my e-mail with the Chicago Historical Society, I had a phone conversation with them that echoed the same concerns. It appears as far as I can tell, these subjects are ficitious and a hoax. <b>Delete</b> If any information is needed, I will supply it. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 03:54, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Thank you all for the kind words. I am very glad to see Tyrenius's and Kjkolb's work, I was suspecting something when I was looking through their conversations and when both of them confronted me on Portland's talk page. These appear to be complicated and thought out hoax articles. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 11:37, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I hope Yanksox won't mind if I just clarify any ambiguity and say that the confrontation on Portland's talk page was with two of the suspect sockpuppets, not with Tyrenius and Kjkolb! <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 12:17, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Even for a small country like Singapore, to be the leading drag performer is notable enough to keep, imho. I found websites (only a few in English) that confirm this <a href="http://www.wcities.com/en/record/46,281091/85/record.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wcities.com/en/record/46,281091/85/record.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> <a href="http://www.sodomylaws.org/world/singapore/sinews037.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sodomylaws.org/world/singapore/sinews037.htm" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>, though I acknowledge that both have reliability issues.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase02</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 04:04, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Kchase02. If she were in New York, it'd be borderline non-notable, but in Singapore it's a different story. Plenty of google presence. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireplace_0f6a.html" title="User:Fireplace">Fireplace</a> 04:40, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I tagged it as a speedy then as a prod simply because I found no references in google. I read the references now provided and the second one of the above does call Kumar (drag queen) the most notable one in Singapore and that is notable enough for me. Since have checked with <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webcrawler.html" title="Webcrawler">Webcrawler</a> and found <a href="http://www.queerday.com/2005/sep/28/kumarsutra_brings_drag_queen_to_singapore_handphones.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.queerday.com/2005/sep/28/kumarsutra_brings_drag_queen_to_singapore_handphones.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> that also calls this person the most notable drag queen there.--<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Lake_9bc6.html" title="User:John Lake">John Lake</a> 04:47, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There was a large argument I had with <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> which I removed because of irrelevance toward the discussion of Daigo Umehara. He then sent me a personal PM, which he stated that he had a bias toward me and then found another article which I wrote, and AfD without research of notablilty. His tagging of Melee FC was completely bias. He also falsified information to back his point of view. He however, is correct in tagging the NorCal Tournament. The reason why I recommend this article for deletion is because it is not even notable in the smash community. Therefore the chances of someone else out of the community being interested is slim to none. Melee FC however is the largest tournament to date, not only gaining television publicity, but also captures the interest of causal smash players and gamers. (There are over 6 million causal smash players) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.248.218.111 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.248.218.111.html" title="User talk:71.248.218.111">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.248.218.111_d61d.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.248.218.111">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

A Google Books search brings up "Seastead" as a neologism coined in the late 1960s to describe the possibility of a US federal government initiative to encourage the US States to distribute sea resource rights to entrepreneurs more effectively (a plan which I'm sure the libertarians would hate)<a href="http://www.lib.noaa.gov/edocs/stratton/chapter3.html#Plan" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lib.noaa.gov/edocs/stratton/chapter3.html#Plan" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. This 1960s government neologism doesn't seem to have caught on, which is why we don't even have underwater sea colonies today, never mind cities on the moon. The Books search also suggests "Seasteading" as a slang term used to describe self-sufficient sailing (sort of like <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Costner_7a16.html" title="Kevin Costner">Kevin Costner</a> in <i><a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterworld.html" title="Waterworld">Waterworld</a></i> but without the <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gills.html" title="Gills">gills</a>). The sailing term seems to date back to the 1970s<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0898150515/104-3532977-6427169?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0898150515/104-3532977-6427169?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>( see the reader comments on amazon). A <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> multi-decade search of newspapers and magazines only brought up a few hits, which were all related to the 1970s sailing movement or to people with Seastead as a surname.

<p>Gamecrufty article about an international <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee_ba8d.html" title="Super Smash Bros. Melee">Super Smash Bros.

<li>A few notes. This initial reason for recommended deletion was based on a bias (negative personal feelings) toward the creator of the page. Reading through this article provides both citations and reports of the notablilty of this tournament. To view an unnotable tournament see NorCal Tournament. Melee FC has been portray by the media, and thus gone beyond that of interest community.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Those familiar with the Smashboards/Smash Brothers tournament community know that this has been the most competitive and diverse Smash tournament for the last two years, even compared with the professional leagues, therefore "non-notable" is not a reason to delete.

Because of publicity WSOP has become notable. What makes Melee FC notable is that if someone not apart of the tournament community is interested in finding out what the largest tournament in Smash is, they could search for it on wikipedia. Smash has sold over 6 million copies and as a result the interest group is much larger than just that of the tournament players, therefore people would be interested. This article is an interesting read for any gamer, smash related or not. Both poker and smash has received Television publicity. Also, this tournament has larger notablilty than many Magic: The Gathering players, which each have their own article. Also this article has notability because it is the most notability aspect of a certain interest group.

<li><b>Comment</b> It lacks notability because it has only been mentioned in Nintendo Power, the official magazine for all things Nintendo, and the homepage that organizes the tournament. World Series of Poker is televised on a national network. Magic the Gathering has a larger fanbase than SSBM, as the Gamecube was not very popular among the PS2 and the X-Box. If I were to hold a SSBM tournament at UM, I could probably gather upwards of 100 participants, too, and it could also be determined as international, because there would be plenty of participants who go to my university and are from other countries (<a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanzania.html" title="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina.html" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, etc.), but that wouldn't mean it requires international notability on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 19:37, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Maybe you arent reading everything, NBC news team also broadcasted it on the 6 clock news. Also if you host a tournament it will not gather anything international. Melee FC is the apex of smash tournament and is noted as the largest tournament out come for a single fighting game. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.248.218.111 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.248.218.111.html" title="User talk:71.248.218.111">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.248.218.111_d61d.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.248.218.111">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Okay, it says that the local NBC station for the area, <a href="../../../w/n/d/WNDU-TV_0dd9.html" title="WNDU-TV">WNDU-TV</a>, broadcast a news report on the tournament. It's not like <i>NBC Nightly News</i> or <i>Dateline NBC</i> reported on it (which it would then be notable, because a news program broadcast nationally would have mentioned it). MELEE-FC is not as notable as (for an example) <a href="../../../q/u/a/QuakeCon_c54a.html" title="QuakeCon">QuakeCon</a> which gathers several thousand participants in a LAN Party, during which they play multiplayer first person shooters against each other (<i><a href="../../../q/u/a/Quake_III_Arena_a428.html" title="Quake III Arena">Quake III Arena</a></i>). <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 20:13, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also note that I said fighting games. Fighting games in general do not bring even over a hundred participants. Evo and can bring around 400 because it host seven games. FC3 however, was single handly able to bring 186 participants. There will be even larger tournaments this summer, however they have not yet occured. Also FC is an annual tournament therefore people interested in going and expect one every year. As far as fighting games go Melee FC has brought the largest crowd. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.248.218.111 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.248.218.111.html" title="User talk:71.248.218.111">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.248.218.111_d61d.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.248.218.111">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Uh, there were over 200 entrants in the MvC2 tournament at EVO in 2004.

<li>First, sign your comments with ~~~~, even if you are an IP editor. Second, just because it is a fighting game that got nearly 200 players in it's third year doesn't make it any more notable than if it was a Tekken tournament that got 400 participants and got mentioned on the local CBS network in <a href="../../../d/u/l/Duluth%2C_Minnesota_117c.html" title="Duluth, Minnesota">Duluth, Minnesota</a>. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 20:36, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I think the mentioning of MELEE-FC in the SSBM article is plenty. This article is not very interesting or informative to anyone who does not attend the tournaments, and the person who wrote the article even said that he doesn't care. I've been to both FCs and I'll be at the next one, by the way. <a href="../../../a/o/b/User%7EAOB_9b4e.html" title="User:AOB">AOB</a> 00:36, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I'm somewhat sick of this notability thing. Nintendo power and local news count as reliable sources, it's just that this article doesn't back up its claims with those sources. I don't think we should compare this to WSOP, but if this is the most important/successful tournament for this game, I think that's a reason we can include it. However, the article is full of inside information that only fans would know: this is not verifiable info and needs to be removed. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 13:11, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

I defy one thing, your actions. And I am prepared to be hurt by the process. Just like Ghandi, I draw fire upon myself and I am willing to suffer the consequences.</i> How is that not attempting to martyr yourself? Look through this AfD as well as the other two. The bulk of the text is yours. Long rants accusing people of things, long rants repeating the same things again and again, etc. Now let's look at what I said again...nowhere did I ask you to leave. I did, however, ask you to find a different place to vent.

I tried to offer an appology. I looked at your submissions and made one of my own that matched yours. A simple two sentence statement of fact.

<dd>The explanation is simple I was ashamed of my behavior and I was going to quit wiki-pedia. I am not used to this type of treatment. I was determined to leave and to delete the article myself. I realized my ill will and bad feelings were not rational. I stopped, and licked my wounds and pondered. Because I come from a background of repect, love and tollerance, I decided to take a stand for truth and these principles, to return and make the way safe for other newbies.

<dd>The logic is simple. I'm new and trying to learn. Anyone who just says "Delete" does not teach me anything. Someone who rubs it in is just down right mean. Phillis Jackson and the Celtic Toe may be <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_legend.html" title="Urban legend">urban legend</a> similiar to the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brass_monkey.html" title="Brass monkey">brass monkey</a> if so it belongs here just as much as the others do. I'm trying to contribute, not defile. Why do you discourage contribution? Sayng something is nonsense and deleteing it is not the same as others have suggested as, labeling it correctly and putting it in its place. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittonLaRoche_27da.html" title="User:BrittonLaRoche">BrittonLaRoche</a> 21:12, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BTW - Since when was then benchmark of notability that work must be published in a peer-reviewed journal? Wikipedia only requires that the source is notable. No these aren't 'scholarly' magazines but the ideas still exist in published form which is enough. Yes the work isn't rigorously scientifically tested but it still exists as an idea, and its not like its published in a magazine that nobody reads either - I really think you guys should give the author a bit of slack on this and give them the benifit of the doubt that they are not trying to disrupt wikipedia, but just trying to contribute, albeit on topics which aren't really notable enough <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMammal4_a688.html" title="User:Mammal4">Mammal4</a> 13:47, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No there is no argument - I'm saying delete this because its not notable. I just made the point (concerning people's comments here and on the Celitc toe page) that notability is not dependent on being published in a peer-reviewed journal. Also, if you read my comment on the Celtic toe page you'll see that I suggested merging it with Morton's toe not deleting it (i.e ditch all the pseudo science stuff and just leave a short paragraph mentionning the urban myth part of it) because although its not scientific it does exist in folklore so should be recognised as such <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMammal4_a688.html" title="User:Mammal4">Mammal4</a> 14:51, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Another editor said of the Celtic toe article, "The problem with this article is that it over cooks the information and tries to make out that there is more to the evidence than their actually is," which I think is a good synopsis of the issue.

<p><b>Cited references for Phyllis Jackson</b></p>
<p>It would be nice to actually get a look at the three references BrittonLaRoche has given us for Phyllis Jackson's notability, as the link provided only goes to a list of article titles. I realise that it is sometimes hard to get hold of accessable links for peer-reviewed journals because they generally require a subscription, but as the list stands it doesn't prove anything as it is only a list of article titles. I may be able to help as it appears that I might be able to at least view the International Journal of Osteoarchaeology article through my job, which seems to have access (I can't tell for definite now, as I am at home, but will know more tomorrow).

<dd>Phyllis Jackson has continued her work on foot bones from sites throughout the city. She has now studied over sixty burials, from excavations at Gambier Parry Gardens, London Road, St Oswald's Priory, Blackfriars and Southgate Street. Her research, which looks at the structure of the foot, provides evidence for ethnic and tribal origins, deformity, disease and way of life (for an introduction to Miss Jackson's work see Current Archaeology 144, pp466-70). As always, volunteers and work experience students have provided invaluable assistance with improving the documentation and storage of archaeological material held at the unit. RA</dd>

<dd>"The subjects are near-unidentifiable..." yes because I stink as an artist. People are the hardest to draw. This is a sketch I made of that photo. That makes it my work, in turn I give it freely to the world. I prefer your opinion and your justification rather than to abstain. I am learning the process the hard way. I do not know of any other way to learn in this environment. I've read all the policies and procedures I could in two weeks. Here are some more examples of what I have done for wikipedia. I do this because it takes an extreem amount of effort to request permission to use a photo and then prove that permission was granted. Further the author has to grant the rights in away that makes it usable by anyone who wishes to reference wiki pedia. I found it next to impossible. Its far easier to sketch and prove I did it. <a href="http://thefartist.blogspot.com/" class="external text" title="http://thefartist.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">"The Lost Colony's Creation of Sir Francis Drake"</a> --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittonLaRoche_27da.html" title="User:BrittonLaRoche">BrittonLaRoche</a> 19:41, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<b>Mammal4 research conclusions</b></p>
<p>I've checked out the International Journal of Osteoarchaeology reference cited above. It doesn't mention Phyllis Jackson anywhere, or Celtic toe, or Morton's toe for that matter. I've read it in moderate detail, and it is a quite interesting article, but not really relevent to any discussion here or on the Celtic toe page. This agrees with and confirms <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a>'s and <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a>'s reading of the article. I can't get hold of the two articles in "the Foot" journal so I can't comment on these. As far as notability, Phyllis Jackson actually scores less unique hits that I do if I search for my professional name! I don't think that I require an article about myself so to confirm what I said originally, she simple isn't notable enough to be included. <b>Strong Delete</b>. If anybody else wants a copy of the paper give me your email address and I will send you a copy.

If not then let me finish it with the proper credentials. I had never heard of "Osteoarcheology" before. At least the misguided source gave me a new keyword to use in my search.

<li><b>Comment</b> - OK that does not link to articles but rather a 68 pg document called "Current and Recent Research in Osteoarchaeology: Proceedings of the Third Meeting of the Osteoarchaeological Research Group (The Osteoarchaeological Research Group) (Paperback)" published in 1998 about their meeting in 1995. The ORG seems to be a hobbist organization - "The Osteoarchaeological Research Group (ORG) was set up in 1993 with the intention of bringing together anyone who works with or has an interest in human and/or animal remains. The core function of the group is to provide a forum for the exchange of news and ideas through quarterly newsletters and regular meetings. We are also interested in promoting the provision of careers advice and training in this field, providing information on services for specialists and considering standards for recording/reporting." - I can find no evidence that this organization has been notable in any way or has made any significant contribution to this area of endeavour. <del>A cursory examination also suggests that none of it members are notable (again happy to be corrected and please do).</del> So what we appear to have is a mention of a non-notable person in a non-notable book by a non-notable organization. I still find the evidence of notablity for this person and their claims to be lacking. Those who wish to keep need to provide something more solid than we have seen before. -- --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 17:01, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>If there is academic any peer review of Phillis Jackson's work, I hope to find it. I won't post any more peer review articles until I can review it or find someone who can send me a copy. If I cannot find a copy then I will note that in the article also. If no one in academic circles referes to her work then there must be a reason. She has been around with her theroies since 1992 and keeps popping up, obviously if they don't refer to her, there is a reason. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittonLaRoche_27da.html" title="User:BrittonLaRoche">BrittonLaRoche</a> 18:22, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'll sweeten the pot. Should you decide to file for arbitration then I ask you agree to this term: the loser of the arbitration will pack his bags and leave wiki-pedia forever. I think it fair to warn you, <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><b>IrishGuy</b></a>, I've brought my bag of garlic, a wooden crucifix, holy water and a silver bullets melted down from saint medalions and a small silver crucfix (worn about the neck) I may be mixing myths but hey, vampire orwarewolf whatever type of newbie biter you are, you are going down. If you are the chicken warewolf I think you are ( who else would bite defenseless newbies? ) you won't do it. If you don't do it please take your "chicken warewolf" label, place it on your forehead and go vent somewhere else. Wiki-pedia is better off with out the newbie biters. All one has to do is vanquish the head warewolf, vampire or whatever and nomral people (especially newbies) become civil and will be the happy place its meant to be. Naturally I'm suffering from the bite of the warewolf, I'm foaming at the mouth and biting everyone... but I'm going after the one that bit me. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittonLaRoche_27da.html" title="User:BrittonLaRoche">BrittonLaRoche</a> 19:22, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>"Newsworthy events" is where it falls down.

"Theo Walcott on England football team" is newsworthy, "he has a girlfriend who has a car with a custom number plate and is doing some A-levels and some charity work" isn't.

<li><b>Reply</b> - that's very judgemental of you.

<li>We are not reporters, we are encyclopedia builders, and I think that is exactly our job - to sift what is noteworthy out of the rest.

<li><b>Delete or Merge.</b> I resubmit this nomination. I don't see how sidestepping the problems mentioned above would resolve them. Rather it seems to me that it would merely compound them. If editors wish to improve the main article, or to divide the article down into a 'book article' and also a 'movement article' then it seems to me that this first needs to be discussed and agreed to on the article discussion page. This 'book' article seems to me to be quite POV, calling the students of this book a 'cult', and attempting to place what seems to me to be undue attention on a single contributor to the early publication of ACIM who was a transexual. Please do not delete this discussion until after it has had due time to be fully discussed here.</li>

<li><b>Clarification:</b> For what it's worth, the article calls the book a "cult favorite". It does not say that the devotees are a cult. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 04:29, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>The term "cult favorite" does not mean <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cult</a> per se. Movies, such as <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocky_Horror_Picture_Show_bb05.html" title="Rocky Horror Picture Show">Rocky Horror Picture Show</a> have been referred to as "cult favorites". The term simply means that a particular item holds a great deal of appeal, is perhaps even a centerpiece of the lifestyle of, a comparatively small portion of the overall population. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Deletrix_fe81.html" title="User:The Deletrix">The Deletrix</a> 05:57, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The term <i>cult</i>, when applied to a religious movement in any direct or indirect way, may also imply certain additional connotations beyond simply <i>a group of unusually devoted movie goers</i>. It seems to me that there might be other more effective and less potentially misleading terms or phrases to use here than the term used by the Publisher's Weekly author, such as perhaps the phrase "which has managed to gain a significant group of devoted students." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottperry_5cbd.html" title="User:Scottperry">Scottperry</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottperry_457e.html" title="User talk:Scottperry">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Scottperry_ff53.html" title="Special:Contributions/Scottperry">contribs</a>).</small>

<ul>
<li>Regardless of what editors <i>think</i> the word "<i>cult</i>" means, per <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">policy</a>: "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. "Verifiable" in this context means that any reader must be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, because Wikipedia does not publish original thought or original research." Therefore any individual <i>opinion</i> about the word "cult" is up to the reader, and our jobs are to provide the reader with reputibly verifiable previously published information. Ste4k 01:04, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Unless this is Wikisource, some interpretation and synthesis of source material <b>is</b> required to write the most objective and neutral and verifiable of articles. Refering to ACIM followers as a cult can't be defended by refering to the word "cult" found in a secondary source and saying "look, it's verifiable!" because it is clearly taken out of context. Have you not seen enough people distort the meaning of Biblical text by pulling it out of context to support some non-neutral agenda? There is no difference here. Neutrality of articles requires thinking and interpretation on the editors part and this is a component that cannot be removed from article writing, again, unless this is Wikisource or Wikiquote. Nor should you say Wikisource is built on verifiability-not-truth, for it is surely through verifiability that you are hoping to retain the truth, for it <i>is</i> what you value. —<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntireconciler_2301.html" title="User:Antireconciler">Antireconciler</a> 19:58, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can see your point, but the statement in the article does not refer to "ACIM followers", whatever or whomever those might be. Here is the statement: "<i>It became a spiritual curriculum for many individuals and study groups, well over a million copies have been printed, multiple foreign-language editions exist, and it remains a cult favorite.</i>" I read four different things there, none of which necessarily have to with one another unless one injects a personal bias. The word "<i>cult</i>" itself, only has negative connotations to people whom have only experienced the word from a negative perspective. From an objective NPOV perspective, and from the perspective of PublishersWeekly, this is the term used to distinguish a small religious group from a large religion. The entire first section also gives accolades for the number of books sold. Do you believe it impossible that there is a significant portion of 1.5 millison readers that like cults? The nominator says, "<i>calling the students of this book a 'cult'</i>". Do you think that this statement is true? The nominator also says, "<i>undue attention on a single contributor to the early publication of ACIM who was a transexual.</i>" The contributor in question put forth $440,000 as the initial catalyst and was very open and proud about gendre issues during a time (70's) when "out of the closet" hadn't even yet come out of the closet. The contributor is now deceased, but has left an educational foundation as a legacy. To pull out from the entire article only these two terms and express fears of bad connotations seems to be done from a biased point of view rather than neutral. The term "ACIM" by the way is considered to represent only a faction of the full population that reads books of this title. To present a neutral perspective, factionism should be avoided.

<li>I think it would be helpful on the nominator's part to contact each of the people that voted on this matter earlier, since the nominator believes the reason is different enough to re-open a closed discussion that the other parties believe has been closed and dispensed with. Or if the nominator believes that the question put forth is wholly the same as put forth by the former nominator, then the seperation between <i>Original</i> and <i>Resubmitted</i> sections should be removed. If the latter is the case, then my procedural vote will be striken. Ste4k 01:04, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>A unified article structure or a fractured one?</b> Should this article (and the logic of its creation) remain, then the previous main article on ACIM would essentially have to be deleted and a new article only about the <i>movement</i> would have to be started. This article seems to me to be an attempt by its creator to sidestep the traditional Wiki process of dialogue with the editors of the main article, and to ultimately thereby delete it. I do not agree with the logic of the creation of this article, and I believe that this discussion should be clarified. It chould be clarified here that either there will be two articles: one about the <i>movement</i> and one about the <i>book</i>, or there will be only one article about both. It seems to me that this is what this discussion should ultimately determine. No?</p>
<p>If this is an accurate assesment of what we are discussing here, then the question essentially becomes: Is the <i>movement</i> better fully described <i>apart</i> from the book article or <i>within</i> it? It appears that the creator of this article has not actually read much of the book itself, but instead has mainly focused on the external circumstances of its authorship and early publication, which admittedly are unusual. The actual contents of this book repeatedly stress the need to steer clear of formal organization. Thus no formal officially sanctioned <i>movement</i> has yet formed around this book, but instead the majority of its students focus primarily on independent study of the book. By this I mean that the original editors and publishers of this book have never sanctioned the formation of such an organization, and the majority of its students do not belong to any such formal organization. I do not see why this <i>movement</i> deserves a separate article in Wiki.</p>
<p>I believe that the creator of this article would do best to follow the traditional Wiki course of dialogue with other editors rather than attempting to delete the main article via what seems to me to be a rather circuitous procedure here.</p>

<li>I purposely left the material that was incorrectly merged into this article alone. The rest of the work was my own, and as previously stated, obviously a POV fork, whatever that is.

It has already been <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">pointed out</a> sufficiently that nobody wants to know the truth underlying this topic, and researching the matter has only generated accusations of bad faith, etc. Ste4k 15:48, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Surely, and I can appriciate your desire to not be involved with this topic. It has generated quite a few misunderstandings. It is because I understand the value of your contribution and your desire to bring facts and objectivity to this topic that it can't be fair either to you or the WP community to allow it to be simply deleted. The information you have collected at the above revision is neither a POV fork, not-notable, nor unverifiable, so it can't be fair to the community to simply revoke the information in virtue of your being the lead contributor. Again, I can understand not wanting to be a part of this project anymore, and not wanting your name associated with it. Can we agree, then, to allow the work to be viewed and understood as if were community-authored, and on its own merit?

<li>The past has already occurred. The future cannot be predicted. There are possibilities that neither of us can even consider at this juncture, which looking back upon, a year from now perhaps, we might both say to eachother, "Oh my, had we only had the wisdom not to print that." Hindsight has been granted us to realize how irrevocable the future might be. A truly neutral position is seen as despicable from all perspectives, being contrary to any of them.

<li>I agree that no one could write an article and have no motive and no conception about which viewpoint was the more truthful. Still, I think there is a difference between having a point of view while understanding and respecting the dissenting perspectives, and having a point of view antagonistic to dissenting perspectives. I can understand and respect your viewpoint and yet disagree, but for respect of it, want to talk about it. Discussion would surely be pointless otherwise. Similarly, there are a lot of things I've commited to print that I've later disagreed with, but for respect of it (and really myself), continue forward, willing to continue making mistakes for the sake of learning from them. Surely your viewpoint is not so antagonistic or despicable, else what would leave me here talking with you, totally unconvinced? —<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntireconciler_2301.html" title="User:Antireconciler">Antireconciler</a> 21:26, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Merging two topics which are contentious to each other, which discuss different topics under the same name, only serves to provide more ambiguity rather than disambiguate the title. It would be better to provide the information in an article that is complete, and which has a better topic name, etc. The information that this article contained is not lost and will be re-introduced at such a time when it is more of a complete topic with better research.

<p>Blatant advertising for Aspen Communications. I've written a bit on the issue on the James T. Chiles talk page. Both articles are essentially plugs for Chiles and Aspen communcations. Are Chiles and Aspen significantly famous or noteworthy enough to have articles? If so, please consider modifying the page so it is more neutral. Otherwise, if they cannot be salvaged, they should be deleted.

<p>Delete: This is a false article. This has been started by a person called Paul Akinbola who has been posting made up stuff like this on internet forums (mainly Digitalspy and TV Forum) for the last 2 years. Recently, he's started using wikipedia to either start or edit articles to fit his fantasies in his past username Paul2001 (look at the <a href="../../../c/i/t/CITV_964a.html" title="CITV">CITV</a> article for evidence of this) but he has done plenty of vandalism under the GMTV username as well. You only have to look at the Talk Pages of both users to see he's been warned plenty of times before. Effectivly, he makes something up, posts it on the message boards then creates or edits articles to fit what he posted on the message board (this article was created around 10 minutes after he posted on Digitalspy). <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames2001_2059.html" title="User:James2001">James2001</a> 22:27, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Okay; I'll remove my vote; I don't understand enough about how these deals work. But if I were a business traveller, and there were Microtel and Hawthorn Suites hotels in a lot of the big cities I visited, I would expect Wikipedia to show me something if I typed those names in. Even if they're just a collection of hotels owned by independent groups, they would seem like a major hotel chain. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 15:26, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

They simply tell the reader that a unit in the game exists and describe the units. These articles are also not gamecruft. Wikipedia defines <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">gamecruft</a> as "a selection of content that is of importance only to a small population of enthusiastic fans."

<li>Really? Some quotes picked out, more or less randomly from one of the pages: <i>Tiberium Refineries process raw tiberium, turning it into credits that a player can use to purchase new units and structures. Without a refinery a player's economy will slowly deteriorate until all credits have been exhausted</i>...<i>The tiberium refinery is only capable of storing 2,000 tiberium credits, therefore Tiberium Silos are used to store any additional tiberium refined in the facility.</i>...<i>Orca pads allow for the construction of Orca aircraft. Without Orca pads any Orca aircraft returning to a GDI base will be unable to rearm itself.</i> Sounds like advice to a player to me; i.e., a game guide. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:23, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is a great part in Plato’s Republic when Socrates confronts his opponent, who wants to be told what twelve is but does not want to here that it is twice six, or three fours; nor does he wish to be told that it is an odd or even number. How then are we best to present this information to him? Sometimes telling it like it is is the only way to convay a point. You also point out that these article are of no interest to anyone, but you have not cited a source for that information.

<li>Thank you for taking Wikilawyering to a whole new level -- of absurdity. But for you, let's try to make this simple: let's divide the world into precisely two groups: those who own and play C&amp;C, and those who don't:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Those who own C&amp;C</b>: already have the game manual which contains all this information. Actual usefulness of article for this group: <b>none</b>.</li>
<li><b>Those who do not own C&amp;C'</b>: have no possible use for, need of, or interest in, the information in the article. Actual usefulness of article for this group: <b>none</b>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Total segment of world population that this article is actually useful for: <b>none</b>. The only possible group left would be those who lost their manuals and those who pirated their copies of C&amp;C: the former group is very tiny and the latter group -- whatever their size -- can find assistance in their piracy elsewhere.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- These articles are within their rights to stay, in my opinion. While it may be true that a good deal of the information within the articles are indeed "game specific," the "game specific" information is only there to detail the key differences between each vehicle/unit/etc. between each game. To reiterate, there have been a great deal of changes over the course of time to a lot of these units. For example, as stated, the GDI and Nod APCs eventually differentiated from one-another over the course of time, one becoming amphibious, and one being equipped with a drill for burrowing underground. But I digress.<br />
My point is that this information is here because people showed interest in learning the history of some of these units and equipment. Is that not what encyclopedias are for? Storing information and recalling it when interested? Go read an encyclopedia some time. I'm sure some of the "irrelivant" information you'd find there would turn your head. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoseph_Collins_3462.html" title="User:Joseph Collins">Joseph Collins</a> 03:30, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

I don't get the point why these articles are being dealt first rather than those articles in <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warcraft.html" title="Warcraft">Warcraft</a> universe, for example. I am in support of lessening the number of articles by merging them by their sides/factions/groups (like GDI/NOD, Allies/Soviet, China/GLA/USA). I hope the nominator would prioritize the "bigger fish" rather than the articles that receives lesser attention, and I am eager to wait to see the the deleted articles of Warcraft first before proceeding to delete these articles related to C&amp;C. Anyway, the reason of "<a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a strategy guide</a> is irrelevant since there are no connections of this argument to the article.

<dd>The presence of other poor articles is never an excuse for the existence of a poor article. Two wrongs don't make a right. C&amp;C first, then I'm going to try and clear out the Warcruft.

<dd>Thank you for replying regarding my position! I agree with you in saying that, "Two wrongs don't make a right." However, why can't you correct the "other wrong" of you don't open up your concern on articles like Warcraft that you want to delete by nominating them as early as now? I also agree with what you say, which is, "The presence of other poor articles is never an excuse for the existence of a poor article." But why can't you start eliminating those "other poor articles" that you describe so that it would not be used as "an excuse for the existence of a poor article", in which I assume that the "poor article" you describe is this? This is contradicting to "C&amp;C first, then I'm going to try and clear out the Warcruft." If you want to prove that these "poor articles" from a less famous game, like C&amp;C be deleted first, then you should make a basis for that by making more famous game, like Warcraft as a concrete proof, rather than using a senseless, invented, and irrelevant argument as a proof. Note that I am not judging the fame of both games mentioned; however, it is evident that recent games like <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defense_of_the_Ancients_75a0.html" title="Defense of the Ancients">DOTA</a> is more famous than the latest C&amp;C games, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Command_%26_Conquer%7E_Generals_08b8.html" title="Command &amp; Conquer: Generals">Command &amp; Conquer: Generals</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Command_%26_Conquer%7E_The_First_Decade_4e56.html" title="Command &amp; Conquer: The First Decade">Command &amp; Conquer: The First Decade</a>.

<ol>
<li>The web site is not mine. So I am not Spamdexing, and until I read your link did not even know what it was.</li>
<li>The suggestion that the information lacks verifiability is obviously a false one. The information via the links it refers to provides full references of published scientific literature. Therefore the suggestion that it fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and possibly <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> is plainly wrong.</li>
<li>Toxicity is a rapidly ongoing area with entirely distinct subjects within that area - one for each toxic substance. The information and web sites for each subject will alter independently for each subject. For example, when new research becomes available concerning manganese toxicity, a different web site and references will be inevitably linked only to manganese. The links used at the outset are only what is used at the outset and will inevitably change.</li>
<li>What is the alternative&#160;? - no link to further information and references, or only one link for each toxin which soon becomes out of date, as a better link will become available for some of the toxins&#160;?</li>
<li>Is the purpose of Wikipedia providing information for those that want it, or preventing the availability of information solely due to the possibility of the alteration of search engine rankings for a site that does not even sell anything&#160;? --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnson_MD_4c03.html" title="User:Johnson MD">Johnson MD</a> 14:05, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The Parkinson's Disease site has been repeatedly vandalised. The toxic section has also had large parts of it randomly deleted. It has also been proposed in discussionson the Parkinson's Disease site that, as the page is well over the required size that subjects (such as symptoms and toxicity) be taken out on to other pages, so that only a brief summary can remain on the Parkinson's Disease page. This is one of the reasons for doing it here.</li>
<li>The Parkinson's Disease Forum (the original source of the information on the toxic causes of Parkinson's Disease) is listed on the web sites. However, it is very unlikely that this in itself is going to lead to people getting information about the toxic causes of Parkinson's Disease. It is also three links away from the actaul page for toxicity. Somebody would have to go to in order&#160;: Parkinson's Disease (Wikipedia) &gt; see the tiny link &gt; The Parkinson's Disease Forum &gt; Parkinson's Disease &gt; Toxic causes.</li>
<li>Therefore, is the purpose of Wikipedia to make information more readily available, or to make information as difficult to get to, because the arguments against inclusion solely indicate the latter. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnson_MD_4c03.html" title="User:Johnson MD">Johnson MD</a> 15:12, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Very well said! Bridgeman's website has very little besides his own contributions, as Andrew notes. What he has done is something like a literature review of his topic. However, he's gone very broad-brush in his review, attempting, for example, to say something about any toxin that produces a symptom bearing some resemblance to PD. For each toxin he cites only one article. In a literature review for a peer-reviewed journal this would not be acceptable, since it's too easy to pick and choose among the literature for work that supports a particular viewpoint. Bridgeman has a particular and not widely shared view of PD pathology, and he has selected his articles to support that viewpoint. Since his invention, dopavite, is based upon that viewpoint, that's expected. His website looks impressive to a layman, but it's shallow and very wide. He's really not critically reviewed any of the articles, either, as one would expect in a solid literature review, but has mostly clipped and pasted. His expertise is very open to question in my mind, especially given his hyperbolic claims. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfsnow_eafc.html" title="User:Profsnow">Dan</a> 15:30, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not even particuarly thorough. Rotenone was thought to be causative on the basis of an animal study involving megadoses which induced parkinson-like symptoms and also lewy body pathology. However the family on whom the human model was based were subsequently shown not to have been poisoned with an organophsophate but what was in fact liquid halperidol.

<li><b><s>Weak</s> Strong Delete</b> -- <s>"Weak" because the article I see seems well documented with footnotes at the bottom. I see only one external link; since it was so controversial, I deleted it.</s> "Delete" because:
<ul>
<li>I have no way of checking the paper documents cited in the footnotes and I probably wouldn't understand them if I did.</li>
<li>I normally assume good faith edits. Given the history I'm just learning about, plus the recent rude stuff from <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneral_Tojo_4_545f.html" title="User:General Tojo 4">General Tojo 4</a>, I am unsure good faith can be assured here</li>

<dd>If link-spamming is the issue and the article is kept, I suggest keeping the external link deleted and protecting the page. I am sure if <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnson_MD_4c03.html" title="User:Johnson MD">Johnson MD</a> is legitimate, he won't object to this.</dd>
<dd>If this article's saga gets any weirder or the supporters of this article misbehave, my vote would swing to a "strong delete". Collectively, we editors owe Wikipedia readers reliability even if we may sometimes miss the mark on style, comprehensiveness, etc. That means we can't accept any material we don't think has been proffered in good faith. That's especially true of highly technical medical material.</dd>
<dd>From painful, close observation of someone dying of Parkinson's, I can say this is a horrible disease. Manipulating any information associated with it in the pursuit of spamdexing -- well, that's just downright despicable.

<dd><i><b>Upgraded to "Strong Delete"</b></i> -- "Strong" because of the additional bad faith edits made by the article's supporter(s) since I voted 13 hours ago. If we can't trust the article's editor(s) and supporter(s), then the article is unreliable. Additionally, the article's backer(s) have insisted on keeping their vanity link in place, claiming it's vital to the article as a source, yet it's not a peer-reviewed source. Taken together, these two behaviors are just so revealing. I am unfamiliar with sock-puppet sanctions and bans but I think administrators would be justified to throw the book at these people. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A.

<dd>What exactly have I as a supporter of the article, due simply to the overcrowding on the main page, done to deserve to have "the book thrown at me". Assume good faith in established editors at least. And btw, I left the link in one place as a compromise, not endorsing it, considering the debate surrounding it. External links do not come under the Verifiability policy, thats just for References, however, if the site is a valuable external summary of the topic it could be relevant. Fully protecting the page has simply made me unable to improve it, leaving this debate from now on as a sham as I cannot improve on my initial referencing efforts. Could someone change the full protection to semi-protection so I can actually put the references on? And if this article is deleted the admin should ensure that the references are kept on the main page, for all the bloat that this will make on the page I think it is worth it given the reputations of the journals being used. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 03:14, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am a little confused about your comment still. You seemed to <i>imply</i> in your vote that supporters of the article, regardless of their efforts should be dealt with by administrators. I know that there were a string of edits made by the sockpuppets in question, however, I am behind the scenes trying to improve the article due to my firm belief that the content would bloat the main article, and forking is legitimate because of this. I am hampered in this by the recent full protection put on the article, something which I do not approve of but cannot find a quote to back up my belief that AfD articles should be free to be improved by participators in the debate. Sorry for confusing your comment with something against my edits. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 04:46, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure how to address your concerns. Your efforts to improve the article are commendable and I will take your word for it that there needs to be a separate article. I am reluctant to change my "delete" recommendation, however, if that could lead the forces of sockpuppetry somehow tainting the reliability of an article (medical articles in particular). I just don't know enough about protection, etc. to know how to reconcile your intentions with my concerns; maybe someone more knowledgeable does.<br /></dd>

<dd>"Rotenone is an insecticide that is known to cause Parkinson's Disease. Insecticides are also known to affect well water. Rotenone is commonly used in powdered form to treat parasitic mites on chickens and other fowl, and so can be found in poultry. Rotenone is produced by extraction from the roots, seeds, and leaves of certain tropical legumes. Rotenone inhibits tyrosine hydroxylation, which is essential for the formation of dopamine. So Rotenone causes Parkinson's Disease by lowering dopamine levels.[12]"</dd>

<dd>"Rotenone is an insecticide, which when given intavenously to mice has been demonstrated to cause a model of Parkinson's disease. Rotenone toxicity is caused by complex I inhibition, depletion of cellular ATP, and oxidative damage. These processes cause neuronal loss in midbrain dopaminergic neurons, leading to depletion of dopamine in the brain.[17]"</dd>

<dd>I wrote that after coming from a case presentation about the suspected human cases of Rotenone which were widely reported. The presentation was from one of the Neurologists who examined the family and was tasked with looking for gene markers for them. The bottom line is that there have been no human cases of PD caused by Rotenone. So a statment like "Rotenone causes Parkinson's Disease" is misleading.</dd>

<dd>As for references, I think if you can't read the original references then you have to take it on faith that what was said in the article is what is reported. Based on the behaviour of General Tojo so far I have a big problem with putting any faith in him. Whilst there are peer-reviewed papers knocking about on these toxins the evidence is nowhere near strong enough to be making the kind of statements listed here. I will endeavour to get some of my lab-based colleagues to have a go at this article, but the disruption GT has caused so far is exactly the kind of thing that puts busy academics off putting Wikipedia in the first place. A compromise solution would be to keep the page here, keep the toxins off of the main PD page, but to protect the page, and go and round up some biochemists to start it off from scratch.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm not sure I understand what criteria is being used for deletion but (per all above) this is notable and quite well verified. The title may sound silly but if that's how it was translated from Korean - so be it. Ifnord 13:35, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Using this criterion, stolensidekick.com should have been kept. Can anybody explain the differences to me?
<ul>
<li>Easy indicator: Stolensidekick.com has 12 (<i>twelve</i>) distinct Google hits. "Dog Poop Girl" has 14,200 Google hits... <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 15:18, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Nonsense, it's about verifiability. Both are verifiable, but this one will likely be kept while the other was deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> I was quite surprised to know that the article was once deleted. Possibly people do not know much about the mind set of Koreans. Koreans are some how a race who concerns very much about their "face", like the Chinese. This is somehow more serious if an incident is related to foreign people. I heard a case that my friend (who is a Hong Kong person) who refused an old woman beggar on a subway train with his elementary Korean, but the beggar insist. He accidentally pushed her onto the ground, and fellow in the same cart rushed to punch the old beggar. He was shocked and asked his Korean friend, and his friend replied because others thought the old beggar is losing the face of Koreans in front of a foreigner. I also noticed that the girl involved was asked to leave the colleage she was studying, and this article was translated into Chinese, as well as the original Korean version. Therefore, the article is worth to keep. I will say this incidence is a reflection of the Korean culture. -- <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomchiukc_7f38.html" title="User:Tomchiukc">Tomchiukc</a> 08:55, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please read the first link of the Korean version. It was an old man who helped her to clean the dog's poop! How shameful it is! A young girl shall pay respect to an old man, but the old man was helping her to clean the dog's poop! If she was sensible, she will do the job herself and say sorry to the old man as well as the See Lai sitting next to her, but she decided to walk away. She shall really feel ashame. -- <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomchiukc_7f38.html" title="User:Tomchiukc">Tomchiukc</a> 09:01, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Tornavalanche qualifies for WP:BAND because they have members of notable bands and have a record out with a notable band.</p>
<p>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such. Is cited in notable and verifiable sources as being influential in style, technique, repertory or teaching in a particular music genre.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> The band is completely non-notable, and even ignoring the fact that I <i>despise</i> the "contains at least one member..." rule, I'm not sure why that other band (which is Tornavalanche's <i>only</i> assertion of notabiliy) is itself notable.

<p>The result of the nomination was <b>no consensus</b>.

<li>Factual Errors, Needs Balance: it is my habit not to get involved in this sort of argument but as this article mentions me by name allow me to point out at least two errors. I was the Staff Director of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence but I served under Chairman Larry Combest (R-TX), 1995-97, not under Dave McCurdy for those earlier dates. The staff study mentioned, IC21, was written in 1995-96 under different circumstances and with different conclusions than described. I would add that the description of the so-called Burundi exercise is not entirely accurate and does not comport entirely with the views of the Aspin-Brown staff. This is piece as it currently stands is more polemical than informative. It needs to be toned down and it needs balance. OSINT is not some sort of Manichean struggle.

<li><b>Keep, cleanup and caution</b> the individuals who try to use this article, which clearly is about an encyclopedic topic, as a soapbox.

<li><b>Keep, cleanup, caution notes, and expand participation</b>. Lowenthal is correct to point out the inadvertent error, which I will correct now. More helpful would have been an actual entry adding to the group knowledge. The caution is noted, and should be extended to Alan Simpson, who is a spiteful blow-hard, and the CIA folks, who cannot stand having the truth about the inadequacy of their program pointed out. While Lowenthal is not correct on the Burundi exercise, and it was a major factor in getting the Open Source Agency into the 9-11 report, I am quite happy to move strongly away from "soapbox." My intent in not creating my own wiki at oss.net as I was asked to do, and instead pointing to the wikipedia, was precisely to engage as many people as possible in the sharing of knowledge through the wikipedia idea. I will be at the wikipedia conference in Boston in early August and would be very glad to participate in an offline session about how to make this more useful and less conflicted. It would be great to make it a special project with a moderating super-editor (not me) who can lock in truthful statements subject to repeated deletions by spiteful antagonists, and who can block untruths or other sidebars as necessary. I found it quite shocking to have all the references deleted simply because they were primary. Isn't that what knowledge is about? I have spent 18 years advocating open source intelligence in support of public policy, and I can tell you it has been a sacrifice, not a joy ride. I actively solicit group help in wikifying the page, in expanding the table of contents, and in identifying and blocking people who delete useful information out of spite. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Steele_6ced.html" title="User:Robert Steele">Robert Steele</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_Steele_3cb2.html" title="User talk:Robert Steele">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Robert_Steele_5aef.html" title="Special:Contributions/Robert Steele">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

I have worked VERY HARD to make this about OSINT and to avoid references to me or my web site, but the sorry fact, however mean-spirited a handful of critics might wish to be, is that the HISTORY of OSINT would not exist if I had not, at great personal sacrifice, lost money on each of those annual conferences, and taken the trouble to digitize the contributions from 1992-date. I am ready to do whatever it takes to satisfy the Wiki process and to attract OTHERS to contribute, and I am most grateful to the organizers for blocking the individual that was doing repetitive deletions out of spite.

<p>NOTE: If the delete notice could be removed, it would at least not DISCOURAGE new entries by OTHERS. My press release should result in at least 100 potential new international contributors, and many of them, if they see the delete notice, will choose not to waste their valuable time.</p>

<dd>Robert, I've posted a note to your talk page, however I'd like to reiterate that we aren't really what you are looking for. We aren't a site where you can just edit willy-nilly, though the press might lead you to believe otherwise. As has been pointed out to you by many, many editors, there are site policies with which we expect contributors to read and bear in mind when they add material to Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not there for anyone's essays or boosting of a particular topic.

I agree with the person who says joint point at my web site (as the master page does) but the whole point of what I have tried to do with the sub-structure for OSINT is to set the stage for OTHERS to contribute. Am going to go passive now and wait to learn more at the Wiki conference. It would help if the delete notice could be removed, and the master page could be "locked down" or at least blocked from CIA deletions--they HATE having me point out the fact that for 18 years they refused to pay attention to this, and now they have one young man with $5M to spend, when we should have someone of the stature of the Librarian of Congress, with $500M on the way to $1.5B to spend--simply trying to put all this in context. I will immediately comply with any guidance from the group between now and Boston. 68.227.195.23 15:01, 6 July 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Steele_6ced.html" title="User:Robert Steele">Robert Steele</a> 17:59, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>You know I fear there are misassumptions here. The organisation behind the wikipedia phenomenon assuredly has a president (or similar role). But it appears to me as a relatively new editor here that he exercises the same rights here as any other editor. "We" thus do not have a president, because "we" are all autonomous editors, some of whom have (for example) rights to administer the project. Thus we have organised chaos, if you will. Based upon <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assume_good_faith.html" title="Assume good faith">assuming good faith</a> the wikipedia phenomenon has grown and is widely respected. As an entity it is not manipulable. This AfD nomination is a case in point. An article that was in a parlous state was nominated. It has been substantially cleaned up. At the end of the period of the nomination a decision will be reached. The article should not be a soapbox. It needs to end up flat, neutral and factual. In that way the nominator will have done us all a service, as will those who worked on the article. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 21:16, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think what he means in that he talked to Jimbo on the phone and straightened out what is and is not encyclopedic. Hey, try this on for size: "Wikipedia is not a call to action, except for building a general encyclopedia." I guess the "soapbox" clause covers that. I think that that rest of Mr. Steele's agenda might be better suited for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikia.html" title="Wikia">Wikia</a> or something like that. He is obviously looking to network with other people about his area of expertise. Clearly, he is politically adept and is not going to make a nuisance of himself at Wikimania 2006. -- 67.121.114.153 21:55, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Don't you just hate it when people think they have rank and try to pull it? Mr Steele is doing himself no good in my eyes. I support retention of the article, but by no means in its current form. The <i>topic</i> is notable. Even the fact of the <i>soapbox</i> is notable. But the article is execrable. At the end of this AfD we need a diligent editing process to finish stripping out the POV and uncited stuff, to look at the articles it has spawned and do the same task, and maybe even AfD some of those if they exhibit the same POV tendencies. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 22:05, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Quote from the article: <i>This article will be about the very large impact that <b>black culture</b> has in France.</i> Excuse me, what is "black culture"? Second, this entry does not really pertain to culture in any way, except in listing personalities known from culture. <i>This will be an extremely large database, eventually having thousands of black French personalties in the politics, military, music, cinema, fashion, sports and arts of France.</i> Oh my. This better be stopped it before it grows "extremely large", since it is an indiscriminate collection of information, grouping together random and unassociated individuals by skin colour. Lists shouldn't contain loosely associated topics. On a side note, the page is a mess and has been tagged for cleanup since July 2005 (actually it's a pity it wasn't deleted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_French_Black_people&amp;oldid=19584125" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_French_Black_people&amp;oldid=19584125" rel="nofollow">when it was new</a> and under the name "Black france" (!)). <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunkmorten_c486.html" title="User:Punkmorten">Punkmorten</a> 15:42, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, it shows that the list is pointless because: It exists with the purpose of showing the impact of a certain culture in France by listing a number of unassociated people who have accomplished things in different fields.

<li>There's a huge amount of references sitting on Google. Perhaps the issue is one of reference and correcting the miscategorisation. WP:BIO applies, but I think WP:PORN is a bit of an overstatement. She only shot one or two soft-porn movies and not very good ones at that.

<li><b>Comment</b> This seems like a well meaning but somewhat over-enthusiastic attempt to delete a biography from a smaller country. The South African movie scene isn't big, and what there is is under-represented in IMDB, and is unlikely to seem "well known" to foreign Wikipedians. This person seems to have made a mark in South Africa, and her name crops up as the subject of a number of articles on Google <a href="http://www.feministafrica.org/04-2005/matchett.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.feministafrica.org/04-2005/matchett.html" rel="nofollow">[54]</a><a href="http://www.mothertongue.co.za/women-artists.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mothertongue.co.za/women-artists.htm" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>. There are hardly any African editors on Wikipedia, especially in special interest areas like the alternative scene and the arts - shouldn't Wikipedians rather be encouraging biographies of this sort? <a href="../../../z/a/i/User%7EZaian_7381.html" title="User:Zaian">Zaian</a> 15:47, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Keep</b> and <b>Rewrite</b>. I've added this vote after doing a bit of background research. She is notable on a number of counts, including as the winner of the FNB Vita award for Best Actress for 2001 in South Africa. I've added an intro paragraph to the article and another biographical link. I think the rest of the article needs to be rewritten to remove its heavy and self-indulgent style. As it stood, it was hard to separate facts from porn from opinion. The article also omits mentioning <i>Raya</i> and <i>What the Water Gave Me</i>, which other sources mention as two of her most significant works. <a href="../../../z/a/i/User%7EZaian_7381.html" title="User:Zaian">Zaian</a> 16:34, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

A Google search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Beck+is+a+hipster+doofus%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Beck+is+a+hipster+doofus%22" rel="nofollow">"Beck is a hipster doofus"</a> gives <i>no</i> hits, for example, and a majority of the results the provided "source" searches show nonspecific references. All it takes is some blog to have written "hipster doofus" and "David Lee Roth" anywhere on the same page to generate a hit. -- <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScientizzle_e07a.html" title="User:Scientizzle">Scientizzle</a> 19:21, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Just look at the results. "Beck is such a goofy hipster doofus." "...hipster doofus Beck." "Beck was just lookin' like a stoner-hipster-doofus..." "...Beck's hipster doofus lyrics..." And on and on and on. I ask again, how better to collect all these references together than with a Google search? Remember that the claim in the article is that the term is "frequently applied" to this person. Anonymous 198736 21:00, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I did look at the results. Clearly there were <i>some</i> hits. However, those three Google searches came back with 124, 86 &amp; 38 original hits, respectively, which hardly qualifies as "frequent" for the internets. My point still stands that a Google search is not citable a source as defined by <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> &amp; <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>--it's actually closer to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. If you found a source that discussed the term "hipster doofus" as something widely applied to these three musicians, that might be worth something. Then the issue would be whether "hipster doofus" deserves its own article or should such sourcing be applied to the individual articles of the subjects at hand. -- <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScientizzle_e07a.html" title="User:Scientizzle">Scientizzle</a> 21:13, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My apologies if I came across as brusque! The recreation of the article was indeed out of process, and I'm sure you nominated it in good faith. My comment wasn't directed at you; rather, I was annoyed at the original AfD (which I missed) because a one-minute google search (or even a quick consultation of the press page on the company's own website) would have rendered it unnecessary. I see a few new users contributing to the article, and this discussion, and I'd hate for them to be driven off for want of a little legwork on the part of AfD participants. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font color="red">Z</font>iggurat</a> 22:43, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I have no data on sales but would honestly be suprised if the sales for this book have reached three figures. Just because something is verifiable and can be presented in a NPOV fashion does NOT mean it is encyclopedic. For example, I have a dandelion in my yard. This can be verified, it can also be presented in an NPOV fashion. But encyclopedic? Of course not. Notability is the key. The dandelion is not.

<li><b>Comment</b> What if we merge all three of the articles into one article titled "Books written by Stephanie Apruzese"? The guide to deletion says "<i>Books are notable if well-known, and should be listed under the author if not</i>" --<a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikallover_048c.html" title="User:Tikallover">Tikallover</a> 15:14, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The author is not notable either. The standard for notability for an author per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work</li>
</ul>
<p>The author in question currently has one book that is self published and one other (the one in this article) that is not published at all. I have no sales figures but would be suprised if the one book that has been published has sold more than 20 copies to people outside the family/friends of the author. Writing a non-notable book does not make an author notable. In this case, neither the author NOR the book(s) in question are notable. I strongly suspect that the author of the books is the person who wrote the wikipedia articles also. Wikipedia is not for self promotion. Once this, or any other book by this author (or even all the books added together) meets ANY of the criteria for notability under <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a> I will happily vote to include them here. Until that happens, and it's not even close, then I will continue to wish Stephanie well but will also continue to vote as noted above. <a href="../../../d/i/p/User%7EDipics_9566.html" title="User:Dipics">Dipics</a> 16:13, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Very Strong Delete</b> Let's cut to the chase here. The author of these articles, <a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikallover_048c.html" title="User:Tikallover">Tikallover</a> is also the author of the books in question and is, in fact Stephanie Apruzese. This can be found from the authors page at <a href="http://tikallover.deviantart.com/journal/" class="external free" title="http://tikallover.deviantart.com/journal/" rel="nofollow">http://tikallover.deviantart.com/journal/</a> . This article and the others about this authors books, published or not should be deleted not only as painfully obviously non-notable but also as flat out gross vanity.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I felt quite a bit of sympathy for Stephanie — more than she'll ever know, owing not only to my own situation, but to a coincidence of names. I <i>did</i>, until she started using emotional blackmail, for which I have no tolerance whatsoever. But this is all irrelevant. A self-published book with no critical mention, however earnest or compelling, does not merit a Wikipedia article. It is <b>not</b> a judgment on the work or the person, however much either the author or her detractors may try to turn it into such. However, I do wish her well with this work, which may provide her a positive avenue to help express and possibly control her self-destructive feelings. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 22:28, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

And according to Jimbo, the person who made Wikipedia, says that encyclopedic content "is information which is verifiable and which can be easily presented in an NPOV fashion". He also says this about Qubit Field Theory, which is something of little importance, "I'd say that not more than a few thousand people in the world have heard of it, and not more than a few dozen understand it. (I certainly don't.) It is not famous and it is arguably not important, but I think that no one would serious question that it is valid material for an encyclopedia. What is it that makes this encyclopedic? It is that it is information which is verifiable and which can be easily presented in an NPOV fashion."

It gives a good list of 10 notability criteria. This book doesn't come close to meeting any of them. I have no data on sales but would honestly be suprised if the sales for this book have reached three figures. Just because something is verifiable and can be presented in a NPOV fashion does NOT mean it is encyclopedic. For example, I have a dandelion in my yard. This can be verified, it can also be presented in an NPOV fashion. But encyclopedic? Of course not. Notability is the key. The dandelion is not. And, nor is the book per <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a>.<a href="../../../d/i/p/User%7EDipics_9566.html" title="User:Dipics">Dipics</a> 04:54, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The author is not notable either. The standard for notability for an author per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work</li>
</ul>
<p>The author in question currently has one book that is self published and one other (the one in this article) that is not published at all. I have no sales figures but would be suprised if the one book that has been published has sold more than 20 copies to people outside the family/friends of the author. Writing a non-notable book does not make an author notable. In this case, neither the author NOR the book(s) in question are notable. I strongly suspect that the author of the books is the person who wrote the wikipedia articles also. Wikipedia is not for self promotion. Once this, or any other book by this author (or even all the books added together) meets ANY of the criteria for notability under <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a> I will happily vote to include them here.

<li>I suggest a keep. I work for a MAJOR telecommunications company and after internal review of it and other AJAX type tools it looks like we will be using Dojo as a toolkit for our internal tools.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Dojo is notable and has recived backing from industry giants. The article is in a bit of a state, but it's not the annoying spiel it started as.

<li><b>Keep</b> please. I am Lgh. Toni Harthoorn is a very modest man. Which of you have never heard of or seen the capture gun in action? If you check out any episode of Daktari you will see AM Harthoorn credited as technical advisor on the show in the end credits. You can obtain several books that mention him through Amazon: these include books by AM Harthoorn himself, by Sue Hart, by George Adamson, Iain Douglas Hamilton and by several other people well known in the African wildlife sphere. Anyone who knows anything about African wildlife will recognise the above names. My material on this man and his invention are all verifiable, and should, I hope, render the article as keepable or at least as something deserving of a better epithet than 'fishy'. -- <a href="../../../l/g/h/User%7ELgh_81a0.html" title="User:Lgh">User: Lgh</a></li>

<p>Please see links to other glamour photographers on Wikipedia, they too share the bios of the photographers, some of which are Rolando's friends today.</p>
<p>As a published author for the second largest photography book company, Amherst Media, and a writer for Cygnus Publication magazines including Studio Photography, PMA Daily, and others I disagree. Not to mention Rolando came on board in 1999 with what Google.com ranked as the top glamour photography site for many years, now Glamour1.com.</p>
<p>Gomez has 27 years of photography, worked with many glamour models and even discoverd the April 2006 Playboy Playmate Holley Dorrough. Gomez has taught over 85 "Glamour Photography" workshop from Canada to Mexico and as a photographer has worked in 39 countries. His recent glamour photography book has even made the Amazon.com list, not to mention his previous DVD on glamour photography was produced by the author of many glamour books, Gary Bernstein.</p>
<p>Gomez has spoken on glamour photography to record breaking crowds at Photo Plus Expo in NYC, the top photographer's annual show, Photo Imaging Design Expo in San Diego, Fotofusion in Del Ray Beach, Fl., and has taught glamour the Palm Beach Photographic Center and the Julia Dean Photo Schools in Los Angeles. For more information see his biography at www.rolandogomez.com</p>
<p>Not to mention, the recent issue of Leica World News magazine ran a three page article on Gomez and his glamour photography. Gomez is sponsored by Leica, the Rolls Royce of cameras, Olympus, Chimera, Hensel Lighting, Lexar and many other companies. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Rolandogomez (<a href="../../../r/o/l/User_talk%7ERolandogomez_5776.html" title="User talk:Rolandogomez">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rolandogomez_8dd9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rolandogomez">contribs</a>) 23:38, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Mr. Gomez, I hope you realize that every one of your edits to Wikipedia is recorded under your logged-in name - that is, Rolando Gomez. The article you've created is on its face obviously about yourself, and that is the main problem here. Generally speaking, it is much better to wait until someone else writes about you, since that helps indicate that you are notable enough for inclusion. Please also consult <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a> for further explanation. <a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidG_2ba7.html" title="User:RidG">RidG</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/i/d/User_talk%7ERidG_5b69.html" title="User talk:RidG"><font color="#6666CC"><font size="0.5">Talk</font></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RidG_4a2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/RidG"><font color="#6666CC"><font size="0.5">Contributions</font></font></a></sub> 00:01, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm more than happy to "clean up" or edit what you may need, but I have made significat contributions to glamour photography in the past ten years, enough to earn a spot in the masthead of Studio Photography and as a successful author for Amherst Media, a top photography book publisher in the United States. Not to mention my contributions in general as a photographer and photojournalist. I'd be happy to provide tearsheets.</p>

<p>""Comment"" Thanks Tevildo--I'd be happy to send you a copy of my new book, email me an addy. As I mentioned before, I'm still learning this, and when I initially posted the article, I was still editing, I didn't expect an automatic review and for it to be sent to the deletion category.</p>
<p>Now, since I'm still learning this, have five kids and my own business to run/take care of, what is the next step? Is the article going to be deleted? How is it taken out? Etc. I might add, I saw in the WP link to "vanity" where "newbies" should not automatically be added to the deletion category immediately, they should be addressed first to give chances of correction before arbitrarily judged. Not trying to be mean here, as printed words are often harsher than spoke words, but please understand, I'm new to this and I can contribute as I learn more, in fact, as mentioned earlier, I was asked to come here by another person. Respectfully, Rolando Rolandogomez 01:10, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>To help you in your decisions, I'll share a few observations. I have a long bystander interest in the development of computers, information systems / data bases and worldwide understanding and have met many of the pioneers of modern computers and the world wide web. Hence, I am a fan of Wikipedia. I also enjoy photography as a hobby and took a workshop class from Mr. Gomez. It is evidently that juxtaposition of interests and my comments which gave rise to the current discussion.</p>
<p>First I applaud (as I think would Mr. Gomez) the volunteer efforts of editors to include useful, and exclude non useful, entries. I rather admire this effort.</p>
<p>Relative to the case at hand:</p>
<p>Mr. Gomez did submit amateur model Holley Durrough to Playboy which led to her success in becoming a Playboy "centerfold" model (Miss April 2006). While I was at a workshop taught by Mr. Gomez I met Ms. Durrough. I found her to be an exceptionally photogenic model and a very candid, ambitious, and personable young lady. She (and other models) expressed confidence in, and loyalty to, Mr. Gomez. Mr. Gomez enjoys a very high level of respect from such models.</p>
<p>In the interests of disclosure, such confidence on the part of the models and the enthusiasm of Mr. Gomez led me to enter into a minor business relationship with Mr. Gomez. However, such minor relationship is insignificant relative to my posting.</p>
<p>I empathize with you in dealing with matters of taste, art, politics and personalities. Relevant to the definition of 'glamour photography' my take is that it need not be "erotic". I suggest "including erotic images and other images which are somehow focused on attractiveness in a way not usually found in day to day life". OK, call me verbose, but I think some enlargement would be good.</p>
<p>Good luck with your deliberations.</p>
<p>Steve H</p>

Hm. Perhaps if more information were added, it would be considered worthy of an article?
