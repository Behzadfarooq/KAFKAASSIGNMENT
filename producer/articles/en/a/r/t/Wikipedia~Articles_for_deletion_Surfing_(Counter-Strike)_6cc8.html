<li><b>Keep</b>; this is <i>not</i> a game guide about a technique used in Counter-Strike. It is an article describing a <i>popular</i> type of Counter-Strike level. It gives a general summary of the concept with a screenshot. It doesn't tell you how to play and in no way attempts to be a strategy guide. Google test comes up with tons of hits for searches like <i>surfing "counter-strike"</i> and <i>surfing counterstrike</i>. No, you cannot go down to the library find published sources about surfing in Counter-Strike, but you can find thousands of Internet sites about it to establish verifiability. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 15:24, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd be interested to hear a more detailed description of the nominator's reasons for wanting to delete the article; WP:NOT and WP:V don't tell me much. What part of WP:NOT does the article violate? I can see WP:V to a certain extent, since the information from the article is not found in reliable, published sources, but I'm sort of surprised that this article has been singled out in that way. Thousands of articles on Wikipedia do not cite published sources but are not nominated for violating WP:V. I've read the nominator's general response to this, which is something along the lines of "I'll get to those eventually," but I somehow doubt the nom intends to nominate <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_6a6b.html" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a> for not citing published sources, or perhaps <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a>. The sources that the article cites should be considered reliable in the proper context (talking about the Counter-Strike mod in question). This is not a vote, so unless the nom can actually describe how WP:NOT and WP:V apply here, I don't see how a bunch of "delete per nom, gamecruft" responses represent an adequate debate on the issue. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 20:50, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Looking at WP:NOT now, I see that you're trying to use the reference to "game guide." Step back and look at the context, please. The policy is "while Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction." The phrase "game guide," in this context, means "guide to playing a game." This article is <i>not</i> a guide to playing a game, but rather a <i>description</i> of a popular mod; therefore, WP:NOT <i>does not apply</i>. You're using the words of an official policy out of context as part of your personal mission against "cruft." <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 21:29, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> How? I'm looking at WP:NOT right now and I'm not seeing anything applies. I'm not trying to be difficult, but WP:NOT does not say anything about "Wikipedia is not a place to write about popular mods to a game which 19.5 million people own." <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 21:15, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The game is notable. Every little thing associated with the game? Not so much. Violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> by my reading of it (and yes, we already know not everyone agrees with that) but even if it didn't it's not notable in the context of a general encyclopaedia.

<dd>Please reread the context of "game guide." It is in the context of "Wikipedia is not an instruction manual." Do you contend that the article is an instruction manual, or did you misunderstand WP:NOT? This applies to everyone who has said that the article violates WP:NOT. Do you contend that the article is written as an instruction manual? <i>If not</i>, WP:NOT <i>does not apply</i>. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 22:50, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree with your reading of NOT to begin with (instruction manual is not ment to limit, but game guide is ment ot expand the concept of not being instructive in general by citing a specific instance); but I also believe that the maps are primarily instructive. They have exceptional utility in assisting game play.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 17:22, 19 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What do you believe "game guide" means? I'd be interested in hearing your personal definition, based off of the following policy:
<dl>
<dd><b>Instruction manuals</b> - while Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice ( legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s. This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Also, the article just contains a list of names of popular maps. I don't see how that is of "exceptional utility". Did you have this AFD confused with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Individual_Counter-Strike_maps_3142.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Individual Counter-Strike maps">another one</a>?

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is <b>not</b> a game guide or instruction manual, I don't how it could be interpreted that way. It is a descriptive article about a mod and gametype, how it plays, and then a list of maps. There are no instructions. As far as verifiability, the game itself is an acceptable primary source. As far as issues not addressed in the nomination, "counter-strike surfing" results in 1.27 million GHits, so it is at least semi-notable as a mod probably being played by thousands of people. (Of course, that does need verifiability.) --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 00:16, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm sorry, I've had difficulty getting a response to this issue. I quoted the relevant part of WP:NOT above. Could someone define "game guide" to me?
