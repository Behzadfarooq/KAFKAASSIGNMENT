<p>This page appears to be a vanity page. While a search of Amazon reveals she has indeed published a book, that alone would not make one noteworthy. Millions of books have been published by millions of people. They don't all rate a page on Wikipedia. Nothing about her beyond self-promotion seems noteworthy. The links to the various press releases are links to services that contract press releases from small businesses. Again, they all appear self-aggrandizing. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENtk53s_64da.html" title="User:Ntk53s">Hebron</a> 21:28, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Please don't count me twice for deletion as I am the originator of the AfD nomination, but Ms Woodbury, a google search of your name and email address reveals your email address as being "yourfirstname@arhiannonwaitscompany.com", so I seriously doubt you have a neutral interest in this article. If the person you seek to promote is indeed noteworthy, write the article as such. As written, it appears more and more to be as <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliga10_0ee9.html" title="User:Caliga10">Caliga10</a> wrote, an article where "Ms. Waits herself edited Wikipedia, or at the very least a friend/employee of hers." Since you apparently work for Ms Waits, you are actually in a far better position than any of us to show why she is notable. But you haven't done that. If Ms Waits is noteworthy enough to be included in wikipedia, please tell us why. Please give wikipedia users something other than links to a bunch of sites owned, leased or sanctioned by Ms. Waits. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENtk53s_64da.html" title="User:Ntk53s">Hebron</a> 06:50, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The links at the bottom of the page are not all owned, leased or sanctioned by her company. Google is not by her company either. I am trying to add links to magazines, shows and publications to show this. If you look at the magazines you will find they print her work. The show clearly has a link. There are links to everything. We didn't want to just list her as a psychic because she is alot more. I also put links to a few shows she has spoken at. Remember these are deleted off after a period of time and not all shows advertise online.</li>
<li>I am trying to show reasons. I need input instead of insults.(E-mail I have received). I have been accused of harrassment, insulting, being rude, stupid, uneducated etc. I have been accused of being Rhiannon and advertisement. All because I am trying to put bios of people that appeal to New Age and spiritual groups. Rhiannon really is not just New Age but these group seems to be drawn to her more so than others.

<dd><b>Annoyed Answer:</b> it's called a talk page. USE IT. Can anyone help me clarify this for her? We don't email other editors about articles, we talk to them... on their <i>talk</i> page. While it is not required, it's also reccomended that you use proper grammar.</dd>
<dd><b>Calmer, more detailed answer:</b> the places where you would discuss Rhiannon Waits would be my talk page, your talk page, and the article's talk page... and possibly here. At this point, I'm pretty sure everyone agrees you are not Rhiannon Waits. However, you are too close to her to present an unbiased viewpoint, something we value greatly. It would be prudent if you took time to read <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">wikipedia's policies</a> that I pointed out on your talk page.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> unless the author can find a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reputable source</a> to support notability. I couldn't find any substance in related web pages, and IMHO other Wikipedia editors shouldn't have to do all the work in removing puff and bias (one problem being that the existence of psychic phenomena is of course <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">POV</a> and so notability cannot be based on that alone). I would have said keep as a single-para article if it weren't irredeemably promotional (and apparently written by the subject's office staff <a href="http://www.psychic-rhiannon.com/arhiannonwaitscompany.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.psychic-rhiannon.com/arhiannonwaitscompany.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>).

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia does cover notable New Age authors, certainly - the difference is that I've heard of 4 of the 5 people you mention or their work; plus the pages about them were not generally started by people with a vested interest or partiality in the subject matter, as can be seen from the balanced style most are (I hope) written in. Links might be useful in supporting notability, at least if they are to well-known print publications (such as newspapers) reporting on or reviewing the subject. PR releases just clutter the web with needless verbiage that few take seriously, and have made it very hard for me to extract any relevant factual information about the subject. To put it bluntly, it currently looks like one big publicity bubble with little content, at least none of general interest. <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> remain relevant here. --<a href="../../../c/e/d/User%7ECedders_7ad5.html" title="User:Cedders">Cedders</a><sup><a href="../../../c/e/d/User_talk%7ECedders_4da3.html" title="User talk:Cedders">tk</a></sup> 20:29, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I wrote the following in a good faith effort to provide some suggestions to you, but was prevented from saving it due to and edit conflict... you had just written your comments above during the time I was editing mine. After reading what looks like a sarcastic retort on your part, I'm only going to continue leave these suggestions as a matter of continued good faith in the hopes you weren't being facetious, but were rather serious. Sarcasm really won't get you anywhere. Please keep that in mind when you write to a discussion page. Anyway, my original comments where as follows: It does not help or lend credibility to your argument that you work for Ms Waits, and that a new wikipedian has logged on to lend support to your cause under the name "Athena Louise", a name that also appears under one of Ms Waits websites as being the pseudonym of a friend of hers, a Ms Barbara Melit.<a href="http://www.psychic-rhiannon.com/friendrhia.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.psychic-rhiannon.com/friendrhia.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> It leaves other wikipedians (in my opinion) looking at this like it is a publicity campaign, along with all the contracted press releases. My suggestion to you is to follow the old adage "less is more". Example, <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Sites_9eef.html" title="Kevin Sites">Kevin Sites</a> is a journalist known by millions of people around the world for his blog and his prominence on Yahoo's website. Yet take a look at his page here on wikipedia... it's not even a full page long. The more "fluff" and unsourced claims you put in this article, the more you link to magazines most of us have never heard of, the more it appears you are trying to make someone seem famous that really isn't. My advice, and it's only my opinion, is to trim the article down to something smaller and well written. Leave a link to her homepage, and put all the magazine links there. I say all this, but even with improvement, the article may be better written and not appear as a publicity stunt, but it still lacks any indication of notoriety. I've thought about this... what is notoriety. The best answer I can give you is not to list what <i>she has written</i>, but rather include what <i>others have written about her</i>. Tolstoy and Asimov may have been among the most prolific authors of all time, but what makes them truly notable is only partly based on what they wrote... the rest is based on what others have written about them. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENtk53s_64da.html" title="User:Ntk53s">Hebron</a> 21:54, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The show is aired in Washington - yet also online.Even ABC is airing a TV show online now. You asked for proof of an author - I gave you 2 books and a CD. You asked for proof she is a syndicated columnist. I gave links and proof. You asked proof that she is a motivational Speaker. I gave links, proof and names of owners of several shows. You asked for proof that she works in the same group as people on here. I gave proof and links. You asked to see things writen by OTHERS. I gave you links. You said Prove she is a psychic. I sent you links and I offered numbers to people that validated her predictions while she was on stage.You asked I edit the page. I did and still am. One says add more links - another says shorten. I am thankful for all suggestions. The nice ones for sure. I have tried e-mailing others as I was - and was accused of harrasment even though I was not rude. I have asked for suggestions. What is next? You will not contact me for phone numbers or e-mails. What do I do next? 68.1.122.211 19:18, 7 June 2006 (UTC)MICHAELLE68.1.122.211 19:18, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>I would like to make a statement. I am not Dannion Brinkley's manager. I did work with him for over 20 years. His wife has been his manager the past couple of years.

<p>I, and LightStream Productions has worked with Rhiannon since 2003. The comments I made about Rhiannon Waits on our site and in her book, are my experiences with her, and are true and I stand by by what I wrote. I will put her ability up against anyone!! If anyone has a question, you may email me directly!! It is absurd to think Rhiannon wrote my testimonial nor do I appreciate anyone making such claims without checking with me!

<dd>Yes I had Mel Contacted so he could verify I nor Rhiannon wrote the testimonials on his page! You want proof and when I try to supply it, you get insulted. Why do you throw these things out there if you do not want me to offer validation?68.1.122.211 19:27, 7 June 2006 (UTC)MICHAELLE68.1.122.211 19:27, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I tried to start a page on Lisa Iris. It was deleted in less than two minutes because it belonged to me and no one else had added content. In two minutes.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I tried again, with the article remaining 5 minutes and was deleted. Can someone explain to me how this is right? Is anything I put on here going to be deleted? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelleWoodbury_17cd.html" title="User:MichaelleWoodbury">Michaelle</a> 02:55, 9 June 2006 (UTC)MICHAELLE<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelleWoodbury_17cd.html" title="User:MichaelleWoodbury">Michaelle</a> 02:55, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Michaelle, there must have been a server error or something at that time. There isn't a deletion log entry for Lisa Iris, and pages simply aren't deleted unilaterally without discussion--as you've seen above with Rhiannon Waits.--<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliga10_0ee9.html" title="User:Caliga10">Caliga10</a> 12:12, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay well I don't see a log now either but it gave the name Academic Challenger. But I will take your word on it.
