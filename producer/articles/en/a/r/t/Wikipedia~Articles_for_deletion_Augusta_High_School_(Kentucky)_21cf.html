<li><b>Delete.</b> The school does not want it on a public website. This should be put onto the school's website. (Aaronl23 19:19, 6 February 2007 (UTC))</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> School is notable, school and/or writer do not <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a> the article. Changes made yesterday to the article should address the school's concerns anyway - it previously included an unencyclopaedic list of current school officials down to the level of PE teachers and subject aides. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 06:03, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If rewrites are needed, then rewrite, but deletion is not necessary for addressing editing concerns. Is there an accusation of copyright violation? I didn't see any of this content on the school's web page, but would be happy to see sources- any copyrighted material should of course be removed or rewritten, but that still doesn't require the deletion of the whole article. -<a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisherQueen_a50d.html" title="User:FisherQueen">FisherQueen</a> (<a href="../../../f/i/s/User_talk%7EFisherQueen_b952.html" title="User talk:FisherQueen">Talk</a>) 17:14, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It is not on the school's website. It is a book called "History of Educational Institutions in Augusta, KY" written by W.H. Hanson. The book contains all of the article along with the superintendents and principals prior to 1977. The only thing that is not in violation is the facts section that shows the present athletics and other various things. (Chickendog456 17:17, 7 February 2007 (UTC))</li>
<li><b>Reply to comment</b> All copyrighted material should be deleted or rewritten and cited to that book, I agree- thanks for providing the source. -<a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisherQueen_a50d.html" title="User:FisherQueen">FisherQueen</a> (<a href="../../../f/i/s/User_talk%7EFisherQueen_b952.html" title="User talk:FisherQueen">Talk</a>) 17:22, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It might as well be deleted then because it is a bit of controversy. You are welcome, it took some digging to get to the bottom of this (Chickendog456 17:40, 7 February 2007 (UTC))</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It is quite interesting that this book ("History of Educational Institutions in Augusta, KY" written by W.H. Hanson" - searches by name or title), is not in any of the State of Kentucky's public libraries, <a href="http://kdla.kyvl.org/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;PAGE=First" class="external autonumber" title="http://kdla.kyvl.org/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;PAGE=First" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, it is not in the Univ of KY database <a href="http://kysu.kyvl.org/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;PAGE=First" class="external autonumber" title="http://kysu.kyvl.org/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;PAGE=First" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> it is not in the US Library of Congress Database <a href="http://www.loc.gov/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.loc.gov/index.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, nor available at any of the major retailers. I believe it would be beneficial to see proof that this book actually exists before anything is removed from the article.<a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkierRMH_4ae2.html" title="User:SkierRMH">SkierRMH</a> 23:55, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It is a local book. It is very clear that it would not be in print. Why would anyone want to read "History of Education Institutions in Augusta, KY" that would live in Hawaii?

<li><b>Comment</b> Such a book would be a small-press, local publication, so I remain neutral on the question of whether the book exists. Any user is welcome to edit the page, and copyright violations should certainly be rewritten and cited. But none of that has anything to do with deletion- they're reasons to improve the article, not to delete it. -<a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisherQueen_a50d.html" title="User:FisherQueen">FisherQueen</a> (<a href="../../../f/i/s/User_talk%7EFisherQueen_b952.html" title="User talk:FisherQueen">Talk</a>) 00:47, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> if we are going to have articles on high schools, and I guess we are, then this is as good as any. I see no reason why we should heed the school board. We're not under their jurisdiction, and they have no right to control how they are viewed through outside sources.

<li><b>Keep</b> when we press that save button, we license our contributions to wikipedia. if the book is on google books, or someone will mail copies of the book to many libraries, we may be able to judge it as copyvio, but just because someone dislikes history, that doesn't mean it should disappear.<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDUBJAY04_bab5.html" title="User:DUBJAY04">DUBJAY04</a> 20:07, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There is lots of good information and pictures on these articles and it is one of the "better" school articles on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../h/d/t/User%7EHdt83_c8de.html" title="User:Hdt83">Hdt83</a> (<a href="../../../h/d/t/User_talk%7EHdt83_57f5.html" title="User talk:Hdt83">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hdt83_8593.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hdt83">contribs</a>) 04:05, 9 February 2007 (UTC).</li>
<li><b>merge and stubbify</b> but merge the two articles as 90% of the material repeats. The book is a MA Thesis from the University of Cinncinati, as listed in Dissertation Abstracts. it exists only at that University, and only in typescript; -- the record in the University of Cincinnati Library is <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/oclc/37660424?page=frame&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fuclid.uc.edu%2Fsearch%2Fo37660424&amp;title=University+of+Cincinnati&amp;linktype=opac&amp;detail=CIN%3AUniversity+of+Cincinnati%3AAcademicd" class="external free" title="http://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/oclc/37660424?page=frame&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fuclid.uc.edu%2Fsearch%2Fo37660424&amp;title=University+of+Cincinnati&amp;linktype=opac&amp;detail=CIN%3AUniversity+of+Cincinnati%3AAcademicd" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/oclc/37660424?page=frame&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fuclid.uc.edu%2Fsearch%2Fo37660424&amp;title=University+of+Cincinnati&amp;linktype=opac&amp;detail=CIN%3AUniversity+of+Cincinnati%3AAcademicd</a>. I suggest going instead to <a href="http://uclid.uc.edu/" class="external free" title="http://uclid.uc.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://uclid.uc.edu/</a> and searching for it. There is a discussion of whether to use manuscript sources on the WP:RS discussion page; for this, I do not consider it an RS, but more important it has been guessed that nobody will go to Cincinnati to check the manuscript copy against the aticle. It will be a nice example of how gullible we are at WP, because the style is very unlikely. Since the history does look interesting , a stub would be justified.</li>

<dd>I understand why the author wants to remove it; he has presumably thought better of his copyvvio, and he should just admit it and let us get rid of the articles on that basis or merge and stubbify.

<li>If this is a copyvio, <b>delete without prejudice</b>. In general, I would also suggest a <b>delete</b>, as much of the information appears to be vanity, indicating a run-of-the-mill institution with nothing that really stands out.

<li><b>Delete</b> without prejudice to re-creation. I think <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a>'s reasoning is pretty much right, and it matches my own thoughts. Although the article is full of content, it seems to me that notability is neither asserted nor evident: though the school has a history, it is in practical terms no different from any of its peers. There is no reason for me, as an outsider, to regard this school as worth knowing about, and that's what notability is all about. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 19:34, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
