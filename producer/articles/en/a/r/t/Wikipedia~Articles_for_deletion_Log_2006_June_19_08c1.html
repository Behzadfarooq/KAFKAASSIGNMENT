<dd>I am sorry but I couldn't figure out what you meant to say just then. WP:POINT is not relevant to someone commenting on a discussion, particularly when you are the nominator, and the fact that you mistook the precident (sic) to be delete when infact it was merge and redirect, which is not what AfD is for. You could have had the merge discussion somewhere less disruptive, which BTW, is what WP:POINT is about. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans</span><span style="color:#009000;">e</span><span style="color:#0000FF;">ll</span></a> 00:33, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For future reference the spelling is precedent. AfD is not the place to try out things you aren't sure about. It is for being certain of something yourself before coming here. Did you put this on the relevant Noticeboards and Wikiprojects before doing this? Did you prod any of the articles?</dd>
<dd>And your wanting everyone else to know exactly the steps you followed to nominate this, which is probably relevant since you had to fix up your RfA because it wasn't formatted correctly, is just ludicrous. Actually warning me for 3RR for removing the single-use instructions that interfere with this process shows a damn lot of immaturity.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Capitalistroadster. There's seems to be blanket nomination for every contestant of this particular BB by the same nom, which completely ignores what the individual person may be notable for, particularly for things outside the show. I note the nomination text is *exactly* the same as another nomination, despite substantial differences in the subjects. Before doing a nomination, it is important to read the individual article, and see what specific reasons there are for deletion or retention. Now, if the nom feels the other stuff isn't adequate, than please say so, and explain why, but please don't present a copy/paste nomination rationale. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 05:12, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> without prejudice against recreation when it becomes more established. I would say that all journals are notable... once they get going. One issue (and only hardcopy?) is not quite enough. The journal is not published by any known publisher, a category in which I would include online-only open-access journals; this could just be a web page which never gets updated again. (The people listed in the journal table of contents do appear to be real, however.) I am also somewhat put off by the fact that the author of this article appears to have created this article and Martin Reimann, who is the journal's editor (and which was only fleshed out after I tagged it {importance}), and has not been back since: it smells like <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 05:48, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> unless there are third party sources.

<li><b>Keep</b> It would be helpful to get someone who speaks German to go over the site and provide a summary for the rest of us, so we can better evaluate its notability with reference to German academia.

<p><b>No vote</b>. This was prodded for five days, but I feel it requires consensus. Prod nomination was "vanity/nn: 1) dubious references to Mr Bowker have been deleted from other articles already (see discussion page for details) 2) "Dean" of Trinity College, Cambridge: There's a master of Trinity, who may well be notable. This "dean" story seems like an attempt to trick readers into believing Mr Bowker was a leading figure at Trinity. He was obviously not. 3) As other people have pointed out, there's thousands of people who may claim to have been 'consultants for UNESCO.'". For myself, I can add that the article has been around since 2003, and that enough editors have contributed to it to make its deletion necessarily controversial. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 01:09, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

The dean of any Oxbridge college is usually notable (not by virtue of that position, but due to the sort of people who are appointed).

<p>This is the brother of Søren Aabye Kierkegaard, and the article focuses on that. There's little independent notability, although the subject of the article was a bishop.

<li><s><b>Weak keep</b></s> <b>Strong keep</b> - He appears to be slightly notable because of the Kierkegaard connection (not enough on it's own) - but IMHO being a Bishop pushes him over the top.

<p>There is also no evidence that these <i>are</i> just "a couple kids with a myspace site". The original music on the site proves that they created music.

<dd>Note also that the article deleted twice was Stefan Roberts. Looks like all these articles need serious review. A few of them are his name inserted into articles on real titles.

<p>The title of this article is 'Samuel Goldner', when it in fact refers to Stephan Goldner. Further, the article is largely plagiarised from Scott Cookman's book <i>Ice Blink</i>. It is inaccurate (Cookman's conclusions are very much disputable, many bordering on fiction) and clearly not NPOV. <a href="../../../f/i/p/User%7EFipe_d9f8.html" title="User:Fipe">Fipe</a> 03:18, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> Perhaps I should add to that. The article could certainly be cleared up to remove the plagiarism (parts are lifted word for word from <i>Ice Blink</i>, particularly Chp. 15) and flag the heavy NPOV as Cookman's opinion (and look at the criticism of Cookman's book, in Martyn Beardsley's <i>Deadly Winter</i>, for instance), but this wouldn't change the fact that the page title refers to someone other than the article's topic. <a href="../../../f/i/p/User%7EFipe_d9f8.html" title="User:Fipe">Fipe</a> 03:30, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>think</b> how does this differ from any other list on wikipedia? it is not exorbitantly large - it is just a good little reference article that fits well within the realms of an encyclopedia. Why would <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_layout_engines_%28CSS%29_fced.html" title="Comparison of layout engines (CSS)">Comparison of layout engines (CSS)</a> remain? If Language pages are linked to a list of language codes, the css article should equally link to some real world facts. The size and character of this would hardly justify a transwiki or merge with the wikibook on css. --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIancarter_9538.html" title="User:Iancarter">Iancarter</a> 04:02, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b>- of course I'm a web developer, so I may be a tad biased. Cutting it down to the basics and transfering the rest to another wiki with a link would also be acceptable. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtw_80b7.html" title="User:Artw">Artw</a> 05:06, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Transwiki</b> to Wikibooks. It really looks like a reference manual and the non-list parts aren't very encyclopedic. If it's kept for some reason, please rename to Lis of CSS values and keep the capitalization in the headers and the title in check. It should be "CSS <b>v</b>alues" and "CSS <b>p</b>roperties". The bolded letters should not be capitalized. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:41, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Transwiki</b> to wikibooks, this has a number of problems: the source is shot through with HTML/CSS by its nature, and pure wiki mark-up is the ideal. The article makes no reference to versions of CSS (could be fixed). It is badly named because it lists CSS values. An article telling you about the origins of the idea (who/what/why) would be useful... but then that's probably better handled in the main CSS article. The article is really not suitable for Wikipedia since large parts of it are very howto-ish/technical documentation. It's really part of a wikibook. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 12:48, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The phrase "muie maneliştilor" means "suck it up, you <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manele.html" title="Manele">manele</a> lovers". My best guess is that the article is a hoax, since it's hard to believe a <i>manele</i> group would denigrate its own genre. The 1500 or so hits on Google are only such vulgar invectives on discussion forums, not the name of a group. The few hits that do talk about a music group are Wikipedia and one website that copied our article word for word. — <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdiJapan_10e9.html" title="User:AdiJapan"><font color="#0000C0">Adi</font><font color="#8080FF">Japan</font></a>&#160;<a href="../../../a/d/i/User_talk%7EAdiJapan_6c19.html" title="User talk:AdiJapan"><font color="#4040FF">☎</font></a> 07:47, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just for fun I put the first paragraph in babelfish to see what an NPOV but not fluent translator would come up with:</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>That it is essential condition for the existence of a State of Right that the Powers Public, with total respect at the beginning of reciprocal independence that governs them, they fit his action and they exert his attributions within the marks that the Constitution and the laws indicate to them, and that all the inhabitants of the country can enjoy the guarantees and fundamental rights that she assures the Political Constitution to them the State;</i></p>
<p>versus, the article's translation.</p>
<p><i>That for the Rule of Law to exist, public authorities must carry out their activities and discharge their duties within the framework of the Constitution and the laws of the land, respecting fully the principle of reciprocal independence to which they are bound, and that all inhabitants of the country must be allowed to enjoy the guarantees and fundamental rights assured them by the Constitution;</i></p>
<p>I would like to see whether other Spanish and English bilinguals would really translate "un Estado de Derecho" -- in capitals in original -- as "Rule of Law" as opposed to a "State of Law" with a clear focus on the State rather than the legalities of the situation. It changes the whole meaning of para. 1 and there may be other issues in the remaining paragraphs, too. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 01:34, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a puzzle that I'm struggling to understand. What is Aspies For Freedom? A forum or an organisation? Does it have forum users or members? Leaders or owners? When its only visible activist Joe Mele was removed from the group, all that happened, as far as I can tell, is his account was banned from the forum.</p>
<p>My instinct says that the entire <a href="../../../a/u/t/Template%7EAutism_rights_movement_d039.html" title="Template:Autism rights movement">Template:Autism_rights_movement</a> is a fiction, documenting nothing more than a clever manipulation of Google and Wikipedia. All the Amy Nelson-created autism sites and domains are virtually contentless, with extensive links to each other. At dmoz they would mostly be rejected as linkfarms. This is not dmoz - a directory of websites - but an encyclopedia of things that exist whether or not websites about them also exist.

<li><b>Keep</b> - It does seem rather silly to just delete the article when it will simply be added again in the future. Surely it is better to place the standard declaration at the top to say that Wikipedia is not happy with the article and that it needs expanding and leave it at that until there is a consensus that it has reached an appropriate level of depth? I have attempted to expand it but an antivandalism police man (sorry, forgotten your name) felt that my contrabution on threesomes was not appropriate. Perhaps threesomes should be split from this article?</li>
</ul>
<p>Further it would be very silly to remove this article when (working from the framework that has been established) there is so much more to say on the subject. There must be surveys and articles written on households with 3 partners? It is far more common that people realise. Perhaps more work could be done to also include famous people who have lived in menange a trois such as Alan Moore (considered to be the greatest comicbook writer in the world) who lived with two ladies.</p>
<p>There are many areas in which this article needs improvement and a wide range of information that could easily be inserted to do so.</p>
<p>Like I said mark up clearly that it needs expanding but please don't delete as that would be wasteful and short-sighted.AWD--84.92.120.61 00:58, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your response seems to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume bad faith</a> on the part of the nominator, who made reference to the appropriate guideline. That guideline, btw, says in the second full paragraph that it is a rule-of-thumb that can be ignored in favor of keeps or deletes as desired. I'm not sure what you mean that it's only a guideline "not to delete". I, for one, will await more evidence and arguments, but if the band is kept, I think all the bio's (except Lobby Loyde's) ought to be <b>merge</b>d and redirected.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase02</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 16:05, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You may be shocked to hear that prior to 1995, information was stored on stuff called "paper" rather than on Google.

<dd>Your qualms with WP:MUSIC are quite clear but you don't address where I went wrong in judging notability. The article spoke for me: a band with no album releases to their name, article without a single reference; I don't understand where you can blame my impaired judgement, especially considering you're aware of my ignorance on the subject matter. By nominating this article with a particularly concise opening statement I <i>acknowledged</i> my ignorance and let the discussion take the course it needed to.

<li><b>Delete unless...</b> the authors find some way to make this more than just a grab bag of facts. The problem here is notability. Too much of the article is just information. The authors need to give some organization to the article and some background: when was it built, what was there before, what is there besides stores, any public institutions there (lawyers, government)? I don't like malls in general but realize that in many places, especially the US, but maybe also Australia, urban growth the past half century has not favored traditional, mixed-use commercial/public/residential neighborhoods. Such traditional neighborhoods certainly have sufficient notability to be included in Wikipedia: I think of <a href="../../../u/p/t/Uptown%2C_Chicago_082f.html" title="Uptown, Chicago">Uptown, Chicago</a> where I live. However, these newer communities often find it difficult get covered here. I don't want to have a blanket rule that says "no malls can be featured here unless they meet stringent criteria." The criteria should be no more restrictive than those that allow, for example, Uptown, Chicago to be on here. Otherwise, most people who live in new communities will find that their commercial life will be excluded, by fiat, from Wikipedia. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 22:30, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is an electrical component patented in 1966 — it's not exactly a new thing. The stub was created in March 2005 by an anon, before which it had been a redlink on <a href="../../../m/%C3%B6/b/M%C3%B6bius_band.html" title="Möbius band">Möbius band</a>. It's an interesting application of topology to electronics, and in my opinion deserves at least a stub. (In fact, I felt it deserved an image too, since the article didn't do a very good job of describing how it actually works, so I drew one myself.) Yes, it's an obscure topic and the references aren't that great — but they're sufficient to establish that this thing exists and has been written about in respectable magazines (see the quotes on the rexresearch page).

<li><b>Keep</b>. I wouldn't expect something from 1966 to have much of a web presence, if it never found a practical application. Nevertheless, it's verifiable.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Mobius-strip geometries occur today in several recent patents on clock distribution on chips. The one I heard of had counter-rotating traveling waves going around the edges of the strip, with some inverters bridging the edges to pump the thing, and of course taps studded all over the place. This becomes practical only because modern switching frequencies (5-10 GHz) are on the same order as speed-of-light x size of chip. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 14:28, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. So far, I've seen no evidence that this cannot be verified, only that it hasn't yet been verified. Given that Aleem Pahalwan is said to have been active in India in the 1940s, it doesn't surprise me that a Google search turns up few, or no, hits. Verification can be done in other ways: references to books, newspapers, etc. I think there's little doubt that this is verifiable, ie it can in, principle, be verified. As such, it should be kept and we should give editors the chance to find and post sources. Wrestling is a big Indian sport but unlike football, field hockey or cricket, it hasn't been covered as much by urban media. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 01:41, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - An issue I have with this is that this guy could very well be made up. It may be theoretically verifiable if someone happens to have an Indian newspaper from the '40s, but for all we know now and most likely will know in the future, its made up. Also, if you read #2 under the official verifiability policy, it states "Editors adding new material to an article should cite a reputable source, or it may be removed by any editor." Thus, we are requesting it be removed. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 15:56, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well I'm quite new here, but I was presuming looking at the sheer number of articles of this form that there has been some kind of discussion on whether they should be allowed at some point before. This article could be genuinely useful to a reader (admittedly not in its current state). Eventually this article can be put into some kind of chronological order, like other genre articles, and be annotated, which is impossible with categories. <a href="../../../i/a/e/User%7EIae_1a56.html" title="User:Iae">Iae</a> 16:21, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> - That sounds like a different kind of article. Lists (at least the ones I've seen) are just typically an alphabetic ordering of articles. I'm not quite sure what to call the type of thing you are describing, but I wouldn't use the term "list". <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 16:39, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>By annotations, I just mean small comments alongside the entries. Most lists have these. In the case of this article it would be beneficial to have the years the artists was active, or, in the case of confusing entries such as <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiohead.html" title="Radiohead">Radiohead</a>'s or <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broken_Social_Scene_a94c.html" title="Broken Social Scene">Broken Social Scene</a>'s, to clarify exactly why they are included. This can't be done with a category. If you don't even think that would be worthwhile, then fair enough, I'll let it go and give up. However, after looking through the articles <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_musicians_by_genre.html" title="List of musicians by genre">here</a>, very very few are good enough to not be replaced by an equivalent category so I can't even give an example of what I'm describing. Basically, I'm coming round to agreeing with you, but I can see potential usefulness for an article like this. I still think a proper discussion should be conducted somewhere relevent to <i>all</i> the genre list articles beforehand though (if that's possible). <a href="../../../i/a/e/User%7EIae_1a56.html" title="User:Iae">Iae</a> 17:05, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Junior sports teams are rarely notable and do not meet any of the notability criteria for inclusion on WP. There is no reason why this page is any different - only notable teams should be included - so I would like to see the removal of ALL Junior/Juvenile and Children's teams that do not have genuine notability. How can any team in a Junior B/Juvenile/AAA Hockey League be notable? These teams do not compete in significant tournaments (though I'm sure their Moms and Dads and very proud) and are not professional. WP is not intended to be used as a catalogue of things that exist but an encyclopedia of things which are notable. This, and all the other Junior teams, are not notable and should be removed on mass. At best they could be mentioned on the article about the league - if the league is genuinely notable enough to warrant its own page - most will not. Robertsteadman 14:29, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>For information - the first nomination was closed early due to too many comments, spamming by someone trying to protect the page and personal abuse being meted out at those wanting the page deleted. Robertsteadman 14:31, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: Akin to the Rookie leagues - <i>each and every team</i> of which has an article - and the numerous amateur leagues in baseball (the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Cod_League_f96c.html" title="Cape Cod League">Cape Cod League</a> is averages a few hundred spectators at best during its games, and even some teams there have articles), the Junior B leagues are all feeders into Junior A and college programs. The mere fact that nom has, in both this debate and the previous one, equated these league with kiddie squads demonstrates that he has little idea what these leagues are about and who plays in them, and therefore can have little enough grasp on their notability.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Sports bore me to death. I've only watched 2 sports contests in my entire 45 years although I've unwillingly attended dozens. I have no interest in any sport league, minor major junior senior whatever. Nonetheless, Wikipedia isn't written to please me.

If there's room for <a href="../../../o/l/l/Ollie%2C_Iowa_f0e9.html" title="Ollie, Iowa">Ollie, Iowa</a>, a town of 240 people, I think there's room for this article and also for the other teams in all the junior leagues in Canada. For those who insist that this team has no notability, perhaps you were thinking of me, and thank you kindly because, yes, for me, it is absolutely non-notable. But as others on here have pointed out, the team has real notability for, at the very least, the 100,000 people in Thunder Bay. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 02:05, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It is apparent you didn't read into it or didn't research it on any of the google hits you found last time you AfD'd this article. It is not a problem, I will explain. This JUNIOR league is multi-tiered during the regular season. As I can see, you seem to like euro football, so you might be able to understand this system. 3 different levels of hockey compete in interleague action... Junior "B", Juvenile, and Midget AAA... at the end of a roughly 40 game season... the 4 Junior "B" teams are the only ones allowed to compete in the playoffs... the playoff champion competes out west for the Keystone Cup. The Minor level teams compete in their perspective All-Ontario playdowns and no longer have anything to do with the TBJBHL... their results in the league do not enhance or disrupt their seeding in the Ontario minor playoff systems and are only used as "filler" for the Junior teams and as a way to warm up for the playoffs for the Minor teams. The Juvenile and Midget teams have not been included in the TBJBHL article other than in passing and have little to do with the Northern Hawks and therefore have nothing to do with this AfD. Hopefully this helps you. <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDMighton_5f64.html" title="User:DMighton">DMighton</a> 00:07, 21 June 2006 (UTC) -- Also, Junior A, B, and C classifications are only partially based off of skill level... in fact, they are based mostly off size of the centre they play out of and what league is closest to their town. As well, Junior B teams could be competative in Junior A or Junior C, as Junior C could be competative in Junior B and even a few could survive in Junior A... examples of successful league switching is all over the hockey world... the Barrie Colts, Markham Waxers, Orangeville Crushers, and Listowel Cyclones just to name few involved in an uncountable amount of league moves. Even the Bradford Rattlers just jumped directly from Junior C to Junior A. <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDMighton_5f64.html" title="User:DMighton">DMighton</a> 04:29, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The cat is only famous because of its owner. Anne Frank is notable, her cat is not, as it never did anything other than simply exist as Anne Frank's pet. By this argument, is the pet of any famous person notable? Maybe I will litter Wikipedia with articles about atheletes pets. Similaraly, the Sky Mirror itself is not notable. The artist may be, but at best, this piece of art belongs in that artist's article. What historical significance does it have? As I said, notability is in the eye of the beholder.

<li><b>Comment</b> I should have said this sooner, but I've been so wrapped up in other stuff... mostly logging statistics and earning a paycheck... In the hockey community, especially in Canada where there is no official allowance of sports scholarships and in the US where Canadian athletes almost never get half-scholarships due to their Canadian citizenship... Junior hockey, even at its lowest levels, is considered to be either compatible or higher calibre and higher in importance than College/University hockey (I'm not saying that Uni Hockey is unimportant -- but let's face it, a kid doesn't grow saying he wants to play U of G over his local Junior C club -- at least not where I'm from). This "Kiddie team" stuff has just got me thinking... Junior hockey teams are not and have never been considered lower in the pecking order than scholastic hockey... and this is a widely regarded belief in the hockey community. Junior hockey is to hockey as College sports is to Basketball or American Football. <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDMighton_5f64.html" title="User:DMighton">DMighton</a> 01:41, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This level of team is notable. For example, the <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarnia_Bees_4130.html" title="Sarnia Bees">Sarnia Bees</a> have 10 NHL alumni players.<a href="http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayersByTeam.jsp?team=Sarnia+Bees" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayersByTeam.jsp?team=Sarnia+Bees" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. The <a href="../../../p/e/m/Pembroke_Lumber_Kings_1d4e.html" title="Pembroke Lumber Kings">Pembroke Lumber Kings</a> have 40 NHL alumni. <a href="http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayersByTeam.jsp?team=Pembroke+Lumber+Kings#P" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayersByTeam.jsp?team=Pembroke+Lumber+Kings#P" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> The <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stayner_Siskins_734e.html" title="Stayner Siskins">Stayner Siskins</a> have only 1 NHL alumni <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stayner_Siskins" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stayner_Siskins" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>, and yet the team has a major influence on the town. Even without being a feeder system for the NHL, this level of hockey is notable, as many of these teams draw large crowds, are major influences in their communities, and are large business enterprises. I don't understand why <a href="../../../g/o/_/GO_Finch_Bus_Terminal_2fb2.html" title="GO Finch Bus Terminal">this Go-Bus station</a> is notable, but for transportation/train fans, these type of Go stations are important. Many of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Ice_Hockey_66a9.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Ice Hockey">Wikipedia:WikiProject Ice Hockey</a> members have stated that they believe these Jr C, B, and A teams are notable hockey enthusiasts. Anyone wanting to work in the hockey industry in Ontario would be very interested in learning about these teams. Fans hoping to spot the next <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Gretzky_af9c.html" title="Wayne Gretzky">Gretzky</a> seek out these teams. (Gretzky was playing Jr.B hockey less than 2 years before he played in the NHL). Heck, look at all the fuss made over the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Category%7EStaal_family_6db7.html" title="Category:Staal family">Stall family</a> and it's easy to see why fans would be interested in where players come from before the NHL.</li>

I did exactly the same thing with <a href="../../../w/o/r/Talk%7EWorld_Junior_Ice_Hockey_Championships_c90c.html" title="Talk:World Junior Ice Hockey Championships">Talk:World Junior Ice Hockey Championships</a> when I put on merge tags and proposed a rename.

<p>The current guidline for living athletes is as follows:<br />
"Sportspeople/athletes who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports, including college sports in the United States." These are paid athletes, and they play at a level equivalent to U.S. college teams. It makes sense then, that their teams would be notable too.<br />
That's the current policy.<br />

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. OK, let me give you a better reason. You're making yourself more notable every time you bash Wikipedia. Just as you claim the right to tell everyone about Wikipedia's "stupid" policies on your website, so Wikipedia editors should have the right to tell everyone what <i>you</i> are doing. If you're revealing the identities of so many Wikipedians...well, shouldn't we be entitled to reveal your identity? You just want to make yourself look good by trying to delete and cover up the facts about your life as an activist.

<li><b>Note</b> (1) The above "Keep" vote is by the author of the article. (2) I searched the website of Black Belt magazine <a href="http://www.blackbeltmag.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blackbeltmag.com" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> and got no results for "Speedman" or "La Tourrette". <a href="../../../n/a/w/User%7ENawlinWiki_2ff5.html" title="User:NawlinWiki">NawlinWiki</a> 11:33, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The above made no attempt to email info@thespeedman.com or webmaster@thespeedman.com and ask which black belt magazine speedman was featured in, and disregarded the sale of speedman books in Amazon.com. It is recommand if the above would like to know, they should at try email, and assume "good faith".

<li>Um, no. The article itself should be verifiable without an editor having to email someone (at an email address not listed in the article). And it's reasonable to assume that if you say something is "featured in black belt magazine", that one doesn't have to look beyond a magazine called "Black Belt magazine". If you have verifiable secondary sources proving this person's notability, post them -- don't make us play treasure hunt. <a href="../../../n/a/w/User%7ENawlinWiki_2ff5.html" title="User:NawlinWiki">NawlinWiki</a> 17:10, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. And how would you know that no one made an attempt to contact that email address? In any case, there seems to be little trace of speedman <i>being featured</i> in black-belt magazine but a lot of google hits mention his repetitive <i>advertising</i> in that same magazine. Quite a different perspective. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 05:54, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>--NawlinWiki is continuing the pattern petty bothersome vandalism of in asking to delete articles with no assumption of good faith, and with no attempt to verify a website by asking it's author. This lack of valid research by Nawlinwiki shows that this article was put up for deletion in bad faith.</p>
<p>Pascal.tesson is equally wrong as if a email was attempted, they would have learned there was an article written about Speedman, as well as adversting, and posted such attempts for such information here as proof that the person was invalid. Google is not the only source of research that will verify articles that exist from a publication. As it's clearly obvious not everything is on the internet. Pascal.tesson should clearly have known that there are other valid sources then the internet itself. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasssiveego_09fe.html" title="User:Masssiveego">Masssiveego</a> 06:08, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

This martial art style is not a hoax, it is valid, notable and it is real. Please do better research before making false accusations.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think most of this is "verifiable" but just hasn't yete been "verified." The distinction is important. Hazing and pranks are an important part of school life, and this article did a good job of bringing this together. It avoided the common mistake of just listing info. It's NPOV, verifiABLE, and doesn't sound like being too much OR to me. It deserves the change to grow and be challenged and grow some more.

<li><b>Comment</b> I see your point, but few mentally stable people on Wikipedia are likely to attempt terrorism, and people who do most likely don't have the technology. Spinach doesn't have a negative physical impact on people (you can joke, but it's true), and as for herpes, you can't really encourage a disease in that way, as nobody wants to catch it. Bullying, on the other hand, is probably practiced by hundreds of kids who may come looking to this page for ideas. Like I said on the talk page, I don't object to the encyclopaedic treatment of the topic, but I do think listing different pranks, complete with instuctions, is a bit much.

<p>The information in this article seems to be unverifiable. It is assembled from four different web sites which contradict each other in various ways and have various factual inaccuracies. None of the web sites cite <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>. I went to the nearby university library today and can find no reliable sources about it. I was reluctant to list this at first, since I've heard of this tank, but the more I thought about it the more I realized that I've only ever heard about it from Internet tank fan sites, never a reliable source. Without a reliable source, the article must go, based on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Would it be acceptable for now to trim or qualify portions where the sources are in disagreement? I too respect and appreciate the legwork contributed by the nominator, but I'm unconvinced that AFD isn't premature. Two apparently-independent web pages predate the wp article: Achtung Panzer<a href="http://www.achtungpanzer.com/p1000.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.achtungpanzer.com/p1000.htm" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> and Panzershreck<a href="http://www.panzerschreck.de/panzer/pzkpfw/p1000.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.panzerschreck.de/panzer/pzkpfw/p1000.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> (other web sites that appeared since then look like they may be sourced from the wp article itself). Neither site provides reliable sources, but both sites agree that a project with the name existed, and roughly agree about the intended size and armament. Achtung Panzer, at least, appears to be fairly reputable as far as such enthusiast sites go, and presuming good faith on their part I'm willing to provisionally allow that the whole thing isn't just a hoax. On the other hand it does seem to be disturbingly hard to find information about the Ratte compared to the Maus and E-100. --<a href="../../../s/a/u/User%7ESaucepan_785f.html" title="User:Saucepan">Saucepan</a> 05:20, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>To be honest, my initial intention when I found the article was to simply trim portions that seemed to be original research and sections where the sources were in disagreement, but I ran into resistance there. When I tried to verify information about the subject, I couldn't find anything. For a short time I thought it would be a good idea to simply trim the page down to what everyone agrees on, but it seems to me that a source is either reliable (or based on reliable sources) or it isn't, and four web sites that don't cite sources don't add up to one reliable source. While I generally consider Achtung Panzer to be reputable, their P-1000 page has at least one factual inaccuracy (discussed on Talk:P-1000, and their illustration looks nothing like Panzershreck's, which casts some doubt on the reliability of one or the other. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 06:26, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I wonder how "acknowledged expert" is meant to be interpreted. Is it enough that assorted other amateur web sites consider his to be good, or are we talking about a higher standard of acknowledgement? Does he have to be generally acknowledged to be an expert by professional historians?

Libraries that have it are: NORTHLAND PIONEER COL (AZ), LOS ANGELES COUNTY PUB LIB (CA), PLACER CNTY LIBR (CA), MIAMI-DADE PUB LIBR SYST (FL), PRITZKER MILITARY LIBR (IL), ALLEN CNTY PUB LIBR (IN), KOKOMO-HOWARD CNTY PUB LIBR (IN), KENTUCKY HIST SOC LIBR (KY), NICHOLLS STATE UNIV ELLENDER MEM LIBR (LA), SAILS, INC (MA), SAGINAW PUB LIBR (MI), UNIV OF NEBRASKA OMAHA (NE), MOHAWK VALLEY COMM COLL (NY), CUYAHOGA CNTY PUB LIBR (OH), EASTERN OREGON UNIV ((OR), US ARMY, MIL HIST INST (PA), NAVAL WAR COLL (RI), BLUE RIDGE REG LIBR (VA), MILWAUKEE CNTY FEDERATED LIBR (WI), and SAINT NORBERT COL LIBR (WI). So, I'd say, have someone who lives nearby check that book, see if it seems scholarly or has references. This thing was supposedly cancelled by Speer in '43, so I'll check my copy of <i>Inside the Third Reich</i>, but it wouldn't hurt to check <i>The Spandau Diaries</i> and <i>Infiltration</i>, too (I don't have those). If no luck there, then I'll say <b>strong delete.</b> <a href="../../../s/a/c/User%7ESacxpert_3406.html" title="User:Sacxpert">Sacxpert</a> 10:46, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't live near a copy of <i>Tanks; the Axis powers</i>, but my nearby university library has <i>The Spandau Diaries</i> and <i>Infiltration</i> so I'll have a look at them either today or early this week.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I just spent two hours at the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_State_University_da5b.html" title="North Carolina State University">NCSU</a> library looking at Spandau: The Secret Diaries, Infiltration, and Inside the Third Reich. This is in addition to the time I spent last week checking NCSU's resources on tanks and armored vehicles. I was not able to read anything cover to cover, obviously, but I scanned probable sections and checked indexes and I found no mention of the P-1000. In addition, George Parada of AchtungPanzer did not respond to my queries. I believe that if I spend several hours at a major university library, and I cannot find reliable sources on a topic, and none of the contributors of an article are able to present reliable sources, that information should be considered unverifiable and removed. According to <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, any editor can remove unsourced material, and the obligation to provide a reliable source belongs to the contributor(s), not those seeking to remove it. I understand that realistically, not every article contains reliable sources, and I wouldn't suggest that all of those articles be deleted. However, if an article cites <i>no reliable sources</i>, a source is <i>requested</i>, nobody is able to provide one, and several hours of research fail to turn up a reliable source, the article should be deleted. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 00:34, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I agree with Tom, and I've checked my copy of <i>Inside the Third Reich</i> as well, without success. I've also gone back through my <i>Panzer Tracts</i> and other German tank history works, and find no references there, either. I don't see any documented evidence anywhere to support the claims of this vehicle's existence, and without either a detailed reference from Mr. Parada, or somebody producing direct quotes from the Grove book (which I listed above along with every library in the country that owns it), I see no reason to believe that this vehicle had any basis in fact. I am therefore changing my vote to <b>strong delete.</b> If anyone ever produces a copy of the Grove book, I might change my mind, <i>if</i> it seems verifiable and scholarly. <a href="../../../s/a/c/User%7ESacxpert_3406.html" title="User:Sacxpert">Sacxpert</a> 08:45, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> unverifiable tankcruft which wouldn't merit an article even if it could be shown that a sketch on a napkin or wooden scale model actually existed. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 10:26, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm persuaded by TomTheHand's argument that it shouldn't be this difficult to find reliable sources for a notable project, and Wikipedia's current editorial stance appears to be that unreliable information is worse than no information.

<dd>I initially closed this article as a keep, since it sounded like a move was going to be done, which is something that does not need to be brought to AfD. Also, if any content is used in a new article, the old one must redirect to the new one to preserve attribution. I think that it has been cleared up that content from the article will not be used in any new articles. Also, keeping the article as a redirect is seen as confusing, since it would have to link to one of the pages but its title suggests that it has content on both topics. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 02:52, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have no idea why you think it's good to keep. the article is not used by or linked by any other article. the content of the article should have been separated in the first place. the writing in the article leaves a lot to be desired. the original author (who would be the only person with an interest since no one else seems to even know it's here) is nowhere to be found (and i have e-mailed him directly). the "first-order hold" that he describes is about the most academic and worthless version of the FOH (i didn't even recognize the impulse response, but i <b>did</b> eventually find a MATLAB simulink reference to such an animal) and that FOH is incompatible with the piecewise linear drawing of an FOH output in the top graph. there was never a need for this combined article, it's mistitled (there are hyphens missing), it's poorly written, has technical error, i've already written the separate articles of the two different ZOH and FOH with accurate equations and illustrative drawings, also pointing out the differences between the different versions of FOH, no one has come to defend the combined article, it's not referred to by any article, and there is no stated reason for a disambig.. tell me, Tango, what is there to keep? and how did you draw any conclusion that there is a consensus to keep, thus closing as "keep"?</dd>
<dd>recently i was disappointed to see an article <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proof_by_verbosity.html" title="Proof by verbosity">proof by verbosity</a> delected. that article had more accurate content and reason to exist than this one. <a href="../../../r/b/j/User%7ERbj_42ae.html" title="User:Rbj">r b-j</a> 17:07, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>one last note (for comparison)<b>:</b> as i mentioned to <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a>, this is akin to an article titled William and Hillary Clinton. that should be a red link. it is about <b>two</b> different but related topics. they deserve their own separate articles. because they are related, it is appropriate to have each point to the other, perhaps in the ==See also== section. but it should be a red link as shold Zero and First Order Holds . if William and Hillary Clinton were to redirect, who should it redirect to? if it's a disambig that simply lists <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillary_Clinton_c91c.html" title="Hillary Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, it offers <b>nothing</b>. it has no reason to exist. <a href="../../../r/b/j/User%7ERbj_42ae.html" title="User:Rbj">r b-j</a> 18:25, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

&gt;&gt; Hi Robert
&gt;&gt; I saw your modifications. You are indeed a knowledgeable person in the
&gt;&gt; field. Please go ahead and thanks for your email.
&gt;&gt; Regards, Arash
&gt;&gt;     
&gt;
&gt; we might delete the "Zero and First Order Holds" page in favor of the
&gt; separate pages.
&gt;
&gt; actually, i never heard of or known of the "predictive" FOH (you didn't use
&gt; the term "predictive") until i started investigating the strange looking (at
&gt; least to me at the time) impulse response you had for the FOH.  your top
&gt; graph with linear interpolation was for a "regular" FOH that i previously
&gt; knew about and i could tell that you would *not* get that nice linear
&gt; interpolation with the FOH impulse response you had shown.  so, at first, i
&gt; just thought your FOH section was simply wrong.  but it had the effect of
&gt; forcing me to research the web and i *did* come up with some reference to a
&gt; predictive FOH that had that weird impulse response, so i included that in
&gt; the final section of First-order hold.
&gt;
&gt; thanks for getting back to me.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Keep</b>. Bear in mind that it isn't simply this young lady's finish that makes her notable, but also the controversy regarding her reinstatement. This latter point is largely unrebutted in the debate by those who favor deletion, and influences my reading of the consensus AfDs have next-to-no precedential value anyway, but this consensus emphatically says nothing about the general notability of non-controversial high-place spelling bee finishers. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 19:45, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The spelling bee is major notable and nationally televised sport. My understanding is that this year a U.S. network carried it live in primetime. Placing third in such a competition <b>must</b> be at least as notable as being a minor MLB, NHL, NBA, NFL player - and we know that players with even one at-bat etc. on the top level are entitled to WP articles! There are precedents, of course. We had a few AfD's (can't find off hand) for people who've participate in one career NASCAR race decades ago, placing nowhere near the top, and were kept. Surely, this participation is worthy of an article. As to its staying a stub forever, that is not necessarily true, but it's no more true about Hooks than about the NASCAR people. (If anyone can point me to those AfD's, I would appreciate it.) - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 17:19, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Unlike the winner and the runner-up (who, as stated, is also the back-to-back Canadian nat'l champ), Saryn Hooks' third place finish is just a third place finish.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree that third in a national academic competition is notable performance for an encyclopedia that is not paper. And she is definitely the subject of multiple independent news articles. I don't particularly like this result because it means I am also eligible for an article, but as it was in the pre-web days, I don't expect any of you to go visit the morgue of the appropriate local papers to verify that claim, so I'm safe. I don't know if the reinstatement should be mentioned in the bee article, the editors of that article are the best judge of that. The best academic competitions have a procedure for challenging judgement, so that may or may not be worthy of inclusion. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 00:53, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>So, going forward, you are confident that this third-place finish will be sufficient to gain continuing coverage from reliable sources, yes? That in, say, five years, it will be easy to verify her latest achievements and where she is from the continued coverage that finishing third gains her? Or will she, like an unsuccessful political candidate, appear perhaps one day in a "where are they now" piece? My view is that these people should be merged to a single article until there is some additional claim to notability - otherwise we get the "last heard of selling used cars in Portland, OR" style of article, which is silly. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 11:20, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm not at all familiar with <i>The Keys to the Kingdom</i>, so I'm not going to comment on whether the article should go, but yes, of course you can (and probably should!) be bold and do the merge, as far as adding the information to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Keys_to_the_Kingdom_1df8.html" title="The Keys to the Kingdom">The Keys to the Kingdom</a> goes. However, you can't really put a redirect in on the old article, as that would screw up the AfD template. It's also probably best if only admins close AfDs (if only because they can delete articles if need be) -- I mean, let's assume that Nithlings <i>are</i> widely considered a topic that deserves its own article. You're the first person after the nominator to voice an opinion on this one, so if you were to close it, you wouldn't be acting on consensus, but on your personal opinion. A situation like that could very well lead to a lot of unnecessary friction between you and other editors.

<li><b>Comment</b> Possible counterarguments exist, hence the (admittedly strange step) of nominating your own article that has been marked for deletion...and then commenting on it. I originally went fact-finding in an effort to build a defense for the article, but after reading the appropriate guidelines as to what is and isn't note-worthy, I found myself a bit lost. So if you'd indulge me, I'd like to post what would have originally been the defense here.</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> as NN bio/vanity/autobiography. The article makes no substantial assertion of notability with the exception of an unsourced receipt of a collegiate award. The article was created by Tuesday 1pm Series, which has a strong correlation to a section of the article which states, <i>"In his final year, he arranged the <b>Tuesday 1pm concert series</b>..."</i> (emphasis added by me). The article has been tagged for speedy twice previously, with the tag being removed both times by a different user, Trio Sarabanda, whose only edits outside this article seem to be adding Luke D. Moore to various lists (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_21st_century_classical_composers.html" title="List of 21st century classical composers">List of 21st century classical composers</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postminimalism.html" title="Postminimalism">Postminimalism</a>. <a href="../../../b/u/g/User%7EBugwit_0cfa.html" title="User:Bugwit">Bugwit</a> <small><a href="../../../b/u/g/User_talk%7EBugwit_0602.html" title="User talk:Bugwit">grunt</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_bugwit_4152.html" title="Special:Contributions/bugwit">scribbles</a></small> 17:51, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> It's worth pointing out that the single google hit in question is actually a completely unconnected member of the US Air Force. I'm no expert on classical music but I doubt anyone who was born in 1982 and who graduated from Keele University less than two years ago is deserving of a place on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_21st_century_classical_composers.html" title="List of 21st century classical composers">List of 21st century classical composers</a> and can consider Philip Glass and Hans Zimmer his contemporaries. --<a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslaySolomon_7ae5.html" title="User:IslaySolomon">IslaySolomon</a> 20:55, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The great majority of proposed deletions do not receive keep votes from me, so empirical data seems to contradict Kicking222. I think the list is OK, and someone who wants a more discriminating list should assemble one and propose it. I think this article would be greatly improved by references, to establish it as verified (it does look verifiable to me). <a href="../../../s/n/u/User%7ESnugspout_c970.html" title="User:Snugspout">snug</a> 21:05, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>The great majority of articles don't get keep votes from you, but have you <i>ever</i> voted to delete something? Ever?

If you choose to vote to keep everything, that's your decision, and I have no problem with you making that decision. But the fact that you (literally?) never vote delete, and the fact that you rarely state <i>why</i> you vote keep aside from "It's above my notability threshold" don't really give a lot of weight to your arguments for keeping articles. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 21:13, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't vote to keep everything; as I noted, most articles receive no comment from me. I certainly will vote delete when I expend the effort in time and research to support it. I think a delete vote should not be cavalier, and it concerns me that most delete votes are themselves poorly sourced and reasoned. A keep vote is a vote to preserve the information so its status can eventually be resolved carefully. <a href="../../../s/n/u/User%7ESnugspout_c970.html" title="User:Snugspout">snug</a> 21:57, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>-Guys- is this your job? How cool! Anyway, a few questions from the (admittedly carbon-based) composer himself: -what distinguishes between notable and undeserving of credit? -I make a potentially false assumption that none of you have produced a musical or literary work, but if this is true, what makes you qualified to assess the validity of entries such as this? -Wikipedia is by definition an encyclopedia, so on that principle would it not be beneficial to all to be as comprehensive as possible? Would anything other than that effectively be censorship and where is the line drawn? <b>-How can the concise nature of the article be expanded to become more notable?</b> NB. Tuesday 1pm Series and Trio Sarabanda are my successor in the role of Montford Scholar and an acclaimed violinist who will be performing the Violin I part of 'Moments' when it premieres later this year. In addition to this, Glass, Reich et al are not considered contemporaries- they were writing music when I was still in diapers! Thanks in advance, I find this all very interesting! Luke</p>
<ul>
<li>Luke, No...I'm pretty sure that this is not a job for any of the editors here. The point of whether or not any of the editors here have ever published musical or literary work is irrelevant. The qualification to make the decision is based on Wikipedia policies, including <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What Wikipedia is Not</a>.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Note that the supposed "composer himself" admits that the article is constructed by his friends.

<li><b>Keep</b> Pascal.Tesson- do you have any ideas as to the extent of the limited context of contemporary UK composers?

<li>You're right, and I'll strike through that response. Nevertheless, I still don't think a clip show's notable. I wouldn't run a normal <i>Lost</i> episode article through AfD, or a character article (unless it was something like "Unnamed Extra #5 in Pilot"), but yeah, this at least merits community review.

<dd>Of course, that doesn't exactly answer the question that a Google search, irrespective of "unique hits," for "Lost: The Journey" and "ABC" yields 517 hits — and a high Google count isn't unsurprising given that "lost" and "journey" are commonplace English words. Any poem that has something like "Lost, the journey ended" or "Picard said, 'We're lost.' 'The journey's not yet over,' Troi replied." is going to yield one of the 27,000 hits your search produced. The ABC limiter yields a far more accurate representation of how many Google hits the program owns. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;• 17:26, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What you view as <i>hyperbole</i> is what I view as calling attention to the fact that you're citing things out of context (for instance, citing one line from <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Television_episodes_d747.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes</a> while skipping the very next line that completely undercuts your argument, for another instance, doing the same thing with the google test text) in what I view is a strenous effort to get this article deleted, no matter what the actual policy is, no matter what tactics you need to employ. I detest this article, I detest the entire Lost show, and I think it's silly to have individual television episodes carry articles except in very limited cases where they were culturally significant in a larger context, but the group that works on these articles has <b>arrived at a consensus</b> that clearly says individual episodes should not be deleted except in certain cases, which this episode (and if it's branded with the Lost episode badging, it's an <i>episode</i>, clip show or not) no longer, in my judgement, meets. Instead of fighting so hard this way, instead of doing out of process things (that second AfD you started WHILE the DRV was running, was way out of process, picking and choosing from guidelines as you have apparently done more than once here, is a bit out of process, policy wonking like you did in the DrV to try to get people's views discounted is out of process) to get this article to go away, why not work to get the guideline changed. I'd support that. But I find your contributions to this process not nearly as helpful or collegiate (you are quick to charge others are not assuming good faith while giving the appearance that you yourself are not assuming good faith, for example) as they could be, in my view.

<dd>And, by the way, hyperbole is "extravagant exaggeration," and exaggeration is "to enlarge beyond bounds or the truth" or "to enlarge or increase especially beyond the normal." Given that I'm <i>not</i> responding to every individual in here, yes, you were extravagantly enlarging beyond bounds or the truth. The underlying point of your argument may have been what you then proceeded to rant about directly above, and how much <i>that</i> underlying point was hyperbolically stated is another issue, but your originating hyperbolic statement was what I was taking issue with.

With regards to the latter half of your point regarding calling someone's comments hyperbolic itself being an act of hyperbole, you're essentially saying I'm exaggerating his exaggeration -- that really doesn't seem to parse out as understandable for me. With regards to no. 2, I'm bringing up individual problems I have with people's responses — what metric they're using, misunderstandings of policy. In each case the responses vary, and are thus not the same comment multiple times. The cited portion of the guide in question can hardly be construed as interpreting the mere act of challenging someone's viewpoint as "the same comment." With regards to no. 3, were you someone who I felt had an objective viewpoint on, or benevolently meant opinion of, my behavior and actions, I would value your comments about my personal reputation and thus take your comments under due consideration.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete</b> Racial slurs may constitute encyclopedic topics; however, because of their sensitivity, they must be extensively referenced by verifiable sources before they can be included in the encyclopedia.

An unencyclopedic tag was inserted followed by a deletion tags listing invalid, absurd and irrelevant reasons. The article is most appropriate for Wikipedia as it is serving the important purpose of providing information on a racial slur, which is gaining prominence. The article is far from being a dictionary definition. The editor goes on to criticize the English of the author. The article was written in simple English in line with Wikipedia policy.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The article is based on facts supported by actual reports and information from reliable sources. It contains necessary information and facts about a current derogatory term. The POV claim is groundless. I note with regret that the connected article in the list of ethnic slurs was deleted repeatedly by vandals. Please be constructive. The article is valuable reference material for Wikipedia. --Chungkwok 06:12, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Number of problems - (a) no evidence that the term is in actual common use. For example, the url refers to just another racist comment. The emphasis of all the articles is not on the term <i>in particular</i>, but on the discrimination towards mainland chinese <i>in general</i>. Hence, it is far more appropiate to have an article discussing say, Taiwanese-Mainline antipathy, with this as a possible redirect, than focus on a single obscure term which has no verifiable origin and so on. (b) If the term is to be noted at all, it belongs in List of Ethnic Slurs. It doesn't deserve an article of its own, because it's just a dictionary def. (c) Assume good faith. List of Ethnic Slurs has a detailed verifiability criteria that needs to be satisfied, to stop people from putting in any old phrase. Further, do not use the vandal template in the middle of an article! It's meant to be used for userpages. (d) The article in question does have a POV problem. As an encyclopedia, we should be stating matters of fact. We should not be imploring our readers to be nice to each other and not be racists. Wikipedia is not a self-help guide.--<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFangz_eec0.html" title="User:Fangz">Fangz</a> 13:03, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. (A) Common use of the item is evidenced by authoritative newspaper reports and they do indicate that the term is being used openly in public. Common use of the term is evident. The term being discussed in the legislative assembly (equivalent to the US Congress) is more than sufficient evidence that term is gaining prominence and continued use of the term is expected, otherwise it would be treated as an isolated case. The article focus finely on the term itself and explanations related to the term only. There is no emphasis on racial discrimination. Origin of the term is not important considering that the purpose of this article is solely to provide encyclopedic information on a racist term. (B) The list of ethnic slurs is a list and not intended for extensive information. If all articles of this length were "listed", then the list would be too lengthy to serve any useful purpose, especially as an online encyclopedia. It is hard to see how a detailed article such as this can be considered as a dictionary definition. <a href="../../../c/o/o/Coolie.html" title="Coolie">Coolie</a> and the "N" word all have articles of their own so why would this term not deserve a page of its own? (C) Verifiability has been satisfied as stated above. Sorry about the vandal template. (D) Something that has happened in public and reported in newspapers is a "fact". There is no intention is not to guide anyone on anything. The sole intention is merely to provide encyclopedic information on a racial slur. --Chungkwok 17:40, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Nominator Comment.</b> Verifiability has hardly been met in reference to the article. The sources mentioned in the article do nothing more than use the phrase "Chinese pig" in terms of the differences between Taiwan and mainland China. If you are trying to provide a definition for Chinese pig, then you are doing nothing more than providing a dictionary definition, which is unacceptable for Wikipedia. The articles asserts no importance or notability for this phrase. The one isolated incident of the Canadian teacher is not notable enough to support the need for the Chinese pig article. The article itself is strongly POV, and it does nothing but use an ethnic slur to further the differences between Taiwanese and Chinese people. I am not even sure if this article qualifies to be merged with the lackluster <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ethnic_slurs.html" title="List of ethnic slurs">list of ethnic slurs</a>. The first sentence of the article even humorously states "Chinese pig is an racially offensive term," yet one of the sources even mentions how the term Chinese pig denotes social and not racial discrimination. And, if the difference is of nationalities, then it certainly is not dealing with racism. <a href="../../../c/o/o/Coolie.html" title="Coolie">Coolie</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a> are amongst the most widespread derogatory terms in existance.

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> What is important is whether the term "Chinese Pig" exists, has been actually used as a racist term in daily life, has racial slur significance and can be substantiated or verified. All these requirements have been met. Evidence of public usage of the racist term alone is sufficient to qualify it as a racial slur. The existence of the term has been demonstrated and verified by credible newspapers reports of an incident involving two unrelated individuals of different races exchanging racial slurs in public. Public transport can be taken as a miniature of society culture and usage of racial slurs on public transport indicates common usage. Use of the term in public by ordinary folks has been established. The victim was upset at the use of term to demean him racially. If a white person calling a Chinese person a "Chinese pig" is not racially injurious or discriminatory, then what is it? The Taiwan link shows that the term is also used there. Justification for inclusion of a racial slur in Wikipedia is not by the number of times the term has been used or its rank in popularity. It is not necessary to demonstrate the number of times it has been used or how common the term is. The term when used by Chinese to Chinese is ethnic or social discrimination because of the many different ethnicities among Chinese. A foreigner to Chinese is racial discrimination which is the case here. The core of the matter is whether the term exists and whether it can be verified. How can we say that the article cannot be expanded like the one for Coolie? Are we going to eliminate everyone using the term hereafter so that the term will never be used again? The arguments supporting deletion seen so far are weak and unreasonable. A black person being called a Nigger could go to Wikipedia to locate detailed information about the term and a Chinese person being called a “Chinese Pig” could do the same. Why should there be a difference? I strongly recommend keeping this article.--Dragon Descendant 03:00, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

No one needs to "save" this article because it has the legitimate right to exist since it meets all the criteria of Wikipedia. I have not and do not need to use another user name to argue anything. We do not need a lot of people to argue for inclusion or deletion but we do need convincing and valid arguments. The simple fact is that there is nothing to argue about therefore no one bothers. You have stated that there are "many" justifications for removal of this article, but failed to point out which ones. Please avoid such empty talk and messing up the civil and orderly manner in which this is progressing. Kindly concentrate on material facts and avoid wasting time and resources of those concerned. Anyone can see that you are not interested in constructive discussion, therefore please excuse us. Again, we have yet to see any valid and convincing argument for deletion.

<li><b>Comment.</b> All these wriggling and wrangling is indeed perplexing. The pointless and tiresome efforts of some individuals trying to force or wrestle the article out are amazing. Nobody has yet come up with anything convincing. All we are hearing are just empty excuses and repetition of points, which have been satisfactorily addressed. Could anyone come up with just one valid and convincing reason for deletion of the article please? It is just not good enough to say that if we cannot get rid of this article then just merge it into list of slurs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the absence of valid arguments, I suppose I would have to assume that and the reasons behind all these objections could lie in the embarrassment of having an article about this derogatory term in Wikipedia and the worry of the undesirable effects of mentioning the term. Could it be that some of these objections are to be from individuals exercising blind patriotism and raising objections about the article?</p>
<p>I suppose I would have address the concern of these individuals who might be uncomforatable with the derogatory term. People voluntarily come to Wikipedia to seek information about the term. That is what an online encyclopedia is for. I have to state the term is not being broadcasted to people on national TV new s or carried in newspapers or any other mass media. If "nigger", "coolie" and "Eurotrash" can have their own articles and people do not mind it, then why should we resist this article?</p>
<p>The term is not only in local newspapers. On the contrary, the term is being used everywhere from Hong Kong multi-cultural society to worldwide high governmental institutions including the respected state legislature of a major South East Asia country. Please see the external links in the article titled "Chinese pig slur used in state legislature". If that is not notable, then what is?</p>
<p>Considering that there appears to be no valid or constructive comments, it is time to end this debate. The article should be kept intact.--Chungkwok 07:36, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is a disgrace to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>In fact there is a hamlet in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sint-Lievens-Houtem_b083.html" title="Sint-Lievens-Houtem">Sint-Lievens-Houtem</a> called Cotthem. No more than a circular road boarding on the Polbroek (which has also been turned into a metropolis as Polfbroekstraat). It was a hamlet of the village of Oombergen, which has been merged into Sint-Lievens-Houtem. Now, all that is already on the page of SLH. How can Sint-Lievens-Houtem, which has fewer than 10,000 inhabitants, harbour a hamlet with 39,070 inhabitants?</p>
<p>Of course, I can provide pictures of this circular road (I happen to live in the neighbourhood - it is nice cycling there), but somehow I think that even a letter by the mayor of Sint-Lievens-Houtem is not going to convince those people (are there really four of them?) who are prepared to create a parallel universe.</p>
<p>What I write here also holds for Eiland and Polfbroekstraat (actually a misprint for Polbroek), of course: only relatively unimportant streets in Sint-Lievens-Houtem!<a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPan_Gerwazy_3e18.html" title="User talk:Pan Gerwazy">User_talk:Pan_Gerwazy</a> pgp 19:39, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Luckily for you, it is not a Roman soldier, only a "monument" (to point out that the Romans built a street here, and no they did not build this whole street, only a small part of it) - so Belgian portrait right does not apply. Belgian copyright is at stake here - you will have to ask the municipality of Sint-Lievens-Houtem.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Please realize that this is not an "area". It is a STREET running through green fields and an artificial wood. It does not "support" these pubs and restaurants, people from elsewhere come there (wonderful place to walk and cycle) to drink and eat. Just look up Cotthem 1 and then Cotthem 6 and Cotthem 9 in www.mappy.be (6 and 9 are the two pubs by the way) and you will see how far away houses are from each other. Basically it is a very quiet place which explains why people like to have a pint or a meal there. I did not know much about the street, I just looked on the website of the municipality of Sint-Lievens-Houtem. And I happen to understand the captions which appear when you hold your mouse on these pictures. And no, I am not going to add to an article which claims this is a city of more than 30,000 inhabitants, when every Belgian would find it a joke if it was in the Dutch-speaking Wikipedia - and we tend to put hamlets there which have fewer than 5,000 inhabitants. This street is not Wall Street. And no, I do not live there either (in case you are starting to think I am a nimby and want to keep it quiet). So my basic argument is: if you make an article about this street, you will have to make one about half of the streets in Belgium. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPan_Gerwazy_3e18.html" title="User talk:Pan Gerwazy">User_talk:Pan_Gerwazy</a>---pgp 02:11, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry, but you are defending articles about things you know nothing about, as has been shown before. You and your friends only started to look at what Gotem really is and introduce that into the article after the AfD was filed, even though you had had two years of looking into it before, but just couldn't be bothered. Now you are trying to do the same all over again here, and will probably on Eiland and Polfbroekstraat as well. While Gotem was, luckily for you, an existing, though small, village (even though it had nothing to do with the original nonsense article), you don't have such an easy escape here. Take a look at this <a href="http://www.viamichelin.com/viamichelin/gbr/dyn/controller/ItiWGPerformPage?isAvoidFrontiers=false&amp;isFavoriseAutoroute=false&amp;isAvoidPeage=false&amp;isAvoidVignette=false&amp;isAvoidLNR=false&amp;strTypeStep=0&amp;strVehicle=0&amp;reinit=1&amp;strStartAddress=&amp;strStartCP=&amp;strStartCity=sint-lievens-houtem&amp;strStartCityCountry=311&amp;strDestAddress=kottem&amp;strDestCP=&amp;strDestCity=sint-lievens-houtem&amp;strDestCityCountry=311&amp;image2.x=17&amp;image2.y=18" class="external text" title="http://www.viamichelin.com/viamichelin/gbr/dyn/controller/ItiWGPerformPage?isAvoidFrontiers=false&amp;isFavoriseAutoroute=false&amp;isAvoidPeage=false&amp;isAvoidVignette=false&amp;isAvoidLNR=false&amp;strTypeStep=0&amp;strVehicle=0&amp;reinit=1&amp;strStartAddress=&amp;strStartCP=&amp;strStartCity=sint-lievens-houtem&amp;strStartCityCountry=311&amp;strDestAddress=kottem&amp;strDestCP=&amp;strDestCity=sint-lievens-houtem&amp;strDestCityCountry=311&amp;image2.x=17&amp;image2.y=18" rel="nofollow">ViaMichelin page</a>, and click on the map to have a better look. You can see that Kottem, Polfbroek, and Eiland, are three streets around the market of Sint-Lievens-Houtem. These are thoroughly non-notable and have no reason at all to be included in Wikipedia. If one of them has even one interesting, encyclopedic fact about them, add it to the main article about Sint-Lievens-Houtem.</dd>
<dd>My question to you and The Raven is still standing: why did you bother creating, modifying, and defending articles about places you know actually nothing about and had no idea about their importance, notability, or whatever? Was the only reason that they somehow turned up in your search for words similar to Got'em and Caught'em (probably the "first battle of Gotem", since the recent one is described as the second one)? I don't mind that this all started as a joke, but it has grown very, very stale, and the little bit of respect you as a group gained by correcting finally the Gotem article is rapidly disapearing again. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 05:06, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Frankly this is irrelevant, although I could take the time to answer this question, it has no value in this discussion. The point is an article was created about Kottem, and some of us believe it is a town, the others a street. The latter group vehemently advocate deletion, while the former group attempt to fix the article and make it truthful/verfiable. I have yet to see any usefull contribution to this article from those who advocate its deletion, while (surprisingly enough) they present such contributions only on these 'votes for deletion' pages. If I were to make an analogy, we are a group of workers attempting to erect a building, while a crowd of jeering kids shouts at us with insults and various demoralizing statements from below. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Raven_d68a.html" title="User:The Raven">The Raven</a> 01:27, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That something exists is no reason to have it in an encyclopedia. It has to be notable. It is not. An article has to be possible that is more than a stub. It is not. If (a big if) anything of encyclopedic importance can be said about the street, add it to the Sint-Lievens-Houtem article.

<dd>No, you are wrong. See e.g. [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents]: "City streets are contested, but minor streets are not generally notable". If you can only make a stub from a street, then it is not notable. Furthermore, the current article lists nothing about this street that is true. Even worse, there is no street with this name, it is a typo in some database. I have not seen one textbased article (i.e. not a map) which says anything about this city or street, so why should I assume it exists and has any notability? Find me some information that shows it has notability and enough can be said about it to have an article about it. Until then, "Delete" is the only possible vote.

<dd>Beyond doubt it is notable, as <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">User:Pan_Gerwazy</a> has shown (in this very discussion!).

I note that under these circumstances the main argument for deletion will be that if you make an article about this street, you will have to make an article about at least half of the streets in Belgium. So if Lambiam's version will endure, the deletion is necessary because this street is not notorious enough - by far. Note that in the category "Belgian streets" Kottem has the company of only the E17, the E19 and the E40 - the disparity in notoriety is enormous.<a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPan_Gerwazy_3e18.html" title="User talk:Pan Gerwazy">User_talk:Pan_Gerwazy</a></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Unfortunately, that's not an argument for deletion. The street is notable because it is a street; the fact that there is an article on it does not mean we must arbitarily make articles about all streets in Belgium with similar notability, it simply means that such articles would be allowed. It has been established on numberous AfDs that the standards for notability on Wiki are much lower than the notability of this article, and it is commonly believed that we should follow precedent. This is not the place to try and set a new precedent, and we are not the people to do it. You STILL have not given any real reasons to delete this article. Thus, the article MUST be kept.

<dd>If you knew this information, why didn't you put it in the AfD at the beginning? It's taken roughly a week for all of this to come out; the fact that Kottem is actually the road Cotthem and that it's non-notable. I was under the impression that it was a town and thus notable. If you'd pointed this out at first, perhaps I would have voted delete initially, as I did with Polfbroekstraat. I'm not in the business of keeping unneccessary articles; I'm in the business of defending articles from unneccessary deletion, which is what triggered all of this when somebody speedy deleted this and a number of other articles. <a href="../../../s/y/p/User%7ESyphonbyte_a97f.html" title="User:Syphonbyte">syphonbyte</a> 03:15, 22 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Syphonbyte, two things: first, the fact that Kottem is nothing more than a non notable street was added to the AfD at the beginning: "What I write here also holds for Eiland and Polfbroekstraat (actually a misprint for Polbroek), of course: only relatively unimportant streets in Sint-Lievens-Houtem!" (last line of initial post to the AfD). So it has not taken roughly a week for all this to come out, it was there right from the start. Furthermore, you created the article: it is your responsibility to make it truthful. If you don't know anything about the subject (as you have shown conclusively on all the articles involved and the project), don't bother creating an article, and even less start contesting the deletion of it (speedy or not). As has been shown over and over again, this isn't or wasn't an "unnecessary deletion". It is you and your friends who are wasting everybody's time, not Pan_Gerwazy. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 07:31, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Syphonbyte, if your approach were correct it would be very easy to introduce non-notable items in Wikipedia. When you create the article, put some completely incredible stuff there. Make it a copyvio for good measure, with info that readers can use to google up a webpage from a credible source (the BBC or the EU) which also gives a link to the website where you stole the text. So that even after the AfD, someone who comes to vote for deletion, gets worried about the consequences for the Wikipedia project and starts correcting. After which the AfD quoting a hoax is in trouble. BUT even if it were feasible, there is still one little problem you will be faced with: neither Kottem nor Polfbroekstraat exist in the real world, where the official names are Polbroek and Cotthem. So, the hoax element basically remains. Fram, thanks for pointing that out - so I do not need to revert the changes in the article to the hoax. Saves me some time.

<p>This article is a disgrace to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The truth is there is no such place. There is in fact one real Belgian google: <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/vaign96/Pagina%203.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freewebs.com/vaign96/Pagina%203.html" rel="nofollow">[32]</a></p>
<p>Which by the way, also mentions the Polbroek, as the street is really called. The text gives a lot of "wegels" (paths, unaccessible to cars, and thus usually not mentioned on a road map) that connect the "Polfbroekstraat" to "Hoeksken". On the road map I use ("Stratenatlas van Vlaanderen - Guide des Rues de Flandre. Standaard Uitgeverij, ISBN 90-0-20614-3.") Hoeksken is a street parallel to Polbroek. For those who do not understand why Polfbroekstraat could be a misprint for "Polbroek": most streets in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium end in "straat" so incorrectly adding "straat" to a street name which does not have one, sometimes happens. And again, Polbroek also appears in this one Belgian Google.</p>
<p>The reason why it is obvious that Polfbroekstraat is in fact "Polbroek"? Well, at the point where a street called Espenhoek, coming from the South and going to the centre of SLH, becomes the Polbroek, there is also a road on the right: the almost circular road called Cotthem. And yes, Cotthem is another one of these phantom towns created (as Kottem) by the same people who created Polfbroekstraat, Eiland, and others. Note that both Espenhoek and Cotthem are marked as hamlets of the former village of Oombergen, and that Sint-Lievens-Houtem has fewer than 10,000 inhabitants. How could a town like that harbour three or even four metropolises with more than 30,000 inhabitants EACH?</p>

<dd>In the talk page on Polfbroekstraat I claimed that the Polbroek began at the most southerly arm of the Cotthem with the approach road to Sint-Lievens-Houtem. This was based on a road map in book form quoted above. According to www.mappy.be (online road map of Belgium), this is wrong: Polbroek starts at the most northerly intersection. This makes the Polbroek even shorter.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Of course I cannot prove that something does not exist - how could I have photographic evidence of that? Since there is no such thing as Polfbroekstraat and the "place" in the area is a street called Polbroek (the only Belgian google is, I repeat, a misprint), it is going to be very difficult to prove that Polfbroekstraat is not a town. Except by default of course: how is it that such a big town as Polfbroekstraat is so strangely absent from all lists of Belgian towns, villages and hamlets? There are lists of postal codes, where everything that was once a village on its own is listed (they are on the internet) and Polfbroekstraat (or Polbroek) is again strangely absent. Talking about postal codes, where did you get the postal code mentioned in the article? The problem is, you see, that all postal codes in Belgium consist of 4 digits. Not five - like in France or Germany. I have just looked up 41063, of course. Nothing in Germany, some hamlet of Moenchen-Gladbach. But the French one is interesting: Couffy (renamed from Couffi in 1979). Seems like someone has been looking up the postal code of Cotthem in the wrong country. "Not stupid Frenchie, stupid Belgian" Hercule Poirot would have said after finding that one out. Stop inventing your own parallel universe and start writing real articles, I would say. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPan_Gerwazy_3e18.html" title="User talk:Pan Gerwazy">User_talk:Pan_Gerwazy</a>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm only trying to represent a town/village/hamlet/populated area that I believe exists (and is supported by some sources). I have no clue who changed the postal code, I originally had posted a 4 digit postal code but was changed by 70.152.52.77. I will attempt to find the old postal code and replace it. Please do not make wanton accusations, we are trying to accurately represent a real place (to our knowledge). If you feel something is inaccurate, I want it changed as much as you.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Raven_d68a.html" title="User:The Raven">The Raven</a> 03:56, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I see the postal code is back to 3150 now. Funny, as that is a postal code from the province of Flemish Brabant. All East Flemish postal codes start with the digit 9. It was the postal code you first put there, and which is really the postal code of Haacht (famous for its beer, like the two pubs in the Cotthem). According to the history of the page, 70.152.52.77 first changed your postal code to 3840, which as we all know by now is a postal code in Limburg, and the postal code (surprise, surprise) of Borgloon (where this hamlet <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gotem.html" title="Gotem">Gotem</a> is situated, for which all this fuss was started in the first place). 3 minutes later the same guy goes for the French postal code of Cotthem but takes Couffy. Three minutes is not much to start looking up postal codes all over Europe, so he must have been in a hurry. Four minutes later the same guy turns Polfbroekstraat into a part of the municipality of Sint-Lievens-Houtem - the first time anything serious and more or less connected to the real world happened on this page. And after needing only 4 minutes for this horrendous step forward, he chose to go away and not to look up the Sint-Lievens-Houtem postal code, since he KNEW that he had put the postal code for Cotthem, and not the one for Polfbroekstraat? Sorry, this behaviour seems rather strange to me. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPan_Gerwazy_3e18.html" title="User talk:Pan Gerwazy">User_talk:Pan_Gerwazy</a>--pgp 21:06, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Concerning the pictures, its very easy to prove Polfbroekstraat doesnt exist. A simple trip to the coordinates specified by fallingrain and some pictures would prove it beyond a doubt. Otherwise, I agree fallingrain is inaccurate, but I doubt that they would be wrong about a 'population center'. Also I admit I have no idea as to the postal code, but the longtitude/lattitude coordinates are most certainly correct. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Raven_d68a.html" title="User:The Raven">The Raven</a> 01:34, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>STRONG DELETE</b>. No article (as opposed to maps) about Polfbroekstraat has been given yet. Not one source to state its importance (fallingrain is, as we know by now, not trustworthy at all). This is because <b>it does not exist</b>. A city on Belgium with only one Google it from a Belgian website (a typo) is hysterical. It is up to the people that created the article or are trying to defend it to show its notability, its importance, or in this case, its existence.

<dd><b>Comment</b> There are many other sources which list the same information as falling rain. I have added some of them to the article for your viewing pleasure. Indeed, one can easily find many more that say the same thing by googling 'Polfbroekstraat'. Do you claim all of these sources are in error? I doubt this is the case. However, I would not rule out the fact that all these websites get their information from a single database. Indeed, it seems (from the link you provided) that there is a street called Polfbroek. This does not imply there is no town/cottage/hamlet/etc. called 'Polfbroekstraat', which exists as per the sources cited. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Raven_d68a.html" title="User:The Raven">The Raven</a> 07:31, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As you say, all these erroneous data seem to come from one database. Aren't you surprised that such a city cannot be found on any Belgian site, that no one can provide any info on it, etcetera? And don't ytou think that it is an incredible coincidence that Polbroek is located just next to Eiland and Kottem, two articles also made by you and your friends, and equally ridiculous? I still don't know why you or any of you have created and recreated articles about places you obviously know nothing about. It has been shown (e.g. with <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gotem.html" title="Gotem">Gotem</a>,which also started out as one of your silly articles) that the population numbers and so on given on fallingrain and all these other sources are completely unreliable Gotem dropped from 21000 on fallingrain to 282 in reality). Furthermore, the actual names of lpaces on these sites are equally unreliable, as you can often find many versions of the same name. Finally, it is up to you and the defenders of these articles to provide correct, reliable info. If you can't find a single Belgian site or article that gives us any info on Polfbroekstraat, if you can't show on ViaMichelin or another routeplanner where this city lies, then it is only worth deleting. if you want to try the effort you have done with Gotem to save it from deletion, namely start from scratch and turn it into a reliable, seriously sourced and informative article, be my guest. But you can't, as it is no city, village, or hamlet: it is the misspelled name of an unremarkable street. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 12:41, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

One other farm is called <i>Eyland</i>. Two or three "neighbourhood roads" are listed between <i>Polfbroekstraat</i> and some other farm.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Though I agree with what you seem to suggest, I must say you misinterpret the list, I am afraid. Anyone who understands Dutch sees this is a list of "buurtwegen" (vicinal roads) which in 1843 ran between several points, hamlets or streets in the neighbourhood of SLH. The vicinal roads were probably just dirt roads, and most of them do not appear on the map today.</dd>
<dd>As for what they connected: Hoeksken for instance, is also a street, although it probably originated as a point or place or a farm, since it is the diminutive of "Hoek", meaning corner. Hoeksken by the way is a road that runs parallel to Polbroek, which suggests that there may have been dirt roads between those two, made by farmers for instance.</dd>
<dd>Oombergen and Borsbeke, however, WERE villages. Crapenijke was a hamlet. "Eiland" perhaps was not a farm either. It may have referred to the Eilandmolen (from 1480), which still exists today (it can be seen on the Internet) or the field to the NE of it. So, yes, you are right there, somebody got farms, mills (Eiland), fields (Cotthem) and streets (Polbroek) confused with hamlets and villages but not all those "points" were farms <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPan_Gerwazy_3e18.html" title="User talk:Pan Gerwazy">User_talk:Pan_Gerwazy</a>--pgp 20:30, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> This article resulted from an entry in the Glossary on the U.S. Senate site, where there is an entry for "presiding officer". But that's not an office. There is no actual office of "Presiding Officer". Formally, the President of the Senate (the United States <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vice_President_56ab.html" title="Vice President">Vice President</a>) presides over the Senate, but usually, he leaves it to the <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_Pro_Tempore_0b6b.html" title="President Pro Tempore">President Pro Tempore</a>, which is an actual office held by a Senator, who in turn, often designates some other Senator to do the job for a day. When it's a designated senator, the Congressional Record refers to them as the "Acting President Pro Tempore". The term "Presiding Officer of the United States Senate" is sometimes used to refer to the Vice President, though. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 19:53, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, there's no such office. Why can't there be an article about the person who's sitting up in that chair? Other articles may link to it thusly: <tt>"…A Senator wishing to speak must get the attention of the [[Presiding Officer of the United States Senate|Presiding Officer]], who will then promptly ignore him because he didn't say 'Mother may I?' The Senator may appeal the ruling to the [[President of the Senate]].…"</tt> The United States Senate website actually refers to that person as the "Presiding Officer" so I wasn't going to change the title of the article.—<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkles_da7d.html" title="User talk:Markles">Markles</a> 20:14, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article was previously nominated for deletion, and consensus was reached that it was notable as an example of pseudoscience. Subsequent editing toward NPOV, however, has resulted in the elimination of any explicity pseudoscience reference in the body text as well as in an article which is lengthy and presents a fairly elaborate description of these dubious 'procedures' which in my judgement might be misconstrued, and which has actively engaged a proponent attempting to render the article a pro-Omura/BDORT piece in the name of neutrality – as well as the valiant efforts of another editor to maintain WP standards. The <i>very</i> lengthy discussion seems to have resulted, in my judgement, in little more than stalemate, with the question of the article's grounds for notability, now that the pseudoscience aspect has been relegated to the margins, now open. Effectively, the only established NPOV cite is that of the NZ authorities. It is unclear to me if this is sufficient to justify an entry, and I would like to throw the question to the community for consideration. TealCyfre 19:20, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> – I am the original creator of this entry, a choice I now consider to have proven ill-advised. At the time of its creation I had, as a newcomer, some mistaken impressions as to what was suitable for a WP entry, which impressions have since then been somewhat clarified. In the light of that somewhat broader comprehension I would make the following points, and will then leave the discussion to others:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>An entry must be notable solely on the basis of verifiable independent sourcing.</li>
<li>When limited to such sourcing the only acceptable information we have for Omura and his armamentarium is limited to a patent on record and another on application, and the en passant establishment of the NZ Tribunal in the case of Richard Gorringe that PMRT/BDORT/Applied Kinesiology are without scientific basis and therefore an unacceptable modality of treatment.

<li>Dear TealCyfre, <s>please be advised that it is considered unethical and/or bad form for the nominator of AfD to add his/her vote below, as the very act of nominating normally constitutes a vote. It is acceptable and quite common for the nominator to follow up with relevant comments below other people's votes, which you have obviously also done. I leave it to you to cross out your vote above.</s> This relocation by Philosophus is also acceptable. Now to your specific points:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Notability and proper sourcing - we are all in agreement, I think, every single one of us here.</li>
<li>Specific notability here: please review again the 6 points I raised above, per your request. You may not agree with my opinions, but you seem to ignore 4 other points at least.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>If I may add my own summary here: Dr. Omura claims to have created a simple technique whereby it is possible to easily diagnose/cure most/many diseases that afflict mankind, which he calls BDORT. Apparently Richard Gorringe, a medical practitioner, used this technique on some patients in NZ, to the exclusion of conventional medicine. He was brought in front of a Medical Disciplinary Tribunal which reprimanded and fined him, and specifically concluded that BDORT (which it called PMRT) was 'ineffective' and 'irresponsible' to use<a href="http://www.mpdt.org.nz/decisionsorders/decisions/0289dfindings.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mpdt.org.nz/decisionsorders/decisions/0289dfindings.pdf" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>. Yet, it seems (based on reliable sourcing) that BDORT is still being promoted around the world, for example by the New York Academy of Medicine<a href="http://www.nyam.org/events/index.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nyam.org/events/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">[35]</a><a href="http://bdort.net/pdf/21stsymposium.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://bdort.net/pdf/21stsymposium.pdf" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>. Also, at least one BDORT article appeared in the peer reviewed Medical Acupuncture journal <a href="http://www.medicalacupuncture.org/aama_marf/journal/vol14_3/case3.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.medicalacupuncture.org/aama_marf/journal/vol14_3/case3.html" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>. Dr. Omura has multiple impressive <a href="http://www.tmj-pain.com/Omura.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tmj-pain.com/Omura.pdf" rel="nofollow">[38]</a><a href="http://bdort.net/en/omurast.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://bdort.net/en/omurast.htm" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> medical credentials obtained at major US institutions according to his CV. This is a clear case of notability of both Dr. Omura and his BDORT technique. Establishing notability does not imply judgment of merit of Omura or BDORT. In fact, by prominently displaying the NZ Tribunal's result, WP is clearly showing the only mainstream's assessment of BDORT. But one can't just wish something one disagrees with away - the item's <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> must be assessed objectively, and then, assuming it rises above the required notability level (which I believe it easily does in this case), it is WP's editors mission to present a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">well sourced</a> version of it. I think what we have now is actually pretty good, and if anyone can suggest ways to improve it please do so. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 04:00, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Unfortunately, the situation on nominators adding a vote is more confused - while some people say that doing so is bad form, the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Guide to deletion</a> actually says that doing so improves the clarity of the discussion. I have seen a few AfDs where the nominator has been neutral, so I can see how it could help, but adding it to the bottom like this detracts from the clarity, so I have moved it to the top. I usually put an explicit statement of my position somewhere in my nomination when nominating something for AfD. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus"><b>Philosophus</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus"><b>T</b></a></sup> 12:20, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree with you. I think all would agree that adding a nominator's vote at the <i>bottom</i> of the discussion may create an appearance of an extra vote.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article is about Dr. Omura and his invention, the BDORT procedure. Both have more than amply sourced notability. Specifically, there are multiple international symposia, as well as 'continuing education' courses, held at (but not <i>by</i>) mainstream institutions. All of this is well sourced in the article. Also, the BDORT procedure itself was subject to review by a highly qualified medical ethics review panel in NZ. They concluded that BDORT has 'no scientific validity'. IMO, the combination of a highly promoted medical procedure that is claimed by its promoters to diagnose and cure everything from cancer to the common cold, coupled with a clear verdict by an ethics review panel of 'no scientific validity', all well sourced, more than meets WP's <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sourcing</a> criteria. I don't think we have to resort to tossing in inflammatory 'pseudoscience' or 'quackery' adjectives (which directly label its promoters as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlatans.html" title="Charlatans">charlatans</a>) to allow the article to stay.

<li>The problem, here, though, is sourcing, as you've said yourself in discussion. The bio info you cite is sourced to Omura's site, not independently verified, as is also the situation for the claims of use. Even if it were verified, which it isn't, the bio info itself doesn't likely rise to the 'professor's test' of notability simply because the fellow self-publishes his 'international journal.' The mainstream institution you cite is simply listing a 'conference' in a local hotel – it isn't actually hosting or sponsoring it at all – which is the case for many of its other listings. We seem to have no verifiable sources for claims of widespread use at all – only vanity sources, hence the notability issue. This seems to leave the Omura entry in verifiable form dependent solely on the NZ commission and its ruling re Gorringe – for both of whom we have already appropriate short entries. If WP presents claims of widespread use, etc, not independently verified, it seems to me there may be issues at a number of levels. TealCyfre 19:25, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I’m concerned that WP, in the <i>name</i> of NPOV, may be used to promote for-profit dubious activities, verifiable only through paid placement and vanity self-publication, and may, to boot, inherit potential liability issues as a result of so doing. Your first cite is not self-evidently self-published, but you yourself have consistently argued in discussion against its acceptability since the author of the article is not an MD, but only, so far as anyone can determine, holds a PhD in Sports Medicine, and refers to its being ‘triple-blinded’ because three people in physical contact with one another avoided eye contact. If this is ‘triple-blinded’, heaven knows what ‘peer-reviewed’ means in their usage. As to the <i>professor test:</i> A near infinite number of academics and MDs attend and/or host various seminars, and yes, in the modern world they are very often ‘international.’ They are not, in my understanding, per WP criteria deemed notable. We have <i>nothing,</i> other than the promotional claims of Omura’s own two sites and their echoes, to vouche for attendance, extent, etc – and these are promotions for money-making activities which WP, if it is not exceedingly careful, may fall into the trap of vouching for and promoting in my estimation, which could create non-trivial exposure in the event of another Gorringe-like incident occurring. All the various listings you present, in addition to being non-verified, are to publications which simply list anyone who pays to be listed. Hardly confirmation of notability in my estimation, and arguably evidence of vanity combined with non-notability. TealCyfre 20:33, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>My critique of the Shinnick article had to do with the validity of its technical assessment of BDORT as a medical technique, <i>not</i> with its being a neutral source that seems to show that BDORT exists outside of Omura's publications. Hence the 'triple blindedness' is not an issue, as the scientific credentials of the author are not established. As for WP inadvertently promoting a scientifically unproven technique by its NPOV stance, I believe that by simply neutrally presenting the facts as we see them in the public domain, and including a reference to <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quackery.html" title="Quackery">quackery</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">alternative medicine</a> in the 'See Also' section, we would be safe. It does mean that we have to be <i>extra careful</i> to be as neutral as possible and present the relevant sources with appropriate weight. For example, all Omura's related Web sites and publications count very little for our purposes, as they would not be considered neutral. The NZ document would get a lot of weight by virtue of its neutrality as well as the credentials of its experts. As far as the professor test, IMO there are not a lot of professors who actually organize and hold multiple international symposia, while promoting their techniques or inventions. I agree that we have no hard proof as to attendance figures, but there are some abstracts and I would have to assume that at least the authors attended. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 21:09, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

No evidence of being notable even within acupuncture or pseudoscientific circles. A job at a university, a self-published journal, and a bunch of self-hosted events with unknown attendence don't meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> professor guidelines.

<li>You might want to bear in mind, Wickning1, that we are talking about someone having a single cite in a single journal, once, and this in an article written by someone who as best we can determine is a PhD in SportScience, who once was in the Olympics, and who makes a living promoting this stuff. The other example of 'notability' given here is that in a long monthly listing of seminars/meetings presented, Omura's, held at a local hotel, is on the list. If these make Omura 'notable' then 'notable' has a pretty low threshhold, or so it would seem to me. By these criteria I would think nearly every physician and college professor would manage to qualify, and it is explicit WP policy, as I understand it, that the threshhold simply isn't that low.

<li><b><s>Neutral</s> Keep</b>: I'm not sure about this. I withdrew the nomination because it does appear that, as a pseudoscientist, Omura and his practices are notable. They do seem to have international use among doctors of questionable reputation. However, the article has now been turned into what amounts to an advertisement for the practices with "These findings are not known to have been presented to or subject to evaluation by conventional independent peer-reviewed assessment." tacked on to the end of each section, much like the FDA warnings on most bogus medicines. This is not an acceptable method of NPOV. The findings probably haven't been presented for peer review (excluding, of course, peer review by Omura's colleagues) because it would be too difficult to find legitimate reviewers who could consider it as something other than a joke. An RfC for the article might help, but as with most articles like this, it is difficult to find people who care enough to maintain the article against supporters, and deal with the usual wikilawyering. I would very much like to see this as a real NPOV article, but it seems that that isn't really going to be possible. Ironically, TealCyfre may be the person who is able to do this. But given the choice between an article like the current one and deletion, I would choose deletion. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus"><b>Philosophus</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus"><b>T</b></a></sup> 21:13, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm in effective agreement with Philosophus on these issues. I'm strongly inclined to the judgement that if any article <i>at all</i> is appropriate with respect to the NPOV issues, it must be very short, as I had suggested earlier. It may be that given the practical problem of finding enough people who care to maintain the article against supporters re-expanding it to another advertisement it is most appropriate to delete.

<li>I think that the issues of length and notability are independent of each other. There is no WP policy that says that article X may be included only if it can be kept to Y words or less. If anything, we have the 'WP is not paper' policy that almost encourages us to provide extra detail. The primary and critical issue for inclusion is <i>notability</i> - do we have it or not - if not - forget the rest. If yes, then the only constraints are neutrality, verifiable sourcing, due weights, good style etc. Your concern about letting WP become a platform for promoting unproven science will be addressed by properly following the above guidelines. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 22:05, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I also believe that the article's size doesn't have too much influence on the POV, as long as it does not become a long rant which no one but a supporter can understand enough to edit (like Modern Galilean relativity). --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus"><b>Philosophus</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus"><b>T</b></a></sup> 22:26, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think I see the core issues as two-fold: 1) Notability, per se, given the fact that there are entries for Gorringe and the NZ commission. 2) The probability, given scant awareness of the existence of Omura, that an entry provides a point of entry for adherents devoted to the creation of an advert to further 'legitimize' their process, which, to further compound the practical problem, may present WP with legal exposure. TealCyfre 22:55, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I think if 'legal exposure' is a criterion, WP might as well steer clear of any controversy, or just fold up tent. The correct approach is to decide on notability, and if it exists, write a good article per WP policies of neutrality, good sourcing, due weights, etc. The 'threat of the zealots' is part of the WP process for many articles, and so far WP has managed just fine. See also the Talk page. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 23:09, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I'm afraid my understanding diverges here. My understanding is that WP policies do indeed consider potential legal exposure. Perhaps I'm in error. In any event, what, given the fact that the Gorringe entry exists and the NZ Tribunal entry exists, is the notability justification for this entry, really? Verifiably, we have objectively scant evidence even of its existence. What we have evidences yet another deluded fool or charlatan promoting himself. As I understand it these don't rise to notability simply because they were referenced by the NZ tribunal in the case of Gorringe. Everything else we have on Omura is Omura's self-promotion and self-publication or that of his presumably tiny band of followers with no meaningful evidence even of their existence aside from self-promotion other than the passing quasi-advert for a meeting. How is this notable? TealCyfre 23:21, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I am not saying legal exposure is a non-issue for WP. Like any organization or individual, especially in today's sue-happy environment, one has to tread carefully. Having said that, the mere <i>fear</i> of exposure if we address sensitive or controversial topics should not paralyze us nor thwart our mission. If we handle each notable topic while carefully adhering to WP's policies of neutrality, reliable sourcing, due weights, etc. we should be on safe ground with any future jury. As far as notability in this case, the fact that some components related to Omura/BDORT have been explained in separate articles would not detract from the notability of the Omura/BDORT. We possibly would want to <i>merge</i> items (e.g. Gorringe, NZ Tribunal) but I doubt it. I think Omura/BDORT is the primary focus we currently have for the other articles, and believe we have more than enough reliable and neutral sources to establish Omura's/BDORT's notability. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 23:36, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>1) The Shinnick article is an article by a non-MD in an alternative medicine journal. We don’t, so far as I know, have an entry for every professor whose work has been evaluated or referred to in an academic journal – once.
<ul>
<li>The issue is not if <i>we have an article for each such case</i> but <i>whether</i> such a situation is notable per se. It seems to me that that publication adds credence to the existence of BDORT and to the fact that it was published, at least once, in an academic journal. My opinion is that once it is so published it becomes notable by WP's definition of the word. It does not have to be a house-hold word. And the fact that Shinnick is not an MD has nothing to do with notability. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 00:52, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>2) The NZ report does not vouch for notability of BDORT per se. It addresses the utter lack of scientific credibility for BDORT. In any event, there is an entry for Gorringe, and the commission’s report, which had an effect in altering policy re alternative medicine. These are notable, to at least some degree. Omura/BDORT, however, are only established as references, not as notable in and of themselves. Indeed, the commission simply treats them as insignificant variations on the theme of applied kinesiology.
<ul>
<li>The NZ report is read within NZ among practitioners and others. It is a neutral highly qualified publication. Certainly its readers would know about BDORT (or PMRT in their case) after this report came out. Yes, it does not focus on Omura - the focus is on BDORT/PMRT. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 00:52, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Very true. Anyone can write anything on the Web. But this is Omura's Web page and WP policy is that we allow wide tolerance to a person's bio on his own Web page unless some fact is contentious. If you disagree with some fact on his page, please speak up. And yes, alone this would not be enough, this is part of the larger package. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 00:52, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>It is the Academy's official Web page, with their official course schedule. The other 'things' they list are also courses. This proves BDORT is publicized (i.e. published to promote participation in a course) by a mainstream institution. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 00:52, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>True. Mere existence of a patent per se would not establish notability. In this case the reference is used to describe the procedure in a neutral site and show it exists outside of Omura's domain, and that the US government at least <i>looked</i> at it (with obviously no merit claim). BTW, lots of people read all newly issued patents which are published in a gazette by the USPTO. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 00:52, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>It is not wrong, in that it is an accurate statement of fact. The statement that Omura is Dir Med Rsch HDRF is <i>verifiable</i> so far as I am aware only via self-published sources. Nor does it constitute evidence of notability for Omura and his armamentarium. It was originally part of a separate entry for HDRF which was conflated with this entry. TealCyfre 02:04, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If the Omura bio on his own Web site claims that he is the "Director of Medical Research" (DMR) of HDRF, then as I understand WP policy for bio info on one's own Web site that information is <i>allowed</i> (properly sourced to that Web site) unless there is any opposing claim, in which case more investigation (i.e. better sourcing to resolve the conflict) would be needed. Are you aware of any claim that Omura is <i>not</i> the DMR of HDRF? And as far as notability, if we accept that he is/was in fact DMR of HDRF when they took on GMC 'on behalf of the people of the USA', and created a legal precedent in the process (for which we have a separate and valid reference), I would consider that another chunk of notability. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 02:29, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

</dd>

<ul>
<li>The notability question comes first, in my understanding. If Omura is not notable then other questions are moot. So, then, this other bit of 'notability' consists of his having, according to his own CV, been Dir Med Rsch of the HDRF at the time of a baseless suit that established precedent in that the courts preferred in future not to have to trouble themselves with going through the motions of dismissing suits which didn't even attempt to establish their basis? You will note that the HDRF itself was effectively judged non-notable when its independent entry was folded into that of Omura. Now we have the spectacle of that entry, having been established as non-notable, constituting evidence that Omura is notable in the absence of other established basis for establishing his notability. This seems to me the sum of infinitesimal evidence amount to nothing more than the sum of infinitesimal evidence, sorry if I'm not persuaded. TealCyfre 02:46, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>That the suit was 'baseless' is not an issue. The issue is that it <i>created a precedent</i> which was subsequently cited in the Bonano Organized Crime suit, where Omura/HDRF was used as precedent. I doubt that your average run-of-the-mill frivolous suit reaches that level of notability. Whether some previous discussion considered HDRF and its suit to be sufficienly notable on its own to justify its own article is immaterial here. We are relying on this lawsuit to add more notability to the Omura article, and yes there is a cumulative effect, but my suspicion is that if you spend some time (as I have) reviewing and voting on AfD's, you'd discover the WP <i>Keep</i> bar is set much lower than you seem to think. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 03:11, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm sorry, but for my part I fail to see how these rise to the level of notability. Gorringe is notable, his cases having in part prompted further clarification/revision of NZ codes of practice, as is the NZ commission and its successor commission, which are intrinsically notable. You will note that while press coverage may be found of Gorringe, there is none of Omura or BDORT in connection with the case, further suggesting their lack of notability. Omura is not on my considered judgement notable on the basis of the NZ case, which in the course of addressing Gorringe's defense duly consults expert witness and then dismisses Gorringe's PMRT and Omura's BDORT upon which Gorringe asserts his PMRT is based as utterly without claim to scientific merit of any sort, as simply another variant of Applied Kinesiology. This would establish via objective sourcing Omura and BDORT's claims to validity as spurious were they notable, but they do not in my judgement establish notability. The listing of seminars simply fails the <i>professor's test</i> in my judgement, and thus fails to establish notability. TealCyfre 01:25, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The listing of seminars does not apply to the professor's test. It applies to the <i>notability</i> of BDORT as a procedure, since there is a course delivered on it, publicized in the official web site of a mainstream academic institution. It does connote some notability to Omura, but that is not the thrust of that reference. In the NZ case, again, it is the BDORT/PMRT procedure that became notable, as it was allegedly used in lieu of conventional medicine to the detriment of a patient's best medical care, and the practitioner was disciplined and fined. This connotes notability to the BDORT/PMRT procedure as well as the practitioner. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 01:42, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Then I presume you feel every comparable listing of every comparable seminar is notable by WP standards. This would mean every topic treated in every seminar listed in a publication.</li>
<li>Gorringe became notable. I see no evidence that it raised Omura or BDORT to the level of notability. If so, where is that evidence? TealCyfre 01:51, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The seminar listing of a course given on topic X, publicized on the official web site of a mainstream academic institution, connotes notability for topic X, especially if topic X is claimed to diagnose/solve many/most of mankind's diseases. PMRT became notable by being cited in the final report of the NZ tribunal, as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"We therefore accept that PMRT is not a plausible, reliable, or scientific technique for making medical decisions. We find there is no plausible evidence that PMRT has any scientific validity. It therefore follows that reliance on PMRT to make diagnoses to the exclusion of conventional and/or generally recognized diagnostic/investigatory techniques is unacceptable and irresponsible."

</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I would respectfully submit that a published report by an eminently qualified medical disciplinary tribunal, that considers use of a procedure "unacceptable and irresponsible", makes that procedure (PMRT/BDORT) notable. I suspect that this was the reason the case was publicized by the Tribunal (note that some cases are kept confidential). <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 02:05, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If you look up the contents of one of the 2 Omura seminars publicized on the Academy's Web site, e.g. <a href="http://bdort.net/pdf/21stsymposium.pdf" class="external text" title="http://bdort.net/pdf/21stsymposium.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> you will note it includes BDORT. So I would say that if someone publicizes a symposium on a mainstream academic institution's official Web site, that would make BDORT, a featured sub-topic of the symposium (note the illustration), and most likely Omura, notable. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 02:59, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

No <i><b>reliable</b></i> and accurate sources that can be <i>verified</i> show that he is not or was not what the article says. From what I can see, Fortheloveofhampsters is also trying to mold history to meet his own beliefs and expectations without meeting the Wikipedia rules and guidelines on the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_%28band%29.html" title="Steam (band)">Steam (band)</a> article.

<li><b>Delete</b> because since anyone can write or edit on here, leaving it on here may give someone the impression that Greg Bravo may have written this himself. Any entertainer would have to be out of his mind to engage in such cheap PR tactics or even want this. I don't know who is right or wrong about the above gibberish, and do not even care. The intensity and controversy is very interesting, though--ad nauseam.

<p><b>*Comment</b> There is no reason to add my vote because it is pretty clear in which way this <i>vote</i> is heading, perhaps for the wrong reasons though some definitely seem to be right! It's hard to ignore the fact that this is all like whoever brings the most friends to a gang fight wins the day! There definitely is no fairness or impartiality involved, and that is truly remarkable for an organization that touts itself as an encyclopedia. Please stay away from the Beatles' articles!

<p>Luchawiki (which has over 700 bios of Mexican wrestlers) does not mention a wrestler named "Manteca." It appears he has won no titles, no hairs or masks, been in lucha magazines or done anything that would make him a notable luchador. It is also likely he is not real as well. The article claims that he fought with another wrestler over the name "<a href="../../../c/h/u/Chupacabra.html" title="Chupacabra">chupacabra</a>" about twenty years before the first chupacabra sighting. There are also questionable things like a Mexican wrestler having a move called "Butterball" and the mention of the IWA as a sanctioning body (there was no promotion in Mexico called IWA, it was an American promotion in North Carolina). At best this person in non-notable but he is most likely entirely fictional. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarren_Jowalsen_31c2.html" title="User:Darren Jowalsen">Darren Jowalsen</a> 20:33, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This guy is not notable and there are very view factual reports about his activity Smtusa 17:21, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b> James Dicks is very well known. He claims to be a best selling author, produces 12 hours of radio programming a day, claims to be the "world's leading expert in forex trading." There are 17,300 hits when googling for "James Dicks" and all the hits on the first several pages appear to refer to this guy. The article has several links including a Fox TV news report, a feature <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Press_a5dd.html" title="Houston Press">Houston Press</a> (alternative) newspaper article, a financial website "Stupid Investment of the Week." And there are several rip-off reports. There is no question that the guy is notable. The article was originally put up as a puff advertising piece, and now that I've corrected it and made it NPOV, he wants to delete it. The previous vote was to <b>KEEP</b> after the corrections were made.<a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmallbones_ca2c.html" title="User:Smallbones">Smallbones</a> 19:25, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Smallbones. I fail to see what has become deletion-worthy since the previous keep. - <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperlex_32b0.html" title="User:Superlex">Lex</a> 05:10, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Smtusa. There are numerous false claims in this article and unless it can be proven that the aligations are true, they don't belong in Wikipedia. The whole article seems like it is trying to prove his guilt, when in fact he has never been convicted of these accusations. "He is reportedly the nephew of Charles Givens...." Where is the proof. Anyone can make statements like this and it seems this article is completely bias and draws conclusions without facts. Writing in such a manner is liable. FYI, it is not James Dicks who wants this article deleted (although I am sure he does), but me, for the sake of keeping Wikipedia free from bias opinions against those you don't like. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.193.232.253 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.193.232.253.html" title="User talk:66.193.232.253">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.193.232.253_5b26.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.193.232.253">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is an annual lifesaving competition, 7 years in or whatever, not to mention the first in Canada's atlantic provinces. I'm not sure, could even be all of Canada. draws hundreds of competitors, some going on to represent the province in national competitions and even some in the US and in Australia. It's not a profit organization, so It doesn't have really a need to advertise, and if someone wonders what it is, why shouldn't they be able to find out on here? <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESECProto_acc3.html" title="User:SECProto">SECProto</a> 00:38, 20 June 2006 (UTC) addendum: I was recently reading about <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">Systemic Bias in Wikipedia</a>, and about the variety of subjects which are not covered. If they are outside the technological field, then they are less likely to get any attention, etc. I think this article almost fits in that category - Due to the subject of the article, it will be neglected (or in this case- nominated for deletion). And another note, in a search on google, the nova scotia surf league gets results not so much from the government of canada/nova scotia, but from the NSLS (government sponsored), the lifesaving society, and the major paper of nova scotia (the chronicle herald).

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm a lifeguard, so I'd hardly go around accusing me of bias against lifeguard competitions *rolls eyes*.

<li><b>Reply</b> - No worries about the systemic bias, i never accused you of it - I just said it almost seems to fit in that category. No offense meant, the topic just stuck in my head.

<li><b>Answer</b> If it is was the first in <i>Canada</i> then yes. But it's the first in a single region.

<p><b>Comment:</b> Hmmm... I'm not sure how you reach the conclusions you do. Centric CRM has over 5,000 registered users in the development community. If you actually visit the <a href="https://www.centriccrm.com/Portal.do?key=community" class="external text" title="https://www.centriccrm.com/Portal.do?key=community" rel="nofollow">community</a> you will see a very active and robust set of forums with countless posts on a daily basis.</p>
<p>As for innovation, Centric CRM was named a finalist for LinuxWorld's Product Excellence awards 2 months ago at LinuxWorld Boston. The product's approach to CRM which marries traditional CRM functionality found in products like Salesforce.com with sophisticated functionality like Document Management, automated customer surveys, collaborative project managment, content management and e-commerce is unique in the CRM space. As an example, the Centric CRM developer community with its discussion forums, wikis, newsgroups, code repositories and so forth, is run entirely on Centric CRM itself.</p>
<p>As for user base, companies like The Weather Channel and other Fortune 500 companies are using Centric CRM throughout their organizations today, in addition to many SMBs throughout the world. More significant customer engagements will be announced in the months ahead as those projects clear their NDA requirements. On the partnership side, some of the leading infrastructure companies in the IT space are forming strategic partnerships with Centric CRM because of its unique position in the marketplace as a true enterprise class open source application. Announcements on these fronts will be forthcoming over the next 6 weeks, as will related articles in the press and online.</p>
<p>Centric CRM has been under continuous development for over 6 years, comprises millions of lines of code, and has been embraced by some of the world's largest companies. A deliberately low profile has been kept during that time while the pieces of a valuable business were put in place; sort of an old fashioned way of doing things, in this age when a couple guys with an idea can get millions of dollars of VC funding. The profile of the product is now being deilberately raised as part of a larger effort to expand its awareness and penetration into the market at large. Posting an article to Wikipedia is but one small step of that larger process.</p>
<p>That Centric CRM has no "encyclopaedic notability" seems to me a hasty conclusion based not on verifiable fact (development community size and vigor; technical sophistication of the product; quality of customers; etc.) but on a single datapoint--number of Google hits. I encourage you to look a little deeper before drawing your conclusion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Mdh98368 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mdh98368_26ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mdh98368">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>That's all very interesting, but the argument has two flaws. The first is that it does not directly address the concerns of Wikipedia, but that is excusable because you probably haven't been made aware of them. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28software%29_dfdb.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (software)">Wikipedia:Notability (software)</a> is the project document that details how the notability of software like Centric CRM is judged. From what you've said above, criterion #6 is the closest one to being satisfied: can you provide a citation for the LinuxWorld award/honor?</dd>
<dd>The second flaw is where you say, "The profile of the product is now being deilberately raised as part of a larger effort to expand its awareness and penetration into the market at large. Posting an article to Wikipedia is but one small step of that larger process." That's specifically a Do Not at Wikipedia. (See <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_02d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity">Wikipedia:Vanity</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a>.) Wikipedia is an academic project, not an advertising platform or a web directory. Using it as a platform for promotion makes editors rather hostile, often to the point that an article that is on the borderline for being included, as, say, one might be if it got a marginal honor in line with criterion #6, will get voted out of existence on principle. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 18:15, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Thanks for responding.

As for published pieces, there is Michael Caton's-- e-Week's Techncial Analyst--<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1828447,00.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1828447,00.asp" rel="nofollow">piece in e-Week</a>. At least two long articles in the print editions of 2 separate and well-respected industry magazines will hit the newsstands in July and in August. For an independent opinion on Centric CRM's technological sophistication, I could put you in contact with Brian Shield, CTO of The Weather Channel, who has moved TWC's entire help-desk operation onto Centric CRM.</p>
<p>My purpose in submitting the article is not commercial gain. Rather, we are proud of the approach taken in designing and building Centric CRM. Unlike many commercial software ventures, Centric CRM's design and execution would please a computer scientist. As an avid user and fan of Wikipedia, the thought of having the company listed there would be very gratifying. Over the next few weeks, my intention was to begin posting some interesting technical information about the product, discussing its MVC design pattern, its incorporation of the JSR 168 (portlet) spec, and so forth. Information, in other words, that is intended to be of general interest to other wikipedia users interested in open source, CRM, and innovative applications of advanced technologies.

<dd>Criterion #6 isn't satisfied by the LinuxWorld mention, as nominations are not awards. The eWeek piece is a very minor news piece and future articles don't count, so #1 isn't satisfied either. Numbers 2 through 5 don't apply.

<p>Hi Folks: I wrote or replied to each of you with no response from any. Zoe and I talked and he pointed to the NPOV to which I responded (no reaction yet). So, not having anywhere else to go, I came here to reach all if I could??? Zoe suggests the title is polemic. Scientist have dug 12 feet into the earth at Aamjiwnaang before they reached unpolluted dirt/clay. Every inch before it is polluted, as is the air above it. Aamjiwnaang is not under siege by an army everybody likes but me. It is saturated with benzodenes, clorines, x-factors providing a haven for a possible pestilent. How do I defend my piece if you mark for delete and move on to your next article, never revisiting the last to see if the writer spoke to the issues pointed out? Is there another way that I don't know about? <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBud_Whiteye_2e81.html" title="User:Bud Whiteye">Bud Whiteye</a> 14:57, 20 June 2006 (UTC) Bud Whiteye, Aamjiwnaang</p>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Keep</b>.

<p><b>Vanity</b> - The article, now about a fake game, was simply created to generate attention for an obscure person, who in turn tried to re-sell the "fake" game in a private auction on his forum using this article as hype for the product.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Nomination has the facts wrong about this article. The article has nothing to do with vanity, as I wrote the majority of the text back in November of 2005. There's no money or traffic to be had through this article at this point, nor was there any when the original article was put up, as I wasn't in possession of the alleged cart or even knew much more than what's in the article. Article is about a noted hoax that made the rounds throughout the internet. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 00:18, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Delete or Merge</b> - Problem is the "hoax" is up for auction on a person fan site right now, and they're using the Wiki article in the chat about it that I've seen to get people to believe it is "real". The hoax is not even in the top 10 "Zelda" hoaxes of all time, it was merely a small blip. The article only serves to drive traffic to certain sites, to give the creator more attention, and to be used for commercial purposes. This is blantantly vanity and abuse, it's time this article goes away. Perhaps a page about ALL ZELDA HOAXES would be warranted, but not this one game. --<a href="../../../t/s/a/User%7ETSA_3997.html" title="User:TSA">TSA</a> 09:04, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>If people want to falsely use a Wikipedia entry as justification, when it's clear in the page that the veracity of the actual cart is questionable, that's not our problem. Your continued assertions of "only used for commercial purposes," "vanity" and "abuse" make little sense considering who has written the most of it. Hell, you were involved in it. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 10:56, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I can’t say that I necessarily agree with the reason of vanity, but I think that the article is perhaps written in a way that may somewhat convey that impression more than it should; at first glance, it almost appears to be a legit game in the series when it's not. However, I don’t necessarily think that the article’s content is unimportant. The Zelda Series is huge, making things like this important for fans and researchers, but like TSA wrote, I think it would be better suited in an article about Zelda Hoaxes, rather than standing on its own. Then, perhaps this could redirect to that page. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedNitrogen_c88f.html" title="User:RedNitrogen">RedNitrogen</a> 23:27, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The talk page discussion referred to above is quite convoluted. The article under discussion here was created by User:Pce3@ij.net when his/her attempts to include the computations in the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half_life.html" title="Half life">half life</a> article were rebuffed. That article contains the rather standard and quite simple math equations for exponential decay, however User:Pce3@ij.net apparently objected to the use of a couple of the standard symbols. The content of the page under consideration here contains:
<dl>
<dd>A simplified <i>how to</i> calculation which doesn't use the <i>rate constant</i> symbol. The use of non-standard <i>lg</i> for <i>log</i> is itself confusing (this was pointed out to the user). Objection: Wikipedia is not a <i>how to</i>.</dd>
<dd>The inclusion of unexplained or identified (language) computer code for the calculation. Meaningless nonsense - which adds nothing to understanding the concept. If programming is being taught then the <i>students</i> should develope the code from the equations.</dd>
<dd>The long table was apparently produced by the author using Excel to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a> and is in itself rather absurdly meaningless.</dd>

<dd>Yes, thank you. Though I'll with-hold my vote for the time being, I agree that the way the article is a bit out of place the way it is right now. I would like to bring to your attention what are called <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_General_Audience_b9fe.html#Trampolines" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject General Audience">trampolines</a>, and if there is really a need to demistify half-life (there is, high-schoolers learn about half-life and at that level it is completely inaccessible), then a trampoline could be in place. Wikipedia may not be a how-to manual, but a case has already been made for trampolines, and the only thing lacking is volunteers with enough understanding and will to create the articles. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshgavin_9ad7.html" title="User:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="white" style="background:blue">&#160;freshofftheufo</font></a><a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreshgavin_46e9.html" title="User talk:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="blue">ΓΛĿЌ&#160;</font></a> 16:36, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For high-school accesible demistification of the concept of half-life I consider most appropriate to perform experiments and correct computer simulations. See in <a href="http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/Mar2003/1047912974.Ph.r.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/Mar2003/1047912974.Ph.r.html" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> how to test the <i>behavior of the last atoms</i>. The proponent of the fork lacks to understand that validation of physics-math models consists in comparing the model's behavior with experimental observations of real physical systems or valid simulations (physical and/or computer). The references given here describe how to test the validity (or not) of the exponential formula for <b>small number of atoms</b> with simple simulations, experiments, and computer code. Physics describes nature. When a formula can mimic nature we accept such a model and use it. In radioactive decay, the exponential model <b>does not apply for small number of atoms</b> (or small number of atoms are not within the domain of validity of the formula or equation or table). The DIY experiments use pennies or m&amp;m candies. <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/radioactive_decay.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/radioactive_decay.html" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencenetlinks.com/lessons.cfm?DocID=178" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sciencenetlinks.com/lessons.cfm?DocID=178" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>. A similar experiment is performed in college with isotopes of a very short half-life, e.g., see Fig 5 in <a href="http://www.uni-regensburg.de/Fakultaeten/nat_Fak_IV/Organische_Chemie/Didaktik/Keusch/cassy_pa_hwz-e.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uni-regensburg.de/Fakultaeten/nat_Fak_IV/Organische_Chemie/Didaktik/Keusch/cassy_pa_hwz-e.htm" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>.

<dd>The table is wrong--mathematically incorrect according to the specific principle it aims to clarify (as explained on the parent article <a href="../../../h/a/l/Talk%7EHalf-life_bb98.html" title="Talk:Half-life">Talk:Half-life</a>, but not corrected by proponent of the forked article). The page's proponent claims the results table is for an equation for a process by which each atom of <sup>14</sup>C transforms into an atom of <sup>14</sup>N, given a starting amount of <sup>14</sup>C. Observation: the total number of atoms is not constant, therefore the table is not correct for the issue at hand. The proponent supports it "The issue here is not the tables anyway or who created them or how since the facts they are intended to illustrate can be reproduced by virtually anyone using virtually any method." I don't see how false facts can be used to support anything about anything, nor why they should be included anywhere in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 17:11, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree about the tables. I don't know what Jclerman is going on about though, why are you trying to dictate <i>how</i> to teach high schoolers? I don't mean to be rude but your speech largely resembles rambling, and it may be that you are not a native English speaker but it is incredibly difficult to follow your discussion.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The majority opinion here is based upon the notion that half life computation is entirely dependent upon and a matter of probability. While the application of half life computation is probabilistic in some cases it is highly deterministic in other cases. Take a annuity account for instance. A steady exponential loss is deterministic rather than probabilistic as would be the case if the losses varied at random as with an open market sub account. Since the Half-life computation article now contains both probabilistic and deterministic computation computer code (and examples) it is more comprehensive than similar articles on half life which deal only with probabilistic applications and are somewhat more dependent upon symbolism which some users find difficult or have too little time to absorb.

There are points that should be added to <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-life.html" title="Half-life">Half-life</a> and/or <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exponential_decay.html" title="Exponential decay">Exponential decay</a>, and both need actual references, but neither problem is addressed by this article. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 16:55, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-life.html" title="Half-life">Half-life</a> article now seems to have incorporated some of the basic ideas about which I was concerned into the body of the article thus somewhat relieving the need for those ideas to be expressed elsewhere. However, a single article on half life (see: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_exponential_topics.html" title="List of exponential topics">the wide variety of articles</a> needed to cover the topic in the Wikipedia) especially one based entirely upon mathematics <i>without</i> any practical computational example (see: <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rule_of_three_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Rule of three (mathematics)">Rule of three (mathematics)</a> as an example and especially one that shows the probablistic or random nature of the computations) in light of the many deterministic applications of half life in the everyday real world seems a bit <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elitism.html" title="Elitism">elitist</a>, <a href="../../../e/g/o/Egoism.html" title="Egoism">egotistical</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selfishness.html" title="Selfishness">selfish</a> to me. <small>...IMHO (Talk)</small> 23:34, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>My vote remains. I think honesty is better than diplomacy here: the article still betrays deep misunderstandings over what's going on. In particular, the sections "What happens to Carbon-14 when it decays?" and "Continuous and Discrete Decay" are completely wrong. I can't get into specifics because there's just too much. If you want to fix the article, you'll have to tear it down, read some books, and start over; none of this accumulation of notes and apologies on top of the same rotten foundation. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 15:04, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm afraid I have to echo Melchior's concerns. The article's tone still represents the author's attempt to push his own view of radioactive decay ("...such a claim fails to consider the following fact...") and is misleading to the point of inaccuracy. Blocks of sample code, flatly, do not belong in articles. Finally, the article is still a content fork, which is a fault that no amount of editing will repair. Pce3 has gone so far as to avoid <i>any</i> internal links to the original <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-life.html" title="Half-life">half-life</a> article, preferring to use an external link (<a href="http://www.lbl.gov/abc/Basic.html#Half" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lbl.gov/abc/Basic.html#Half" rel="nofollow">[52]</a>) so as to avoid mentioning Wikipedia's (longer, more detailed, and more comprehensive) article. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 15:25, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Ditto. Problems persist in the new version. Just to single one of them, the original blunder that started all these discussions: the table now called <i><b>Transition of Carbon-14 to Nitrogen-14</b></i> still reflects a grave contradiction between its numbers and the narrative which imply deficiencies in physics, logic, and computer code. E.g.:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>between Cycle 1 and Cycle 2: 5E+307 atoms of C14 decay into 1 single atom of N14. Where are the missing (5E+307)-1 N14 atoms?</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>between Cycle 1024 and Cycle 1025: 1 single atom of C14 decays into 1E+307 atoms of N14. Which process creates 1E+307 atoms out of a single one?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Needles to repeat it again and again, as it has been said already, the number of C14-<i>decayed</i> + N14-<i>created</i> atoms at each cycle should remain equal and constant throughout the whole table if it is to reflect both the correct physics and the proponent's own model. <a href="../../../j/c/l/User%7EJclerman_3d71.html" title="User:Jclerman">Jclerman</a> 16:18, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The information provided by this article differs from the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-life.html" title="Half-life">Half-life</a> article by expanding the results of the probabilistic method of computation (with less reliance upon archaic symbology) and showing the mathematical equations, computer code and actual results of both the probabilistic and the deterministic methods of computation. Special attention is given to the primary application of half life computation in Carbon-14 dating where integer versus decimal variables should be used. Expansion of the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-life.html" title="Half-life">Half-life</a> article is necessary to demonstrate and clarify the correct interpretation of the mathematics in regard to their application to a Carbon-14 dating scenario. Since <a href="../../../j/c/l/User%7EJclerman_3d71.html" title="User:Jclerman">User:jclerman</a> insists that the half-life decay of Carbon-14 proceeds <i><b>ad infintium</b></i> regardless of Carbon-14 sample size it is clear that <a href="../../../j/c/l/User%7EJclerman_3d71.html" title="User:Jclerman">User:jclerman</a> is using decimal rather than integer variables in his thinking which simply do not apply. By refusing to allow this clarification and example to be included in the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-life.html" title="Half-life">Half-life</a> article <a href="../../../j/c/l/User%7EJclerman_3d71.html" title="User:Jclerman">User:jclerman</a> and the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-life.html" title="Half-life">Half-life</a> article fail to uphold the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy and the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-life.html" title="Half-life">Half-life</a> article should be tagged for deletion instead. <small>...IMHO (Talk)</small> 09:58, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am bringing this article up for an AfD vote because I am unsure if it meets several of the qualities for inclusion at Wikipedia. First, the subject only has 1000 Google hits, which to me is a rather low number to be considered notable. Second, the article is definately self-promotional, with people connected with Advocacy Investing having created the article. That said, the subject has had some significant press coverage (such as <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/f6ddcfca-ecc2-11da-a307-0000779e2340.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/f6ddcfca-ecc2-11da-a307-0000779e2340.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/f6ddcfca-ecc2-11da-a307-0000779e2340.html</a>, along with articles (which I can not verify) in CNBC, the Wall Street Journal, The Street.com, First Business, The Wall Street Transcript, Crain’s Chicago Business, Green Money Journal, among others. I have speedy deleted this article twice now and have restored it at the request of the article's creator. I will not be voting b/c I said I'd simply present the facts on the article and allow others to decide if it meets the criteria for inclusion here. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 00:02, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've searched references for the whole content of the article for too long, yet haven't been lucky. I've already asked for them in the talkl page again and again, with no answer. The original article had a whole section which was nonsense (see Talk page), so I believe the article's topic is completely made up, or maybe original research by some non-expert in the topic. In conclusion, the article is non-verifiable and (consequently) perhaps original research. <a href="../../../e/u/y/User%7EEuyyn_f321.html" title="User:Euyyn">euyyn</a> 00:39, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>delete</b> - The content is mostly weak and the few things of note are well covered elsewhere. The implication that these things are post-OO is simply wrong; delegation, mixins and multiple dispatch are an intergral part of OO.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b> (if we were vote counting, it's 4-3 delete, so no consensus, leaning towards delete, but AFD is not a vote). The three links provided - the sole justification for keeping - are sixth form reviews (ie, twelfth grade). Calton provides the best argument. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i><b>/</b>/<b>/</b></i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 08:54, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
