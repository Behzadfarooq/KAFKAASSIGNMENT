I am not sure which thing on the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> this fits but...if you go to the torrent typhoon <a href="http://www.torrenttyphoon.com" class="external text" title="http://www.torrenttyphoon.com" rel="nofollow">main site</a> and click on "About", it eventually points to this particular wikipedia page.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Agree with submitter. See: <a href="http://www.torrenttyphoon.com/about.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.torrenttyphoon.com/about.aspx" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<li><b>Delete.</b> No evidence this site is encyclopedic; The page is POV and promotional. However I disagree with the nominator and a couple of the above votes about the reasons for deletion. If this were to be a good Wikipedia article, there would be no objection to the site linking to us. We should evaluate the article according to the same criteria as any other. Perhaps, in time, we should expand the guidelines of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:autobiography</a> to include promotions such as this? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 05:22, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: This website has existed for less than two weeks, and it's not yet known how many people will ever know of it. Microsoft Windows has been available for twenty years and nearly all the computer users in the world know of it. If you don't think that's a significant difference, fair enough. I do, so no change of vote. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 11:00, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Rjstott, I'm not sure you quite understand what they did. They basically are pointing their website back to a Wikipedia article, which is very very against policy. Very.&#160;:) Content doesn't matter that much, honestly. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">Woohookitty</a> 05:42, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC).</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I think I understand perfectly well and wonder what the fuss is about. Both of the policies cited need a serious stretch of imagination to cover this situation if it is really seen as a no-no. Do you suggest that if the referring web-site had a copy of this then it is ok. There is serious merit in having a definitive view and that that definition would be the one in Wikipedia. The problem I see is that the creator of the page might suppress any change and keep it POV. However the rules of Wikipedia would sort that out and have already given the article Public Domain status?--<a href="../../../r/j/s/User%7ERjstott_f82b.html" title="User:Rjstott">Rjstott</a> 09:47, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm no expert here, but I'd vote <b>Kill</b> simply because this is POV and reads like a brochure. It may be good, but is it NPOV&#160;? --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 09:28, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Our deletion policy doesn't support deletion of articles simply because the content is POV. Needs a lot of cleanup to remove the superlatives and whatnot. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:00, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: Agree that POV is not an issue regarding deletion, this is a very important point. But the issue here is that this article is promotional by its very nature. It's not a notable site, not yet at least. It has only even existed for two weeks.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I have now edited it to remove the promotional language. The subject is probably NN because it's so new, but I could be persuaded otherwise by someone familiar with the BitTorrent community. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreplySpang_52d7.html" title="User:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">(talk)</a> 12:28, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This web site was created on April 18th, 2005 -- almost two weeks ago. So I agree that it is not notable yet, unless someone provides evidence to the contrary. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 12:32, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. It is much condensed now, and I put all the information that was on it on my About page... so I think it is fine now. If growing 7500% (literally) in 1 week doesn't constitute "notable" I do not know what is (Source: Publicly-viewable stats page). --SubKamran 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b>. OK, I'm satisfied. I'll even add a link to the main site for you. My main objection, which was the fact that it was pointing back to Wikipedia, has been taken care of.

<li>I'm not yet. "We have served 19704 searches," says its front page. For a <i>search engine</i>, that's nothing. The article says it "will search the major torrent websites and pool their results onto one page;" so it's a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metasearch_engine.html" title="Metasearch engine">metasearch engine</a>, or a script that relies entirely on results from other sites. It's longstanding official policy that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> a web guide, or a vehicle for self-promotion. I can't see squaring this with a keep vote, or I could write my own metasearch script and spread notice around and have a Wikipedia article the next week. I hope keep voters understand how low this would set the bar for the notability of websites. <b>Userfy</b> to User:SubKamran or a subpage, without a redirect from the main article space. Bring it back to the main article space if and when it starts getting cited in major media, hitting the high ranks in Alexa, etc, and if someone other than the person behind the site puts it there. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 20:50, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Between keeping and deleting an article or redirect at Torrent Typhoon, to be clear, I want my vote to count as <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 16:51, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Notability is all very well to apply to people (because there are so many of us and we're vain and like to see our names on websites, and most of us aren't of much interest to anyone beyond our families) but here we have a publicly available (if very new) website and an article containing verifiable information about it. That is all that Wikipedia policy requires of an article. An article about a website of this type doesn't have to establish "notability". The question is whether or not it's an accurate article about a website that people may wonder if they want to use. They could try the website if they knew (or guessed) the URL or they could enter the name in Google and be brought to Wikipedia to read about it first. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 21:50, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I disagree with ya a bit, Tony. I think notability is an issue no matter whether it's a company or a person. Otherwise, Wikipedia could very easily become a web directory and it shouldn't be. I mean I work for a small ISP in Wisconsin that has 7,000 users. Are we public? yep. Are we notable? No. We're just a plain ISP. The problem with opening up that can of worms is that Wikipedia is not meant to be a web directory. Once Typhoon Torrent becomes well known, great. Otherwise (and especially in an age where using open source materials, anyone can make a program), we're opening ourselves up to alot of crapola that doesn't belong here. You describe it as whether or not its an accurate article about a website that people may wonder if they want to use. Isn't that a description of a web directory or search engine? That's what web directories or search engines are for, NOT an encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">Woohookitty</a> 22:09, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>For this case I concur. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 16:51, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Advert, non-notable, WP is not a web directory. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 22:55, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. If it proves its notability in the long run, a better article will organically reappear. In the mean time, they shouldn't use wiki as free advertising. <a href="../../../f/e/c/User%7EFeco_e36a.html" title="User:Feco">Feco</a> 05:05, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I fail to see how it is advertising now that all the fluff has been removed and I do not link back to it anymore. All in all, I don't mind if it's deleted if it goes against WikiPedia's policies. Let's examine it now: 1) "or vehicle for propaganda and advertising" -- The article is now in a neutral point of view, no advertising, I do not link back to it anymore. The article provides a brief and concise explanation to what Torrent Typhoon is. But like I said, I will not cry if you remove it if it goes against policies. --SubKamran 1 May 2005</li>
