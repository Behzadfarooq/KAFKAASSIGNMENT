<p>Unprecedented list, overall pointless. Wikipedia isn't like a Middle School Black History Month powerpoint presentation. There is nothing *unique* about being Black and being one of these things so a separate article like this is just plain ridiculous.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> <b>Delete</b> (see the explanation of my change below); unless you want to go after <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Inventors_646d.html" title="List of Inventors">List of Inventors</a>; there is a solid argument at this juncture for a question of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. --<a href="../../../m/h/k/User%7EMhking_b8d7.html" title="User:Mhking">Mhking</a> 04:27, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>No, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_inventors.html" title="List of inventors">list of inventors</a> has precedent and reason. It is an occupation like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_physicists.html" title="List of physicists">list of physicists</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_film_directors.html" title="List of film directors">list of film directors</a>. There is no Notable white innovators, inventors and scientists or Notable Hispanic innovators, inventors and scientists because categorization this by race is pretty much <i>overcategorization</i>. There is absolutely no viable comparison between the two. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 04:34, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I am aware of said <a href="../../../e/s/s/Wikipedia%7EEssays_b681.html" title="Wikipedia:Essays">essay</a> (not policy or guideline); my reason for voting <i>keep</i> is because of "encyclopedic content." That it also happens to be potentially useful is a contributing factor, but not the main rationale. That being said, I would be in favor of a rename to "List of black inventors" per various comments below. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">â—„</span></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel"><font color="indigo"><span style="text-decoration:none">Zahakiel</span></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">â–º</span></font></a> 07:16, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - if kept, the article needs to be renamed to remove the words "notable" and "innovators." The former is redundant (anyone with a Wikipedia article has to be notable) and the latter is not objectively definable. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 05:02, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I personally think that it is more or less identical to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_actors_and_actresses_e282.html" title="List of Jewish actors and actresses">List of Jewish actors and actresses</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_inventors_ed2a.html" title="List of Jewish inventors">List of Jewish inventors</a>. <b>Comment on deleting</b>: even if this is to be deleted, it must be done in a professional way, lest we got flagged by NAACP on this. This is a dangerous territory, best to keep it. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorge_Leung_a0b3.html" title="User:George Leung">George Leung</a> 05:13, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>move</b> to List of black innovators, inventors, and scientists; might as well bring into line with aforementioned Jewish list(s). --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian">Merovingian</a> â€» <a href="../../../m/e/r/User_talk%7EMerovingian_28b5.html" title="User talk:Merovingian">Talk</a> 05:19, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Fear of being "racy" is not a valid reason to keep a list. This, plus vote stackers, is the reason lists like this haven't been deleted yet. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 05:31, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> Well, this page isn't very well done, for one thing, I think the name choice is poor. But since <a href="../../../i/n/v/Category%7EInventors_by_nationality_4f87.html" title="Category:Inventors by nationality">Category:Inventors by nationality</a> does exist, I'd say there's no inherent objection to identifying people by race or ethnicity as appropriate. But this page is poorly doing it. I don't know if List of Black Inventors or List of African-American Inventors or what would be the better name to work with though. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:21, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I personally am leaning towards deletition, though the easiest way to express my reasoning is a reverse violation of <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a> (WP:OTHERCRAPDOESN'TEXIST), and as such, I feel it's best to hold off on voting for now. I also think that articles / sections / lists like these are just begging for "counter-article-section-lists" - that is, Notable white innovators, inventors, and scientists. I think it's important to come to some form of consensus on what would happen to such an article, before acting on this one. That said, one statement that I definitely feel strong enough about to bold is, <b>If kept, rename per <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a>'s statement</b>. --Action Jackson IV 05:35, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> also, it seems the List of Jewish _____ is being thrown around. I will say that there's several distinctions between being "Jewish" and being "Black" - two of which would be the ease of figuring out if someone is black (generally, and yes, there are exceptions), versus the relative difficulty of determining, from sight alone, whether someone is Jewish or not. Additionally, Judiasm is a religious choice. While we can bicker this way and that about determinalism and whether or not people actually "choose" their religion, it all comes down to the fact that it's a lot easier for me to pretend to be a goyim than it was for Michael Jackson to pretend to have light skin. --Action Jackson IV 05:48, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As noted by <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricR_931f.html" title="User:EricR">eric</a> above, race-occupation and/or nationality-occupation classifications are quite common and themselves rather intuitive. The suggested reasons for deletion of "pointless"ness and lack of "unique"ness are subjective and incorrect (or at best, irrelevant). Articles on Wikipedia need not be "unique" and the fact that dual classifications by race and occupation outside of WP exist attests to the fact that they are <i>not</i> pointless. That being said, rename to List of black inventors or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_black_inventors_and_scientists.html" title="List of black inventors and scientists">List of black inventors and scientists</a> per above. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 06:49, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and rename per above, using "African American" as the adjective since everyone in the list is an African American.

<li><b>Keep</b> - But I agree that this article needs a lot of work and that it needs to be expanded and renamed. The list is far to short and far from comprehensive. "African American" might make more sense for the time being. At some point a "lists of lists" should come in to being. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuturebird_4da8.html" title="User:Futurebird">futurebird</a> 11:45, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> the black/white issue isn't a relevant world view, race is alway debatable, soon enough we are going to see actors that are 1/4 this and painters that are 5/8 that. besides, don't we have categories to provide, hmmmmm, categorization? why the manually updated lists? they are just meant to fall out of date if not manually kept. Is the person relevant because he was an inventor? yes. did his race contribute to that relevance? I think not. and about the other lists, all the other lists, the same applies. if someone realy needs this information, i'm sure using google to search through the site will provide the same result. i'd also like to add that <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Steele_4e77.html" title="Claude Steele">Claude Steele</a>, who is on that list is not even described in his own article as black, but is categorized as such. <a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGalf_4119.html" title="User:Galf">Galf</a> 12:30, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I have no opinion on the actual list, but should point out that just because <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Steele_4e77.html" title="Claude Steele">Claude Steele</a>'s article doesn't say he is black doesn't mean that he isn't. Other famous African Americans aren't direclty identified as such in their articles (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr._19fa.html" title="Martin Luther King, Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_Jackson_14cf.html" title="Jesse Jackson">Jesse Jackson</a>). And at least for the 19th century scientists, their race <i>did</i> contribute to their notability, considering nearly all college and universities in the US were segregated at that time, as were most professional organizations. I would say that becoming a scientist when denied most opportunities to do so is pretty notable. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 19:30, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> because as an European scientist I fail to see the purpose in the American obsession to divide everything into 'black' and 'white'. If it is renamed with 'African American' in the name obviously even scientists from African countries couldn't be listed (and they I would have thought make up the majority of 'black scientists'). But then at least it would be clear that this list is for Americans to divide themselves. <a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptimale_e2f2.html" title="User:Optimale"><font color="blue">Optimale</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../o/p/t/User_talk%7EOptimale_ccdf.html" title="User talk:Optimale"><font color="blue">Gu</font></a></sup> 13:42, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well, as a European scientist you might be particularly unsuited to comment rashly in this discussion because it neither involves your culture nor your expertise in science. And yet you have no compunctions about saying that it's "clear that this list is for Americans to divide themselves." You might want to be a bit more hesitant about assigning motives to people in other cultures not your own. You might also want to refamiliarize yourself with the Wikipedia principle of "assume good faith." As someone from a continent where ethnic tensions in almost every nation from the Atlantic to the Urals are higher than in America, you might want to treat your self-description more as a humble caveat than a credential. <b>Let me educate you:</b> For those of us in a culture where there are many ethnic groups at different levels of social and ethnic power, and where there is a history of those levels constantly changing over time, these lists perform both a practical and emotional purpose: practical in that they can be used by both middle-school students researching reports and graduate students or researchers studying ethnicity; emotional in that particular career fields have widely varying proportions of ethnic groups and it is often useful to people considering entering those fields to find out about the prominent people from that person's ethnic group who have gone before them. Ethnic organizations often refer to members of their groups who have succeeded in various fields, and one purpose of this is to discourage bigotry from outsiders who have said, in the past, that members of such-and-such a group can't do a particular job. It's not as important, but worth noting that it also happens to be verifiably true that certain ethnic groups, for cultural reasons, often predominate in one field or another for a period of time. That is also useful to study, and these lists might possibly help in that in some way. Particularly among ethnic groups where many people live in impoverished neighborhoods, it has been thought useful for children to know about people from that group who have been successful because despair and discouragement can smother ambition. Most of what I've just written are familiar points to most Americans, whether they agree with them or not. I encourage you to bring up the topic with an American, but when you do, try not to seem presumptuous. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 16:58, 11 March 2007 (UTC) (just edited a few words, no change in meaning <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 17:02, 11 March 2007 (UTC))</dd>

<li>I did read the reasons, I just don't buy it. After all, why are only American ethnic groups targeted? Why not go after all these listings as well <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_people_by_nationality.html" title="Lists of people by nationality">Lists of people by nationality</a>? After all, by the logic being used here, they too should be deleted. All I'm saying is that this bandwagon got started because some provocateur created a "List of Caucasian Americans" for no reason other than to get it deleted so he could use it as justification to start the process of deleting ethnic lists. So regardless of the arguments presented to argue for deletion, I do think, if one looks closely enough, this is being fueled by xenophobes who don't like to see the accomplishments of ethnic minorities listed or highlighted in any way. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStudierMalMarburg_d798.html" title="User:StudierMalMarburg">StudierMalMarburg</a> 22:09, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
