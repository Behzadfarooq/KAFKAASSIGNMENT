<li><b>Comment</b> Should every airplane crash that ever happened have an encyclopea article? Hundreds of planes crash every year. Two people died on this airplane.

<ul>
<li>This event is inherently verifiable based on reliable sources, including news coverage and official reports from government investigatory bodies. If we can have articles on every elementary school, articles on every single Pokemon, articles on every coin, every TV show character... why not plane crashes? I think Airwork Flight 23 is a far more interesting and poignant story than, say, <a href="../../../j/a/d/Jadzia_Dax_fe27.html" title="Jadzia Dax">this page</a> about some irrelevant and insignificant nonexistent persona invented by a Star Trek screenwriter. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 03:20, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Take a look at this site: <a href="http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/query.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/query.asp" rel="nofollow">NTSB database</a>. There are thousands of plane crashes. Should there be an article on ever single one? – <a href="../../../z/n/t/User%7EZntrip_e9b2.html" title="User:Zntrip">Zntrip</a> 03:28, 11 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So, what? We're rapidly approaching 2 million articles. Tens of thousands of articles about schools. Thousands of articles about <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">some stupid sci-fi franchise</a>. Thousands more articles about <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">some other stupid sci-fi franchise</a>. Hundreds of articles on Pokemon. You're telling me that some more articles about a few plane crashes is going to cause Wikipedia to run out of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not paper</a>?

<li>The basic fallacy of the argumentum ad Pokémon, which is what you are propounding, is that Wikipedia's task is not to be an encyclopaedia of what <i>you</i> consider, subjectively, to be more "worthy" and more "important" than Pokémon. It is the world at large, not Wikipedia editors, that determines notability. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">Notability is not subjective</a>. If the world at large writes more source material about Pokémon than it does about aeroplane crashes or about <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Bregans_d39e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bregans">characters in Latin textbooks</a>, because the world at large considers them more notable, then Wikipedia has to simply reflect that. If you think that the world at large has an unbalanced perspective, then it is the world at large that you need to change, by persuading it to write more source material on what you personally consider to be worthy and important. Wikipedia is not an instrument for <i>changing</i> human knowledge, only for reflecting it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:00, 11 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This article is reliably and verifiably sourced - far more verifiably sourced than any article on Pokemon ever will, given that no government agency will ever compile an accident report about the death of a Pokemon in <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle.html" title="Battle">battle</a>, looking to determine causes and find ways to prevent such Pokemon deaths in the future, as is the case with this crash of an air-carrier-operated airliner. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 07:10, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, you are right. I am deliberately comparing an official government report from the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Transportation_Safety_Board_ed3c.html" title="National Transportation Safety Board">National Transportation Safety Board</a> to a freaking strategy guide for some stupid card game. Bravo, Uncle G, for exposing my trickery. Bravo indeed.

<li><b>Comment</b> Saying that if there are a lot of Pokemon and Star Trek articles tons of plane crash articles wouldn’t be a bad thing sound like fuzzy logic. An article about every plane crash isn’t possible or practical. Should there be an article about every car crash or ship that sunk? I guess it better than Pokemon, so why not.

And to respond to <a href="../../../z/n/t/User%7EZntrip_e9b2.html" title="User:Zntrip">Zntrip</a>, yes, it is possible to have an article about every plane crash involving an <i>air carrier</i> (passenger or cargo) with fatalities, and an official investigation, report, and news stories. (I wouldn't necessarily extend notability to every general aviation crash, on the other hand, without some particular reason for an article.) --<a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 05:27, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> for failing notability. A Google for "airwork"+"flight 23" gets ONE hit, unrelated. Doing a search for "airwork flight 23" gets ZERO hits. Yes, two official reports were generated per article references, but even they don't reference it as "flight 23". I might guess there were local NZ newspaper articles written, but the fact nothing else appears to be circulated is symptomatic of lack of notability. I fail to see any substantive changes to flight ops from this one accident, the <a href="http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20050502-0" class="external text" title="http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20050502-0" rel="nofollow">NZ report</a> describes changing checklists, and making sure fuel balancing is done correctly. The fact it is possible to have an article about every plane crash doesn't mean there has to be one. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 10:47, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> <i>Since there is a common theme to this set of airplane crash AfD, there will be an equally common theme to my replies</i> I think it's bad precedence to start putting a "death threashold" for the notability of a plane crash. I would say a crash with <i>any fatality</i> is notable. Ideally entries are written because they will be of encyclopedic interest and value to others to read. A plane crash with fatalities (even a small number) affects alot of a people--the community where the crash took place, people actually involved in the crash as well as friends/families, anyone who is interested in the aviation crash history of a particular airline, and those people who like reading about crashes anyways. Someone was originally interested in the topic enough to write the article in the first place. I can easily see many others who will have continual interest in reading it. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 10:49, 11 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Those are all fallacious arguments. Saying that something affects a lot of people and therefore merits inclusion is a fallacious argument because there are quite a lot of traffic accidents every single day that affect a lot of people, that cannot even be verified after the fact. Saying that something includes a fatality and therefore merits inclusion is a fallacious argument because there are many fatalities every day, the reporting of which would turn Wikipedia into the very memorial that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">by policy it is not</a>. Saying that because someone was interested enough to write the article and it merits inclusion is a fallacious argument, because people write all sorts of original research about things that they are interested in (mainly themselves, of course, but not universally) every day.
<p>An argument that <i>isn't</i> fallacious is an argument that addresses the sources, as <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> does. The provenance and depth of the available sources is what should determine whether something merits inclusion. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:00, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Do car crashes get the kind of media coverage that airline crashes do? I would say the relative <i>rarity</i> of airline crashes in approximation to car crashes plays a major role in that. Plus the public has a perpetual fascination with airlines which makes the notability of commercial airline crashes with fatalities all the more enduring. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 07:08, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Some car crashes get lots of media coverage. Some air traffic accidents get no media coverage. Trying to cover all such accidents with a single blanket provision is another fallacious argument. Once again: Please address the sources, as <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> does. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:52, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Uncle G. How many car crashes get national media coverage? or even regional coverage outside of it's individual market? How many car crashes trigger <i>mandatory government investigations</i>? Now contrast that with commercial airline crashes which <i>always</i> get's coverage if there is a fatality. (<i>If it bleeds, it leads</i>) and more often then not the coverage is regional if not national and they <i>always</i> trigger a mandatory government investigation even if it's pilot error. It's a fallacious comparison. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 07:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not to speak for Uncle G, but the argument that newspaper standards should also be our standards is also fallacious. This is an encyclopedia, with stated guidelines and policies for inclusion of articles. Can you address this issue in terms of WP policies? <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 11:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>It's a fallacious comparison.</i> — Then why did you make it? (Hint: "traffic"&#160;!= "car".) For the third time: Please address the sources. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:10, 14 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>An easy survey above shows that <i>you</i> were the one who introduced the car crash comparision to try and nullify my contention that fatalities in a commericial airline crash is a <i>major thing</i> and adds markedly to the signifigance of the event-and by extension it's encyclopedic merit. Your retort was that my contention was akin to making Wikipedia a memorial and your introduced your fallacious comparision of a car crash. Ironically, your fallacious comparison only <i>strengthens</i> my contention because in that absurdity of your comparision the overwhelming signifigance of commericial jet airline crashes is shown clear. The media coverage and the <i>mandatory</i> government investigations they trigger set them apart from other events in a signifigant manner.<br /></li>

<p>As for Wikipedia policy, there is <i>no policy or guideline</i> that inclusion violates. The closest anyone has come is to try and stretch <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> as either a memorial or an indiscriminate collection. The memorial is a straw man since no one is advocating a memorial to the particular individuals but rather that the fact that <i>there is fatalities</i> enhances the overall signifigance of the event (i.e. the newscoverage and the mandatory government investigations). With the second, far from being indiscriminate articles like this chronicle specific and signifigant events for all the reasons that have been expounded on before.<a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 05:25, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> as circumstances are "interesting" from an air crash perspective. I disagree that all air crashes resulting in deaths are inherently notable -- there were ~400 fatality crashes in the last year alone!<a href="http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/query.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/query.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <small>Note, reported. Database does not contain all crashes.</small> Scheduled flights with fatalities is more manageable at 9. Thus, my general rule of thumb would be scheduled flights with fatalities. That would still exclude this one, though. In any case I definitely discourage articles about non-fatal incidents (like the one a few weeks back about that guy who was arrested for freaking out). I'm just suggesting a metric for judging stuff that should be a "speedy keep".--<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 11:17, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with Dhartung that not all flights with fatalities are noteworthy, those by scheduled service (cargo included) are presumably so, and nothing has rebutted this presumption. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 20:48, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Personally, I would consider any fatal airplane crash notable. Even if you don't accept this, as others pointed out, this crash led to new safety measures being implemented, so it had a lasting effect on the industry.

<li><b>Keep</b> - WP has plenty of other articles on airliner crashes. Saying this one isn't notable assumes some kind of arbitrary threshold has been set. <i>How many people have to die, Admiral?!</i> --<b><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexwcovington_2ca2.html" title="User:Alexwcovington"><font style="background:#000088;" color="#FFFF88">AlexWCovington</font></a></b> (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexwcovington_ddca.html" title="User talk:Alexwcovington">talk</a>) 01:11, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>while I appreciate the heartfelt italics, I think the issue is not body count, but notability per stated WP standards.

<li><b>Delete</b> someone may prove me wrong, but although a plane disintegrated, there was little news generated, and the consequences would appear to be really quite minor adjustments to flight procedures. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 01:29, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Investigation had an impact on the checklists and rules for the Swearington Metro aircraft, so the event has significance which goes beyond just a normal and sadly all-too-common small plane crash. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 06:26, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand. There's more to this story than the article talks about. The SA-227 has had some chronic autopilot issues that this touches on. And, fuel management is an important issue in aviation, and this incident is an important "lessons learned" example. Although only 2 died (fortunately!) the parameters of the incident, the crew inputs and reactions and the ultimate outcome make it, from an aviation perspective, quite notable. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 03:20, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Dhartung. Scheduled flights that have fatalities are notable. They're taken seriously by the government and investigated in a way that demonstrates their notablity. I also agree with the anonymous poster that even an unintentional "death threashold" is something that should be avoided. --- <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethling_7cd1.html" title="User:Bethling"><font color="#BB45AA">The Bethling</font></a><a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBethling_721d.html" title="User talk:Bethling"><sup>(Talk)</sup></a> 17:10, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This is exactly the sort of thing Wikipedia is good to look up for. Commercial jet liners with passenger deaths are very notabable. --Eileen R 23:17, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
