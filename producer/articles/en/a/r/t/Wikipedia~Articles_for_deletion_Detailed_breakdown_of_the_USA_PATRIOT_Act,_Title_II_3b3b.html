<p>This article is not an appropriate encyclopaedia article. I believe it counts as original research, because clearly it is not reporting someone else's detailed breakdown of the act, but carrying out its own. While a clause by clause explanation of legislation would be appropriate in a legal textbook, an encyclopaedia should summarise information about an act rather than carry out an analysis of it. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 23:13, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - on February 10, 2006, it was a Wikipedia featured article. There have only been a few minor edits since then. Seems that there was a community consensus that this was a worthy article. —<a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> @ 00:12, 1 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For the record, I strongly object to using this article's featured status as an argument for inclusion. That perspective turns wikipedia policy (that any AFD-survivable article can be featured) on its head. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 23:21, 1 May 2006 (UTC) (featured article director)

<ul>
<li>"Encyclopedic" (e.g, able to survive AFD) is not a criteria we check for on the FAC (because, frankly, I don't want FAC to turn into the shitfest that AFD is). We simply assume it is encyclopedic. So I object to using "it's a featured article" as a justification for keeping it on the AFD when the FA status is based on the assumption that it would survive AFD. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 15:14, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep.</b> There are 30 citations to show it's not original research. (Of course, more cites are always welcome.) Moreover, a clause-by-clause breakdown of important legislation <i>is</i> the encyclopedic approach — certainly by the very definition of the word, whose antonym is "summary." <a href="../../../p/r/r/User%7EPRRfan_ba7e.html" title="User:PRRfan">PRRfan</a> 00:35, 1 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>See below about the cites. Now we're not like other encyclopaedias it is true, but can you find a single other general interest encyclopaedia that has ever attempted to provide a detailed breakdown of a piece of legislation? What they do is describe how an act arose, summarise what it does, talk about criticisms, that kind of thing - <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_Act_6934.html" title="Parliament Act">Parliament Act</a> is a good example. Clause by clause breakdowns should not be our business. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 10:35, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Protest in the most strongest possible terms</b> - I spent a great deal of time on this article, having it listed for deletion is a slap in the face. I consider this to be a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. The article, though it needs updating, is a <i>featured article</i>! - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 03:00, 1 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How much work you put into it doesn't actually matter, unfortunately, if it's not an encyclopaedic article. I personally would like to see this article deleted, so how can that possibly be POINT? <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 10:35, 1 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Bugger. Just realised the page I was contributing to. This is <i>not</i> original research. I am writing about what the Act says in plain English. Maybe I should be assuming good faith here, but it's a little tough as you are trying to get an article I spent a lot of time and effort on deleted. I am assuming <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> because you voted down my other <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> article based on the title, not really on the content. I challenge you to find any part of the atricle that is my own opinion. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 11:51, 1 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Right, so <b>you</b> are reading the act and interpreting it into plain english - you are not reporting someone else's published interpretation of the act into plain english. Therefore, it is original research. You completely misunderstood my objection to your FAC, which was entirely about content. You seem to be saying that because you have worked on an article, someone who thinks it should be deleted is automatically acting in bad faith - very arrogant indeed. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 15:41, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Every single summary <i>anywhere</i> on Wikipedia condenses information and explains it in plain English, if it uses technical language. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 06:05, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> It seems as though you did this because you need a case against <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu's</a> push for featured article status of <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_PATRIOT_Act%2C_Title_III%2C_Subtitle_A_9bb5.html" title="USA PATRIOT Act, Title III, Subtitle A">USA PATRIOT Act, Title III, Subtitle A</a>, but this article was ruining it. I say that that is bad WikiEthic. Please consider removing your request that this be deleted, and thus save yourself more criticism.

<li>I did this because, while I was complaining about the unencyclopaedic nature of one article, another similar one was pointed out to me. While at least the first unencyclopaedic article was at an encyclopaedic title, this one isn't. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 10:35, 1 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So let me get this straight: you listed an article for deletion which took me about a month to write because you didn't like the <i>title</i>? Whatever happened to the page move button?! - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 11:43, 1 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The time it took you is irrelevant. The content is unencyclopaedic - the title precludes anything encyclopaedic being written in its place. Hence, a deletion nomination. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 15:41, 1 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again I ask why you can't move it? If you are that concerned about it, moving it to something like Sections of Title II of the USA PATRIOT Act would also allow commentary to be added to each section. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 06:07, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>, well-sourced with a humongously long list of references, definitely not OR. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimchi.sg_9ead.html" title="User talk:Kimchi.sg">Kimchi</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kimchi.sg&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kimchi.sg&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">sg</a> 09:06, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Why is it so different? I am explaining what the Act says. I'm going to keep writing these articles. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 11:45, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, how in the world is it OR?

<li>Yes, a scene by scene analysis of Hamlet absolutely would be original research - how could it be anything else? <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 15:41, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> OK, here is why I would like it kept: so far in the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_PATRIOT_Act_9b8d.html" title="USA PATRIOT Act">USA PATRIOT Act</a>, we have not got any real information on what the Act actually says. Orin Kerr once justly took us to task for such an atrocious bit of writing. Well, I decided to do something about it: I must admit I was somewhat stung by his commentary. On review, he's right though. The article as it stands is a dog's breakfast. So what I'm doing is to write about each of the titles and any commentary that I find on them. I'm currently writing about Title III, which is taking quite a while. I don't think it's unreasonable to read the Act, then write about what each section says. This article was originally in the article <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_PATRIOT_Act%2C_Title_II_8bfe.html" title="USA PATRIOT Act, Title II">USA PATRIOT Act, Title II</a>, but I was forced to split the article when I discovered that my article had ballooned to about 120-130KB. It was only logical that I summarised it and then put the detailed breakdown in its own article. The information is all good in there, and as several people have pointed out it is fully sourced. I genuinely don't see how splitting an article is a large cause for concern, especially when this article is just basically explaining the Act in plainer English. I also fail to see how it might be anything but an article written from a neutral POV. Eventually I'll be working on the other articles, so expect to see a few more of them around the traps. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 12:15, 1 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I say, the state of other articles is irrelevant. What's happening here is that <b>you</b> are interpreting the act - original research. The references you cite <b>cannot</b> be used to verify <b>your</b> interpretation of what the act means in plain english. Therefore, the article is original research and is also unverifiable. Therefore, it should be deleted. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 15:41, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep pending policy discussion</b>: I can see how this <i>could</i> be considered OR, but if that's the case, there are further reaching implications—most book/movie/drama articles would be deleted or at least have their plot summaries removed, for example. The scope of WP:NOR needs to be debated first, before deleting an FA. In a perfect world, this article would be based on the discussion found in a law textbook or on some other published breakdown of the law, but in its current form, it's still a strong article. TBSDY, for the Patriot Act articles you write in the future, would it be possible for you to find sources like those that Worldtraveller is requesting? --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpangineer_57d1.html" title="User:Spangineer">Spangineer</a><sup><a href="../../../../es/s/p/a/Usuario%7ESpangineer_0822.html" class="extiw" title="es:Usuario:Spangineer">[es]</a></sup>&#160;<small><a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpangineer_c738.html" title="User talk:Spangineer"><font color="brown">(háblame)</font></a></small> 15:34, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with that, but if you mean that you think this article is the latter I would have to disagree - I don't think it can claim to be a summary when it's about as long as the original legislation is. Comparing the original legislation with this detailed breakdown, many of the sections of this are longer. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 17:43, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The stated reason for deletion is, "not an appropriate encyclopaedia article," but that's not really what's going on here. This is a dispute about the <i>content</i> of the article, not the topic. Such disputes should be kept to talk pages unless the article cannot be sourced and rendered NPOV. This is not such a case. IMHO this article is well written, well sourced, and as NPOV as possible, but anyone who disagrees with me can, of course, edit the page or bring their concerns to the talk page. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 16:00, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually this is all about the topic - by virtue of being called 'detailed breakdown of...' it is unencyclopaedic. The article under discussion might be well written and well sourced but it's still original research.

</li>
<li>Friendly question for Worldtraveller: is there a difference between "one person's translation of the legislation" and one person's translation of a legal textbook's description? Either way, the author of the article has to change the text so that it is not a copyvio while attempting to perserve the meaning. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpangineer_57d1.html" title="User:Spangineer">Spangineer</a><sup><a href="../../../../es/s/p/a/Usuario%7ESpangineer_0822.html" class="extiw" title="es:Usuario:Spangineer">[es]</a></sup>&#160;<small><a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpangineer_c738.html" title="User talk:Spangineer"><font color="brown">(háblame)</font></a></small> 17:21, 1 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The difference as I see it is that a translation of a piece of legislation into plain english, which this piece attempts to be, requires analysis of the legislation - that is, original research. From the sources given, I can't verify that what is claimed to be the plain english meaning actually is the plain english meaning unless I also analysethe legislation - the sources cited do not show that that is the case. On the other hand, if someone else had already summarised the essentials of the legislation, it's a simple job to describe that summary and cite your source - it's then very easy to verify from the source that what is claimed to be a summary of the legislation actually is a summary of the legislation. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 17:43, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Alright, let me try to word this correctly. <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamlet.html" title="Hamlet">Hamlet</a> is a play by Shakespear that represents one intertwined writing that can be <i>summarised</i> under one plot summary. The <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_PATRIOT_Act%2C_Title_II_8bfe.html" title="USA PATRIOT Act, Title II">USA PATRIOT Act, Title II</a> is a non-intertwined piece of writing that can only be <i>summarised</i> section by section. Just because the author has combined multiple sections, in order to avoid hundreds of articles, and has thus placed those <i>summaries</i> one after another, does not change the <i>summaries</i> to <i>analyses</i>. Now that you are aware of the similarities between this and other articles sumaries, I reccommend (based on your <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_Bold_7281.html" title="Wikipedia:Be Bold">Be Bold</a> attitude) that you go and delete/change the following sections of the following articles, as they, according to your interprestation of an encyclopedic article, are not.</li>

<li>I disagree with your assessment that it is impossible to summarise the act without breaking it down section by section.

<li><b>Obvious Keep</b>. This whole debate seems very much a non debate and rather a one man vendetta. Surely it is clear that the majority of people think the article should be included, despite the crusade entered upon by the forementioned critic? The article enables anyone who might have an issue to look it up, failure to have the article would mean people dont have the opportunity to look up quickly and efficiently the inns and outs of the act. And for that matter, almost all articles on history on wikipedia are subjective, and often inaccurate. That does not mean they should be deleted, that means they should be corrected. So if you, Worldtraveller, have such an issue with the article, why don't you correct the points you disagree with?. Fredheir 23:40, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The PATRIOT Act is notable, and an article on it should be considered encyclopaedic.

<li><b>Comment</b> - something which people don't seem to be considering is the nature of the references here. I see lots of comments saying 'it's got 30 references, it must be OK', but actually two thirds of the references are the law itself. This is a bit like me writing an article about, say, the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helix_Nebula_5dda.html" title="Helix Nebula">Helix Nebula</a> and saying 'it's 100 arcminutes across (reference: the object itself)' - the only way i can verify that this article's analysis of the act is correct is to do my own analysis, just as if I told you the size of the Helix Nebula that I'd worked out myself from looking at it, and that number didn't appear in any peer reviewed journals, your only way of verifying my statement would be to carry out your own observations. I don't doubt that most people would agree that would not be acceptable, and would count as original research. Now how is this situation different? <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 23:00, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Huh? The act is a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a>. A nebula can't be any source; your personal original research findings on said nebula are a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a> however (and incidentally are not accepted on Wikipedia, as per <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>).

<li>Maybe my analogy is not the best. Let me try a different one - this detailed breakdown is 80% as long as the piece of legislation it's looking at. If someone put up an article called 'Detailed breakdown of Hamlet' which was 80% as long as the play, and which referenced the play throughout, wouldn't you think that could be considered original research?

<li><b>Keep</b> - Encyclopedic topic ... and an Act is a legitimate primary source for its own overt contents (though not for contentious matters of interpretation). Similarly, a movie is a legitimate primary source for what it contains (though not for contestable interpretations). I realise that there is no bright line between overt contents and interpretation, but the concept of original research has to be applied with common sense, rather than in a spirit of radical epistemological scepticism, and not stretched too far beyond the job it is designed for (eliminating crackpot theories, etc).
