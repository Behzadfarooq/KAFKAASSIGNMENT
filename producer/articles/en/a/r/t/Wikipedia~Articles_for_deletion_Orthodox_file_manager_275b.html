<ul>
<li>Thanks for your assistance, Fut.Perf. My reasons for asking for deletion are the following:
<ul>
<li>Googling for "orthodox file manager" (<b>with</b> quotes) yelds a measly 305 results.</li>
<li>The term is never mentioned in the <i>Jargon file</i>, the most notable and comprehensive hacker slang dictionary.</li>
<li>The term "orthodox" is not even mentioned in the web site of <i>GNU Midnight Commander</i>, probably the most notable example of Norton Commander clone in use nowadays.</li>
<li>So, my opinion is that this entry looks like an attempt by somebody to use Wikipedia either to add authority to his own neologism, or to add "orthodoxy" to their file managers of choice. --88.149.168.128 11:11, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certainly not a well-recognised term - seems to be coined <a href="http://www.softpanorama.org/OFM/index.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.softpanorama.org/OFM/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">by this website</a>. I would guess most people would call these "norton commander clones" - that term gets far more google hits. Either <b>move</b> or <b>delete</b>. Googling for "Orthodox file manager" -wikipedia -Bezroukov gets only 400 hits. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 10:54, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Quite a lot of other articles (such as <a href="../../../z/i/p/ZIP_%28file_format%29_8b8e.html" title="ZIP (file format)">ZIP (file format)</a>, <a href="../../../g/n/o/GNOME_Commander_3ddd.html" title="GNOME Commander">GNOME_Commander</a> and <a href="../../../7/-/z/7-Zip_7ff2.html" title="7-Zip">7-Zip</a>) link to this article, which might indicate some notability, so I'm not really sure this is a made-up term. Any thoughts? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayden54_117a.html" title="User:Jayden54">Jayden54</a> 12:17, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ah, but two questions: who added those links? And people often accidentally propogate neologisms within Wikipedia&#160;: did they have sources other than <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_file_manager.html" title="Orthodox file manager">Orthodox file manager</a> itself. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 13:08, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Weak keep or merge with <a href="../../../f/i/l/File_manager.html" title="File manager">file manager</a></b>. From a (superficial) search through Google articles, it seems that the neologism was coined and propagated by <a href="http://www.softpanorama.org/OFM/index.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.softpanorama.org/OFM/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">SoftPanorama/Bezroukov</a>, but it caught up to a <i>certain</i> extent. I'm undecided whether the term should be used in Wikipedia; IMO it functions a bit better than "Commander clone" or "Commander-like file manager", but then <a href="../../../f/i/l/File_manager.html" title="File manager">file manager</a> is fairly empty and could better serve as a summary article than this "neo-logistic" one. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 14:27, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b> <s>or <b>move.</b></s> It is both obvious that the class of file managers described in the article exists &amp; it is a notable collection of file managers (and the term is preferable to "Norton Commander-style file manager" or similar alternatives). There have been no strong arguments for deletion &amp; the strongest objections come from an anonymous user. The term has been used by the developers of Krusader and other popular file managers, as well as in news articles. There is a dmoz sub-category "orthodox" under "file managers." While a google search for 'orthodox "file manager"' does produce false positives, a quick survey of some of the first hits (from 13,200 total) suggest that some people call these "orthodox twin-pane file managers" or "orthodox two-panel file managers" or other permutations of 2/two/twin/dual pane/panel. Another semi-popular alternative is "orthodox or NC-style file manager." --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 15:20, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why would "orthodox file manager" (305 Google hits) be preferrable to "Commander style file manager" (15000 Google hits)&#160;? What does "orthodox" mean? That's complete nonsense. So I'll say that the only "orthodox" file manager is the Macintosh Finder. Go ahead and contradict me. --88.149.168.128 16:00, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is a discussion for DELETING the article &amp; was prompted by your comments. Now you are arguing to move (rename) the article. As such, I think this should be speedily closed as keep &amp; talk of a page move should go onto the discussion page. --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 17:37, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not arguing it should be moved. I'm arguing it should be deleted.--88.149.168.128 18:45, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So why'd you ask about "Commander style file manager?" I'll treat that question as if it was sincere. As AoR notes, it is a clumsier term. It also promotes a particular piece of software over others. As for your other challenge, you have pointed out multiple pages that use "orthodox" to refer to a class of file managers resembling NC/mc/emelfm/krusader/etc. Playing the same google game shows only four hits for "'macintosh finder' 'orthodox file manager'" and none of the hits claims the finder is an OFM. --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 22:11, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I never asked for the entry to be <b>moved</b> to "Commander style file manager". I'm asking <b>you</b> why <b>you</b> are saying that a term which yelds 305 Google hits should be preferred to a term which yelds 15000 Google hits. Moreover, seeing as the number of Google hits evidently doesn't matter in <b>your</b> view, the fact that a Google search for "macintosh finder" "orthodox file manager" yelds only 4 hits shouldn't constitute a valid objection to my (clearly fictional) point that the Macintosh Finder is the only orthodox file manager in the world.--88.149.168.128 23:34, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How about the coherent content of pages? It was easy to see that none of those four pages referred to Finder as an OFM. It is straight forward to see that most of the thousands of pages which mention orthodox file managers are describing the same thing. --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 00:00, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Firstly, "orthodox file manager" doesn't return "thousands" of pages. It returns a LOW number of pages, which means that the phrase is not wide-spread and it's used mainly by its proponent(s). As for the fact that no one is referring to the Finder as an "orthodox file manager", that's probably due to the fact that I didn't put up a web page calling the Finder "orthodox", nor did I make up a Wikipedia entry for "orthodox file manager" where I say that the Mac Finder is the only orthodox file manager.--88.149.166.153 09:14, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>The second search is not relevant because it includes all the pages where the word "orthodox" is unrelated to "file manager". 1970 hits for "orthodox file manager" is of course ridicolous, and it just goes to prove my point. It also makes sense to suppose that a considerable part of those pages have had Wikipedia itself as a source.--88.149.166.153 20:51, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You claimed that a search didn't "yeld" (sic) thousands of pages. I showed this wasn't the case (even the most conservative search gives close to 2000 hits). How is this "ridicouluous" (sic)? I did point out that there were false positives in the second search. However, as I also stated, it catches many other pages that refer to file managers as being orthodox (because some people use orthodox as one in a series of adjectives). --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 21:42, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>1970 pages is not "thousands of pages". The second search is useless unless you also cite the exact number of false positives.--88.149.166.153 22:00, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Number of Google results does not necessarily show anything and neologisms are not necessarily bad. Moreover, it <i>is</i> used and this article is useful - it helped me understand the term when I came accross it. Much ado about nothing. I 'd like to add that a good cyclopedia tells you about things that have 300 google hits, including neologisms. Why wikipedia it when we can google it&#160;? The Ubik 03:45, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Are you saying that if I coin the phrase "kazoo-playing file manager" and somehow get it to spread to less than 2000 web pages, I am welcome to write a Wikipedia entry about it? Interesting...--88.149.166.153 10:37, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
