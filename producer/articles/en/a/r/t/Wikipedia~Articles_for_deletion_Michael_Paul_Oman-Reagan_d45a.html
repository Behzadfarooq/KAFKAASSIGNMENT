<p><b>Delete</b> - Not notable artist vanity. Less than 50 Google hits, for some perspective I googled other minimalist artists like <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sol_LeWitt_63ac.html" title="Sol LeWitt">Sol LeWitt</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Judd_dcf8.html" title="Donald Judd">Donald Judd</a> and they were each in the 40,000-60,000 range. I also nominate <a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_Gallery_b41d.html" title="Field Gallery">Field Gallery</a>, his gallery, google search of "field gallery" Michael Paul Oman-Reagan returns 8 results. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMidnighters_8ade.html" title="User:TheMidnighters">TheMidnighters</a> 8 July 2005 14:30 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>This is an interesting point you make in your vfd request. Let's look at it from another perspective. If I google <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Doss_c261.html" title="Bill Doss">Bill Doss</a> I get 985 results. However if I google other Musicians like <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jackson_1873.html" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madonna_%28entertainer%29.html" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna</a> they are in the 6,960,000- 21,200,000 range. Clearly this means...? Nothing? Something? you tell me. Apples and oranges, does that mean apples don't matter? 66.108.21.54 21:52, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>- articles like Pandeism are kept with a lot less google hits and my understanding the google hits is a guideline instead of official policy.

<li><b>Keep</b> If you google just Oman-Reagan you get over 99 hits for this artist. Additionally you will find him mentioned in Modern Painters magazine and ARTnews magazine. More important is the Field gallery listing. It really is an important institution. I say, keep him and add more information about his role as the founder of the gallery.

<li>That is correct, the above Keep was written by me, the author of the article. I am working on a history of a particular art movement over the last decade in Portland, Oregon and the artists who were involved. This article is an artist who was part of this movement. This movement and the artists have been repoted about on CNN, written about in Art Forum, ArtNews, Art in America, The Oregonian, The Organ, The Portland Tribune and more. It has been discussed by Jerry Salz art critic for the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Village_Voice_bbe7.html" title="Village Voice">Village Voice</a> (he called it intimidating), as well as Larry Rinder, former curator of the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitney_Museum_of_American_Art_4e48.html" title="Whitney Museum of American Art">Whitney Museum of American Art</a>. The following keep was NOT written by me, but rather by a user who shares the same wireless internet connection as I do, as does an entire building and possibly more. His comment is pointless, nevertheless, it is a keep vote as he is a distinct person.66.108.21.54 20:20, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This sort of article is the kind of rare bit of information on a relatively obscure contemporary artist that is SO helpful and one of the reasons I always check wiki when I can't find something elsewhere. If Wiki just had what you can find everywhere it wouldn't be useful. Having said that, the article is in shambles, it needs a re-write desperately. 151.202.8.52 04:43, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Interesting thing - I realized while editing this that I throw the word vanity around a lot but haven't read the definition for a while. For example - wiki definition of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_page.html" title="Vanity page">vanity page</a> says: "vanity by itself is not a basis for deletion, but lack of importance is". This is a tough one - what establishes importance? For example, I just noticed Richard Tuttle doesn't even have a page, he's having a retrospective at the SFMOMA right now and is probably one of the most influential artists at the moment. Just my few cents. 151.202.8.52 05:41, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article doesn't appear to meet any of the critereon for deletion: It is not "original research" (sources check out), it is not an "inappropriate user page" (not a user page), it is not a "vanity page" (sources check out, wide press coverage - though provincial), it is not "advertising" (nothing for sale or promotion), it is not a "Hoax" (sources check out), it is not "idiosyncratic"(seems to not be structural or behavioral characteristic peculiar to an individual or group.) Although, article does contain source text, perhaps that quoted text should be removed?68.174.126.204 03:18, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
