<dd><b>Comment</b> - No, I have nothing against him and truly don't know who he is. I don't remember how I stumbled on the page, probably doing my random wikignoming - finding a page with no category, etc, and looking it over. As noted above, the original page I saw was absolute junk with obvious non-encyclopedic entries (strike 1). You'll note the page still has no category today except via the AfD (strike 2). If you click "What links here" the only references were an incorrect one I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blowing_a_raspberry&amp;curid=153771&amp;diff=67222766&amp;oldid=65384721" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blowing_a_raspberry&amp;curid=153771&amp;diff=67222766&amp;oldid=65384721" rel="nofollow">just fixed</a> and the NIN one that had been added <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nine_Inch_Nails&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66574898" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nine_Inch_Nails&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66574898" rel="nofollow">the day before</a> (maybe that was how I hit the article). The IP that added the link to the main <a href="../../../n/i/n/NIN_6f79.html" title="NIN">NIN</a> page was an obvious vandal as noted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nine_Inch_Nails&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66574898" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nine_Inch_Nails&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66574898" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nine_Inch_Nails&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66575367" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nine_Inch_Nails&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66575367" rel="nofollow">here</a> (strike 3). Also, as noted above, no incoming Google links to his column (strike 4). And lastly, it is <b>very</b> strange that a single person's name would be referred to as something else in the other languages ("The NIN Hotline") (strike 5). So that's why I brought it to AfD. And when a AfD gets innundated with random IP votes with no signatures, I do not envy the admin who has to try to track it all down. Especially because I don't think from what I've read that Meathead == The NIN Hotline. So votes that say "NIN Hotline" should stay have nothing to do with this individual. — <span style="text-decoration: none;"><a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevragnarok_789a.html" title="User:Revragnarok"><font color="#696969">RevRagnarok</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/v/User_talk%7ERevragnarok_52e4.html" title="User talk:Revragnarok">Talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Revragnarok_e131.html" title="Special:Contributions/Revragnarok">Contrib</a></sup></span> 12:05, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Since when is vandalisation criteria for deletion? Or lack of category? Or lack of internal links? Or an honest mistake in the language links? No, meathead is not the NIN Hotline: he is affiliated with that site, and writes a featured column which is hosted there.

<dd>Linking to your user page is an act of agression? Wow, there's a lot of rules here on wikipedia I wasn't aware of. I'm not going to defend swindley's comment because I didn't write it. By the way, you have yet to convince me that the article is non-notable. In fact, the edits of the last few days have pretty powerfully demonstrated that there is knowledge out there on Meathead that most people who had heard of him were unaware of — more needed to be added, not removed, to make the page encyclopedic. The article as it stands is NPOV and verifiable. Disambiguate the name if you must, but do not delete the page. The <i>Perspective</i> is known independently of the NIN Hotline, and creating a new article on it that would, at this juncture, solely host information on Meathead smacks of bureaucracy. Clearly, someone was motivated to create and maintain a Meathead page, but not a NIN Hotline page. There must be a good reason for that. <a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBotleySmith_160d.html" title="User:BotleySmith">BotleySmith</a> 20:57, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>.To say that Meathead is only known by "a very small online community" is clearly speculation that can just as clearly be proven false. Wikipedia would not allow, nor appreciate if everyone who knows of and enjoys Meathead came to this site and started posting 'Keeps' all over the place (as evidenced by the alert at the top of the page). Just because some people are ignorant of his existance does not mean that others are, and indeed, Meathead is linked with Nine Inch Nails in a significant enough manner so as to warrant a Wiki article (See my aforementioned reference to "Closer to Mario").

If, of course, he makes more flash films. Which he should. Seriously though: Meathead is a healthy counterbalance for everyone that tends to take Nine Inch Nails, Reznor, music as a whole too seriously.

<li><b>KEEP</b> It's important to note that in the context of Nine Inch Nails and Trent Reznor, Meathead is part of the band's total experience. He has been part of the history of this band since 1999 and is certainly not somone "riding on Trent Reznor's coattails". Meathead's talent and humor have kept NIN fans entertained for years. As a satirist and humorist he is funnier than most of what passes for comedy today. Last year, a rumored end to the Meathead Perspective sent fans into fits of grief and hair ripping at the thought of not having his satirical point-of-view around. If someone not overly familiar with the band, or it's culture were to hear "Meathead" it would be nice to think that they could check it out on the Wiki.

<li><b>Comment</b> I strongly disagree. Meathead will be part of NIN's story forever. NIN is very much involved in the internet. The months leading up to the release of 'The Fragile' is a prime example of this. Do a little research and you'll find that certain marketing tactics were directly focued on the NIN internet fanbase, including Meathead. Also, Meathead kept us laughing during the (long drawn out) years until '[WITH_TEETH]' was released. Meathead was around for all of it and it is relevant. I've only recently heard of the 'mud shark incident'. Does that mean it's not relevant? Absolutely not, I'm just not a fan of Led Zeppelin.

Despite the fact I may be a Nine Inch Nails collector and thus probably am more intune with NIN related news (The NIN Hotline being the most consistent, reliable, and frequent source), meathead has been a thoroughly entertaining section at that site. The article itself does need some revision to take away any arguments that it's entirely vanity related, but personally I think there is a fair amount of information there and could be some more that could further legitimize an article on Wikipedia. I think that just because you aren't familiar with meathead in the context of Nine Inch Nails doesn't mean there isn't a sleu of fans and devoted readers of The NIN Hotline who are always anxiously awaiting to see on their RSS feed an absurd headline that must be something from meathead. I would suggest revising meathead's article and if you or any other Wiki editors are adamant about the <i>All in the Family</i> reference, have a search for "meathead" go there first with an option to view a meathead (disambiguation) link. On a side note, I'm actually suprised there isn't an article on The NIN Hotline. Just my thoughts, though. - Nlibera 13:12, 3 August 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Nlibera (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nlibera_e657.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nlibera">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> "Mikewhy" is known to many Tori Amos fans and Tori herself. You could even say that he is a "celebrity" in some Tori circles. He is a fan who runs the popular <i>A Dent in the Tori Amos Net Universe</i> website. But he does not have his own Wikipedia page. Instead he is included in the page about his website. If you give Meathead his own page, you would have to allow separate pages for other fans that write about bands, as well as other NIN fans from the Hotline. Many of the NIN reporters like Leviathant are "celebrities" in some NIN circles. I don't believe Meathead should have his own page. There should be a page for the NINhotline and Meathead should be included on that.--72.81.128.247 14:24, 3 August 2006 (UTC) Dolores <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: 72.81.128.247 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.81.128.247_d755.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.81.128.247">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<dd><b>Re: Comment back</b>. Do you really need to resort to name calling? I think my <i>comment</i> makes sense. Regardless if I as an individual do not know about the meathead reference in <i>All in the Family</i>, I agree it should be the first thing to come up in a Wikipedia search. If the current Meathead article is cleaned of the vanity pieces (mostly the "Trivia" section), and if there are any parts that sound non-neutral to have it revised as needed, I think that would be worthy of keeping. That way it's accessible to any Nine Inch Nails fan curious about The NIN Hotline's most well-known author/journalist. Even if you don't know about him, don't like him, or don't care to know more, I think it's viable information that should be available to the inquiring public, no matter how small that inquiry may be.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. "I think it's viable information that should be available to the inquiring public" But couldn't said information be added to a (edit: Wikipedia) NIN hotline page? That makes more sense than having a separate page for every NIN Hotline reporter that is popular in the NIN online fan circles. Once you take out the vanity information, there is very little "viable" information left about Meathead. What information exactly entails Meathead having his own separate page?

<dd><b>Re: Comment</b>. I agree there are parts that qualify as obvious vanity. They should be removed. Perhaps there isn't a lot left, but there are plenty of articles on Wikipedia that are stubs as well, and in many cases I'm assume there isn't much else to add. As well, the many staff members of The NIN Hotline probably do have the ability to create detailed biographical sections and even one for Meathead (or maybe just Leviathan, owner and head maintainer of The NIN Hotline as far as I know), but then I have no control and cannot contribute to it. I think they are trying to keep it as professional as they can with the staff members "wank page" being small as that's not what the site itself is about as it's for new on Nine Inch Nails. So my understanding is Wikipedia is an open-ended encyclopedia for anyone to add information on anything, in this case Meathead. Instead of trying to find information on Meathead on his website or The NIN Hotline, I could come to Wikipedia to find all the information many have collaboratively added to get as much info on him at once, versus the possibility of googling it or searching through the vast forums of echoingthesound.org (and personally, I'm not a fan of forums). If this article is deleted, then that's what I'd have to do. If it isn't, maybe there isn't a lot now, but who knows in the future. At least I am not restrained by The NIN Hotline's decisions on what and what not to author on their website about Meathead. I hope that was clear, let me know if there is more I can clarify. - Nlibera 01:31, 4 August 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Nlibera (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nlibera_e657.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nlibera">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> Since Nlibera has not commented (yet); this is the way I see it: <b>Informative</b>:1) Meathead is the person who writes the Perspective. 2) Description of the perspective. (This can be a short paragraph on a NIN hotline page) <b>Possibly informative</b>: The Nine Inch Goombas remix. Where and how much has it been played? Did some random QOTD crewmember just play the song once during a break or was it specifically chosen by someone higher up? (If the remix is well known, a sentence or two can be added) <b>Possibly Vanity</b>: Proving that NIN likes him. A brief note can be added that Trent is a fan, but do we really need to know that he accepted an award in place of Trent or some NIN crewmembers threw him a party? The whole thing strikes me as vanity; getting people to like Meathead just because Trent likes him. <b>Vanity</b>: 1) "Pimping” his “artwork”. Selling a few prints online does not warrant your own Wikipedia page. If it did, hundreds of thousands of “artists” would have their own pages. Until I see published articles about his work, his art in galleries, etc…this is pure vanity. 2) Other random "facts" on his page. Not important. (Should be deleted). <i>In short, the "viable information" on Meatheard warrants a paragraph or two on a NIN Hotline (edit: Wikipedia) page, not his own.</i> 72.81.128.247 21:00, 3 August 2006 (UTC)Dolores <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: 72.81.128.247 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.81.128.247_d755.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.81.128.247">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Wishful Thinking</b>. Maybe I'm watching this discussion to much, but I'd really like to see a NINWiki. It seems to be a very easy way to get information, and there are plenty of articles out there The NIN Hotline has been tirelessly collecting over the years. Maybe something Levathian or others to consider creating. That way you could search via magazines, dates, or topics discussed per interview, have more indepth information on nin.com's versions, updates, and other celebutantes (ie, Meathead) associated to Nine Inch Nails in one way or another. Though this is just idle wishful thinking and I myself don't have the time or talents to do such a thing. Then Wikipedia could argue further to remove this Meathead entry. Although I always thought Wikipedia's goal was to strive for collecting as much information on everything eventually. As endless as that may seem.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Heltemes 16:31, 5 August 2006 (UTC) It would be really sad to delete this entry just because a few people don't understand the gentelman's work in question. Is he a huge internet celebrity, not really. But, he is an internet celebrity none the less. It would be nice to have usefull articles on artists w/in the internet as well as TV,movie, and radio celebs. I can not think of one productive reason to delete this article. Meathead has been around for a long while, and has been humering alot of people throughout his career (and not all nin fans are stoned and have a shi*%y sense of humor (carl the dinosaur)). Also, by reading the comments left by people speaking on the keep / delete topic; it seems that the people wishing for meathead to be deleted are the ones who are throwing out inappropriate language and squabbling like little kids. It makes me wonder if they want his article deleted because they truely think it is useless info, or because they are jealous that someone has actually made a career out of being a Meathead. When in fact the squabblers have to try and get articles deleted on their spare time to be a Meathead.</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> This whole thing is so silly. Look, I know people have said it before, but I think it bears repeating [again.] Meathead's page is linked from the official NIN site. The Hotline gets a massive amount of readers, and alot of that is due to the Perspective [which came directly from Leviathant who created the Hotline.] It's a hugely popular column. I just don't see how a deletion is warranted. The page has been fixed from its admittedly laughable beginnings [look, I had never done a Wiki entry before- so sue me] and has really developed into a well written and informative page.
