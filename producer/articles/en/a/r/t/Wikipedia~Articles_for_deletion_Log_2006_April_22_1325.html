<dd>What on earth are you talking about? This sex act is not even physically possible, and I made that clear in my nomination. Double vaginal is possible. Double anal is possible. Double vaginal and double anal at the same time is impossible. It's nothing but a joke. The movies are named DVDA because they feature double vaginal and double anal, but <i>not at the same time.</i> Your comments in this discussion indicate that you clearly don't understand that the structure of the human body prevents anyone from actually doing this. Countless pornographies (sic)? I found only two. In pop culture? Only in Parker/Stone projects. This is supposed to be a general interest encyclopedia, not a Trey Parker and Matt Stone fansite. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G. Crawford">Brian G.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm glad that my note caused you to do some actual research on the notability, but I would assert that all you've managed to confirm here is that according to limited online sources, the individual has contributed to at least 9 papers. (actually, according to <a href="http://expertise.cos.com/cgi-bin/exp.cgi?id=223215" class="external text" title="http://expertise.cos.com/cgi-bin/exp.cgi?id=223215" rel="nofollow">this</a> link in the article, 14 papers.) I do note the fact that this is the only article edited by the originator of this article. We're talking about a clinical fellow at Harvard who's published, I'd rather hear someone with expertise in the field say if he's made lasting contributions (as some of the above Keep votes seem to say). Why are you so eager to delete? <i><a href="../../../k/w/h/User_talk%7EKwh_7c75.html" title="User talk:Kwh">KWH</a></i> 05:46, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The way that the keep IP comments were going, one can easily draw the conclusion that this was a vanity page as well. If I were "so eager to delete" the page, I would have speedy deleted it as non-notable. As it stands, I'm looking for debate, not for unsupported and unverified claims of "but he's a great doctor!" or "he's a great scholar!" If there's verifiable information that he's notable, fine, but these comments are not verifications of his notability. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 05:57, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - I have been wanting to edit this article for a while since I am a user of Freewebs. I do realize that it reads like an advertisement, but if you go to Freewebs, they actually advertise for themselves on their own website. And of course, stating prices and benefits that Freewebs offers does make it read like an advertisement, but I did name some negative aspects in the article. On top of that, I felt rushed since the article got marked for deletion. Please feel free to make edits.

<p>(Some lists are useful for Wikipedia development purposes. The lists of related topics give an indication of the state of the 'pedia, the articles that have been written, and the articles that have yet to be written. Like categories, lists can be used for keeping track of changes in the listed pages, using the Related Changes feature. Unlike a category, a list also allows detection of deletion of pages from it, and, more generally, a history of its contents is available.) , so why do individual editors think they have to remove an article just because it IS a list?? Also there is a precedent for this sort of thing at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Premier_League_stadiums_b995.html" title="List of Premier League stadiums">List of Premier League stadiums</a>, for example. <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 20:58, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

It's something for this list to aspire to, sure, but by no means can that be considered to set a precedent for a list such as this simply because they are both about sports stadiums.

<li><b>Delete</b> I have been concerned about the verifiability of the subject from the article's creation, and I continue to be concerned. Notably, a Lee Dennison <a href="http://www.imdb.com/find?s=all&amp;q=Lee+Dennison" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/find?s=all&amp;q=Lee+Dennison" rel="nofollow">search</a> at IMDB returns no relevant results, and the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293662/fullcredits" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293662/fullcredits" rel="nofollow">full credits</a> for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Transporter_7909.html" title="The Transporter">The Transporter</a>, on which, according to the article, Dennison worked, don't list him. However, if the (perhaps tendentious) <a href="http://www.ukscreen.com/crew/ldennison" class="external text" title="http://www.ukscreen.com/crew/ldennison" rel="nofollow">bio</a> provided by a company with which he works is to be believed, then he has indeed been involved in the production of sundry notable films. Assuming arguendo that the bio as provided is entirely accurate, I am nevertheless convinced that Dennison is notable neither as an actor nor as a casting director. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 02:33, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

I think I ought to note that my concerns were as much about verifiability as about truth.

<p>Commnets have been emailed to both users and they are not withstanding. One does not need to be verified nor registered at IMDB to be an actor/crew member nor do the majority of films have CD listed in their crew as the CD role is required before production takes place. This is not a self advertisement (no companies details/web site information has been given) and unlike other people including one user here no vanity picture has been posted. Tendentious is the users own opinion and therefore not legally binding nor fact and the user even comments that "if" the details are fact he is still not convinced - again this is just a matter of opinion and not fact. It should be stated that other actors have placed their own bio here and have passed therefore RH and RC comments are also not valid. If I am wrong please let me know the correct page where it says actors/artistes etc cannot create their own page. I would also request they re-read the following before continuing with their comments. Thanks.</p>

Vanity? Hoax? It would suggest a little reasearch is done befoire casting doubts. The etiquette still states do not "bite" and "assume good faith" which the majority of you have not. Some of you who have commented have displayed a touch of vanity on your own pages and some are rather self indulgent to say the least. <small>(<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Leedennison (<a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeedennison_445a.html" title="User talk:Leedennison">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Leedennison_cef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Leedennison">contribs</a>).</small>)</small></p>

<li>Hi Lee. Do you mean information on editors "userpages"? That's a place to be creative as you like, and you are very welcome to display biographical information on your own user page, which appears when you click on your user name at the top of the screen or in your signature, which can be appended to comments on talk pages simply by typing ~~~~ before you save the page. Information stored in the main encyclopedia (often referred to as "articlespace" or "mainspace") such as the article nominated for deletion here must stand up to high levels of scrutiny per the policies and guidelines pointed out above ("WP:xx"). Many, many pages with the problems identified with this article appear on the deletion board every day, and as you can imagine many original authors contest the deletion. However, not displaying a solid grasp of wikipedia standards and practices when defending such an article is not a way to endear yourself to other editors. Again, I encourage you to stick around and get a better feel for the place. Best regards, <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> 16:58, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm working my way through the article and trying to edit it to be more encyclopedic in nature and also show that Jesse has a bigger following in his own right than was initially laid out in the entry - i.e. his fan site that has only been going since March this year has had 1.4million page views in the past month (I've included links to references) - and that Shades of Gray is just a part of his works (all be it a major one), and not just his sole achievement. Please bear with me, today is my first attempt at editing a wiki&#160;:) 81.79.54.144 07:10, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I am the creator and author of the Jeskid Fan Club website. Jesse brings more than the sum of his movies and online TV, obviously enough to warrant the creation and participation of a full scale fan community. I personally put hundreds of hours into the coding of the website alone, which in itself speaks to who and what Jesse stands for. There unfortunately are some somewhat disgruntled and jealous would-be writers, actors and film makers who have had little success and therefore feel the need to tear down something which is more than they could have hoped for - not to mention, we have come across some of these individuals who have made it their purpose in life to bring an end to Jesse's growing following - "just because". Since going live with the website in march, it has grown at a steady pace of 100+ members per week, and participation includes over 75% of all registered members on a daily basis - and half of that 75% participates every few hours. The fan site alone is anticipating a 2 million page view month, which includes nearly 450,000 site hits. This is, as I mentioned, only about a months time of being live. The most recent addition to JeskidTV, "SPAM" episode, sparked the same flurry of "water cooler" conversation that some better known network programming would. The idea that Jesse Coweel or his best known film Shades of Gray should be deleted in ridiculous, and I would encourage the individuals who requested such action be restricted and/or ignored for future deletion "requests". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.64.255.203 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.64.255.203_032f.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.64.255.203">contribs</a>) .</small>

Do you have an independant source for those pageviews? I'm not trying to say that you are lying, far from it. What I mean is, I could just write something on my own site and make a claim, you know what I mean?

<li><b>Comment</b> You yourself clearly are showing prejudice, you do not check your facts before posting suggesting that Jeskid has few Google hits. When infact he has over 30 thousand. You appear to take every attempt to sabotage this article dispite the obvious fact that Jeskid has a large respectable fanbase. <a href="../../../p/u/r/Pure_Pwnage_9d82.html" title="Pure Pwnage">Pure Pwnage</a> has a simmilar fanbase to Jeskid, but it's article is untouched. I feel you do not show considderation as to when credit is due, since Shades of Gray is only a small fraction on work that has been produced by Jesse. As far as Jesse Cowell and wikipedia themself go, he uploaded one image, there is no big deal in that. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by GrahamGRA (<a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrahamGRA_8e03.html" title="User talk:GrahamGRA">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GrahamGRA_57c7.html" title="Special:Contributions/GrahamGRA">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> Not all of Jeskid's fame comes from his Shades of Gray work. JeskidTV is watched largely by his fan base as well, and his Fan Club website and chat are extremely popular. Sticking that all under SoG would be wrong, because they're not all related. He should have his own individual entry, where you can reach all of his works. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.81.79.187 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.81.79.187_0d1d.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.81.79.187">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The only suggestion is to edit the article to make it more encyclopedic. A seperate article should be made for Jeskid TV work since his work on Shades of Gray (film) has one. There's about 15 hours of Jeskid TV content on <a href="http://www.jeskidtv.com" class="external free" title="http://www.jeskidtv.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.jeskidtv.com</a>. Q&amp;A articles reviews and director bios found within google searches when searching <b>Jesse Cowell</b> and <b>Jeskid</b>. The Google results tally over 30,000+. The Fansite has many numerous active accounts. Seems notable enough. --Microbefox 22:17, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The difference between <i>Shades of Gray</i> and <i>Jeskid TV</i> is that the former has been reviewed by independent organizations/critics and has won some well-known awards. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but <i>Jeskid TV</i> has not. Most of the third-party reliable (non-forum, non-blog) hits are about Jesse's role in <i>Shades of Gray</i>, right? The fact that Jesse has a fan club is great and all, but such doesn't contribute much to verifiable encyclopedic content because of the inherent bias involved. A Google search for <tt>+Jeskid -forum -wikipedia</tt> yields <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%2BJeskid+-forum+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%2BJeskid+-forum+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=" rel="nofollow">517 results</a>, which seems to indicate that most of Jesse's popularity stems from forum communities, which are not citeable as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. If someone can provide some reliable third-party sources for Jesse's popularity/notability outside of <i>Shades of Gray</i>, I'd happily reconsider. —&#160;<a href="../../../t/k/d/User%7ETKD_6306.html" title="User:TKD">TKD</a>::<a href="../../../t/k/d/User_talk%7ETKD_73cb.html" title="User talk:TKD">Talk</a> 01:21, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> From what I can, or rather can't, gather, the group is not significant on the New York scene aside from their own claims. Since members "leave for college" and the group has had ever a dozen members, I really don't think that this is any sort of serious band. Additionally, I don't think the national touring they've done is what MUSIC had in mind; even I could book a dozen shows around the country, rent a van, and have a national tour. Lastly, the stage name Kleibold Harris is just wrong. <a href="../../../t/k/e/User%7ETKE_5ab7.html" title="User:TKE"><font color="maroon"><b>T</b></font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>e</b></font></a><a href="../../../t/k/e/User_talk%7ETKE_bf64.html" title="User talk:TKE"><font color="gray"><b>k</b></font><font color="maroon"><b>e</b></font></a> 18:15, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Should be reviewed for deletion, the previous deletion in 2005 was in my opinion uinfair. I, the author, am posting this page as AfD to avoid it being speedy deleted because it is a repost of an already deleted article. However i believe the original article was unfairly deleted and this should be given a second chance. It is valid information which is not false and should be given a second review perhaps.Crakorjack 03:31, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - this is real. It was a spinoff of a Something Awful forum, although no illegal files were shared there. The admins deleted the forum for various reasons at the beginning of 2005, leading to the setup of this site. From what I can tell, passwords to it were given out to a select few SA members. However, this is not endorsed whatsoever by the site's admins - members that join the forums to ask for the password are banned. Of course, this is all completely unverifiable (there is a section on this in the SA forums "SAclopedia", but only registered users can view it) and so this article should be deleted. --<a href="../../../d/g/j/User%7EDGJM_57c0.html" title="User:DGJM">Doug</a> <font size="1">(<a href="../../../d/g/j/User_talk%7EDGJM_6b9d.html" title="User talk:DGJM">talk</a>)</font> 16:02, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: this may be a keep but is certainly not a speedy keep. As the article stands it points to only very limited publication history.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: All I can base my reasoning on is what is referenced in the article -- she has put out one book, has been interviewed by a major newspaper once, she maintains a website and she used to serve as an administrator at an American law school. This infi may hint at notability (though I'd like to see more). But no, this information doe not make her such a slam dunk on notability that we should cut off the process of discussing whether she belongs on wikipedia. I just don't see anyting here that makes it clear that she meets speedy keep criteria. It is unclear to me why you are so afraid of letting this discussion run its course if you are so convinced of her notability. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 15:30, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'm not adamantly attached to it or anything, but I do think she is notable enough to merit an article. <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html#People_still_alive" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies#People_still_alive</a> states "Published authors, editors, and photographers who have written books with an audience of 5,000 or more or in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more" merit an article. The article as it now stands cites such a publication ("The Anna Ivey Guide to Law School Admission") and a link to the Vault.com column to which she contributes. Given the murkiness and contentiousness of "notability," I think it is best to err on the side of keeping an article. Moreover, judging from interestingstuffadder's comment on the pages's history, it seems that even the nominator for this AfD has reconsidered<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anna_Ivey&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anna_Ivey&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwriter706_012a.html" title="User:Wikiwriter706">Wikiwriter706</a> 23:13, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: the strong response to this AFD has prompted me to do some research (which I am not required to do -- it is up to the article to provide a basis for its notability) and I am getting to where I think it would reasonable to keep this. Also, a review of <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwriter706_012a.html" title="User:Wikiwriter706">Wikiwriter706</a>'s fine contributions make me think that we can count on this article's ongoing improvement. However, I also still do not think this article reaches the criteria for <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_keep_5dff.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy keep">wikipedia:speedy keep</a> (though I imagine it will be kept when 5 days elapse). <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 23:27, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: You're right that it seems likely to be kept so it doesn't matter too much whether or not it is speedily kept, but I do believe it currently meets the criteria for <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_keep_5dff.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy keep">wikipedia:speedy keep</a> since you, the nominator, seem to be stating you don't actually want the article deleted and there has been no other delete vote, valid or otherwise. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwriter706_012a.html" title="User:Wikiwriter706">Wikiwriter706</a> 23:32, 22 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: although I am coming around, I have not yet formally withdrawn the AFD. The speedy keep guidelines indicate that in order for the article to be kept based upon my will I would need to withdraw the AFD. But I agree that you probably have nothing to worry about. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 23:48, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment.</b> The speedy keep is not binding, it's just one user's opinion. Consensus amongst the keeps and deletes will provide the concensus. As I mentioned in my <b>weak keep</b>, I would be hesistant on the article (in other words, I wouldn't have voted; I don't vote when I'm hesitant) had I not looked up Wikiwriter's contribution history, which I thought I linked to but appearantly I just linked to the userpage. <a href="../../../t/k/e/User%7ETKE_5ab7.html" title="User:TKE"><font color="maroon"><b>T</b></font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>e</b></font></a><a href="../../../t/k/e/User_talk%7ETKE_bf64.html" title="User talk:TKE"><font color="gray"><b>k</b></font><font color="maroon"><b>e</b></font></a> 04:29, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I really don't appreciate being accused of bad faith. As the article has developed I have in fact engaged in a dialogue with the author about it and have acknowledged that it has become a solid article and I would not nominate it for deletion again. When I nominated this article it simply did not make a case for notability -- now it does. I am an experienced editor and I really resent being accused of bad faith in a public forum. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 00:36, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know what else you would call a violation of AfD etiquette like this. An experienced editor really shouldn't be using AfD as a first resort without using a more appropriate tag or making a good-faith effort to discuss issues. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparklemotion_f79f.html" title="User:Sparklemotion">Sparklemotion</a> 17:33, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There's a lot seperating bad faith from poor etiquette. Look around the wiki -- plenty of articles are AFDed soon after being created, especially when created by inexperienced editors (which this page's creator was when he/she created the article). Frankly, when I first saw this it article it seemed like non-notable vanity to me. I have since been convinced otherwise. Maybe I should have waited longer before adding the AFD tag, but "bad faith" is an extremely strong accusation around these parts. Obviously I wasn't aware of the articles "obvious" notability. Bad faith implies that I AFDed this article out of some ulterior or nefarious motive -- there is absolutely no evidence of that. Thus, if you are truly interested in being part of a community that values <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">civility</a> perhaps you should pause before levelling such pointed accusations at other editors. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 17:56, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So can we shake hands? There are 2,000 to 3,000 articles/stubs created every day. About 500 get speedy, 300 get prod, and up to 150 on AfD. It's all in process, Sparklemotion. Interestingstuffadder, perhaps you might not want to argue your own nominations so seriously. Sometimes it's best to throw it out there and get out of the way. <a href="../../../t/k/e/User%7ETKE_5ab7.html" title="User:TKE"><font color="maroon"><b>T</b></font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>e</b></font></a><a href="../../../t/k/e/User_talk%7ETKE_bf64.html" title="User talk:TKE"><font color="gray"><b>k</b></font><font color="maroon"><b>e</b></font></a> 06:34, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> another page from the "Ultimate sub-sub-genre-cruft" collection. The article contains nothing except a short, scattered list of bands - not one of which is described anywhere on their own article as Jazzcore, and very few seem to come close to the one line description of Jazzcore on the page. A notable genre should have at least one notable band in it and SOMETHING to say about style, origins, evolution etc. Nothing to merge. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> 16:37, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b> The list mixes two fairly distinct genres, jazz bands heavily influenced by hardcore punk (eg. Naked City, Painkiller, Last Exit, Massacre), and hardcore punk bands heavily influenced by jazz (eg NOMEANSNO, Victim's Family). The latter have more in common with the Minutemen, Blackflag, Fugazi, Gang of Four, Wire and other jazz influenced, but (arguably) not overtly jazzy punk bands, than they do with the first group of bands. There are many very important bands on this list, certainly above the threshold of notability, but the central thesis of the article (such as it exists) is not well supported. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 20:47, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually its "abortion" that is POV. That is why we use the terms "pro-Life" and "pro-Choice." Also I see you were one of two people to edit the article. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 06:08, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>The result of the debate was <b>speedy keep</b> as a bad nomination: gibberish on a <i>talk page</i> is certainly no reason to delete it. Further, deleting a talk page without deleting the article itself seems quite pointless. There are many talk pages on Wikipedia with bizzarre, irrelevant comments on them. The usual course of action is to either simply ignore them, or to be bold and archive/delete them if they add nothing to the discussion. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 12:35, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><strike><b>Speedy delete</b> for obvious reasons.</strike> Hang on, <b>keep</b> this talk page, unless there is some reason to delete the main article. The discussion doesn't make sense to me, even now I have the context, but I can see that at least some of it does actually relate to a question of interpretation that arises from the article. Just delete any text on the talk page that is totally nonsensical, which is probably about the second half of the page. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 08:41, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't see any threat, except a threat to change the article unless a source can be found for the claim that a character depicted in the CD is a Christ figure. Otherwise, you have given reasons to delete a lot (most?) of the text, but not to delete the page itself. Once again it is a <i>talk page</i> for an article that is not in itself being requested for deletion. If it is full of illiterate, unsigned discussion etc., as it indeed is, there are other and quicker ways to deal with it. It doesn't fit the criteria for deletion of a page.

<li><b>Keep</b> This article may include information about a fictitous company, but it does exist in a way. Novell provides trainees with self study material, that includes information of this company. If it was completely fictitous I wouldn't have spent 3 months being an administrator on this training network, and developing install solutions such as those under "network setup". I am not done with this article, I had left it incomplete because I was relativly tired seeing as it was 2:00am. Note- I had deleted the original prod, for I had changed the line from fictitous company, as that suggested this does not exist at all. I jad changed the line to "a training environment created by Novell, inc." I am sorry if this conflicts with your thoughts, but that is why this thread is here, for debate. I will expand on this article as the day goes on to help other get a complete understanding for it.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I'd imagine it would be hard for an Iranian heavy metal act to get a record deal in Iran. Keep on the basis of it's a real band and Iranian heavy metal is an obscure genre.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure that we can be certain that "the only reason the band doesn't have a label is because of the Islamic government in Iran"; such a claim seems, as most of the article, unverifiable. I am certain that, in the absence of verifiable outside sources, the argument may be essayed that such sources cannot exist because of the nature of the IRI, and that argument is likely altogether correct; nevertheless, notability can't be inferred simply in view of a band's having a MySpace page, and, where there are few (if any) outside sources, irrespective of the reason for that paucity, we likely shouldn't include the article. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 21:41, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"How to build a boat" is valuable knowledge for thousands of us involved it the field. Traditionally, the process is not shared by the most knowledgeable practicioners, who compete with each other in business. Therefore, a whole bunch of us need a great encyclopedic resource like Wikipedia to get the knowledge quickly. The only other way to get boat building knowledge is to buy many books or spend many years in the industry. Please keep the article, and let it be improved and expanded.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Tough call but I feel it is notable enough to deserve its own article. Could be useful in a constructive manner.--Cini 16:12, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I've revised it substantially since the initial flag for deletion and since it was tampered with previously with the "animal haters"/vandalism comment. "Puppy breath" is a common term among people who have or breed puppies. Any vet can tell you that the condition and term exists. However, it is not a dictionary definition because it does not appear in the dictionary. (I used dictionary.com and found no entry, but have not checked the OED.) It further proposes a probable/logical explanation for the scent, which has no known (to my knowledge) scientific explanation and could be a potential research project for a vet/biologist. It's inadvisable to merge the entry into "dog" directly as it is much less relevant to "dog" and far more relevent to "puppy" or "puppies", both of which redirect to "dog" and thereby prohibit more detailed discussion about puppies. I feel that "puppy breath" is best kept as a separate entry with a hyperlink within the text discussing puppies under "dog" entry. I added a "See also: puppy breath" link under the "dog" entry and it has gone unchallenged for 24 hours despite the popularity of the "dog" entry and that entry having been edited 10 times in the last 24 hours. "Puppy breath" may currently be a "weak entry", but in time it will unquestionably be added to by the numerous dog owners/breeders out there.Rtperch 17:17, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thank you, I still think it isn't Nurse Joy in the games. It was only until FireRed/LeafGreen she had the pink hair like Joy, leading to believe that Nurse Joy was based on the videogame character.

<li>Surely this is different to the You're My Best Friend/'39 debate you've pointed out? From what I've just read on it, '39 was a B-Side in that record, and was a cover/album track at that - so it shouldn't have been detailed in the main article. Here we have a double A-side with three videos. Where else could this information be put? If its Wikipedia policy to have a seperate article per song then I suppose this article should be split up, but I think it's fine, as it is an article for a double A-side CD, not a song. 81.131.121.180 16:34, 22 April 2006</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Are you sure about the A-Side thing? I see no mentioning of "L.

<ul>
<li>I'm sure it's a double A-side (check <a href="http://www.franzferdinand.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.franzferdinand.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Franz Ferdinand's website</a>if you don't believe me), and if you look on the article in question someone mentioned that, and I quote, "the single was released in an album jewelcase to enable fans to choose whether their copy displayed the sleeve artwork for "The Fallen" or "L. Wells"." Now I've no reason to doubt that, have you? 81.131.121.180 19:39, 22 April 2006 (UTC) EDIT: and as if this wasn't enough, I just found <a href="http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/B000E8NR1W.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg" class="external text" title="http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/B000E8NR1W.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg" rel="nofollow">this picture</a>!

<p>This is one of a few articles that serve as a student enrichment programs within the Saint Joseph’s University category. The category page is weak since it only features athletics and the SJU article itself. Adding enrichment programs in the SJU article page would be messy. --Zacharyleahan 16:47, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, looks like a cut and paste from their website.

<p>Good point Average Earthman. I agree with the delete but would it be appropriate to make a "List of Student Enrichment Programs (Saint Joseph's University)" that links from the SJU article itself? That page would have external links. I don't want the external links of "Saint Joseph's University" to get too big. Thanks. I would like suggestions. --Zacharyleahan 17:31, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I don't know if I have the right to comment on this, but in the meantime I'll assume that I do. I enjoyed Six Faces, as did a couple of my friends. I have no idea how popular it is, and that doesn't matter to me. Nor do I think it should. It's a book that was written, some people have read it and liked it - that's it. Anyone who is searching for or looking up "Six Faces" is most likely looking for this book. And I doubt readers look on wikipedia to find new authors. I use the site to look up things I already know about. I don't see what the big deal is. The book exists, and (I think) the author does as well. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Lillianbrown (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lillianbrown_8e09.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lillianbrown">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>Hm, I am starting to think that one of you is the same jerk who went to Amazon and posted a negative review without having read Six Faces. I wouldn't be surprised. I am a friend of Ashida Kim's, and I recently took notice of how biased your article on him was. I simply came up with this article to let Mr. Callaway's readers know little more about him, as well as his upcoming works. Semi-popular means that he is not world-famous, nor is he a Stephen King in relation to populariy, but that he is known among "some circles of readers", as I said. His website, which I created, is full of reviews by actual people, people who he nor I know in person. People who obviously enjoy his work. His website counters are "per individual hit", not just "per hit". So there is a good amount of people out there who are fans of his. Anyway, I'm not going to play this game with anyone. I have advertisements in other places, but Wiki was not intended to be one of them. I was just giving out some info to those who would like to know. I'll help you to delete the page myself if it bothers you that much, okay? -- Kana Miyoshi</p>

<p>Non-notable, advertisement, possible vanity.

In defense of this list, I'll point out that thus far, it consists of a summary of information taken from other Wikipedia articles: for example, the inclusion of <a href="../../../y/u/c/Yucatan.html" title="Yucatan">Yucatan</a> on the list references the Yucatan article-- in other words, to the extent that any item on the list is unverifiable, that's because the source article is unverifiable. Furthermore, the purpose of this list is to gather together instances of words sharing a particular characteristic of <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_etymology.html" title="Folk etymology">folk etymology</a>. Finally, I have no problem whatsoever with changing the title of the article.</s></li>
</ul>
<p>Further comment: There seems to be a consensus that this article, in this form, must go. It seems to me that the logical follow-up question is: is the information that this list presents not worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia at all, or should it merely be presented in another form? For example, is there a better way of presenting this information, such as in the form of a list entitled "Lists of folk etymologies"? <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpikebrennan_1a75.html" title="User:Spikebrennan">Spikebrennan</a> 12:26, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If the article was titled <b>List of words and phrases derived from misunderstandings</b> - I <i>might</i> change my vote to neutral. The problem is with the <b>Alleged</b> — it's going to attract cruft. If they are <b>verifiably</b> derived from misunderstandings then it's borderline wiki-worthy IMHO. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegapixie_ea09.html" title="User:Megapixie">Megapixie</a> 14:09, 24 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Problem is, the intent of the list is not to list words derived from misunderstandings, but to list words that are <i>erroneously thought</i> to have been derived from misunderstandings. Assuming that such a list meets Wikipedia standards in and of itself, I agree that a word should be listed only if it can be verified that there exists an erroneous belief that the word was derived from a misunderstanding. For example, the article on <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kangaroo.html" title="Kangaroo">kangaroo</a> states in part that there is a common, but incorrect, belief that the word "kangaroo" derives from an Aboriginal word for "I don't understand". The <a href="../../../v/a/u/Vauxhall.html" title="Vauxhall">Vauxhall</a> addition to the list that someone recently made, however, doesn't seem to meet the standard unless someone can provide a citation to that belief being held by someone. In general, compare <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_proposed_Jack_the_Ripper_suspects_6161.html" title="List of proposed Jack the Ripper suspects">List of proposed Jack the Ripper suspects</a>-- that's a list of information where the common element is not that they were all Jack the Ripper, but that they were all regarded as suspects.<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpikebrennan_1a75.html" title="User:Spikebrennan">Spikebrennan</a> 18:02, 24 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Mmmmmm. In that case it's definately not wiki worthy. To take your example - all of the Jack the Ripper suspects have been proposed in various places before they were included on the list - and he is noteworthy. What the list would contain is a list of guide books (or some reputable source) that 'the name of the area is often said to come from the.... but in actual fact it was taken from the ....'. I'm just not sure it's noteworthy - where as Jack the Rippers possible identity is. The list you propose would be like <b>List of people who have allegedly been mistaken for a US President (but haven't in reality)</b>. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegapixie_ea09.html" title="User:Megapixie">Megapixie</a> 02:21, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think the page should be kept, as PKMN.net is a complete guide to all pokémon games, animé, etc, and individual in the way it is written. Adding to that it stands out from other sites with features like the Name Rater and Sentret. It's not doing any harm on this site, and the odds are stacked towards it staying as a Wikipedia page. EM 21:41, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I really don't see why you lot are questioning its value upon Wikipedia. PKMN.NET is a valued community with a wealth of information and as such, the article deserves a place on Wikipedia.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm unsure as to why a page about a website needs to be deleated. It contains no information against the rules of Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> how about a move to Demographic warfare? There's no such article yet. That's an emotionally charged phrase too, but searching with Google, it's used to describe at least four major ethnic conflicts in the world today, plus one in the 19th century.

<dd>With some trepedation, I've created Demographic warfare. Turns out the term dates back to 1970. The article has empty subparagraphs for every instance of demographic warfare I can find, so we're now at a stub with a neutral point of view. I'll let others fill the article in, hopefully not getting carried away in the process. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 03:54, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do Not Delete! On a recent visit to Austin, Texas I stopped by one of the UT frat houses. They handed me a drink which they called the Rick Nagelberg. It was amazing!

<p>Not to be rude or anything, but you would think Tokakeke would have something better to do than to argue with college students over whether a world changing drink should be allowed to remain on the online encyclopedia wikipedia.

<p>DO NOT DELETE:::::::to argue WP:NFT, a rick nagelberg was not something that was merely thought up in one day, it has infact been around for a long time and if the postings do not prove to you that it ihttp://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Rick_Nagelberg&amp;action=edits wide spread then you should consult any bar in any number of colleges accross the country who will say that it is an up and coming popular drink. To argue WP:V, this is not a posting that is looking to harm Wikipedia or inpact it in any negative manner. This is a posting that is there to help people who are searching for resources on the new drink that is sweeping the nation. This is not WP:NOT, this is not what "wikipedia is not." Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that is made to help all people and that is what this post is for. IF you can make some other excuse besides """SOCK PUPPETS""" as a reason to delete this article than make it. As of now, I think you are just coming up with excuses to get rid of this article because you dislike the people making it. You are WP:NOT.</p>
<p>If Wikipedia moderators are gonna delete this page I wish they would just do it already. I posted the listing because I have heard alot of amusing stories pertaining to the drink and from what I can tell, it IS in fact becoming quite popular (at least among the college crowd). If it isn't appropriate then take it down, but the fact that a screwdriver has a listing seems to contradict your logic.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Screwdriver+drink" gets over 750,000 hits. "Rick Nagelberg" gets a WHOPPING one, and from a NN website with only one sentence on&#160;:&#160;:it. "Pasadena Mudslide" (eww) gets over 1,000. As for the guy above, your sock-puppets aren't helping your case. Read the warning I put at the top of the page. With all due respect, you should not be talking about "what wikipedia is not" when you have zero edits. Also, I live near a university, and called the bar most frequented by college students. They had never heard of a "rick nagelberg". If more bars had known about it, wouldn't there be more than one google result? EDIT: Urban dictionary gets no definitions, a website extremely popular with college students. Tokakeke 01:06, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> While I don't like SEED much, it's worth to keep. No general interest? Gundam is consider to be largest mecha franchise in Japan.

Not that I don't like Star Wars, but Japaneese anime is a form of art too.

<li><b>Comment</b> the term "walled garden" refers to a group of articles that lend each other legitimacy by linking to each other. For instance, if someone wrote an article about a nn little league team, it would look bogus as none of the people in it would have articles.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. If anything, you're being too specific with your delete requests... By that logic, you'd have to delete every Gundam article on Wikipedia, along with most other Anime articles - in fact, there are several more obscure series that should have been targeted first. And I'm not in favor of that - I enjoy having the information on this and other series all available in one place. Furthermore, varying amounts of data on the subject (Gundam) are found on the Japanese, French, Spanish, Italian, and German Wikipedias shows, in my opinion, that at least the general subject deserves coverage here. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolux_Ex_Machina_fda5.html" title="User:Golux Ex Machina">Golux Ex Machina</a> 06:27, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: This is fancruft not even about a major character. Wikipedia's Minor Character policy stipulates stuff like this is meant to be collected on one page. A Mech is not a character it is a vehicle used by character in an Anime. Please be objective here and read teh wikipedia policies. The article is source less and is essentially fancruft. --206.191.28.13 15:10, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep it!</b> I use this article sometimes to help out with various online forums and games. Taking if off with no good reason other than you don't like it is not a good reason. And since it is obvious that you don't like it the series, then you must not know the Justice was piloted by the second protagonist in the series. Therefore, it is important to keep it around.

<p>This article was split off from <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Frank_85bb.html" title="Anne Frank">Anne Frank</a> as a way to keep the cruft out of the main article. This kind of thing has become a common way to solve the problem of earnest but worthless contributions. I believe that articles like this should never be created, but rather the problem of trivia should be addressed within an article like <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Frank_85bb.html" title="Anne Frank">Anne Frank</a>, without creating a split. Maybe if this information is so important, it should be mentioned in articles like <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Guy_f6a0.html" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a> or <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilary_Duff_20dd.html" title="Hilary Duff">Hilary Duff</a>, as it's got nothing to do with Anne Frank.

<dd><b>Keep</b> (as per my comment below in reply to <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a>) <s><b>Delete</b></s> - I was the editor who split off the article because I thought the information was not relevent in <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Frank_85bb.html" title="Anne Frank">Anne Frank</a>, but because it was receiving so many edits to that part of the article, I thought there was a strong desire from other users for it to exist. I don't think this obsessive level of trivia collection should be what Wikipedia is about, although I agree that the contributors to it are earnest and well intentioned. I'd be happier to see it, and other similar articles, gone (but as stated below, deleting it may ultimately lead to the trivia section returning to the Anne Frank article, because there are a significant number of editors who are interested in recording this information). I would be appalled and horrified if it was merged back into the article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 00:15, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b><s>Neutral Comment</s> Keep</b> Isn't it better to retain this page rather than allowing a similar section in the main article? I also dislike such 'trivia' material- but strictly speaking, there's no obvious reason why this kind of stuff shouldn't be in the encyclopaedia in some form. I worry that deleting this article will only lead to a lot of difficult to support reversions from the main <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Frank_85bb.html" title="Anne Frank">Anne Frank</a> article- at least this way, good faith editors have an outlet for entering this kind of information into the encyclopaedia. Is the alternative to bluntly tell them their edits are not wanted? <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 02:44, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There's no reason to tell them anything. Just delete the trivia when it pops up. Or, if there's a majority of regular editors to articles that approve of trivia, keep it. I don't see why we need to keep edits on when Anne Frank was mentioned in somebody's favorite cartoon, TV show, or song. A reader's understanding of Anne Frank's life is not enhanced in the least by mentioning this trivia. It only serves to trivialize her. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G. Crawford">Brian G. Crawford</a> 16:30, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No it doesn't "work" for me, but I see keeping the article as the lesser of two evils. There is also justification for having it split from the main article for size reasons, so merging it would greatly increase the size of the original article, which is already quite long. If the subject of cultural references is worthwhile, and I think it is, the problem is the quality of the content rather the article subject itself, so if you feel that it's not necessary to "tell them anything", why not just delete the most trivial from the list, so that the list itself has some relevance? (actually, that would be difficult. I've read through the list again, and I can't see one reference that I think is relevant). You and I agree that the information on the list adds zero to the understanding of Anne Frank, so I don't understand why you would prefer to merge it, and thereby ruin and trivialize a fairly strong FA. Merging should be the last of all options, and in my opinion, the only option that is unacceptable. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 21:44, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would prefer to merge it if it is not deleted so that you editors of the Anne Frank article would have to deal with keeping it short and relevant. Splitting this stuff off makes one good article and one piece of garbage and encourages the rampant expansion of the garbage. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G.

<dd><i>"you editors of the Anne Frank article"</i>? Merging information into an article should not be done to deliberately weaken the second article so that other editors "would have to deal with" it. The article should either remain or be deleted, but it should not be merged into another article unless the aim is to improve the other article. For the record, the kindest thing that I can say about this article is that it's nonsensical rubbish, but my aim was to protect the integrity of the <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Frank_85bb.html" title="Anne Frank">Anne Frank</a> article when I split this off because I could see that a significant number of people thought this information was relevant, and they are now conspicuous by their absence. I don't care what happens to this one. Keep, delete - after all is said and done, I'm not going to lose sleep over it either way. But absolutely no way should it be merged. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 09:43, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree with the comments above and nomination that this material does not belong in the main Anne Frank article and should not be merged. It might be a worthy article if it actually had analysis behind it rather than being a list of instances in which she was referred to.

<li><b>Comment</b>; I also think that merging is a very bad idea. This is not a good article, but there is some scope for improvement. I certainly DO NOT agree that good faith edits of this nature (or indeed ANY good faith edits EVER) should be reverted without giving a reason. It would be far better to direct such editors (many of whom may perhaps be new or inexperienced Wikipedians) to a more suitable article.

<dd>I regularly remove trivia from articles without saying anything more than that it's irrelevant trivia. As I see it, the only people who benefit from this stuff are the ones typing it it. They get their jollies from that and then leave, and I don't see why we need to wring our hands over it. I think it's best to just delete it and move on. That's what I've been doing, and it's what I'll continue to do. I wish you could agree with deleting this article, but it seems that we have such a fundamental disagreement on what is important that I don't think we will agree. I'm fairly sick of seeing <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Guy_f6a0.html" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a> references dumped in articles everywhere, and I delete that stuff on sight. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G.

<dd>Well, it's possible that I have a slightly more inclusive view of Wikipedia than you do. I also dislike trivia sections, but I don't see how they are not legitimate edits as per WP policies. Judging by the near ubiquity of 'trivia' or 'pop-culture' refs in 'serious' biographies and articles, it seems not everyone shares my disdain. It's not for us to enforce our own opinions. None of these articles 'belong' to us- it is a community effort, and the views (and edits) of every member of the community acting in good faith are as valid as any other. I see no reason not to maintain the status quo re Anne Frank. All the best, <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 02:30, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Rather than talking about this one article in isolation, it would be great to get a consensus about the use and misuse of trivia in Wikipedia, work towards having a written policy on what constitutes appropriate and inappropriate recording of trivia, and then have something hard and fast to refer people too. It might be a way of gradually clearing all the clutter and debris from many articles, legitimately. At the moment all we can say is "this is irrelevant in my opinion" to which anyone can quite rightly reply "well who gives a ... about your opinion". <a href="../../../t/r/i/Wikipedia%7ETrivia_16ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Trivia">Wikipedia:Trivia</a> is flawed because it contains a lot of POV terms like "interesting" which is all in the eye of the beholder and impossible to quantify. There's a fair bit of discussion on <a href="../../../t/r/i/Wikipedia_talk%7ETrivia_8a06.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Trivia">Wikipedia talk:Trivia</a> but the comments are disorganised and random without either a purpose or a resolution. Just a suggestion, but I think it would be worthwhile directing some attention in that direction, rather than this one article which is going to be quickly forgotten regardless of the result of this discussion. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 10:01, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I agree with you, Rossrs, there should be a policy that should be followed. I dislike how adversarial this discussion and similar discussions have become, while I realize that I've contributed to this adversarial atmosphere. I just don't see any other way to get my opinion counted. My own view on trivia is that Anne Frank's favorite food or where she got her favorite pen, as examples, would be interesting trivia, while her depiction in market-driven corporate entertainment is not interesting and not needed and is better described as <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a>. I'd like to be able to reach a compromise on this stuff, because the present situation is intolerable to me and many others, judging from the discussion at <a href="../../../t/r/i/Wikipedia%7ETrivia_16ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Trivia">Wikipedia:Trivia</a>. I'm tired of being told that my opinion doesn't count in many cases because of some so-called "consensus," and I'm tired of being discouraged from being honest or outright dismissed by people who throw around <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. That's happened before, although not in this discussion. Rossrs, you want an Anne Frank article cleared of cruft. I completely agree with that. I want that too. Badgerpatrol, you may not like cruft, but you don't want to see anything discarded. That's admirable, but not especially realistic. Besides, everyone is told that if they don't want their contributions edited mercilessly, they shouldn't contribute. Without compromise there's no way to reach a consensus. Is anyone else willing to take others into consideration and compromise? <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G. Crawford">Brian G.

<dd>Brian, I agree with pretty much everything you say, although we are not in agreement about the actual solution to the problem, and that's fine. I want to assure you that I see this discussion as being far from adversarial. On the contrary, it's good that it's being discussed in some detail. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 23:15, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I also do not see the discussion as being adversarial in any way, except in a dialectic sense. It is always possible to have a robust and forthright discussion (such as this one has been) without being incivil. Fundamentally, I agree with <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> that moving towards a clearly-defined policy would greatly help in these situations. I do think that formulating this policy will be very difficult however. If I can just correct a minor point- I personally would love to delete 90% of the 'trivia' or 'pop. culture' sections in Wikipedia articles- but I respect the fact that other people don't necessarily agree, and that editors have put in some effort with these contributions, even if I personally find them to be largely without value. This encyclopaedia is a joint effort, which is why consensus is so important- and consensus means that we won't always get our way on every point. I'm quite sure that everyone is willing to compromise- but personally, I thought in this instance splitting the articles already WAS the compromise position. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 01:58, 25 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Good point. Splitting the article definitely WAS a compromise on my part. It's the only time I've ever felt compelled to do such a thing. It wasn't done lightly and was done mainly because I felt overwhelmed by the number of editors trivialising the article. As one of the two authors of the version of the article that attained "featured" status, I've always kept it on my watchlist and I was affronted that the quotes I'd carefully researched, cited and added from notable people such as <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Mandela_1695.html" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton_9905.html" title="Hillary Rodham Clinton">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a> talking about Frank's REAL legacy and impact on the world, were being drowned in a sea of <i><a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Guy_f6a0.html" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a></i> and <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilary_Duff_20dd.html" title="Hilary Duff">Hilary Duff</a> nonsense. Reading, for example, the <i><a href="../../../m/y/_/My_So_Called_Life_2001.html" title="My So Called Life">My So Called Life</a></i> quote, all I want to do is slap that screenwriter for trivialising Anne Frank in such an inane and so-stupid-it's-offensive manner – how can I convince an editor who thinks something like that is notable enough to put in a Wikipedia article, that it's the worst kind of garbage and has <i>nothing</i> to do with Anne Frank? I've got no policy to refer to - nothing but my own, biased opinion. And not one editor, but several, who all seem to think that "dumbing down" the article is actually improving it. After watching vandalism on this article on a daily basis for more than a year, I've expelled a lot of energy playing the part of "policeman" and it wears you down after a while, so I thought, if people want this rubbish, they win, I'll let them have an article that they can play in. Maybe not a brilliant decision but it's served my purpose of keeping the rot out of <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Frank_85bb.html" title="Anne Frank">Anne Frank</a>, so now it's only the juvenille vandalism to worry about. So in discussing the <i>compromise</i>, I hope this at least clarifies why I split the article - for anyone that's interested. Agree that it will be verrrrrrrrry difficult to reach a general consensus on "trivia". I can dream though.&#160;;-) <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 07:56, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
