<li>I know this is somewhat unorthodox thinking, but bare with me. When we have a band that's a one-hit wonder, <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> says that not only is the song notable, but the band is now notable as well, even if they were to never release another song in their entire career. Along the same lines, I think a company that releases notable software, even if they only last 4 years before bankruptcy (like NaN), is similarly notable. Therefore, I say <b>keep</b>. (However, if consensus becomes to delete, I recommend the merge and redirect be to <a href="../../../t/o/n/Ton_Roosendaal_84d4.html" title="Ton Roosendaal">Ton Roosendaal</a>, as it makes more sense to mention NaN in that intro paragraph than in <a href="../../../b/l/e/Blender_%28software%29.html" title="Blender (software)">Blender</a>'s.) <a href="../../../e/w/s/User%7EEWS23_Esperanza_9829.html" title="User:EWS23/Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>E</b></font></a><a href="../../../e/w/s/User%7EEWS23_debe.html" title="User:EWS23">WS23</a> | <a href="../../../e/w/s/User_talk%7EEWS23_56e9.html" title="User talk:EWS23">(Leave me a message!)</a> 03:21, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Reverting to <b>Strong Delete</b>. Adding <i>The leading company in StreamSQL implementation and standardization is StreamBase Systems.</i> (complete with link) doesn't equate to <b>killed off the marketing</b> in my mind.

<p>Killed the implementation section entirely. That addresses the above point. There are multiple commercial entities using StreamSQL-like approaches to solving this problem now, so I vote to keep it.</p>

<p>Not certain this is an actual term. Seems to be somewhat describing <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lens_mount.html" title="Lens mount">lens mount</a>, which is already covered, but strangely that article was started by the same anonymous user, so I think (s)he intended to describe separate terms. <strike>English might not be their first language</strike> (IP is in NYC); I suspect that "lens focusing element(s)" might be something closer to what is meant, but can't be sure. Nonetheless, Googling for "focusing lens mount" doesn't seem to turn up much relevant to what is discussed in the article.

<p>Hi guys, be calm&#160;:) I have removed the tag 'cause I have used the term "neologism", and I have seen that neologisms are not always eliminated. I'm present to an university lecture, time ago, and one of the speakers was the "random guy". Some days ago, I was to a lecture on the information security and, in a slide, his thought has been taken back... This way I wanted to share what doesn't seem a "common neologism" with you. I have not created "my personal page", I have shared only a form of thought that I like. Now, if you want, cast the stones!&#160;;) --Torment 12:33, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Vanity article from User:Jamesnice - some of them published by what seems to be his own company LTM (which he's been link spamming around various articles). Other by little-known publishers and with very low Amazon rankings. But I'd like the community's opinion on this one.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. My first two books were self-published, but that is not the same as vanity publishing at all. They have both sold several thousand copies. My later books are for Sutton who are a large UK publisher. Both these books have also appeared in translation abroad, as well as the softback and large print editions. Is the criteria by which a writer or publisher should be judged their 'Amazon ranking'? Surely not. It's pretty naff to have to justify myself in this way, but several of the 'delete' comments are plain wrong. Plenty of other minor writers have written their own Wikipedia entries. It isn't wrong per se.

<li><b>Comment</b> I realy wish I hadn't listed the "not English" language issue in my comment eariler. I see that it has caused some consternation and was not my primary motivation. The book is simply not notable. It has not had a visible social or political effect that warrants separate attention. It <i>is</i> a valid part of the Von Bülow article or any number of conpiracy articles. I read plenty of books and watch plenty of movies that are in languages other than English, and would have no problem with many of them getting their own articles. But this looks more tabloid, yellow press quality to me.

<li><b>Comment</b> Notability exclusively to the english speaking world isn't a criteria for inclusion in WP AFAIK. I don't know that there is a policy on excluding topics that are notable to foreign-language audiences. There are a lot of subjects that are important (even if this particular book is deemed not to be) that have not been translated into English. I don't know if there is a policy explicitly stating that untranslated books or films, etc. can be included (the absence of a policy that they cannot implies than can IMO) but <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Sources_in_languages_other_than_English" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Sources_in_languages_other_than_English</a> comes close I think. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Esquizombi</a> 15:57, 31 March 2006 (UTC) <i>Edit</i>: And also <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28books%29_a736.html#Title_translations" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (books)">Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_(books)#Title_translations</a> which is "a naming conventions guideline for the naming of wikipedia articles about books" which states "books that haven't been published in English (yet) are preferably referred to by an English version of the title" which would also appear to indicate articles about books that haven't been translated into English are acceptable. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Esquizombi</a> 19:59, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, the RS does NOT say that Wikipedians cannot do translations. It indicates they may be "performed by a Wikipedia editor" and that it is OK for "editors [to] use their own English translation." Certainly it is generally better (as stated there) to use outside translations (though sometimes a wikipedian may be able to provide a better translation than the ones available elsewhere). This isn't so much an issue with this article, which does cite to english language sources and external links. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Esquizombi</a> 18:13, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I would like "the opportunity to verify for myself what the original material actually said". But, I can't do that here. Given the book is so popular in Germany, it's likely in due time that there will be an English translated version of the book. At that time, I wouldn't object to an article here.

<li><b>Comment</b> It seems to me you're cherry-picking that guideline which states "<b>In principle</b>, readers should have the opportunity to verify for themselves what the original material actually said" (emphasis added). And again, that's not an issue anyway because there isn't any translation of the contents of the book in the article, rather it appears it was composed by reference to english language articles about the book which given that <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Some_definitions" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">WP is a tertiary source</a> is acceptable. If there were translated text from the book you could order the book and a German/English dictionary or plop passages into Babelfish and get an idea as to whether the translation may be accurate or not. But again, there's not, so that's not an issue. Would there be a good place on WP to discuss the broader issue of articles about untranslated subjects?<a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Esquizombi</a> 19:31, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I repeat, I don't think the absence of an article on the deWP proves it is not notable, any more than the absence of an article about an English language book on this WP proves the book is not notable. It only proves nobody has added one yet. There's no article on Barbara Hodgson, for example, or any of her several critically acclaimed and award-winning books, one of which is being adapted into a film (I should work on that). Additionally, the dewiki only has "378.316 Artikel" versus the 1,054,498 articles on this one. Look at the article again; there are better references there than the about.com one you singled out. There are other references to it as a bestseller, for example <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Boston_Globe_7aad.html" title="The Boston Globe">The Boston Globe</a>.<a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2004/02/01/conspiracies_so_vast/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2004/02/01/conspiracies_so_vast/" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Esquizombi</a> 01:49, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Ich verstehe nicht: it is not clear to me, nor have I seen addressed in this discussion, why this content is not better considered at the entry on <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andreas_von_B%C3%BClow_faeb.html" title="Andreas von Bülow">Andreas von Bülow</a>; it is hardly as if that article is so overwhelmingly long that it cannot accommodate more information, and since <u>the book is the vehicle for the ideas of the man</u>, surely it is a better place for it. Why keep this in a separate article? The fact that it is in German, is really a canard. If this is kept this time around, I recommend it be renominated with a suggested merge to the author to avoid an unecessary debate about language. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 09:01, 1 April 2006 (UTC) (Postcscript: WRT several points made above, this is very unlikely to receive an article on de.WP, since their standards for inclusion are generally much more stringent and, per precedent, any such article would almost certainly be flagged for deletion forthwith and the content moved back to Bulow's main German language entry.

<li><b>Comment</b> In the case of people who wrote only one book, and especially if they are primarily known only for that book, I would agree with you. In this case, since he is the author of at least two books and is known (or at least had long been known) for being in the German government, I'd be less inclined to advocate merging. As it is, it's unfortunate so much of Bulow's own entry is about his 9/11 beliefs. I haven't tried to read the de.wiki's deletion policies, but they do have an article there on the apparently untranslated English language 9/11 conspiracy book <a href="../../../../de/c/r/o/Crossing_the_Rubicon_a77e.html" class="extiw" title="de:Crossing_the_Rubicon">de:Crossing the Rubicon</a>, so I'm not sure Bulow's book would be deleted. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Esquizombi</a> 13:31, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> As far as I am concerned, translation into other languages is indicative of the extent of a book's influence. The more translations, the greater the distribution, influence, or interest. Without wide distribution then I would look to social or political consequences of the book and I just don't see much in the way of <i>consequences</i> for this particular book, regardless of its origins.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I agree with the first two sentences of the above comment. Namely, that <i>"translation into other languages is indicative of the extent of a book's influence"</i> and <i>"the more translations, the greater the distribution, influence, or interest."</i> However, it does not follow that just because a book may not have been translated in to English, then the only criteria we can use to judge its notability is its <i>"political consequences"</i>. It's not at all clear how one could judge the <i>"political consequences"</i> of a book in a NPOV way. It may be relatively clear in the case of some exceptions like <a href="../../../q/u/o/Quotations_from_Chairman_Mao_Zedong_fe29.html" title="Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong">Mao's Little Red Book</a>, Upton Sinclair's <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Jungle_506f.html" title="The Jungle">The Jungle</a>, and the scriptures of the major religions; but in the vast majority of cases books just don't have <b>any</b> obviously visible political consequences. However, that doesn't mean they're non-notable. I think looking at the sales numbers of the book in question as a sign of its notability is perfectly acceptable, even when there's no English translation. By excluding popular books that haven't yet been translated in to English we're encouraging <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">systemic bias</a> and hampering legitimate research in to a given topic by English speaking individuals who may be interested in how that topic is percieved or interpreted in the rest of the non-English speaking world. Besides, the English language publishing industry is generally not interested in books in translation: only a miserably tiny fraction of foreign language books are ever translated in to English<a href="http://www.bowker.com/press/bowker/2005_1012_bowker.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bowker.com/press/bowker/2005_1012_bowker.htm" rel="nofollow">[17]</a><a href="http://www.bowker.com/press/bowker/2005_1012_bowker.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bowker.com/press/bowker/2005_1012_bowker.htm" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>, likely for business reasons that may have little to do with their notability in the rest of the world. Why should Wikipedia defer to the English language publishing industry to the exclusion of the rest of the world, when we can rely on perfectly legitimate indicators of their notability elsewhere (such as their sales in other countries)? -- <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_6ec7.html" title="User:Noosphere">noosphere</a> 01:01, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - this article has come a long way since being nominated for AfD. There are three claims being made about: firstly it is NN. I disagree: it has sold 100,000 copies, which is very large for a "non-fiction" (allegedly!) book, especially in Germany. It was the hot topic of the 2003 Frankfurt Book Fair - and <i>as a book</i>, not just <i>as the work of Herr "Cranky" van Bulow"</i>. It is extremely controversial <i>as a book</i> (not just as a selection of views) because of the quality of sourcing - this is an issue about the German publishing industry, not 9/11, therefore we need to consider this book <i>as a book</i>, not just a selection of (what are largely seen as dangerous/bizarre) views associated with one man. Secondly, it not verifiable. I disagree, there are plenty of English languages secondary sources on this book and I have tried to improve the referencing for the article so that it is now clear exactly where each statement in the article can be sourced from. (Haven't finished just yet, will probably take me another hour to incorporate another three English language sources). Thirdly, it is synonymous with Andreas von Bulow and should be merged. Again, I disagree, we need to treat this book <i>as a book</i> for the reasons I have given already plus the fact that Andreas von Bulow has had a long career and is important as a politician in his own right. If we had a balanced biography for him, perhaps the bottom quarter of it would be on his post-politicial retirement conspiracy theorising. However, that is unlikely to happen as in the English-speaking world he is best known for his controversial views on 9/11. Those views do not "define the man" and this article is about more than his views, it also considers the books as a publishing phenomenon, as part of a zeitgeist for similar publications, and as a controversy within German publishing. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 16:33, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't get this policy. Just because they aren't mainstream doesn't mean they aren't an interesting, different band. I think it's stupid to judge bands by how popular they are. Twodeadsluts keep it real by staying underground. Also, seeing as they are not a large band, information on them is almost nil therefore making this page more useful than ones for bands that people already know tons about and could find on countless websites. Also, "band vanity" is a violation of the amendment of freedom of expression. If people found their name offensive, they would not be interested in listening to them thus having no reason to look up information on them. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Metro_53ec.html" title="User:The Metro">The Metro</a> 20:19, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Whatu means 'stone' in Māori. To make it mean hail, you have to add the word for rain: ua-whatu (stony rain) or ua-ā-whatu (rain with stones). It makes no sense for the everyday word for stone to be used without these additions and expect anyone to understand it to refer to hail. Whatu is definitely a Māori word, and cannot appear in this form in any other Polynesian language so this cannot be a <i>Polynesian</i> god in the wider sense. Hail is not that common here in NZ, and I would think even rarer still in tropical Polynesia. Apparently hail does occur in Hawaii, but how could they have used a Māori word for it? <a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahuroa_d2ad.html" title="User:Kahuroa">Kahuroa</a> 06:13, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That list is currently a general list showing the equipment available to the entirety of the thousand Chapters of Space Marines, along with a wide variety of Imperial military and paramilitary organisations whose memberships reaches into the billions. To mention an item with such a small use would show great disproportion in the level of information conveyed (ie:fancruft). We can counter it by not having it in there, or we can counter it by listing every single special piece of equipment, squad upgrade, character weapon, relic, and rarely used piece of technology covered in the Armoury section of each Imperial Codex, because stuff with rules should come first in an article on a playable game. We're talking hundreds of seperate entries in the list <i>before</i> we get down to the level of player and universe impact this device has.

<p>I have been in the process of adding a 'Capability systems' category and updating various entries related to capability systems. I created this page as a placeholder for Charlie Landau to edit, and I have emailed Charlie to advise him that he needs to populate it. It is not clear why Hetter believes that the website <a href="http://www.coyotos.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.coyotos.org" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> returns nothing. It certainly responds for me. I did forget to insert the http:// on the initial edit (since fixed). CapROS is an active sourceforge project, and it is currently funded by DARPA.</p>
<p>Hettar may be right that an entry on CapROS is premature. I suggest that Landau should be given a decent interval of time to put more substantial content here before the page is deleted. I'ld also note that when an author is staring a delete notice in the face it tends to be self-fulfilling. Why should they invest effort in improving a Wikipedia entry if the entry is under threat of deletion? If they don't, how can Wikipedia <i>determine</i> whether sufficient content might exist to justify retention?</p>
<p>By all means let us revisit this in a week or so, by which time there will probably be something to react to. In the interim, have the common decency to let Landau edit without a threat notice in his face. shap 07:53, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>Let us take these in turn.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>: It would be factually inaccurate to fail to mention that the principal force behind CapROS is a company. The article does <b>not</b> indulge in advocacy or sales. The article does <b>not</b> indulge in any other form of SPAM listed at <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The argument for <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> is stronger, primarily because CapROS isn't shipping yet. However, the simple fact that this system is DARPA-funded in the current funding environment is fairly remarkable, and might be construed as a metric of significance for the KeyKOS/EROS/CapROS path of work. To my knowledge, there are only two such operating systems today (the other, FYI, is Coyotos). To the extent that a brief CapROS entry serves as the endpoint of the EROS work, a <i>brief</i> entry is necessary for editorial completeness. For some other topics, this might be a reason to merge the entry into the EROS entry (which might be appropriate at this point). The editorial problem with this is that it does not sufficiently respect due credit. As the EROS principal I would be very uncomfortable with an editorial presentation that would appear to present Landau's work as mine.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a> doesn't apply here. CapROS unquestionably exists. However, this <i>may</i> be a reason not to have a stub entry until CapROS actually releases.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I may not be independent enough to evaluate the <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a> challenge. My rationale for adding the entry was (a) The EROS work was considered well-motivated by a broad number of people, (b) The current EROS development path is proceeding with CapROS, so if the work is worth mentioning CapROS needs to be dealt with for editorial completeness. (c) The desire to avoid proliferation of articles is overridden in this case by the importance of not misrepresenting credit.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I note that Hettar does not respond to my primary original point: the article does not yet <i>have</i> content, and until it has had a reasonable chance for content to be added it is impossible for Hettar to form any useful opinion about it, and certainly not about the spam or vanity points. It is clearly not the expectation of Wikipedia that articles arrive full-formed from the mouth of Zeus. Hettar's nomination for deletion is premature.</p>
<p>I also note that Hetar obviously didn't actually <i>look</i> at the CapROS website. Perhaps he typed ".com" rather than ".org". He has not yet troubled to acknowledge his shoddy archival research in this regard.</p>
<p>The question of Alexa ratings is utterly irrelevant. I know Brewster, and I wish him and Alexa the best, but Alexa's criteria are not those of Wikipedia. Same issue for Google, whose primary consideration is cross-linkage, not merit.</p>
<p>Would Hetar find it appropriate if his current high school faculty made a practice of deleting his term papers summarily at the end of their first sentence on the grounds that they were incomplete?</p>
<p>One more time: the article needs a decent, but not excessive, opportunity to be written before it is evaluated for deletion, and this will not happen if the deletion threat is sitting in the article.

<p>I had much to do with Keykos which is an ancestor of Capros. I argue here that Capros, and therefore the article, is important. I hope that such an argument is not out of line. There are several very active e-mail lists on capability based security. The subject is controversial. There is currently little activity in the area of an OS kernel based on these ideas. This seems unfortunate for without secure platforms there is little hope of a secure infrastructure. I think that Capros is probably the system closest to providing such a secure platform, which I supose is the reason for DARPA support. NormHardy 04:42, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Request Clarification or Undelete</b> 12:03, 2 April 2006 - I only created the article as I saw under the term 'luxury_real_estate' the profile of a company I am aware of and felt this was on par with that article. I felt if that article was accepted, this one could be. Could someone at least clarify the difference between the two? I accept and understand and don't want to add untasteful spam and it was not my intent, but why is one company allowed and another not? 'Luxury Real Estate' was clearly written and corrected by the creator of the business "Luxury Real Estate" with an added definition of "luxury real estate" after placing their company information. Also, is there a way to restate anything in the article to make it valid? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Johng7777 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johng7777_4704.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johng7777">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per above. - After reviewing the spamming policy, I agree this article should be deleted. I do feel that the article 'luxury real estate' should be reviewed carefully as well, as that is where the idea for this article was conceived. I am aware that IBM or Hewlett Packard etc. are large enough for notoriety, but I don't believe 'luxury real estate' would be in that classification as they are not setting any trends per se in the luxury real estate market, nor are they considered a standard by any means. Just an opinion from a luxury realtor. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Johng7777 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johng7777_4704.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johng7777">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Sorry? I didn't check through the google too much, just enough to note that all the google hits were actually about this. It meets Alexa pretty easily though. 2,000 while 10,000 is the criteria. So we shouldn't need to worry about the google part. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 17:28, 13 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cdghost_2076.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cdghost">Per UncleG</a>, the best use of Google results is to carefully scan through them, and find "other people have found the subject notable enough that they have gone to the effort of writing and publishing stuff of their own about it". Many of the Paperdoll Heaven hits are either simply links to the site that look like they could have been placed there as part of an <a href="../../../s/e/o/SEO_d889.html" title="SEO">SEO</a> compaign (eg. many one-liners from blogspot <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2005/10/17/google_draws_fire_over_blogspot_spam_blogs.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2005/10/17/google_draws_fire_over_blogspot_spam_blogs.html" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>), or are mentions by blogs (many of them non-notable). I suppose that it's not a subject that newspapers would write about often, but maybe that means its inclusion in an encyclopedia should be borderline, not Strong. Nonetheless, there are a few semi-notable independent links to the site. <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/entry/1234000843062101/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.joystiq.com/entry/1234000843062101/" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> <a href="http://www.lovemelt.com/download/melt_marketleaders.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lovemelt.com/download/melt_marketleaders.pdf" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 17:51, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> I call Bullsh*t. No way do I believe that Alexa rank. It's been obviously manipulated to boost ad revenues, which is why those google links are so suspicious.

<li>I'm currently working for the company behind the site. We have not engaged in any SEO or artificial Alexa-rank boosting. Believe it or not, there is a big demand for this kind of content. We're past a million subscribers now and are, at times, pushing out 200 Mbit/s of data. <a href="http://www.indexventures.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.indexventures.com/" rel="nofollow">Index Ventures</a> has <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/060216/sfth080.html?.v=34" class="external text" title="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/060216/sfth080.html?.v=34" rel="nofollow">invested</a> $4 million in the company. I will abstain from voting on this request for deletion since I'm biased. If the article is kept, however, it's quite obvious that it needs some serious rewriting. It should also be renamed to Stardoll. I've been intending to do this, but haven't had the time.

<p>That is so horrible of you people, of all people on the internet I would have thought that Wikipedia would be open to allowing the free share of information..cleary you want to limit the flow of information by not allowing a short piece of information on Essembly. If you all think that it is an advertisement then why dont you check out the site, and then modify the article to fit how you like it.

<p>I don't think it's inappropriate for Wikipedia to document social phenomena, and eponymous political slanders is certainly a real (and ongoing) social phenomenon. And documenting a slander is not the same thing as propagating it; I've certainly attempted, in writing this page, to avoid suggesting that I agree with the slanders in question. -- <a href="../../../m/e/o/User%7EMeowse_501a.html" title="User:Meowse">Meowse</a></p>

Also, your cites are merely to examples of this phenomenon, not to published writing about the phenomenon itself ("eponymous political slanders" gets zero google hits right now). If the phenomenon is one that you identified yourself, that's original research inappropriate for Wikipedia, see <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. I've updated the beginning of the AfD to mention this. Remember that Wikipedia is not supposed to be a primary source. It's supposed to report only on what's already been documented by others.

<dd>I don't see any page called eponymous scientific terms, and even if there is one, there's no question that those terms (Newton, Pascal, Ampere, etc) are real terms; they have tons of published cites that go back for centuries, and making a list of them is no big deal. The only disparaging eponymous political term that I can think of with that documentable level of usage is <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quisling.html" title="Quisling">Quisling</a>, and I don't think that was coined in order to slander him. The examples you gave as "successful" range from barely marginal (santorum) to completely invalid (someone coining a term on a blog and someone else sticking it into Wiktionary doesn't make it a real word). And the "unsuccessful" efforts are non-notable terms by definition.

In particular, if you know of any eponymous political slanders of left-wing politicians, I would very much like to add them to the entry. (Note: "Bushitler", while both a neologism and a play on words, is clearly not an eponymous political slander as defined on this page: (1) it's not eponymous, being a portmanteau of two different names, and (2) it doesn't then attempt to redefine "bushitler" to reference an unpleasant concept) <a href="../../../m/e/o/User%7EMeowse_501a.html" title="User:Meowse">Meowse</a> 22:26, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Request for collaboration</b>: I believe that there's a significant social phenomenon occurring here, starting with Dan Savage's coinage of the neologism "santorum", and continuing into the present.

<dd>Your sentence "I believe there's a significant social phenomenon occuring here", without documentation for the supposedly occurring phenomenon, is a sign that you're engaged in <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Wikipedia is not trying to stay ahead of the curve.

<li><b>Delete</b> This page has perhaps a single semi-valid entry and some flame baiting doo-doo by a vandal. There are plenty of politically derived eponyms but they are not necessarily slanders, even if they started as insults. Perhaps the weak, single "Santorum" entry could be used in another article related to political eponyms, but I'm not aware of such an article existing at this time. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAnde_B._3091.html" title="User:Ande B.">Ande B</a> 05:07, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> It's a stretch to call it a list; there's only really one item worth mentioning. On top of that, the title is inaccurate, because the intent of introducing the neologism is to associate the eponymous politician with the connotations of the term's definition, not to assert that they are directly associated with it. --Sneftel 19:00, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I guess the question isn't so much as to whether the concept exists — whether as an urban legend or not: it's clear that plenty of people mention it; e.g. in the newspaper editorial you mention. The issue would appear to be whether enough information about it has been published by reputable sources to be able to write an encyclopedia article about it. My suspicion is that there is not, but it's difficult to prove a negative. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 16:21, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> per Badgerpatrol or redirect and smerge (not sure to where) or transwiki to Wiktionary. I'm not sure how much of an Encyclopedia entry this could ever be. I'm curious as to where <i>Cassell's Dictionary</i> got its info, but I suppose it is an acceptable source. I think the unsourced stuff in the article (e.g. the players do not necessarily self-identify as homosexual) has got to go. I found another source of debatable reliability: ""Other popular variations of such games include ejaculating onto food (favorites are soggy biscuits, white bread, chocolate pudding, etc.). The last person to come has to eat it." Garbage, Greta (1999). <i>That's Disgusting&#160;: An Adult Guide to What's Gross, Tasteless, Rude, Crude, and Lewd,</i> page 71 <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1580080944</a> The game also appears in <i>Goats: A Novel</i> by Mark Jude Poirier, page 106 and in the story "Soggy Biscuit" by Barry Lowe in <i>Flesh and the Word: An Anthology of Erotic Writing</i> by John Preston. It's also described in Devenish, Colin (2000). <i>Limp Bizkit,</i> page 26 <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 031226349X</a>.

<dd><b>General comment</b> I think there is some misunderstanding here. Some voters appear to be objecting on the grounds that the entry is a neologism or 'pure' original research (ie that the original contributor, or a small group containing the contributor and a few friends, made up this term on the spot). Neither is true. 'Soggy biscuit' IS not a neologism. It is a widely-known and recognised name and concept, at least in the UK (as can be confirmed by even a cursory Google search, which returns multiple (thousands) independent hits). One may not have heard of a term, but that does not make it untrue. The question is not 'is this a real thing' but rather 'it IS a real concept, but should it be included in the encyclopaedia'? (ie, can it be verified?). The content is definitely true, but 'actual' truth is not 'objective' truth (ie verifiability). I have provided one ref above, and FGJ has suggested another; there is also the Blackadder sketch. There are numerous pages regarding individual urban legends and modern folklore on Wikipedia. The material should probably be kept in its current form; I feel there is too much for wiktionary, but a move would perhaps be one option as a compromise. As far as I can see, this term now fully satisifes <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 19:56, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>... references provided are not sufficient. This concept exists; in the days of yore where I came up it was called "Circle Jerk" and the supposed target was a Saltine cracker. The problem is sourcing. We have one referenced article that mentions "soggy biscuit" with the 'wink-wink-nod-nod' that the reader already knows what it is. There is a a mention in a book, and a passing mention on <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Adder_e6e1.html" title="Black Adder">Black Adder</a>. Unless someone can produce a source that verifiably describes the act of <a href="../../../s/o/g/Soggy_biscuit.html" title="Soggy biscuit">soggy biscuit</a> in reference to that name, and the other purported terms used for it, it simply does not meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>'s big old bold text: <b>Verifiability, not truth</b>.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:25, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Not to nitpick, but that isn't a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> source because <i>it doesn't describe what "soggy biscuit" is</i>. The exact reference in that article is: "It could have been more embarrassing only if they'd been caught playing soggy biscuit." Anyone reading that would have to have a pre-existing idea of what "soggy biscuit" refers to.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - I want articles like this on wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment on Verification</b> OK, in a nostalgic reminder of my mis-spent youth, I spent part of today in the library looking up naughty words in the dictionary.

<dl>
<dd>Soggy Biscuit, n. 1960's, origin. Aus.: 'A masturbation game, popular among schoolboys, whereby the participants masturbate and then ejeculate upon a biscuit; the last to reach orgasm must eat the semen-covered bicuit'</dd>

<dd>That is surely as exact a definition as <s>surely</s> wikipedia needs? As objective evidence, we now have: the Guardian article, which tells us that a) soggy biscuit is an embarassing activity; b) that it is sufficiently notable as to be suitable for inclusion in a major national newspaper without further explanation, the nod and wink conceit being that the reader will already know what it is and will not require further explanation. We have the BlackAdder reference. We also have FGJ's assertion that the game is mentioned in detail in The Liar. Finally, we have the precise definition in a reference work intended for a mass audience. This, as multiple correspondants above have asserted (not just the slightly unreliable anon. IPs), is a widely notable urban legend. I have no doubt, given the widespread notability of this game in British and Anglophone culture, that many other references are available and can be added to the article in the future. I did not have to look hard in order to find the definition above. I really do feel that we now have enough corroboratory evidence to satisfy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. There is no reason why this article should be held to higher standards of notability and verifiability (which surely have now been satisfied?) than any other on Wikipedia. It is a real concept, not a neologism, sufficiently notable for most readers of a national newspaper to be assumed to have heard of it, and can be verified with an exact definition. It is encyclopaedic. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 19:05, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_schools_in_the_United_Kingdom_bad7.html" title="Talk:List of schools in the United Kingdom">talk page</a> (where there are several comments about the pointlessness of this list), there is in the order of 25,000 schools in the UK.

<li><b><s>Weak</s> keep</b> I tend to like to keep lists like this around until the red links are filled in, as places without articles inherently cannot be categorized and, therefore, the correct namespace for future articles are not as readily available to editors that may wish to create said article in the future (some articles that I have created have been due to stumbling onto red links). I have no objection to future deletion when the categories fill up, I would just hate to lose such a valuable tool for editors prematurely. I would vote delete for when the red links are filled (while I agree that Wikipedia should be optimized for readers over editors, it still is useful to have some deference paid to the people that are actually trying to put version 1.0 together, ie all of us) or if a good wikiproject is started. But for now, the one pro outweighs the cons. I would, instead, rather see the article have a "verify" tag to address concerns in the nom. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican"><i><font color="blue">young</font></i><font color="#CFB53B">american</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../y/o/u/User_talk%7EYoungamerican_2059.html" title="User talk:Youngamerican">talk</a>)</small> 14:47, 31 March 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican"><i><font color="blue">young</font></i><font color="#CFB53B">american</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../y/o/u/User_talk%7EYoungamerican_2059.html" title="User talk:Youngamerican">talk</a>)</small> 14:38, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> as the article is a pure anti-Liberman POV push (by a user who admitted he has only found out who Liberman was this week), and a fork, and I'm not willing to work too much on it, although in principle I think it could become a decent article if the approach was changed. For instance, a clear lead section needs to be made, and the article should focus on the 1950s discussions (might be hard to source), and the paragraph about Liberman should be removed entirely. He isn't the only politician, and not the most notable, who has, at some point in his political career, remarked that he doesn't want Israeli Arabs in Israel. -- <font face="wingdings">Y</font> <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> <font face="wingdings">Y</font> 14:56, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Huldra, I am dispaointed from your vote. But maybe it is not your fault. More than anything, this article show how an editor can take a source like "Haaretz" (which has comntators from all sides of the Israeli political map) and use what is essetialy an election time propeganda (of those who wanted to smear Liberman) and use it as "sources" for Wikipedia article.</dd>
<dd>From the record I presonaly think that Liberman has some views that are facist but that is no excuse to falsify the article about his views. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 19:17, 31 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A very quick note: actually, Zeq; my interest is not mainly in Liberman (which I tried to indicate above). But I see the subject pop up again and again through history (post 1948) due to demographics, read e.g. <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Segev_dd93.html" title="Tom Segev">Tom Segev</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binational_solution.html" title="Binational solution">Binational solution</a>(The Friedlander-Goldscheider study). <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHuldra_dadc.html" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> 19:30, 31 March 2006 (UTC) PS: have you read Segevs latest book?</dd>

<dd>Huldra, The issue is not that "it pops" but "what pops" and "by whom". There was a party in Israel that proposed tarnsfer, It was Kahane party that was outlawed. If Liberman would propose that he will not be able to run. It is aginst the law in israel to propose that. So what ever you think "poped" it is not the same thing as what this article suggests.</dd>

<dd>If that is the case, why does even The Times note: "[Liberman]] plans to strengthen Israel’s status as a Jewish state by transferring 500,000 of its minority Arab population to the West Bank, by the simple expedient of redrawing the West Bank to include several Arab Israeli towns in northern Israel. Another 500,000 would be stripped of their right to vote if they failed to pledge loyalty to Zionism." <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,251-2109796,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,251-2109796,00.html" rel="nofollow">[35]</a></dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I oppose the deletion of this article, since it is not just a general history of communism, but about a specific current (which is also generally seen as the mainstream current of communism). However, if it is to be deleted, then I'd rather suggest incorporing it into <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communism</a> directly. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 15:26, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>: Having read the article, it really ought to be merged as suggested. If kept, it certainly needs a clean up.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Thank you, Monicasdude, for the recommended "strong keep." As for someone that's been involved in more than fifteen years of work in the industry, it's nice to see that others appreciate -- or acknowledge -- their work. I'm sure that Mr. Kimbrell understands that IMDb while being a helpful tool, is not anywhere near a complete clearinghouse for credits. There are literally HUNDREDS of shows that Mr. Crowley produced that are not currently listed on the IMDb database (not an unusual occurrance-- type in other known execs &amp; producers, and you'll often find major gaps in their career timelines). It's curious to note that Mr. Kimbrell doesn't find Cops... the Academy Awards... the Emmys... Big Brother... Headliners &amp; Legends... Trading Spouses... or any other number 'tof listed series, as "notable enough." All seem to represent either major milestones in recent TV history or as standouts in their form. Mr Kimbrell has a page at Wikipedia, yet has but a single IMDb listing. What is the standard for acceptance? I certainly wouldn't judge whether he deserves a listing, but I note the fact for others to see. And, yes, if Air Force Amy has a home here, why not a producer who does a daily battle in the TV production trenches?<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 157.22.64.226 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_157.22.64.226_71fd.html" title="Special:Contributions/157.22.64.226">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Jeez, a lot to respond to there. The events and shows are notable, but not all the people connected with them necessarily are. To put it a different way, <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yankee_Stadium_25aa.html" title="Yankee Stadium">Yankee Stadium</a> is notable, but the construction worker who installed the seats may or may not be. Most of Mr. Crowley's credits on IMDB are as a "Supervising Producer", which is kind of the middle management of TV work: not writing full time, and not creating shows, but more the logistical odds-and-ends that need to be done to get the show on the air. It's important work, and probably interesting work, but not in my mind encyclopedic, which is why I posted this here. His credit for "Big Brother" was as a "story editor", which is a position of similarly ambiguous importance, and I stand by my skepticism of his role in "Cops" or "Trading Spouses" (as well as the award shows), since the article doesn't describe his role or cite sources and there are zero google hits connecting him to those in any way, shape, or form. For all we know, he could've been Assistant Monkey Wrangler #4, or the intern they sent out for coffee and bagels. I agree that his writing work for the History Channel is the most noteworthy aspect of his career, but it's still something of a slender reed. <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_Amy_77d6.html" title="Air Force Amy">Air Force Amy</a> isn't really relevant to the discussion for two reasons: Her notability is grounded in widespread media coverage, which Mr. Crowley doesn't appear to have received, and furthermore, the "cruft justifies more cruft" argument generally doesn't generate much traction here, as it's much more easily turned around to use as an argument to delete both entries. I'm also confused as to your remark about me having a page at Wikipedia, since there's no entry for Colin Kimbrell (nor should there be, at this point). I have a user page, as does every other editor of the site, but that's not really connected to the encyclopedia itself. If Mr. Crowley wants to start editing here, and then adds a few details about his personal and professional life to his user page, more power to him; we've got a lot of work that still needs to be done on our coverage of TV shows. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 20:07, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'll add a comment or two about Mr. Crowley's credentials. It's very misleading to insinuate that he was "Assistant Monkey Wrangler #4" on any production, because he is an experienced veteran professional who commands great respect and admiration from his peers. He has indeed been a showrunner and writer for a number of series, and over the past decade has been a producer for many top shows, from Big Brother to World's Most Amazing Videos to NBC's Headliners and Legends. He is so well-known in the television community that he is featured in the FinalDraft script software's "Why I Write" advertising campaign. Most recently, he has made an impact in the Los Angeles media scene with his "Hollywood Thoughts" website, which breaks news about Los Angeles cultural shifts, while adding insight about its history-- from the recent closing of Schwab's, to coverage of the student immigration protests, and over the weekend, a tribute to a newsstand vendor that was picked up by the LA Daily News and has led to a groundswell for a memorial statue (the site laobserved.com links to him regularly). Perhaps Mr. Crowley can post his extensive CV to give a better idea. Strong recommendation to stay.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 157.22.64.229 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_157.22.64.229_0677.html" title="Special:Contributions/157.22.64.229">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>The things that you're saying about his credits are interesting and useful, but we need verifiable sources to confirm them if they're going to be in the encyclopedia. Right now, we don't have those, and in absence of proof, it's not trustworthy. That's the point I was trying to make with the "Assistant Monkey Wrangler" remark: Information that's unsourced and unsourcable is pretty much worthless. You seem to have a good knowledge base about Mr. Crowley's career; if you have references that meet the guidelines for this stuff (listed at <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>), please add them to the article, as that's the best thing you can do to swing public opinion your way in a deletion discussion. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 23:25, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. What do you need, buddy... and why do you have it out for this guy? Look, Hollywood is a town of relationships. The guy is well-known and always working because of his pedigree. That's easy for everyone in town to recognize... why not you? This is the problem: The land of skin-ripping LaCrosse players is too far removed from the reality of this industry. Hire someone local to concentrate on these type of entries. Must every single gig have a URL to make you happy... and feeling "Trusting"? He's all over the web-- just google him. I think that whatever anybody says here, won't rate with you (Us: "He's a featured speaker at an event sponsored by big companies" You: "so what." Us: "He helped create a new form of software for TV writers (see Final Draft site)" You: "so what."). Whatever. At the end of the day, You're the guy holding the delete button. More power to you. All we can do is holler at the owners of this site to get people that are better informed in your position. As far as TS is concerned, I know that he helped format the very first show... and then streamlined the field operation on the second season. Day-to-day middle management? In your view of the world, probably so. In ours, No. He helped CREATE the LOOK, PACING, AND VOICE of a top-rated show. Not bad for a seat-installer, huh? As for cops? Hey-- was the 'net around in the first season when he did his time in the old Barbour-Langley Marina offices? Geez. Obviously the guy has a successful record. I've worked for him-- he also created/ produced the Animal Planet show, "That's My Baby" (in both primetime &amp; daytime. Daytime was a #1 hit for that show. Marta Kauffman said several times it was her "very favorite" show. Again, notable that the producer of the nation's #1 show (that's "Friends," Colin-- in case you missed it watching the LaCrosse team). He also helped create the first blind date show on TV ("A Dating Story" for TLC). I know at one point, he was doing, like, five shows at the same time. I think only Bruckheimer has more shows going. Man. It makes my head spin that there are people who live and breathe this net stuff so completely.That some dude -- a student at Duke University -- is sitting in judgment of this guy's career-- blows me away. "Those that do, create. Those who can't..." I guess sit on a computer all day. More importantly, it's amazing to see how easy it is for someone to dismiss the integrity of his peers from the pulpit of his dorm. So be it. The annonimity of the web allows for this to happen on a daily basis. And, yes, the "Amy" argument IS relevant: It's good to know that women who spread their legs in a Nevada double-wide are good enough for the 'ol 'Wik... but a guy that makes millions of people laugh or cry on a nightly basis, doesn't rate. Go ahead, Colin... hit the delete button. It's US... we're all wrong... and YOU are always right. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 157.22.64.226 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_157.22.64.226_71fd.html" title="Special:Contributions/157.22.64.226">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Deleting Kalendar from the coffee house category is wrong. To claim that Kalendar is advertising is also incorrect. The Kalendar article lists date of opening and location with interior photo and complies with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> standards. The so called "vanity" aspects have been removed from the article. Kalendar may not be as "noteable" as the larger chains, but that should not preclude it from listing in the coffee house category. To call this article spam would be to call all listings in this category spam. The previous AFD article was edited down to be considered for inclusion - tis all. No harm intended. Please reconsider. The following is the opening paragraphs of the Starbucks listing. I imagine that all listings in this category are similar to this.EllisCHanna 04:06, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Starbucks NASDAQ: SBUX (SEHK: 4337), is a large multinational chain of coffee shops, often serving pastries, popular in the US especially among students and young urban professionals. The corporate headquarters are in Seattle, Washington. The company was in part named after Starbuck, a character in Moby-Dick, and its insignia is a stylized cartoon Siren. According to the company's fact sheet, as of February 2006, Starbucks had 6,216 company-operated outlets worldwide: 5,028 of them in the United States and 1,188 in other countries and U.S. territories. In addition, the company has 4,585 joint-venture and licensed outlets, 2,633 of them in the United States and 1,952 in other countries and U.S. territories.</p>

<li>By definition most of the listings in the coffee house category are "non-notable". In fact the majority of the listings are not known outside the constituency where they are established. Being "non-notable" has always been a difficult area for editors. In this instance for example, the band <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pursuit_of_Happiness_0d8b.html" title="The Pursuit of Happiness">The Pursuit of Happiness</a> wrote a song and video about Kalendar (1996 Kalendar/Gretzky Rocks/In Praise Of (T.W.A.-The World's Address). This by definition makes Kalendar a noteable entity by Wikipedia standards see <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> "A topic has notability if it is known outside of a narrow interest group or constituency, or should be because of its particular importance or impact". EllisCHanna 04:21, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually, if something is not notable, it <i>is</i> a pretty good reason to delete it; see <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">WP:ENC</a>. The comparison to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starbucks.html" title="Starbucks">Starbucks</a> is irrelevant, as that company <i>clearly</i> meets an inclusion standard, <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, based on the second word of its article (<i>NASDAQ</i>). Also, if there are other non-notable coffee houses with articles, instead of those being a reason to keep this article, consideration must be made as to whether those should be deleted as well (i.e, "two wrongs don't make a right"). --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 04:29, 1 April 2006 (UTC) <small>(Cross-post from my talk page.)</small></li>

<li>Thank you Khoikhoi. Point well made. Not being a chain is a very good RFD and this should have been the only point voted on. Claims of being "non-noteable", or "advertising" or my favorite "vanspamvertisment" are invalid.

<li><b>Keep</b> Message boards are suitable for Wikipedia. Joe Kiser is insane.Stunnaman2k5</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> InsideCarolina's message boards are notably influential at the school and often are referenced elsewhere. In fact, a very high selling book (To Hate Like This is to be Happy Forever) spends a great deal of time talking about the goings-on at the IC forums, and it makes sense to have an entry for people to reference. 24.163.67.42 01:20, 31 March 2006 (UTC) Scott O</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>Inside Carolina isn't a "normal" message board. I don't know of any other message boards that have been alluded to in such publications as Sports Illustrated, "To Hate Like This...", etc. IC is a great message board with a rich history. There is no reason for this entry to get deleted. It is merely a collection of articles from IC's beloved fanbase.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Goheelsduksux (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goheelsduksux_a63c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goheelsduksux">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> IC is probably beyond a message board, and is an online community. Members share a common interest in University of North Carolina and the virtual community provides unique experiences and connections. Beyond the avatars are real people, sharing their wit, wisdom, opinions, dumbness, humor, and emotions. IC has been referenced in books and in the media. Wikipedia entry could be very useful in explaining to newcomers and the rest of the world (1) what is in Roy's little finger, (2) who "I'm Stephanie, my name is Stephanie", (3) the legend of Manhattan Heel, (4) the correct spelling of dook, and (5) that Tar Heel must be two words (don't even ask). brewguru</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I'm very sorry Proto, but regardless of your opinion of the nomination, this AfD will remain open until there is a consensus or five days are up, whereupon it shall be closed by a closing admin, not us. I do agree that this is a troll magnet, but the article itself is rather inflammatory.

<li>Do not Delete. Well if you so called researchers did your "jobsworths" jobs properly you would find out who Mr Kerley M.B.E really was and would not disclaim his name with these wild and absurd fallacys that you provide. This seems like another goose attempt of sabatoge on the behalf of the working man and therefore provide basis of your right wing sympathies and other connections. Therefore i would glady appreicate that you leave articles on that have meaning to people who like to appreicate pears and not delete because you never thought of it first. After reading many of your "edits", i find them flawed and half truths. Do not insult my superior knowledge on history and other events. For instance when did the Roman Empire end? exactly.</li>

<li>In response to your reply, i find it nothing more than liberal spin and it shows the true colours of this clique which seems to have inflitrated the Wikipedia, i once loved and knew. As none of you are from the area of concern, you would not understand the importance and influence Mr Kerley M.B.E has had on his local society in the Education and Technological sectors, instead of pen pushing your liberal "polices of conduct", do some proper research and you will see why so many people, especially St.Helens regard him as their "finest son". For one personally i feel that the attack on my page is very biast and unneccesary, it is some hidden agenda to remove me from this site. The information i have posted since i joined has been factual and i feel hurt that my information has not been accepted. Therefore it comes to this sad conclusion that i may have to retire and join my good friends Walter Smith 0.B.E and Archie Knox in creating Fylespedia.</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> - if one wants an encyclopedia one shall resort to britannica et al. Wikipedia will never resemble those, no matter how hard one individual tries. One can deduce the cause of this with simple logic. On the other hand the same reason enables it to have far greater virtues.&#160;:Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia.

The <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_layout_engines_%28DOM%29_dea7.html" title="Comparison of layout engines (DOM)">Comparison of layout engines (DOM)</a> article is a table, and last I knew it table data had a place in encyclopedias, regardless of whether some editors see it as jargon or not. --Heyseuss 03:16, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Sandstein is wrong. This is <i>not</i> a manual, but a comparison table. The article, with its siblings comparing CSS-support, HTML and XHTML supoort, etc, is informative, referenced to and talked about on the Inernet, and very useful. Even Encyclopedias can contain specialised information. Read Encyclopedia Brittanica's articles about quantum physics and you'll see. The article also cites relevant sources, and is not OR. ANd it's definately not a copyright violation. It's a summary of the information available in the sources.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>speedy keep</b></p>
<p><br />
I feel that this article is generally describing any mu* on the internet and see no reason for a special entry on it, especially with all the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Talk%7EMedievia_a12b.html" title="Talk:Medievia">controversy</a> surrounding the whole thing. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearstar_4e67.html" title="User:Tearstar">Tearstar</a> 17:58, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Medievia is fairly large as MUDs go, and if anything, the controversy only makes it more notable. If any MUD deserves an article, this one does. <a href="../../../e/h/h/User%7EEhheh_6717.html" title="User:Ehheh">Ehheh</a> 18:21, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Medievia is a very significant MUD. It ranks #4 over at The Mud Connector <a href="http://www.mudconnect.com/cgi-bin/all_rankings.cgi" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mudconnect.com/cgi-bin/all_rankings.cgi" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> and has its own version of ZMUD <a href="http://forums.zuggsoft.com/index.php?page=4&amp;action=file&amp;file_id=67" class="external autonumber" title="http://forums.zuggsoft.com/index.php?page=4&amp;action=file&amp;file_id=67" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>. The controversy is just another reason why this MUD deserves an article. Its case is significant for the copyright precedent it could have on thousands of other similar games. --<a href="../../../h/e/t/User%7EHetar_0d92.html" title="User:Hetar">Hetar</a> 19:45, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> as above. For great justice. 20:49, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: I second the "keep" votes above and, in fact, feel that the article's discussion of the license violation controversy should be expanded, and given greater prominence. I must also question the user Tearstar's motives in listing this article for deletion. A cursory look at his/her list of contributions reveals that he/she has contributed to a couple of MUD related articles, namely Sancara and Legends of Cosrin. "Tearstar", in fact, appears to maintain a website related to the latter. Therefore, "Tearstar" appears to hold contradictory views on the subject of Wikipedia entries for MUDs, unless his/her opinions have radically changed in the last few weeks. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETraumerei_be75.html" title="User:Traumerei">Traumerei</a> 02:19, 1 April 2006 (UTC).</li>

<hr />
My opinions are not biased, I feel that this mud <b>should</b> deserve an article, I personally feel that it <b>is</b> a notable <a href="../../../m/u/d/MUD_b442.html" title="MUD">MUD</a>, however my problem is the details of the article are very much the same as every other <a href="../../../m/u/d/MUD_b442.html" title="MUD">MUD</a>, I could copy this entire article and use it for every other <a href="../../../m/u/d/MUD_b442.html" title="MUD">MUD</a> that is out there. My reason for commenting/modifying/monitoring mud articles is because of my deep knowledge of many muds they are what i spend all my time doing. (I have played Cosrin for about 8 years) but I feel that if this article is to be included, then it should have some <i>major</i> points of inclusion, not simply <i>how to play a mud</i> or describing every other mud. If there is nothing of note <i>other than the controversy</i> then I feel it should be removed or somehow listed under <a href="../../../m/u/d/MUD_b442.html" title="MUD">MUD</a>, but if someone would like to reformat it, tell us why it should have it's own article, then I would have no problem with it existing, but the article in and of itself needs to tell readers more than what a <b>general mud</b> is. And the criteria it would fall under <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> would be <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> which I do understand is not policy yet, but proposed <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearstar_4e67.html" title="User:Tearstar">Tearstar</a> 07:04, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> is proposed policy; I personally don't apply policies that have not been generally accepted... to me they are meaningless. It is content delivered over the internet, and <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is the closest policy to apply, though I guess "another MUD with no distinguishing characteristic from any other MUD and no evidence of external notability" would work too.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 03:46, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Tearstar, I believe your comments lack merit. Your statement that you could clone this article to describe any other MUD makes little sense; for instance, there aren't several other MUDs with large playerbases that are also guilty of blatant license violations. Looking at the Legends of Cosrin and Sancara articles, I see nothing particularly unique about those either, they read like advertisements for those games in fact (which is not permissible under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>). The <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medievia.html" title="Medievia">Medievia</a> article, while certainly lacking in polish, does collate several important critiques of the game, as well as an overview. If you felt that the article needed improvement, you should've added to the Talk page discussion, rather than indulge in this seemingly trollish attempt to subvert the Wikipedia deletion process. If you feel the article deserves to exist, but doesn't meet Wikipedia's quality standards, well there's already a process for that, and the article had been tagged to reflect that. I look upon this article, in addition to an overview of the MUD, as the kernel of a case study in software license violations, and a general example of how, on occasion, the Free Software community is unable to enforce software licenses due to the cost of litigation. I'd welcome expansion of the article in that direction from qualified contributors.<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETraumerei_be75.html" title="User:Traumerei">Traumerei</a> 05:01, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a very poor article and needs to be cleaned up in many different ways. Currently the whole article is about how it's based on Merc, with some discussion about how it was claimed to have been "completely rewritten". It leaves out that it was "completely rewritten" multiple times, and generally downplays the significance of any opposition to what Michael Krause says. Since this is an articles for deletion thing, notability is enough for a Keep vote. The content of the article does need to be fixed up, but AfD is not the process for it. --<a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtari2600tim_3d4d.html" title="User:Atari2600tim">Atari2600tim</a> (<a href="../../../a/t/a/User_talk%7EAtari2600tim_ebaa.html" title="User talk:Atari2600tim">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Atari2600tim_7b9a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Atari2600tim">contribs</a>) 13:14, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is definately a page worth keeping, I googled "define: cleaveland steamer" after my friend said that he did it to his girlfriend (who he loves and respects) and all I got was this. Without this page I (and many others) would have remained ignorant to the meaning of this disguisting act, and may have used the term unwittingly and been made a complete ass of. It should, however, be preempted with a warning that it contains offensive content and should not be viewed by people who do not wish to be exposed to it. Deleting a term that is so commonly used based on the fact that it is not sourced is ridiculous, I mean who is going to do scholarly research on something like this? Personally, after reading about it I knew I had to run out and try it and it was awesome. Without this article I would have never discovered my fecophilia <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.110.26.195 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.110.26.195_233a.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.110.26.195">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li>I agree that ideally there should be some way of warning people who *really* don't want to see this kind of stuff, but then whose criteria would we follow? Wikipedia is not supposed to be censored, and it could be the thin end of a very large wedge. Probably better to categorise appropriately and let others develop their own solutions. <a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFourohfour_c17e.html" title="User:Fourohfour">Fourohfour</a> 11:47, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> "I mean who is going to do scholarly research on something like this?" That's part of the problem and part of why it should be deleted. Some people evidently get their jollies out of inventing fictional sex acts and creating names for those acts, and then inventing fictional variations thereon and names for those variations... but <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day</a>. Is the Cleveland Steamer real, and are the variations on it real? There's no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> way of knowing that from the article, which is full of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">unsourced claims and speculation</a>. Actual practices that are actually used, that are preferably documented by sex researchers is what is desireable for an encyclopedia.

<li>It might be worth your not looking at it from a strictly academic standpoint. It's possible no one's actually performed the Cleveland Steamer. It doesn't mean that the concept didn't make the rounds in, say, a song by platinum music group <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenacious_D_32dd.html" title="Tenacious D">Tenacious D</a> or in an <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/eb/Orders/2003/FCC-03-71A1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.fcc.gov/eb/Orders/2003/FCC-03-71A1.html" rel="nofollow">official FCC government document</a>. The <i>concept</i> may be false, but the usage of the term is absolutely real and encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 14:07, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> If the unsourced claims in the introduction and the unsourced variations can be pared down to what can be sourced through popular culture references, maybe the article could be kept.

<li>Obviously, original research should be discouraged. My point is that the issue for this article in particular isn't that it should be deleted, but rather that it should be cleaned up. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 14:38, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Note that the reference in the government document is nothing more than its presence in a quoted television transcript that the FCC considers obscenity.

<li>I just fixed the article, removing everything I couldn't verify. My reliable source is some guy named Adam that I met at Dartmouth College in 1992. Somehow, I don't think that's how a Wikipedia article is supposed to be written. If <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> applies, however, then I should be able to reap the benefits of that view as well and do whatever I want with <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_steamer.html" title="Cleveland steamer">Cleveland steamer</a>. My facetious little point is that you can't have it both ways. If you're going to claim that WP:IAR applies and allows you to keep the steamer, then I can say that it also applies to me and I can edit it, merge it, or redirect it however I see fit without approval from anyone. If this indeed is the consensus, that WP:IAR applies, I'll be happy to withdraw the nomination and just merge and redirect as the spirit moves me. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G.

<li>That is one way of looking at it. I'm not sure how much leeway ArbCom or an admin would give you if you got into a post-AfD edit war by using IAR (which may be your point). As it stands, I am not thrilled with the inclusion of this sort of stuff on AfD, but consensus is pretty clear thusfar, and part of the manner that AfD (and frankly any semi/quasi/pseudo-judicial body) gains credibility is a respect for consensus and precendent. At AfD, we interpret if a given article is consistent with inclusion guidelines or, if no guidelines are explicitly set, past consensus on AfD. This debate should be moved over to a centralized discussion to establish notability guidelines for ths sort of article (where we would likely be on the same side). That is where we legislate guidelines, this is where we follow through with consistency. That being said, your latest stub version is a vast improvement, as sometimes the best edit is a mass-deletion. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican"><i><font color="blue">young</font></i><font color="#CFB53B">american</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../y/o/u/User_talk%7EYoungamerican_2059.html" title="User talk:Youngamerican">talk</a>)</small> 01:47, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I assure you, I have no intention of violating <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. I was just making a <i>rhetorical</i> point. I would like to see all these sexual urban legends moved to a single page where content could be carefully monitored to prevent vandalism, <i>ad hoc</i> neologisms, and endless lists of frivolous "pop culture references." I really don't see the encyclopedic value in noting every time the Dirty Sanchez is mentioned in teen movies and cartoons. Some people, probably mostly children, think that these "sex moves" are the funniest thing they've ever heard of, and seem to want to share this kind of thing with anyone they can. Maybe this sort of humor serves the purpose of alleviating anxiety about sexual activity. Maybe writing articles like this one gives the author the same kind of thrill as writing an obscene message in a public place. I don't know. I could write pages on why this kind of article hurts the Wikipedia project, but AfD isn't the place. I agree that there probably should be a centralized discussion on sexual slang articles. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G. Crawford">Brian G.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Can you please clarify how making a <i>rhetorical</i> point doesn't violate <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>? In addition, whilst I agree that there are too many cases in Wikipedia of "In film Y, X was mentioned", this applies to *many* articles. I've said this elsewhere, but I believe you're focussing on articles for things you dislike personally (which I believe is reflected in your comments above and some others). Regarding this and related AfDs, you make some valid points and I'm quite happy to agree with you in principle on them (regardless of your opinion of me which is irrelevant for the purpose of this discussion). However, I believe you're being very selective about the sort of articles you apply the rules to; very stringent regarding the verifiability rules and quite willing to delete material for this article. At the same time, you practically disregard <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. <a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFourohfour_c17e.html" title="User:Fourohfour">Fourohfour</a> 12:01, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - static grass really is a tool used by wargamers to make realistic surfaces. You can find a relatively large number of refs searching for 'wargaming' and 'static grass'. For great justice. 20:46, 31 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think we pretty much know it's a real tool. The better question here is, how widely is it used? Is it written about in the media? Even cruft-media? Is it a big enough deal to merit its own article rather than a redirect into, say, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wargaming.html" title="Wargaming">Wargaming</a>? - <font color="blue"><strong><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">the.crazy.russian</a> <a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">τ</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crzrussian_5348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crzrussian">ç</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">ë</a></strong></font></li>

I would agree with <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> that the article is lacking context, and is barely more than a dictionary definition at the moment. Whilst I would agree that static grass is clearly real, I'm not convinced it's something sufficiently notable to merit an encyclopedia article in it's own right (correct me if I'm wrong, but it's never got much potential to become anything other than a few lines worth of definition). However, someone looking up Static grass on WP should see something, and thus a merge and redirect could see the defintion remain in place. <sub>└</sub><sup><b><a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a></b></sup>/<sub><i><a href="../../../u/k/p/User_talk%7EUkPaolo_332d.html" title="User talk:UkPaolo">talk</a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup> 19:45, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

(Is peace-building PoV?) Anyway, even if you find sources for this stuff (not much sources here!), and remove the things, you're left with short list of stuff that's not really article-worthy, and possibly not even merge-worthy.

<li><b>Keep</b> It's a useful summary of many of the disputed terms. Arguments about these terms exist within and across many articles. It's good to draw them all together. As the Free Software terms mostly originate with Richard Stallman, they're easily referenced with the FSF or GNU web sites. The Open Source Software terms can be seen on the Open Source Inititive site. Common terms can be compared with google hits.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I will not bother to be anything but blunt here: these accusations are ridiculous and reflect nothing more than a personal resentment certain users have against me following previous disagreements. This article was <b>not created in response to the article Serbophobia</b>: An original link to it had been created in mid-January, long before I had gotten involved in the matter. It is <b>not a neologism</b>: it does not refer to any newly created word but is a simple NPOV title that adequately describes a social phenomenon that is very much alive and real in the Balkans today. Futhermore, it is definitely <b>not original research</b>: it does not create primary sources, but is a case of "research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources", which, according to wikipeda guidelines, is "strongly encouraged." All the key information in the article is referenced with credible sources (BBC, Human Rights Watch, etc.), and the evidence I have presented and the quality of the work I have done are, I believe, this article's best defense. I resent the allegations made about my supposedly "ad hominem" intent (I had honestly requested User:Dado's assistance because of his calm and rational approach to constructing quality articles on similar subjects, and he has responded positively) as well as accusations that I have engaged in an edit war (On the article in question, I have repeatedly asked the opposing side to discuss matters on the talk page and cite their sources, to no avail). This is a subject that any objective observer will agree has a place on Wikipedia (see precedent of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Japanese_sentiment_ca49.html" title="Anti-Japanese sentiment">Anti-Japanese sentiment</a>) and shows promise of one day becoming a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_article_3e1a.html" title="Wikipedia:Good article">good article</a>. Should this article be deleted from Wikipedia?

You are ignoring the tentative cooperation already being exhibited between users of various ethnic backgrounds, as well as the fact that the article is even now in its embryonic stages of higher quality than Serbophobia. Absolutely nothing bad has happened to this article so far, and I feel like you're shooting it down without even giving it a proper chance.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well, the article references a variety of credible sources, ranging from European Union institutions to the Human Rights Watch, so could you please explain how the article is inherently POV? And if this article is inherently POV, then why are similar articles such as Anti-Japanese sentiment considered perfectly fine (never even being listed for deletion)? <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 01:33, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> how can there be anti-Bosniak sentiment when hardly anyone in the world even knows what "Bosniaks" are? Serbophobia is entirely different because it can be argued that it exists due to many people having a negative view of Serbs after the Serbs made international news throughout much of the 90's because of the Balkan wars. Furthermore, "anti-Bosniak sentiment" returns 2 (two) hits in google, and one of them is from Wikipedia. A paragraph about it in "Bosnian nationalism" might be acceptable, but I don't really see the point of a separate article about it. Besides, the examples of "anti-Bosniak sentiment" given in the article (ie vandalism of mosques, grafiti saying "death to Islam", etc) seem more like examples of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> than Bosniakophobia. Btw <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> is also being nominated for deletion. <a href="../../../e/d/r/User%7EEdrigu_1cf2.html" title="User:Edrigu">Edrigu</a> 15:20, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Yet again, the google search is irrelevent because the name of the article is not a specific term (as is "Serbophobia") but a NPOV title to describe a social phenomenon of encyclopedic value. Also: why does a phenomenon have to be internationally notable to warrant an article on wikipedia? Thousands of perfectly fine topics exist on various subjects that are relatively unknown outside of certain parts of the world. Anti-Bosniak sentiment exists and is quite visible in the West Balkans, and thus deserves a place on wikipedia. Furthermore, your analysis of the examples cited in the article completely misses the point. Religion and ethnicity are closely interwined in the Balkans, and Islamophobic expressions are simply compounded on top of existing ethnic prejudices (as noted in the report for the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia). This is why there are many instances of "Islamophobic" expression towards Turks and Albanians in Greece, while the country is simultaneously supportive of Palestine in the middle-eastern conflict. Is it fair to describe such things as mere Islamophobia when they are specifically targeted at one ethnicity? I don't think so. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 17:52, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I hate to get involved in a side-argument, but I have to point out that there is a <b>BIG</b> difference between "Anti-Serb Sentiment" and "Serbophobia". The very title of the "phobia" article is inherently POV, and if this article was named "Bosniakophobia" instead then I'd be voting to delete it. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 18:53, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I have to say, I disagree. I still remember, here in the UK, how when Jill Dando was killed, all the papers were going on about it was "the evil Serbs who did it". There are many other examples in the press. Even today, I still get nasty faces if I say I'm going on holiday to Serbia. In the case of Britain, the so-called Journalism of Attachment, is very much to blame for this "phobia" (not in the clinical sense, of course...)

<p><b>Delete</b> If you search, or know about it, you'll know fansites like this on RuneScape have always been deleted by afd. This is yet another fansite which doesn't deserve anything more than a link at the bottom of the page. A few months back an article about runehq was deleted. It was done well and didn't read like an advert. Runehq is arguably much better than this webiste (traffic and guides) and it got deleted therefore, I feel this should be deleted as well. Also another reason I feel it should be deleted is that even the moderators of the site think this is not needed. <a href="http://runescape.salmoneus.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=29884&amp;pid=341297&amp;st=20&amp;#entry341297" class="external text" title="http://runescape.salmoneus.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=29884&amp;pid=341297&amp;st=20&amp;#entry341297" rel="nofollow">here</a> <a href="../../../j/2E/j/User%7EJ.J.Sagnella_6796.html" title="User:J.J.Sagnella">J.J.Sagnella</a> 22:21, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Sagnella, I don't see why you're so interested in seeing that this article gets deleted. Any ulterior motives? Well, I don't think that this article is the same as the previous ones on RuneScape Community and RHQ. RSC and RHQ's articles were stubs that barely had any content in them besides unshameful promotion of their respective websites. This article contains factual information that is potentially useful to many people. If you feel that it's written simply to promote the site, I am sorry to have to say that it is of my opinion that you are mistaken. As proof of that, any links, biased opinions, or whatnot may be cleaned up to comply with Wikipedia's policies. <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDissentor_91cc.html" title="User:Dissentor">Dissentor</a> 22:40, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'll put it this way. Sal's Realm is by no means the best RuneScape fansite.

<li>First of all, define how you rate a fansite as the best or not. What are you using to judge how good or bad a fansite is? I am not saying that Sal's Realm is the best fansite; however, it seems that you came to the conclusion that Sal's Realm is not the best fansite without any supporting information. If other fansites would have to have their own articles to make it equal, by all means, let them be written, as long as they're not partisan pieces of nothing but how great they are and how much other fansites are worse than their's. And as for that being a waste of Wikipedia space, I'm fairly sure you're not paying monthly server costs or anything of that sort. If you think that this article is a waste of space, please do say so in a more succinct manner and I'll spend some time finding articles that have been allowed that are even more useless than this one.</li>

<dd>This brings me nicely on to the key reason as to why this should get deleted. A few months back an article about runehq was deleted. It was done well and didn't read like an advert. Runehq is arguably much better than this webiste (traffic and guides) and it got deleted therefore, I feel this should be deleted as well. Also another reason I feel it should be deleted is that even the moderators of the site think this is not needed. <a href="http://runescape.salmoneus.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=29884&amp;pid=341297&amp;st=20&amp;#entry341297" class="external text" title="http://runescape.salmoneus.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=29884&amp;pid=341297&amp;st=20&amp;#entry341297" rel="nofollow">here</a> <a href="../../../j/2E/j/User%7EJ.J.Sagnella_6796.html" title="User:J.J.Sagnella">J.J.Sagnella</a> 21:06, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't think that traffic and guides are what make a fansite better or worse. I believe that it is the community that truly defines the fansite and what it's about. As for RuneHQ's article getting deleted, if I was around for the discussion, I would've most definitely supported its existance. If it is a well-written article, not biased, and completely factual, then I believe that it would be in Wikipedia's best interest to keep it. That's why the deletionist mantra doesn't make any sense to me. Wikipedia wants to grow, then why throw out articles that aren't tabloids in nature, serve a purpose, are of interest to some, and are not harmful/hatred in nature?</li>

<li><b>Conditional delete</b> The article contains some strong statements ("The book marked a turning point in the discussion on the subject of Neoplatonism"; "The book is considered a cornerstone to dialog between the different scholars in the field of philosophy"). If these claims can be supported by reputable citations — which should not be hard if they are true — the book is clearly notable. Lacking such citations, the article does not establish notability. I must add that the section <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoplatonism_and_Gnosticism_2a63.html#Current_developments" title="Neoplatonism and Gnosticism">Current developments</a> appears somewhat speculative and unsupported, possible presenting original research or a particular point of view. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 00:05, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> This article falls into a common trap that a lot of Wiki articles fall into: The Table of Contents approach to writing.

<dd>An editor is in the process of doing this for this article. They are a student, I believe, and works on it as time permits.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Even if wiki is offering book reviews (this was listed as a topic rather than book review) the article is lacking organization. On the conditional delete comment, I happen to know most of the scholars whose work comprise this book. I wouldn't dispute that this is a turning point, but this is overemphasized (in comparison to the other work in the neoplatonic scholars community). Much work has been done on this topic since 1984. If this article is kept, it only makes sense to review *all* of the ISNS and APS works connecting neoplatonism with other topics (most published by SUNY, more recent works published by University Press of the South), as well as the works lead by John Turner (U Nebraska), Universite Laval, and Society of Biblical Literature on gnosticism. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 20:52, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This article has cost me considerable time and effort and I have been able to have it submitted for peer review by a known member of the International Neoplatonic society. The professor (Professor Moore) has a seat and who is very close to his doctoriate can add a great deal of credibility to wikipedia. Professor Moore has already reviewed the article and stated it was fine. I can forward the email to the admins here if need be. Please tell me why posters on here would rather not discuss these things with me directly. The staff of admins at Wikipedia (who are obviously overwhelmed) seem to be able to find time. Why can not other people. Learning is a process by which one is challenged. Unlike some articles and posters, this article is about the field of study it is so named and this book is the only solidly authoritarian source of the subject. Please post if you guys know any others (pretty please with cherries on top). Unlike some posters who use new age groups to prop up their made up interruption of greek history, words, works and culture. I am doing my best to give the article legitimacy. I believe in wikipedia and I believe that charlatans work can not will not stand up to peer review. I am doing what I can to have the article be about the field of study and to give wikipedia (alittle bit at a time) the type of foundation that states the information is backed up scholars in the respective fields so mentioned in the article. I appreciate all those who have stated that article should stay. I would like to express not only dismay at the disruptive conduct displayed in the request to have the article DELETED rather then reworked, by people who may not have a knowledge of the scholars who work make up the book and conference. Let alone what the book actually states. <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveMonkey_2979.html" title="User:LoveMonkey">LoveMonkey</a> 14:41, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>On my original statement that the article should be deleted, I will concede that it is an important topic, and should be kept as a topic, but that it should not maintain the format of a book review of one source. As close colleague of Dr. Moore, I do not think he actually looked at the article on wikipedia but a section that you sent him through email. He did not understand the structure and purpose of wiki. We personally talked about this two weeks ago and he never visited this site.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> My recent edits have made that option unnecessary. The book now takes up a significant section of the article, but plenty of room is left for other related discussions. An amalgamated article seems the best route to take, since some agents believe that the book was not noteworthy, and so would surely demand the book's article be deleted once the split were to occur. Besides, the material which is there on the conference does address issues which are of distinct and direct significance to the general topic. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">Lucidish</a> 19:32, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Agree with Lucidish. I suggest we develop the already existing article so that it can include the additional information that Zeusnoos has provided and also include the conference that the book covers and be inclusive to current events. And I graciously request the well connected Zeusnoos to contribute. As I request you Goethean to the contribute to the article as well. The better and more researched the subject matter the better wikipedia. I would like to see Zeusnoos and Goethean publically collaborate. As I would be honored to collaborate with someone as was well researched and up to current developements in the fields of Neoplatonicism and Gnosticism as Zeusnoos appears to be. Zeusnoos appears to be an excellent asset to wikipedia.&#160;:)</li>

<p>While cleaning, I encountered some problematic statements. One was the claim that the death of Socrates is the reason for the taciturn nature of the Academy. This is conjecture and Socrates was dead long before Plato started the Academy. The more plausible reason is that Plato valued the spoken word rather than the written. He didn't want the dialectic movements to be transfered outside of the context of dialogue with students and codified as doctrine.</p>
<p>Secondly, everything beginning with the paragraph "The Neoplatonic movement (though Plotinus" should be excised unless the link between neoplatonism and gnosticism is worked in somehow. It's off topic.</p>
<p>Thirdly, when you refer to the philsophers of academy (this section is suppose to summarize the conference findings, btw, and does not seem to do so) which incarnation of the Academy do you mean? The Academy during Plato's time and that during Carneades's or Antiochus's times were very, very different in scope and aims.</p>

<p>First of all let me state-Zeusnoos YOU ARE AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME. Thank you. You and Lucidish are of the finest persons. As for your points I concede that there are differences in the academy as Plato probably dispised pedantry. That makes it wrong to make sweeping generalizations like I did. As has been stated my articulation is poor. I apologize. But as it has been said the richness of work lies in collaboration. I am deeply appreciative of the most excellent editing and work you have done. AAAAAAHHH could I get you to take alittle peek at <a href="../../../p/l/o/Plotinus.html" title="Plotinus">Plotinus</a> Zeusnoos please&#160;::). My contributions there could use just a tiny bit of your excellent touch. <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveMonkey_2979.html" title="User:LoveMonkey">LoveMonkey</a> 01:43, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, I am the original creator of the article. Please take time to read the article's discussion page to view <b>the original afd that was done in July 2004 - the vote then was to keep.</b> If you read it you will see that the voters engaged in a very long and detailed discussion. Moreover, I have also noticed that the article is about 20% of the size that it once was and this appears to be entirely due to pov editing. For an example of how detailed the article once was, check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticisms_of_Charismatic_and_Pentecostal_belief&amp;oldid=13602204" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticisms_of_Charismatic_and_Pentecostal_belief&amp;oldid=13602204" rel="nofollow">10 May 2005 entry</a>. Additionally, I never once used the phrase "critics accuse" or "critics argue" as the current article does. <b>If you examine the history you will see a much fuller, better written, more balanced and more detailed article.</b> --<a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Salient_Oversight_dc71.html" title="User:One Salient Oversight">One Salient Oversight</a> 13:31, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><i>Strong</i> Delete</b>, pointless. Who cares?

<li><b>Keep</b> -- If wikipedia allows naruto's lame powers to have their own pages there is no reason why this is inconsistent with that. Quite frankly I am sick of Wikipedia acting like there is information that shouldn't be on wikipedia. Because of this I will remain identified by my IP alone. --206.191.28.13 03:01, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
