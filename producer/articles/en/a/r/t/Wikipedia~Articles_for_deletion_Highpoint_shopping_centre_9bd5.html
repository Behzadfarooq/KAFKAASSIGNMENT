<li><b>Keep</b>. It is a very large shopping centre indeed and is almost a suburb of Melbourne in its own right. We have thousands of articles for places, centres etc that are smaller and less significant than this Shopping Centre.

<li>I am far too busy to hunt up stuff, particularly since I think internet sources are not what we need. This Shopping Centre has become a focal point. Many shops have been attracted to the area close to the centre. The cinema is taking trade away from those in the traditional centres and may have forced some of those to close. The swimming pool in Footscray is not to be re-opened because one is going to be built at Highpoint. Its affect on the community of the western suburbs is large. I do not think Shopping Centres are necessarily notable. This one however is. Can any other Melburnians give some cites? --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 05:14, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Google hits alone do not verify notability, especially for something related to shopping. I was looking for a phone cable earlier today.

<li>Thanks for the correction. I still think that keeping malls that don't have coverage by independent sources would be a very bad precedent, though, so I still feel strongly that it should be deleted. The notability guidelines are as much to keep cruft out as to keep us from having articles that are hard or impossible to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a>, and a lack of independent sources definitely indicates that it will be difficult to write anything of encyclopedic interest in this case. The article as written contains nothing of note that is worth saying so much that we need an article. Their official site does the job of saying what it is much better than this article does, so the only purpose the current article serves is to be a directory entry. Without indepenent coverage, this article just can't be more than a hollow profile with a traffic-driving link. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 00:08, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I wouldn't keep every shopping center, but one with over 400 stores (if verifiable) is certainly notable. Also must be notable as a large business in the area with this type of income. <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAKAF_4851.html" title="User:AKAF">AKAF</a> 15:06, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comments</b>. It is one of only 5 Super regional Shopping Centres in Victoria. See [<a href="http://www.findnearest.com.au/superregionals.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findnearest.com.au/superregionals.asp" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>]. It is the third largest Shopping Centre in Victoria - see <a href="http://www.maribyrnong.vic.gov.au/Page/Page.asp?Page_Id=1753" class="external text" title="http://www.maribyrnong.vic.gov.au/Page/Page.asp?Page_Id=1753" rel="nofollow">the local Council's Plan</a>. Super Regionals have more than 85,000 sq m of lettable area. There are only 22 in Australia. <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/Business/GPT-to-acquire-50-of-Highpoint/2006/03/20/1142703253870.html" class="external text" title="http://www.smh.com.au/news/Business/GPT-to-acquire-50-of-Highpoint/2006/03/20/1142703253870.html" rel="nofollow">this news item</a> shows that a company was buying a 50% share of it for $621.2 million (Australian dollars). That link from a reputable newspaper gives the quote "which has approximately 400 specialty stores" which is at least close to verifying that number. This is a notable Shopping Centre but we need to find a reference to the effect it has had on the economy of the Western suburbs of Melbourne. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 00:49, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Can you please provide a verifiable third-party reference, which confirms this notability? I reviewed Bduke's news item, but the only thing asserting notability was what appeared to be a self-promotional quote. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 18:23, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Is'nt being a Super Regional Shopping Centre and the 3rd largest in Victoria good enough for you, or do you want to delete all articles on Shopping Centres? The sources for these are independant of the Shopping centre itself. Is'nt the Sydney Morning Herald and the local Council good enough? What criteria would you use to keep an article on a Shopping Centre in your neck of the woods? Australian Wikipedians are telling you it very large and notable. We have been there. Reporting on a place is hardly original research. I have been there frequently. It is 10 times larger than another Shopping Centre in Western Melbourne which has not been deleted although a "prod" was put it on in June. It is the largest shopping centre I have been in. I live in the area that has been affected by the building of it. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 21:23, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
