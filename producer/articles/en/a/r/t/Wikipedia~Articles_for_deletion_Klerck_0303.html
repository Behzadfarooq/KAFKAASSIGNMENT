<p>Whow, a troll trolling wikipedia even after his real life suicide. That's something new. Personally, I think he is not notable, and should be <b>deleted</b>. There are about 20 google hits for <i>Klerck "Kevin Ealy"</i>, most on shacknews, the site he trolled. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">Chris 73</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_73_0282.html" title="User talk:Chris 73">Talk</a> 06:34, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actually think this is potentiall interesting - he may have been a troll - but is there any documented case of someone posting a suicide note online before? --212.95.227.168 13:53, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Entry Klerck should not be deleted because klerck was probably the most prolfic and famous troll ever, and not always as "klerck", and not just one site. Entry should be expanded. I suspect more info about him will come out over the next few weeks as the whole story is pieced together. --66.56.219.6</li>

<li>Based on my interpretation of <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a>, Troll-related is not valid grounds for deletion. <a href="../../../e/d/o/User%7EEdogy_ea37.html" title="User:Edogy">Edogy</a> 21:42, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, ok, also not notable. And one of the things Wikipedia specifically is not is a memorial. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 15:14, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So what does it take to be a notable troll? He caused Slashdot, a notable website, to change the way it handled comments. The GNAA wishes they could do the same. He even went beyond the internet, driving Tolkien fans to gibbering insanity with his obviously tounge-in-cheek Two Towers petition. Reguarding the memorial claims... I hope we VfD the entry of every person who just died and has his entry expanded. Quite often people are not properly recognized for their significance until after they're gone. I don't think klerck's entry as it currently is written seems like a memorial. To NOT mention the fact that he died would be unencyclopedic. Unfortunately, the circumstances surrounding his death, particularly the initially wide-spread perception that klerck's last entry was false, are a by-product of his notariety as a troll. This could cause a treatment of his past trolling activity to appear to be some sort of memorial, I suppose. <a href="../../../e/d/o/User%7EEdogy_ea37.html" title="User:Edogy">Edogy</a> 01:15, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I would just like to add that I feel if wikipedia has an article on the Gay Nigger Association of America, a massive trolling organization that klerck often spoofed, and <a href="../../../g/g/_/GG_Allin_ce18.html" title="GG Allin">GG Allin</a>, the infamous, inflamatory punk rock icon, then klerck definately would be a reasonable candidate for an article. Klerck has been linked to in the Page widening article since 2002, but only recently has anyone created an article about him. 66.56.219.6 00:49, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC) Edit: Changed my vote to how it should be properly expressed, I think? 66.56.219.6 01:43, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC) Hi.

<li>Entirely true, sir, as I said below. I've read many a wikipedia article, but only started learning the ways of editing and such when I saw klerck was on VfD.

<li><b>Keep</b>, I did not know Kevin, and do not belong to the troll community. I submit that his final LiveJournal entry by itself (and a tangential response by one of the people he addresses) is quite interesting. It provides insight to a specific online culture that exists (whether you agree with it or not) and also provokes thought about suicide itself. Also, there was teenager that overdosed on drugs and died while in an internet chatroom. I do not have the time to dig up the quite stale links right now as this happened a couple of years (at least) ago. I suspect that there may be other instances of internet witnessed death/suicide. As more people use the internet, this may happen increasingly. This can be attended to in a scholarly fashion without becoming "troll-centric" that can provide enlightenment about suicide/internet culture. Such treatment done right would be valuable. Is that not what wikipedia is trying to accomplish? eclectro

<li><b>No vote</b>. This seems awfully close to just a "memorial" page, although maybe borderline notable. I could imagine an article worth having, so I can't bring myself to vote "delete"; on the other hand, I just can't make myself say "keep", either. I'm also a little queasy about publicizing someone mostly known for a geek-ish suicide. This really seems a bit like lobbying for another spectacular, self-inflicted death. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 08:21, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As a friend of klerck, we had discussed making an entry for him before his death, this is not a memorial. Atleast in the scope of the internet, he was a very important and influential person, whether or not anybody was ever aware of it.--Jaypeeh 18:31, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b> and expand. If it's true about <i>The Two Towers</i> thing, I remember that going around and being covered in the media at the time. Also it's a fair point about the <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livejournal.html" title="Livejournal">LJ</a> thing, I don't know if it has been done before but even if it's only a recent phenomenon then it could be interesting link in the <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_note.html" title="Suicide note">suicide note</a> article. <b>Comment</b> - though Jmabel's point about publicity is fair, though *shrug* maybe if someone posts their note on their LJ then someone might see it and help?
