<p>Contains speculation, original research, non-encyclopedic, makes many claims not atributable to anyone. It was originally an article called "The Dirty Dozen" which was a made up term nobody uses and gives no sources for such a term. It also violates guidelines for living persons. Also uses weasel words. It also not a person, place, thing, or specific event requiring an entry into an encyclopedia. It is also redundant, and serves no purpose. It is basically an article for original research. <a href="../../../j/f/r/User%7EJfrascencio_b8e0.html" title="User:Jfrascencio">Jfrascencio</a> 01:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Delete but allow recreation</b> Keep but clean-up</s> Valid topic, obviously, but poorly handled.

<li><b>Keep</b> Reading the talk page, this series of articles evolved from a single article on human rights in Iraq; a decision was made to split them up. It would probably be a bad idea to merge them back against the wishes of the editors. The POV of the article could certainly use improvement; a comparison of human rights in SH's Iraq to rights in other Arab/Muslim countries of the time might be instructive, for instance. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 19:36, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> These are good points, but even though there are obvious chronological reasons to split the topmost article this way, it also results in a quasi-POV fork, with the pro-invasion group editing this article and the anti-invasion group the other, both seeking to prove their convictions correct. -- <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 09:08, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The rightness or wrongness of the U.S. invasion isn't going to rest on human rights violations (other factors are involved: whether the invasion works in accomplishing various goals, whether the costs outweigh the benefits or vice versa, whether the invasion had to be done to stop Saddam's regime from using or getting WMDs or being or becoming a base for terrorists -- all sorts of reasons were given by Bush and others for the war; even bringing democracy to Iraq isn't quite the same issue as how bad the human rights record there was). And there's nothing inherently POV-forkish about separating the vast subject of Iraqi human rights violations into regime periods, since the situation obviously changed with different regimes: Before Saddam human rights were in various states; during Saddam's regime that regime was responsible for a certain level of human rights; after Saddam responsibility shifted elsewhere. The subject naturally divides that way. There is no inherent contradiction in one article describing the Saddam regime's human rights record and articles that describe human rights before or after, and no benefit to combining them that I can see. There is, without a doubt, plenty of sourceable information out there. The subject of the article is too important to delete. Too bad it hasn't been cared for better. The best argument for deleting, to my mind, is that the article shows no promise of being well-edited, despite it's importance and appropriateness.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 16:21, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> there's nothing irrepairable here and the subject is both noteworthy and sourceable (and any comparison of Saddam's regime with any other regime in the Middle East would show just how evil he was, with hundreds of thousands murdered). <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 01:23, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>He was certainly no Boy Scout, but compare for instance the violent suppression of revolt in Syria (involving thousands of deaths), the actions of the army in the Algerian civil war in the 90s, Morocco's actions in the Western Sahara, Turkey's behavior in Turkish Kurdistan, and so on. Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator, but his actions occurred in an area of the world where Western-style human rights are not generally respected, and it is fairly common for governments to use force, sometimes brutal force, to suppress opposition, especially from minority populations. We should view him in context. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 05:15, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Speculation, original research, -- It is merely the collection of published accounts, as with all good WP articles. Calling it speculation seems POV.</dd>
<dd>"non-encyclopedic" also POV -- its a subject of general interest about which factual material can be found.</dd>
<dd>'"makes many claims not atributable to anyone" -- Yes, section 1 does need specific sources for every allegation. But they are finadable, so not a reason for deletion.</dd>
<dd>"It was originally an article called "The Dirty Dozen" which was a made up term nobody uses and gives no sources for such a term." It fgives the sources, and any number of news stories could be added.
<dl>
<dd>It mentions a book about <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dirty_Dozen_f3bb.html" title="The Dirty Dozen">"The Dirty Dozen"</a>, which then became a movie, which has nothing to do with Iraq. When referring to Iraq (Iraq's Dirty Dozen), the source of the term is U.S. officials. Just because certain national officials use a term, doesn't mean there should be an article about (i.e. The Imperialist Regime, see no article about it) --<a href="../../../j/f/r/User%7EJfrascencio_b8e0.html" title="User:Jfrascencio">Jfrascencio</a> 00:16, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"It also violates guidelines for living persons." Sourced reports on major newsworthy criminals are not BLP violations--but agreed, it does need sources.</dd>
<dd>" Also uses weasel words." Thats about the opposite of the previous reason.</dd>
<dd>" It also not a person, place, thing, or specific event requiring an entry into an encyclopedia. " Another way of saying nonencyclopedic, and I think almost everyone would say just the opposite. That other parties in iraq may have continued some such practices is no reason to exclude this part of the story.</dd>
<dd>"It is also redundant," apparently meaning the subject is treated elsewhere. But a collected article of this sort makes sense.</dd>
<dd>"and serves no purpose. It is basically an article for original research" All said before, and all wrong.</dd>

<p>That said, I think it is an outrageously unsourced article for a topic such as this, and there's a lot to be deleted from it. Eds. who workecd on an article on such a topic should try to make it really solid. Thats why I said "weak".
