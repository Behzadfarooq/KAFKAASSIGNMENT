<li><b>Delete</b>. There appears to be a debate at the <i>Lost</i> television series forums and blogs (where its current claim of notability is allegedly asserted) whether or not this band ever existed. Nearly <i>all</i> online sources appear to agree that it actually never did, and that in fact the production mistook a certain band named Geronimo Black for some reason. Thus there is no real reason to keep an article that seems to assume otherwise. - <i><b><a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhaedriel_2584.html" title="User:Phaedriel"><font style="color:#22AA00;">Phædriel</font></a></b></i> <font style="color:navy;">♥</font> <i><sup><a href="../../../p/h/a/User_talk%7EPhaedriel_a4cd.html" title="User talk:Phaedriel"><font style="color:#22AA00;">tell me</font></a></sup></i> - 01:08, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You raise an interesting point. I was considering changing my vote until I read your last sentence. What do you mean "I am willing to take extreme measures to keep it"?

<li>I am saying that to delete this article would be a grave mistake, &amp; am emphasing just how fiercely I believe this. Part of my zeal for this article is out of surprise that no one else until this moment has spoken up in defense of it -- even an article that said it was a fictional band &amp; never existed outside of Lost would justify the article's existence. (However, this morning I discovered a web page about this group &amp; added it to the article, so I'd say that either it <i>did</i> exist or is a noteable hoax by the creators of Lost.) In short, had I a "save this article" chit as a long-time contributor to Wikipedia (or any credibility), I would spend it on this article. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 16:52, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>even an article that said it was a fictional band &amp; never existed outside of Lost would justify the article's existence</i> -- that's where you and most everyone else here disagrees. As for that link you added, there's no <i>there</i> there. As I noted on the article's talk page, domain registrant information suggests that this is just another hoax website set up by ABC or some enterprising fan. If that's what it is, it deserves a brief mention in a couple of the Lost articles, just like the rest of the hoax sites. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 16:55, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Baronyx, I assume you'd rather delete this article instead of trying to rewrite it into acceptible form? If this article is deleted, &amp; later events prove that either the group did exist, or it was important to the plot of <i>Lost</i>, it will be more difficult to recreate this article than you may think. According to current practice, deleting this article means it goes away with little or no chance of recreation. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 22:04, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's also incorrect. If this band suddenly becomes an important plot point in the show or otherwise notable, there's nothing stopping anyone from recreating it.

<li><b>Comment</b>: There's no acceptable form for an article like this, with virtually no verifiable content and non-notability besides a less than 20s scene on <i>Lost</i>. What can it be reduced to? One unexpandable line. That's like saying we should have left the page <a href="../../../5/4/0/540.html" title="540">540</a> when its sole contents were (4+8+15+16+23+42)*5. It won't be difficult to recreate the article... notice the page <a href="../../../4/_/8/4_8_15_16_23_42.html" title="4 8 15 16 23 42">4 8 15 16 23 42</a> which was resurrected recently, and instead of being deleted this time, is headed to a redirect. I'm most certainly not opposed to having this page resurrected should the band one day prove pivotal. But, the situation with <i>Lost</i> cruft has gotten beyond reasonable limits, and I'm of the opinion that these types of pages are an embarrassment and discouragement to those who diligently work on the <i>Lost</i> articles. As editors, it is our responsibility to hold Wikipedia to a higher standard of quality in the information we present. We've just deleted the article on the "security system", for example, because of its hefty OR and unverifiability. Will there possibly be a page on the "security system" when the show is done? Sure thing. But just because the "security system" may one day have its own page does not mean that we have to have any old poor quality page that gets made now. There's just not enough on the "security system" to merit an encyclopedic article under Wikipedia policies and guidelines. The same applies to this "band": it may very well be that this is critical to the future of the show (which, note is speculation)... but what may one day be is not an excuse for retaining a substandard article that lowers the quality of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaryonyx_f960.html" title="User:Baryonyx">Baryonyx</a> 06:02, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b>. Does not even merit discussion -- this is a hoax page. There is no band "Geronimo Jackson" which ever topped the charts in August 1978 (See this <a href="http://www.webfitz.com/lyrics/Charts/1978/Ch197808.html" class="external text" title="http://www.webfitz.com/lyrics/Charts/1978/Ch197808.html" rel="nofollow">Canadian chart list for August 19, 1978</a>)-- it was created for LOST, likely based on an actual band from 1972, "Geronimo Black," formed by a member of Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention. (Incidentally, check out the <a href="http://www.raindesert.com/rd_cd_menu/geronimo_black/geronimo_black.html" class="external text" title="http://www.raindesert.com/rd_cd_menu/geronimo_black/geronimo_black.html" rel="nofollow">fourth song on the real album</a>.)—<a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">LeFlyman</a> 17:24, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: This article isn't being advocated for deletion merely because its a fictional band. It is advocated for deletion as non-notable, unverifiable, originally researched cruft material, mentioned for a few seconds in a single episode. There's a rather obvious difference between being a factual, accurate article on a recurring fictional character and a made-up article of a very minor fictional reference, IMHO. As for DriveShaft, I don't think it should be an article, either, even if it is Charlie's band. However, it has more accurate content derived from the show itself, and a more central role to a main character, so the argument for that band's inclusion has stronger footing than this one's.<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaryonyx_f960.html" title="User:Baryonyx">Baryonyx</a> 18:05, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>To clarify: prior to your revising it, the content of the article was made-up (i.e. a hoax) about a fictional band; hence it was a "meta-hoax". The material didn't even refer to the fan-hoax <a href="http://www.geronimo-jackson.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.geronimo-jackson.com/" rel="nofollow">recently registered Web site</a>.
