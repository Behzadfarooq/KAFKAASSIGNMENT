<li><b>Delete</b> Article fails to assert <a href="../../../_/_/_/WP%7E_f74a.html" title="WP:">notability</a>, fails the <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">attribution policy</a> and reasons cited by nom. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 17:51, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Easily passes the primary criterion of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>: "A person is notable if he or she has been the subject of secondary sources that are reliable, intellectually independent, and independent of the subject." (No use even addressing <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a> since it is apparently being eliminated-- 4 points of notability have been removed within about a month-- any point she may pass there today may be gone tomorrow). Multiple magazine layouts, multiple magazine covers, multiple video appearances. Clearly an article on a celebrity, not a vanity page. To use "Notability" to delete articles on celebrities, rather than vanity pages, is an abuse of the term. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 18:33, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Models are not independant of the magazines they appear in. The models work for the magazine. <a href="../../../e/p/b/User%7EEpbr123_cec0.html" title="User:Epbr123">Epbr123</a> 19:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This argument is absurd. Are actors independent of the films they appear in? They are studio employees. Are you planning a deletion campaign on film next? Why do you refuse to deal constructively with whatever it is that is bothering you? Why are you intentionally disrupting Wikipedia with <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> AfDs? You have made over a dozen of these over the past few day, few of which are justifiable, and no doubt several of them will be deleted because editors do not have time improve each article or even to respond to each AfD before it closes. If you were really concerned about notability and sourcing, you would put a source-tag on the article, as I did with your still insufficiently sourced stub yesterday. Instead you continue to disrupt Wikipedia by wasting editor's time. You don't even put any thought into your responses at these AfDs, you just paste the same nonsense. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 19:30, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think you need to review the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notability guidline</a>. There is nothing in this article that asserts she is any diffrent than the tens of thousands of other porographic performers. Even if it did claim so does this article meet the <b>mandatory</b> policy of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">attribution</a>? The obvious answer is no. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 19:36, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>If you think that mens-mags.com is a reliable source and that the "reliable source" is asserting notability by demonstrating that she has been in a porn mag "X" number of times...well then I don't know what else to say to you. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 19:51, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ah, the old "Any source on porn is unreliable if it and when mentions porn" argument... IMDB is perfectly fine for thousands of articles, but suddenly invalid if it covers a porn subject. mens-mags.com is not 'reliable' enough to prove a subject has appeared in men's mags. Scans of the model's picture on those men's mags is not 'reliable' evidence that she appeared in those men's mags, because they are men's mags... If that's the kind of reasoning you engage in, feel free to say nothing more to me. And I will return the favor. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 20:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This subject also has an article on <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deena_Duos" class="external text" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deena_Duos" rel="nofollow">Spanish Wikipedia</a>. Deleting a U.S. subject from English Wikipedia while it exists in another language? What's the <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>? <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 19:49, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So the existance of one policy violation is justification from additional violations? I would hope the point is that we want to keep this encyclopedia inline with its policies. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 19:51, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No. When an article on a minor U.S. celebrity is put up for deletion from the English Wikipedia, while it exists on non-English Wikipedias, the question of whether the English Wikpedia's policies are being abused to keep out certain subjects comes to mind. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 20:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The term "Notability" is <i>abused</i> when it is used to delete articles on minor celebrities. It should be used to keep out vanity pages. This subject is clearly a celebrity. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 19:54, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Clearly? Funny, the notability guidline for <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">porn actors</a> says otherwise. If you have a problem with the guildlines and policies of wikipedia then I suggest you take that issue up on their respective pages, not at an AfD discussion. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 19:56, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have no problem with Wikipedia policies, I have a problem when they are abused to waste editor's time, and to delete articles on subjects that some editors dislike. WP:PORN has lost half its "notability" criteria within about a month, so I go by <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> which this article clearly passes. The nominator has started stubs which are completely unsourced, yet frets about sourcing in over a dozen AfDs in the past few days. Something is obviously fishy here. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 20:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I've added five published interviews, an article, more magazine pictorials and covers. To clarify the IMDB reference: A listing at IMDB is not being used as proof of notability. Rather, like at hundreds of other film articles on Wikipedia, it is being used as a source. That source gives these published interviews, etc. Again, clearly notable. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 18:21, 22 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Interviews are primary sources and therefore cannot be used to establish notability. An article in a porn magazine is not independent source as the subject of the article is an employee of the magazine. Please read the notability guidelines. <a href="../../../e/p/b/User%7EEpbr123_cec0.html" title="User:Epbr123">Epbr123</a> 18:26, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
