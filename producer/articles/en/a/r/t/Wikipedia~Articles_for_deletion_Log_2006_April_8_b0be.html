<li><b>Keep</b>. If webcomics are notable enough to be on wikipedia at all, what's the reason to delete this one? Short time of existence? Whats the limit then - 6 months, year, 2 years?

<li><b>Comment</b>: No, I don't believe longevity equals notability at any point. If a garage band soldiers on for twenty years, they do not suddenly belong in an encyclopedia.

<dd>I understand that there is a formed block, and that this formed block is a recognizable pattern. Now I'll tell you why the Serbs and the Croats are voting keep, to allay any deep suspicions. There exists a very real possibility that to delete this kind of article is counter-productive. Inasfar as it is a "vanity" article, it ought to be restricted; but to delete it is to shove a wrench into the niche of Wikipedia which is kept open to such things from the Internet culture. Impose your criteria here, and you will be made to impose them over articles on every other website you can imagine, not to mention freeware programs. It seems to me -- and maybe I'm only highlighting my limited ability to understand the Internet and the people who inhabit here -- it seems to me that Wikipedia is in a special communion with the web society, and that Wikipedia is in debt with this communion to this society. --<a href="../../../v/k/o/User%7EVKokielov_dc04.html" title="User:VKokielov">VKokielov</a> 05:15, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As far as I can tell, this page is promotion for a marginal esoteric Buddhist group. A lot of the information on this page is accurate, but not specific to this group; rather, it is describing Chinese tantric Buddhism in general. A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=t5K&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=DELA%2CDELA%3A2006-01%2CDELA%3Aen&amp;q=%22Holy+Tantra+Jin-Gang-Dhyana+Buddhism%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=t5K&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=DELA%2CDELA%3A2006-01%2CDELA%3Aen&amp;q=%22Holy+Tantra+Jin-Gang-Dhyana+Buddhism%22" rel="nofollow">google search for "Holy Tantra Jin-Gang-Dhyana Buddhism"</a> turns up a couple official sites followed immediately by the Wikipedia article.

<li><b>Comment</b>. No vote from me, but just a couple things to consider. A google search for "中國漢傳密宗". Which is shown as the chinese name for the subject of the article yield considerably more results. However, I could be searching "cute kittens" for all I know. Also, does notability in the chinese speaking world make it notable in the english speaking world? Just some thoughts. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombride_57b0.html" title="User:Tombride">Tombride</a> 16:24, 8 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good point. "中國漢傳密宗" translates literally as "Chinese Han tradition (or transmission) esoteric (or secret) sect". It would be a bit labour-intensive for me to take a close look at the google results, but it's worth noting that the top hit is a userpage on the Chinese Wikipedia, followed by two official pages of this group. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>)</sup> 17:31, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's cause they are well-known <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek.html" title="Greek">Greek</a> models in the Greek fashion world and entertainment industry, many of them also used in music videos. Some have branched out into the international fashion world. You also can not say if a person is well-known or famous with a search you might do from a non Greek search engine. Perfect example, if you do a search on one of Greece's most famous actors as Θανάσσης Βέγγος, you only get three or four hits<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%CE%98%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%AC%CF%83%CF%83%CE%B7%CF%82+%CE%92%CE%AD%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%CE%98%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%AC%CF%83%CF%83%CE%B7%CF%82+%CE%92%CE%AD%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. When dealing with Greek names, you also have to take into consideration of the fact that the name can be spelled in numerous different ways and that pronunciation plays a big part of getting the correct hits when doing a search. ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 10 April 2006

<dd><b>Comment</b> I notice, by a remarkable coincidence, that it seems these well-known Greek models are all clients of the same modeling agency.

<dd>It is a coincidence since I've also listed models from various other agencies as well. But to answer your question, no, not at all, I have no association what so ever with any of the model agencies these people are associated it with. The reason why Ace Models is representing most of them is because <a href="http://www.acemodels.gr" class="external text" title="http://www.acemodels.gr" rel="nofollow">Ace Models</a> is one of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a> biggest model agencies and a partner for many fashion magazines found in Greece, as well as advertising agencies, film productions houses, leading fashion catalogues and fashion designers use their services. Plus many of their models are former Miss Greeces and have been branching out internationally. Here I ago again sounding like I'm adversting for them but I'm not, just trying to explain why Ace Models is representing most of them. The next agency I'm planning on posting model info from is another big one from Greece <a href="http://www.i-m.gr/#" class="external text" title="http://www.i-m.gr/#" rel="nofollow">IMAGE MANAGEMENT</a> which represents <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katerina_Georgiadou_6d25.html" title="Katerina Georgiadou">Katerina Georgiadou</a>. Besides I live in the States, they are from Greece....a)reason why my searches since they are done by non Greek search engines, such as yours, do not produce many results on their names. I do read/understand Greek though (aka magazines and other info pertaining towards the Greek pop culture) and own Greek satellite channels,in which these models as well as other Greek celebrities are featured on quite often.&#160;;) ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 11 April 2006

<dd>OK, if you don't like non-Greek search engines, show us a search on a Greek search engine that shows him as notable. Seriously, there are thousands of models who've done multiple magazines and ad campaigns. Does that make them notable? For the most part, no. There are a handful of models (mainly female) who become celebrities. The vast majority are unknown to everyone except the agencies that hire them. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 00:56, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't believe I said anywhere in my posts that I don't like non-Greek search engines. What i did say is, it is difficult to get hits from non Greek engines, since Greek names can be spelled in various ways including pronunciations which play a big part in the Greek language. As the example I gave above with Θανάσσης Βέγγος, one of Greece's most famous actors, where you only get three or four hits when searching for him with his name spelled that way, even with Greek search engines<a href="http://www.google.gr/search?hl=el&amp;q=%CE%98%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%AC%CF%83%CF%83%CE%B7%CF%82+%CE%92%CE%AD%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82&amp;btnG=%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%B6%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7+Google&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.gr/search?hl=el&amp;q=%CE%98%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%AC%CF%83%CF%83%CE%B7%CF%82+%CE%92%CE%AD%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82&amp;btnG=%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%B6%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7+Google&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 12 April 2006

<dd>You ducked the issue. Can you show us a search, in any language, on any search engine, that shows this guy to be notable? I've never heard of this Thanassis Veggos, but when I try the same search for Μελίνα Μερκούρη (Melina Mercouri) I get over 50,000 hits. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 00:30, 13 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I didn't duck the issue, the point is just because you didn't hear of them, or are not familiar with certain individuals, or don't get many hits on search engines, does not mean they are not popular or not well know in their native countries. I brought up Θανάσσης Βέγγος because being of the biggest Greek stars in Greek movie history, he is a perfect example of what is being debated here; you only get a few hits when typing in his name even though he was one of the biggest comedy actors in Greek movie history. BTW, Θανάσσης Βέγγος was a more well known star then even Μελίνα Μερκούρη was in Greece, even though Μελίνα Μερκούρη was more in the spotlight for international issues. So saying that you get such amount of hits from a search engines, does not amount much of anything. ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 13 April 2006</dd>

<dd>Well for one thing the guy is on the covers of Greek music CDs for the 2004 Olympics and a familiar face in the Greek fashion world, his more recognized then you would think. ~ So are we to understand that popularity of non English celeberties is based on how many hits a person's name gets on search engines and not how popular a person is in his/her native land? In that case I can prove that theory flawed with the Θανάσσης Βέγγος example I gave above. It is stated above that since Βέγγος name does not produce many hits, he must not be well known, unlike say Μελίνα Μερκούρη who gets over 50,000 hits. Well as Greek-American I can tell you with 100% certainty that if you ask any Greek person who Θανάσσης Βέγγος is they will know. Oh and BTW notice that the search done on his name here<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%CE%98%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%AC%CF%83%CF%83%CE%B7%CF%82+%CE%92%CE%AD%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%CE%98%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%AC%CF%83%CF%83%CE%B7%CF%82+%CE%92%CE%AD%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, does not produce any hits about the fact that a municipal theatre of Piraeus was named after him. Non-notable people do not get buildings named after them. So once more, saying that you get such amount of hits from a search engines does not amount to much of anything in regards to how popular an individual is in his/her homeland. ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 13 April 2006</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I am still waiting to see <u>any</u> sign that he is "popular in his native land." His picture is on a CD and in some magazines. Great. That means he's a working model. Can you offer any <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> at all that any number of people in Greece have ever heard of him? <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 15:18, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Can you offer any <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> at all that any number of people in Greece have <u>not</u> ever heard of him? As I said before just because you don't get 50,000 hits from search engines does not amount to how well known an individual is in his/her homeland. Case in point Βέγγος, one of the biggest Greek stars with only 3 search hits. You also forgot to add fashion shows, runways and presentation events to your list above. As for his popularity, you can find that out if you check out Greek magazines, the Greek fashion world and Greek tv pop culture. ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 13 April 2006

<dd>Please review the Wikipedia standard for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a>. "You can't prove he's <u>not</u> famous" does not count, and there's no rule that says the standards should be ignored for people who live in another country. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 16:15, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well that's a double standard if I ever heard one. So am I to understand that a person's popularity is based on how many hits he/she have on search engines? Because if that's the case then as proven above that is a flawed way of determining a person's popularity. ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 13 April 2006

<dd>Which I ask you again; is the standards of verifiability "popularity" due on the amount of hits an individual gets on his/her names? Cause I can include numerious famous Greeks who get only a few search hits but are well known to the Greek culture in general if that's the case...and to make it more interesting, I'll include all the spellings of their names or as many spellings as I'm familiar with. &#160;;) ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 13 April 2006

<dd>I've read the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> and I don't see anything in the rules which says that the popularity of an individual is based only on the number of hits he/she get on search engines....unless I'm missing something...? ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 13 April 2006</dd>

<dd>By the way, Veggos gets 9,000 hits on Greek Google if you spell his name correctly: Θανάσης Βέγγος. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 16:23, 13 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>BTW his name is also spelled Thanassis Vengos, Thanassis Veggos, Thanasis Vengos, Θανάση Βέγγος and Θανάση Βέγγο. Which points to what I said above and I quote: "When dealing with Greek names, you also have to take into consideration of the fact that the name can be spelled in numerous different ways and that pronunciation plays a big part on getting the correct hits when doing a search." By pronunciation I'm also talking about the τόνος. I've seen Kavadias in the Greek media that was talking about the male and female models used for the 2004 Olympics, mostly because it was made into such a big deal, the Olympics I'm talking about, spelled with two "v's", one "v", his first name as Alexander, Alekos, Aleko and Alex; Alekos written with a "w" and in other cases with a "o". ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 13 April 2006

<dd>My question still stands: is his "verification" on how popular he is solely based on the number of hits an individual gets on search engines, even if he/she are more talked about and noticed in media outlets, then search engines? ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 13 April 2006

Do you have some verification that he is being talked about in other media outlets? For lack of anything better, search engines are a good indication of whether somebody's being talked about, and it's the usual standard for inclusion.<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 19:40, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes I do, as mentioned previously, he has been featured in numerious Greek media outlets. As for the policies of wikipedia, I did read them and I didn't see anywhere where it says that a person's "verification" is based solely on how many search hits he/she gets on search engines. I did come across this though:</dd>

That reference really does mention "the kinky underwear problem," but the context—"In a class my frequent co-author taught at American University, this issue came to be known as 'the kinky underwear problem.'"—makes it a nonce word or neologism, not a real term in widespread use. The reference does talk about "mak[ing] consumption proposals anonymously."</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. While it seems that the article, in its current form, generates next to no hits on Google, it is possible that an economist might know this problem by a name other than either of the two mentioned. Perhaps the article should be mentioned somewhere where an economist could take a look at it and give it the proper name.

<dd>Justin, there wasn't so much a "convened panel of Wikipedians", as just two or three people talking about the article since March 22 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Danah_boyd&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Danah_boyd&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, which is a very different thing than the formal (and much more serious) Deletion Review process that's going on right now. Please, can you provide any proof about the Fox News appearance, like a link to her name on the Fox News site, or any other major press (CNN, MSNBC, BBC)? At the moment, I'm on the fence about her bio, but leaning towards "Delete", since the way that the bio is currently written, it reeks of a vanity article (please read the policies at <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a>). The article has been trying to claim that Danah is amazingly famous, but if she's so famous, how come there's nothing in the article about her being mentioned in major news sites? So far, the way things look, is that this article is just by a bunch of her friends trying to claim that she's well-known, but trust me, that does <i>not</i> go over well among seasoned Wikipedia editors. Also, the obvious sockpuppet/meatpuppet votes (see <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>) that are piling up below are not helping matters, since it's obvious to anyone who understands Wikipedia, that the votes are by newbie users, and as such are near meaningless. Unless some serious credible evidence can be provided that Danah is genuinely well-known, I am probably going to vote "delete", myself. Please please read <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> and provide some solid credible proof about danah's fame.

<li><b>Keep</b> danah is all over, so this seems silly to delete here at wikipedia. She is a leading authority about all sorts of social and internet topics, and there are people who want to look up here accomplishments and information about her. -- Mary Hodder 14:39, 11 April 2006 (<small>(First and only comment ever posted by User:128.111.166.190, 15:40, April 10, 2006</small>)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This can hardly count as a vanity page. boyd is a committed, articulate, insightful and prolific scholar and public intellectual on the topic of networked social communities.

<li><b>Keep</b> As the talk page shows, we went some rounds on this and figured that this is an interesting border case in terms of notability. I did some addition of relevant cites that I believe makes the case for her being notable and she definitely passes <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a> (which is a <i>proposed</i> policy). Of course, I think even danah would agree when I say Wikipedia would not be much of a different place without this article... but I could have sworn that the standard was to err on the side of inclusion for borderline notable cases. -- <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoebeone_7919.html" title="User:Joebeone">Joebeone</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoebeone_73bb.html" title="User talk:Joebeone">Talk</a>) 22:16, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i><b>Later:</b></i> I should be clear: I would hate to see that the fact that someone like myself, a friend and colleague, edited her article would lead to it being deleted. I can commit to not editing it, if that would help. I did some more poking around on Lexis and found at least one other news article from a major paper that is a profile of danah<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. Also, it might be the case that the article appears to be a vanity peace because of my recent edits where I tried to track down cites to investigate notability. As to some of Elonka's specific criticisms: The NYT profile isn't enough? What about the SF Chron profile I've linked to here (that I would add to her piece but it might increase the vanityness)? Also, it seems premature to claim sockpuppetry as no one has been accused of using alternative logins to edit this or other articles related to this issue, no? Granted, the fact that they are new to Wikipedia will affect the weight of their votes, as it usually does. I should also finally note that danah is friends with Jimmy Wales and even got him to speak here at our school (which I was fortunate enough to record) <a href="http://josephhall.org/nqb2/index.php/2005/11/03/jimbo" class="external autonumber" title="http://josephhall.org/nqb2/index.php/2005/11/03/jimbo" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>; if you download that mp3, the woman you hear introducing Jimbo before his talk is danah. -- <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoebeone_7919.html" title="User:Joebeone">Joebeone</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoebeone_73bb.html" title="User talk:Joebeone">Talk</a>) 22:50, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>A handful of paper and citations but not enough for me to think she qualifies under the professor test. Might qualify as a notable blogger. Passing mentions in newspapers and 5 minutes of fame on a popular TV show does not amount to squat. Being a friend of Jimbo does not qualify as notable. Lots of google hits. But when your first google hit begins "hi, this is me", you have to wonder about the quality of them. I'm not convinced she's not notable, but I am convinced the page does not establish notability. <b>Delete without prejudice</b> unless the article is trimmed to focus only on what is notable about her, and expanded to show what is notable about her - not just claim that she is. It should be obvious to the reader that she is notable, and why. What is her great contribution to the universe?

<li><b>Keep</b>. Danah's work is important and she is important in bringing systematic evidence to bear about MySpace. She is a featured speaker at conferences and the media. Indeed, I direct all media inquiries about MySpace to her. Given that she has good evidence, whereas others just talk, her work is both notable and important, and Wikipedia folks interested in MySpace would be well directed to her/it. Who cares if she is a PhD student or a 63-year p;d Harvard PhD (like me). Credentialism is a poor criterion. Danah IS important.

<li><b>comment</b>. We are currently experiencing a drought relating to La Nina - much of New Zealand is expected to have to start conserving power due to the low levels of this country's hydro-electric storage lakes (the lowest for about 15 years). Similar conditions hav also affected parts of Australia (mind you, some of Northern Territory's currently underwater). I doubt if the drought's widespread enough to be considered as a worldwide problem, but it's only partial nonsense, not complete bollocks this time. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 05:00, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

That is second because it's personal and not really of weight. <a href="../../../t/k/e/User%7ETKE_5ab7.html" title="User:TKE"><font color="maroon"><b>T</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/k/e/User_talk%7ETKE_bf64.html" title="User talk:TKE"><font color="gray"><b>K</b></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TKE_3c8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/TKE"><font color="maroon"><b>E</b></font></a> 05:41, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>IMHO, it would be notable and merit inclusion in the main article if one of the current or former execs had done something outside of the SSMU, such as one of them going on to become Prime Minister, or one of them having participated in the Olympics, for example. Something that merits them having a Wikipedia article on their own. As a list though, it's not important or encyclopedic. They can post that on their own website. <a href="../../../a/r/d/User_talk%7EArdenn_1d2f.html" title="User talk:Ardenn">Ardenn</a> 06:14, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

Subject of article may not among his major work, but even minor works by notable creator are generally treated as notable. Comic was published mostly pre-Internet, and apparently would meet 5K audience standard; TPBs still in print and sold by publisher. <a href="http://mupress.com/catalogpg02.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mupress.com/catalogpg02.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. Nominations like this are bad practice, and the resulting deletions damage the Wikipedia project. We have gotten to a cultural state where "Gee, I never heard of this" seems to be a good enough excuse to nominate something for deletion, RATHER THAN raising legitimate issues on the talk page first to see if anyone can help improve the article. In this case, the nominator should have said "Gee, I never heard of Keif Llama or Matt Howarth, and I looked in Google and found only n listings for the character, so I wonder if there's a problem here. Then, pop a note on the talk page. "Hey everybody, I don't know much about comics, but I never heard of this guy and had trouble verifying the information. It's probably my own lack of searching skills, so I wonder if anyone can help me out here.

Dickens' minor novels, Shakespeare's minor plays, hundreds if not thousands of albums minor albums from popular music artists all have entries.

If that article needs to be split it should be done by time period rather than "Christian opposition to anti-Semitism" and "Christian support of anti-Semitism" (please do not create that article). Much of the text has been copied wholesale from irreputable and biased websites. A merge seems like the reflexive choice, but any attempt wade through this swamp would be a nigthmare. The reason that it is "too long to merge" is that most of the text consists of lengthy quotations from "primary" sources rather than a simple statment of the facts.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> -Hello, I am the author of this article. It seems that there may be some confusion on this topic. This article is written from an objective point of view, or at least attempts to do so. It merely is listing the facts of Christian opposition to anti-Semitism. Isn't it a historical truth that some Christians opposed anti-Semitism? Then, shouldn't it have every right to have an article in wikipedia? The article Christianity and anti-Semitims chronicles many instances of anti-Semitism committed against the Jews. This article merely chronicles many instances of when Christians stood up for the Jews. It is based on good solid sources. Granted, some may claim that they are biased. But, can't you argue that about any source. If you don't like it, you can automatically label it as "biased." Frankly, ALL sources are biased in some manner, if you think my sources were biased, why don't you check the books out at the library and then see? Even if they were biased, the authors clearly did immense research on the subject and they did not summarily dismiss opposing evidence. In fact, they confronted it head on in much of the book.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, some of the sources are direct quotes, but that does not merit deletion. Quotes tell us exactly what the author said and that way there is no room for wrongful interpretation of the author's work. Furthermore, many of the early sections of the article are taken from official documents in which the original text was written in Latin. This is about as primary and non-biased a source as you can get! If you don't like the article that doesn't merit its deletion. I am open to suggestions and help in editing if you think there are ways to improve its content. I request that the article not be deleted. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewcrusade_d408.html" title="User:Newcrusade">Newcrusade</a> 03:09, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - This page is just a resource for those Internet trolls out there who want to scare/disgust other people with these shock sites. There is absolutely no need for this article to stay. I can't believe people are asking to keep this article; It's basically advertising vulgar photographs. I suppose anyone can make a shock site and use this article to "advertise" it. I strongly doubt anyone will come into the mishap of seeing these vulgar links if no one sees this page. I suppose the page that just defines a shock site is OK, but there is no need to post links to shock sites.

<p>I propose <b>Delete</b> on Jainism and Christianity (and Jainism and Judaism and Jainism and world religions).</p>
<p>Sorry for length of my proposal but there is some history to wade through!</p>
<p>There are also articles started by same original author on Jainism and Hinduism, <a href="../../../j/a/i/Jainism_and_Buddhism_5370.html" title="Jainism and Buddhism">Jainism and Buddhism</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/i/Jainism_and_Sikhism_c6bb.html" title="Jainism and Sikhism">Jainism and Sikhism</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/i/Jainism_and_Islam_3079.html" title="Jainism and Islam">Jainism and Islam</a>. I am not proposing deletion of these 4. The first 3 are going somewhere, and I've attempted a rewrite as a stub on the Islam artilce. We'll see what happens.</p>
<p>The Judaism article previously proposed for deletion (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jainism_and_Judaism_4156.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jainism and Judaism">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jainism and Judaism</a>). 7 votes - general consensus was that the topic was appropriate, that the original article was weak, and that the best way to proceed would be merging into a Jainism and world religions article. The Judaism article was ProDed 6 months later after no activity. I requested undeletion review (<a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> on April 6) - wish I hadn't!</p>
<p>Currently both the Christianity and Judaism are non-encyclopedic - essentially short essays (original research) by the original author trying to find parallels between the religions. Vegetarianism and Pacifism for Christianity. For Judaism a comparison between the sociology of Jains and Jews - small religions, hard working, family centred - with the only reference a single WSJ articles on the Amsterdam diamond markets.</p>
<p>Until the deletion of the Judaism article through the ProD process neither article was showing no signs of activity. I volunteered to combine the articles - which was the consensus from the origianl AfD discussion.</p>
<p>However, I've changed my mind. I don't think that the current material warrants a merge. My own efforts to find new materials has gone nowhere. The web has yielded little beyond a few notices of inter-faith dialogue meetings and Fundamentalist Christian critiques of Jainism. Given previous lack of activity and unsatisfactory current articles, then delete. If someone later wants to start again with stronger articles then fantastic! <a href="../../../c/j/e/User%7ECje_585e.html" title="User:Cje">Cje</a> 11:16, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, all the nom is saying is that the article is bad. If those other articles exist, why not this one? One could merge all of the Jainism and . . . into one big article called Comparisons and contrasts between Jainism and other worst religions.

<dd><b>Comment from nominator</b>. I started off with the view that "relation of Jainism to other religions is an important topic, why was the Judaism article ever deleted?" Now I am saying that not only are the two articles bad, but they are going nowhere after several months. My strong preference would be to delete them until someone has the commitment and knowledge to create good articles. If the articles survive this AfD then (on quality grounds) they will need to be edited down to sub-stubs until someone can provide encylopedic content. <a href="../../../c/j/e/User%7ECje_585e.html" title="User:Cje">Cje</a> 07:43, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

I am not of the opinion that this series is notable enough that individual articles are needed synopsizing every episode; however as I'm aware and as Henning Malkolm's comment suggests the consensus on this is not yet clear.

<li><b>Merge</b> I am of the opinion that view if any TV shows should have long individual episode summaries. This show is not notable enough to deserve this kind of in depth summary.

<p>dont delete- you guys all have a serious control freak personality.next you'll all probably want to delete the beatles or rolling stones page.and to answer your question, swinger_95, and alcatraz99 are different people, i use a shared computer.but what i really don't understand is how this page is any different to daniel case's, no ones ever heard of him, and yet his page still lasts...and why would someone be so proud of deleting peoples pages, that certain person must be very self obsessed...besides, what difference does one extra page on wikipedia make anyhow. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.213.30.4 (<a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.213.30.4.html" title="User talk:203.213.30.4">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.213.30.4_f3d0.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.213.30.4">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

"The Codex Series" is what a lot of the fans call "The Codex" because of its web address, so a seperate article is valid for purposes of clarification that it is NOT simply "The Codex."

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Yeah, I'm a fan. I don't have to spend a lot of time here to make points, do I? I agree with TKD's idea of merging it with Edgeworks, they hold a lot of the same info, but the fact remains that The Codex Series is something that is different from The Codex, and should be allowed to remain as a clarification page. When The Heretic starts it could hold comparisons between the series, connections and over-arching themes, it deserves its own article, although I suppose that could be held in The Codex Series's section of Edgeworks, if they were merged.

<dd><b>Second</b>. I like that idea, although I'd say if one had to go then The Codex Series should be a redirect to Edgeworks rather than Edgeworks being merged to here, since Edgeworks has a bit about The Codex Series that could serve the clarification function of this page. Tex Murphy 06:30, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not sure speifically which section you're referring to, but text could always be moved from one article to the other. My rationale for having <i>The Codex Series</i> as the "main" article is that there's not much to write about EE except in the context of <i>The Codex Series</i>. —&#160;<a href="../../../t/k/d/User%7ETKD_6306.html" title="User:TKD">TKD</a>::<a href="../../../t/k/d/User_talk%7ETKD_73cb.html" title="User talk:TKD">Talk</a> 03:28, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough. Its not fantastically important, I just figured that the reason for having a "The Codex Series" page would be to clarify about the distinction between that and "The Codex", but that distinction is made in the description of "The Codex Series" on the Edgeworks page, thus making its own page unnecessary. That way, Edgeworks, which is its own entity and idea, has its own page, and The Codex Series, which is really more of a point of clarification, is just a point of clarification on the Edgeworks page. You see what I mean? If someone searched for "The Codex Series" and found its blurb on the Edgeworks page, they would have found what they were looking for, but if someone searched for Edgeworks and found a page about The Codex Series, they would still be unsatisfied. Not to mention it leaves open room should they start another series in Edgeworks that doesn't fit into "The Codex Series": it could just be a new section of the Edgeworks page, but it wouldn't work on a "The Codex Series" page, you know? 68.181.241.78 05:24, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, any reader confusion could be resolved by a strong lead, too. It's not as if a redirect has to stay that way forever. <i>The Codex Series</i> was a redirect to <i>The Codex</i> until recently. Redirects from related terms occur all the time. And those redirects get turned into articles once the target article becomes too big or new information requires expansion. If Edgeworks does a second series, then the redirect could be eliminated. If the lead sentence of <i>The Codex Series</i> mentions that it's Edgeworks Enterntainment's machinima series, I think most people would probably realize why they were redirected.&#160;:) —&#160;<a href="../../../t/k/d/User%7ETKD_6306.html" title="User:TKD">TKD</a>::<a href="../../../t/k/d/User_talk%7ETKD_73cb.html" title="User talk:TKD">Talk</a> 06:40, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nowhere in this article is an assertion of notability, other than the fact that he was credited with the name of a famous general. That does not make one notable. Just like I know people with famous names, but I cant say theyre notable. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPal5017_9170.html" title="User:Pal5017">Pal5017</a> 18:39, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It says right in the article that he is the playwright who wrote the play <i><a href="../../../i/n/h/Inherit_the_Wind_c7f0.html" title="Inherit the Wind">Inherit the Wind</a></i> about the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scopes_Trial_c943.html" title="Scopes Trial">Scopes Trial</a>, which was later made into the famous film of the same name. I don't know how well-known his other works are, but he certainly looks notable to me. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 18:51, 8 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then I think his article should point that out, dont you? Point out that <i>Inherit the Wind</i> was so important so people will instantly recognize his notability.--<a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPal5017_9170.html" title="User:Pal5017">Pal5017</a> 18:56, 8 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Huh? The article on <i>Inherit the Wind</i> is linked - that says how important it was. We don't need to add notes on the importance of things in each connected article? It's like saying the article on John Lennon should say "He was a member of the Beatles, who were a very important band." Many - if not most - people would recognise the title of at least one of Lee's plays. That in itself should be an indication of their noteworthiness, and his. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 00:28, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Of course the article should be improved, but it's enough that it <i>can</i> be improved to keep it around. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 19:38, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Perhaps the article needs a rewrite more than a delete.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Hi, don't worry too much about the editing (the right way to do it would be something like: * '''Keep''' I created it, I'm sorry it was tasteless. ~~~~).

<dd>The article was not nominated for deletion because it lacked a neutral point of view. The reason I nominated for deletion, and seemingly the reason the above users have supported a deletion, is because the People Fisher site seems to lack notability. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and thus not every website is considered noteworthy. You may read the inclusion criteria for websites at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and if you feel that People Fisher meets these then feel free to amend the article asserting notability. Unless you are able to do this, and demonstrate notability of the content of the article, it seems unlikely that users will support keeping it, however well written it may be. The AfD discussion has still got a fair few days to run, in any case, so you've got time to edit the article as you see fit, just leave the AfD notice in place until the discussion ends. <sub>└</sub> <sup><b><a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a></b></sup>/<sub><i><a href="../../../u/k/p/User_talk%7EUkPaolo_332d.html" title="User talk:UkPaolo">talk</a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup> 16:12, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The standard for Wikipedia articles is that there are independent, verifiable sources quoted in the article that show the article is true. I have no reason to believe this article is untrue, but unless verfiable sources are provided it will likely be deleted. If as the article claims, there are many Human rights groups and Christian NGOs working to eliminate this practice I would expect there to be references to it (not necessarily via Google) that could be quoted in the article.

<li><b>Comment</b> The article says that the practice of "voodoosi" in Togo and Benin is the equivalent of "trokosi" in Ghana. However, from a number of sources like <a href="http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/v7i1/ghana.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/v7i1/ghana.htm" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> and the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trokosi.html" title="Trokosi">trokosi</a> article, it seems that the word "trokosi" is also used for this practice in Togo and Benin; I can't find any evidence for a different word being used in those countries. The word "voodoosi" doesn't turn up anything but a lot of hits in German, which seem to refer to voodoo practitioners in the New World. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 20:19, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> It is true that the practice, more technically known as ritual servitude, is very similar to trokosi in Ghana, so much so that when people from Ghana talk about it, they almost always use the word trokosi. This is because they are talking about it in terms with which they are familiar. However, if you go to Togo and Benin, you will find very few people who even know what trokosi is or have ever heard of it. If you ask them about voodoosi, though, you will get a different response and they will immediately respond. The campaign to eliminate this practice is well-established in Ghana but only beginning in Togo and Benin. An article that uses the term that is familiar in those countries will be very useful. That's why I think a separate entry rather than a mere redirect is necessary. Musoniki</li>

<p><b>Closer's notes</b><br />
The only argument raised in this debate was verifiability. Some people said that in the absence of sources, it should be deleted. Others said that it should be kept, unless no sources could be provided. Thus everyone was essentially advancing the same proposition.<br />
With this in mind, I found some sources which cite the books written by the subject, they are mentioned on <a href="../../../k/a/r/Talk%7EKarl_Drobnic_4687.html" title="Talk:Karl Drobnic">talk</a>. Since all concerns with the article have now been satisfied, the conclusion of the debate is to keep the article.</p>

<li>The information in the article is factual and unbiased. It is not a <i>vanity page</i> because it's purpose is not to promote the author nor the band.

<li>I truly appreciate the input from everyone involved. I believe democracy is the most logically evolved system for handling dispute. I'd rescind my effort and delete the article mylsef, but the simple fact that 2 out of 3 people who voted for deletion couldn't do so with conviction, and one "weak delete" voter went so far as to contradict his vote with "...perhaps this should be qualified," leads me to believe that the article really <i>does</i> stand out, meet the criteria and represent faithfully and neutrally the history of a musical group of which a significant number of people have taken notice.

<p>This is a very detailed minutia term for an implementation of a pokemon character, and I just don't see how it's encyclopedic. This might be a worthwhile entry in a wiki expressly about pokemon, but I don't think it should be here. This isn't even an official term used in any of the games, but is rather a neologism invented by the fan community, and it isn't even clear how accepted the term is amongst said community (I don't know, not being a part of said community.)

<li><b>Keep</b> This game has been around since the early 90s and has proven its longevity. I know from personal experience that the database is huge for this type of MUSH (hitting 400 mb) and users can expect to see around 25,000 objects. 'Dark Metal' has become a very well known name within the MUSH culture and spawned numerous recreations of the World of Darkness/Cyberpunk theme, and considering that it has been around for twice as long as MMORPGs such as <a href="../../../e/v/e/EverQuest_5a5e.html" title="EverQuest">EverQuest</a>, and other MU*s are included in wikipedia, I don't think it's a stretch to allow DarkMetal. <small>This comment was added by Bstaaden at 18:07, 10 April 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStifle_2330.html" title="User talk:Stifle">talk</a>) 00:50, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</small>

<p>Non-notable, IMO. If this organization is notable enough to warrent an article, than there are a number of other local mycological societies (notably, the Mycological Society of San Francisco) that warrant an article.

<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>merge</b>. I should first say that I have read the page, lest failure to have read the article should be ascribed to me by For great justice (as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_deletion&amp;curid=1003209&amp;diff=47846278&amp;oldid=47740576" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_deletion&amp;curid=1003209&amp;diff=47846278&amp;oldid=47740576" rel="nofollow">here</a>). In its present form, the article needs a bit of cleanup but surely is sourced and neutral. Assuming arguendo that the list is maintainable, it is nevertheless unencyclopedic; a list may comprise only facts and be wholly cited and sourced nevertheless be inappropriate for inclusion (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>). Even as this list does not merit its own article, it surely presents information that one might merge into extant <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game_controversy.html" title="Video game controversy">Video game controversy</a> article, which presently addresses only concerns relative to game content but surely could be expanded to note that deaths have been attributed to individuals' video game-playing. The occurrence of deaths attributable to video game-playing is notable; the names of those to have died is not, except where such names are provided only as ancillary to a broader theme. Our article on <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crocodile_attacks.html" title="Crocodile attacks">Crocodile attacks</a> is instructive here and may be compared to the video game article to illustrate best what is wrong with the instant article; notably, the article contains a list of deaths by crocodile as a section, just as the "video game controversy" article could contain the list of deaths as a section. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 20:39, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> So you are arguing that it should be expanded and renamed so that the list forms part of a broader article? For great justice. 20:45, 10 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Part of a broader article that already exists. In terms of expansion, I think surely there should be more information added as to scientific consensus apropos of the prospective harm of video games, but I think a recapitulation rather than recitation of this list is in order in the expanded section (the detail is exorbitant). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 20:54, 10 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK - I'm not sure that I agree that a broader article already exists, I presume you mean the controversy page, but I don't really think these deaths are controversial. It's just a list of deaths. Also, do you mean, merge, or delete? You can't have both for copyright reasons to do with the GFDL. For great justice. 21:05, 10 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, the controversy page probably should perhaps be renamed as a criticsm page; whatever the title, I do think this likely fits, inasmuch as the page really seems to be "why people don't think video games are good", where surely that they are thought to have caused deaths is appropriate. I do think one can suggest "merge" and "delete" here; we generally use that locution to mean that whatever information can be merged is inserted into another article, with the antecedent article then turned into a redirect to the new page, preserving the contribution history (although this is not done, per <a href="../../../m/m/_/WP%7EMM_1706.html" title="WP:MM">WP:MM</a>, exclusively for such preservation). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 21:14, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Then that's merge and redirect, not delete, which destroys the history. For great justice. 21:19, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, but see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Merge_and_delete" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Merge_and_delete" rel="nofollow">here</a>, where "merge and delete" is eventually understood to mean "merge and redirect"; that is, as I said, the sense in which I use it, and, in view of its having been the dominant formulation prior to early 2005 (if I understand correctly), the sense in which others use it. The reason that I think merge is appropriate is that the "controversy" article, even as it details normative objections to video games (e.g., that they impart "bad values"--whatever that means), also details medical (psychological and physiological) harms ostensibly following from video game use. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 23:09, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information). The "verifications" which are taking place are news articles and distraught parents. The fact that a news editor slaps a headline on an article that something was a "Video Game Death" in an attempt to sensationalize a story and sell some more papers does not, to me, seem to be a credible attribution. If there were a peer-reviewed study about the connection between particular video games and heart attacks, that study would be appropriate for the encyclopedia. This, however, is a mere list of events that are at best only loosely connected and in my opinion are more likely to be found to be completely unconnected. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 21:16, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This, I think, fairly well encapsulates my thinking; the list should not be a dominant feature of an article or even of a subsection of the "video game controversy" article. However, given that there have been instances of video game-playing induced illness or death, the topic is perhaps one that the "video game controversy" article needs to address, but primarily with respect to general cases and supposed causes (as in the crocodile article), rather than with respect to enumerated individual cases). It doesn't make sense to have a list like this without context or broader information, and so the article must either be deleted or, as is my preference, merged and expanded, such that it's not predominantly a list. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 23:09, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - In a rare moment of actually agreeing with User:For great justice., I've actually found this article quite interesting and reasonably well sourced. I've heard about incidents like the Legend of Mir stabbing and the crazy Korean cybercafe death marathons, and it's kind of a nice place to have all those. I do however have worries over the maintainability of this list as voiced in the article talk page. Puritan on the Moon Jack Thompson attritbutes every crime and death at the foot of the evil computer game empire, listing all the deaths he's attributed to computer games would totally wreck the point of this list. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 09:47, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> -- I regret that the nomination seems to have gotten off to a disorganized start, but that doesn't affect the content of the page. Were these people killed <b>by</b> video games? No, of course not. Did they die in a manner connected to video games? Quite possibly; but then perhaps several thousands have died while or shortly after playing a game. The connections cited are tenuous; cause-and-effect is not shown. It's quite possible, say, to read today's newspaper, stand up, and keel over dead from a stroke. Sensational media might decide to label this as a "news-induced death". All kinds of things <i>might</i> kill you, to stretch the point: mothers-in-law, fluorescent lighting, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barney_%26_Friends_bd26.html" title="Barney &amp; Friends">Barney</a>. My feeling is that any source making such claims automatically becomes unreliable. The weasel word "attributed" does nothing for the quality of the article; <i>anything</i> might be attributed by <i>somebody</i> to <i>something</i>.

<li>There seems to be a fair bit of bad feeling flying in multiple directions around this AfD, which is regrettable, and I hope people can come to terms with each other. I found the arguments presented here quite hard to follow. I did not, for example (after reading this page, the talk page, and Zero's talk page), fully understand precisely what Megaman Zero gave as deletion reasons, and some of the advocacies made by others I found hard to follow too. So I looked at the article and its sources and went back to first principles. I am not a fan of lists in general (if I had a tool to see how I've commented on various AfDs I think it would show mostly deletes for list related articles). However this seems more than <i>just</i> a list. I think the topic of <i>why</i> the media/people/relatives seem to hang stuff on video games is an important (and notable) one. But unless there is research out there already about <i>why</i>, writing an article on that topic would be original research, which we do not do. This list, though, shows that they do, and that's as close as we can get. With this article in existance, the encyclopedia is better than without it (that's the acid test, after all) because now interested readers can read and draw their own conclusions. <b>Keep</b> unless such an article on the phenomenon itself already exists (I could not find it in 20 seconds of trying), in which case merge to that article but in neither case is this a delete opinion. <font color="green">+</font>+<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 19:28, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> This also seems more-or-less to recapitulate my view (viz., that this should exist as an article rather than as a list), except that I imagine there must some legitimately-published and generally accepted scientific research on the subject, which should compose the majority of a prospective new article or section in an existing article. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 19:43, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Not a discriminate collection of information, most references have citations, new name is more apt. I see no reason not to keep (but if I'm missing something let me know). I don't believe the notability of the individual subjects has any bearing on this "compendium" article provided the information is verifiable. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 20:04, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I wasn't clear in my statement. I agree with you. I think it should be made into an article. Right now, it's worthless, but it could be worthwhile. Hence, I don't think it should be deleted, unlike some proposed deletions which could never be made into meritorious articles. Can't the article be retitled? Or does that require scratching this and creating a new one with the correct title? Edited to add: I just checked; this can be done via the "move" function. I believe then that the article as it stands now should be moved to Forbes 100 Most Powerful Women and then edited and expanded. <a href="../../../b/e/h/User%7EBehroozZ_e8a4.html" title="User:BehroozZ">BehroozZ</a> 02:15, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and expand</b> into a proper article. The list is notable, as is the source, but the list by itself, while not a copyvio as pointed out, could be seen as POV.
