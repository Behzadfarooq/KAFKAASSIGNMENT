<li><b>Argh!</b> Not another school article!! On the one hand, we all know that most schools are not really encyclopedic. On the other hand, my non-encyclopeic school has an intake of 300 pupils a year. It has been open for about 50 years. That means it has been significant to around 15 000 children. Each child has 2 parents: so that's around another 30 000 lives impacted on. Then there are teachers, support staff, neighbours, local businesses which support the school and so on and so on, so that, all told, my old school has probably had a "notable" impact on around 100 000 lives.

<li>A compromise would be a victory for school deletionists, just as a "compromise" to delete articles about countries with less than a million inhabitants would be a victory for people who thought that small countries are not encyclopedic. About two hundred school articles are added a week and almost none are deleted. It is obvious which way things are going. The only posssible resolution to the problem is for the school deletionists to give up this fruitless and time wasting campaign. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 16:06, 8 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, CalJW, a compromise is where all dissenting parties agree. There is no 'campaign', 'victory' or sides - it's not a war, and comments like yours do not help. The very loose (and very informal) compromise <i>was</i> heading towards 'high school articles kept, below high school not kept, unless particularly notable'. However, this soon got ignored. Which was a shame. An earlier suggestion was merging short school articles into an article on the educational district. Which also got ignored (again, a shame). <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Proto_c67f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Proto">c</a></small> 16:27, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>While I respect your opinion CalJW, it is inherently a totalitarian argument meant to stifle any dissent from those who don't share the ultra-inclusionist view. I can't fault the logic behind the unwillingness to compromise, but it essentially dooms wikipedia to an endless stream of AfD discussions about schools. If that means endless debate then so be it. I'd rather have an endless AfD debate (and hopefully a <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> one at that) about schools than an environment where dissention is silenced. And let me echo Proto... if people would bargin in good faith we could perhaps come to a consensus that would mollify the majority. --<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:31, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> What you are saying, CalJW, is in effect that the simple existence of a vocal group of people willing to vote consistently againt deletion of a class of article is a valid reason for that class of article to be kept in perpetuity, and further debate to be curtailed. How would you feel about a group of unsigned band inclusionists, for example? The school in question is a middle school, not a high school, and the inclusionist cabal [TINC] has not (as far as I kow) extended its coverage to such schools. And as it happens I went to a genuinely notable school (<a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Albans_School_%28St._Albans%29_42fa.html" title="St. Albans School (St. Albans)">St. Albans School (St. Albans)</a>) so I do find it perplexing that there are schoolw with much shorter histories and zero notable alumni which have *much* larger articles, 90% of which content is trivia - the removal of which trivia would, in most cases, leave "it's a school, it's in this town, it teaches the usual stuff.". - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub>&#160;:: <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 18:32, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think that I need to spend a bit more time clarifying my thoughts in my own head first and foremost.&#160;:) I think that I should remove "important infrastructure" and replace with historical and educational keystones of a community -- schools, libraries, and points of historical interest (unless the first two fall under this category as well). Now, I'm not suggesting that we go as far as the Elementary School level for articles, but I think that middle and high schools are noteworthy in their communities, just as libraries might be. Once again, my beliefs might be odd, but that's my opinion on the matter. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartin_Osterman_083d.html" title="User:Martin Osterman">Martin Osterman</a> 16:46, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

The PRISM Program has been very successful and almost eveyr single student that has come out of it has had a successful high school life, taking many AP Classes or taking IB and doing extremely well (as in top of the class) on all those classes. The PRISM Program has been very helpful to advanced and gifted students. Not only that, but PRISM is going to extend into high school, and a suggested high school program has been sent to Harvard and got a reply saying that the program was a very good idea and was a great college entry program.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The program consists of (in middle school) an extended math program into 11th grade (pre-calc), a 9th grade Honors Freshman composition/Philosophy/Ancient world studies class, and a 9th grade biology class (of course these highlights are for the 8th graders). Not only that, but the programs are more in depth than other schools; there is more discussing rather than reviewing the material. Those who go into high school from this program say they are BORED in AP classes, some even skip from 9th to 11th grade in high school.</p>
<p>The High school program extends the Math, English, and Social studies classes even further, and if it takes the AP path, will create a biotechnology class, along with other classes, just for the PRISM Students. In the IB path, the PRISM students take the IB program from 10th to 11th grade, and in the senior year in both paths, creates University of Washington classes, such as the "Social/Political/Economical/Ethical Case studies" program. I don't think this is exactly non-notable.</p>

Much information about the teachers aren't attacks, some of it is ACTUALLY TRUE, such as a teacher using a meterstick! <small>(<i>preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment by</i> 24.19.161.160 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.19.161.160.html" title="User talk:24.19.161.160">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.19.161.160_bd2f.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.19.161.160">contribs</a>) )</small>

<li>I read your long post, it is indeed a claim of notability and I'm sorry that people have ignored it. This is one reason why trying to judge schools on "notability" is not the way forward. Regarding the information about teachers, statements in wikipedia can't just be true, they also have to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> if anyone is likely to dispute them, so it's best to leave them out of the article. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 02:39, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Basically, <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> seems to believe Wikipedia should be a vast informational garbage dump, a sort of Special Olympics of Data where every factoid is on equal footing with every other factoid, where my <a href="http://www.mujionline.co.uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?Sec=1&amp;Sub=3&amp;PID=749" class="external text" title="http://www.mujionline.co.uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?Sec=1&amp;Sub=3&amp;PID=749" rel="nofollow">fountain pen</a> is on par with, say, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, and exact one-to-one reproduction of the world, without hierarchy, ranking, or levels of importance. <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jorge_Luis_Borges_2dc9.html" title="Jorge Luis Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a> wrote about people like him in <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_Exactitude_in_Science_1c7c.html" title="On Exactitude in Science">On Exactitude in Science</a> <a href="http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/bu/people/bs/borges.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/bu/people/bs/borges.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. <small>(<i>preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment by</i> <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> (<a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Calton_3261.html" title="Special:Contributions/Calton">contribs</a>) )</small>

<li>A <b>bit</b> unnnice? I find it outrageous that Kurt's comments about "deletionist vandalism" (which I do not really consider a personal attack) are excised from the page, but a back-handed insult calling him retarded is somehow allowed to stand. Incivility and personal attacks by "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles" are commonly allowed to stand across school AfDs while the self-appointed hall monitor cabal descends upon school inclusionists who lose their patience with castigation and threats of RfCs. In my opinion, it is partisan and unabashed partisanship.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 15:55, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I removed the personal attacks from all of Kurt's cut-and-paste votes and griped at him on his talk page. Aaron Brenneman (who voted delete in this AFD) just griped at Calton (who also voted delete). I've griped at Denni, Gateman, Trollderella, Kurt, and you. Heck, I even defended you personally when someone was griping at you for stumping up votes. Who, exactly, are you accusing of partisanship? - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Black</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 16:18, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we've all had days where we start editting things by rote and fail to notice other examples of what we're editting, so I'm willing to give A Man In Black a free pass for removing one personal attack and not any others.

<li>So according to Calton we are deleting things to provide wikipedia with hierarchy, ranking and levels of importance.
