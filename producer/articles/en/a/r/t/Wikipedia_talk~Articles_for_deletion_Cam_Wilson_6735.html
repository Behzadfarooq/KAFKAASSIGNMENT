However if it's reposted after a VfD voted "delete", <i>then</i> it merits a db-repost tag under CSD G4 and a deletedcontent tag on the deleted page to stop it being recreated.. What happens if, as seems likely with this article, it gets speedied due to an overwhelming consensus to speedy prior to the VfD period being up is worrying; does that count as a speedy (so db-repost doesn't apply) or a VfD delete (so db-repost does apply)? <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> &#160;| <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywalton_f58c.html" title="User talk:Tonywalton">Talk</a></small> 20:02, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>From <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a></b>:
<dl>
<dd><i>There are a few, limited cases where admins can delete Wikipedia pages "on sight" and without consensus at Wikipedia:Articles for Deletion or Wikipedia:Non-main namespace pages for deletion. Non-admins can ask for an admin to delete such a page, either by listing it on speedy deletions, or by adding a {{deletebecause|Reason}} or a {{Db-reason|Reason}}) header. The parameter Reason should indicate clearly why the page is a candidate for speedy deletion...</i></dd>
<dd><i>G4. A substantially identical copy, by any title, of <b>a page that was deleted according to the deletion policy</b>. This does <b>not</b> apply to content in userspace, <b>content that was speedily deleted</b>, or to content undeleted according to undeletion policy. Of course, other criteria than this one may still apply to such pages.</i></dd>

<dd>CSD are criteria allowing the deletion of articles by one single person (any admin or higher) without the participation of the wider community. If I understand it correctly, the G4 criterion specifies that some pages that have been deleted before may be deleted again on sight, by admins. If a page was previously voted off on AfD, and received the sanction of the community to be deleted, any attempt to recreate it (substantially similarly etc) can be seen as a refusal to abide by the decision of the community; G4 empowers admins to strike those attempts down.</dd>
<dd>Hence, any page that "was deleted according to the deletion policy" (ie. <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a>, ie. AfD) may be speedily deleted via G4 if someone attempts to recreate it again.</dd>
<dd>However, a page that was previously <i><b>speedied</b></i> was deleted solely through the judgement of <i>one</i> person — the deleting admin. It sounds to me like the second clause in sentence 2 of G4 is an attempt to ensure that no abuse of power takes place (indefinite speedies, as you put it). The page if recreated needs to be seen and judged by the community. Hence, "content that was speedily deleted" cannot again be speedily deleted via G4, even if it was "substantially identical" etc to the page an admin saw when it was first SD'd. That, in any case, is how I understand it. However, it does not take a legal expert to see that quite a few WP guidelines are very vaguely (sometimes even haphazardly) written, and continual improvement in this area will be welcome.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000066">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="red"><sup>ζ</sup></font></a>&#160; 21:17:01, 2005-09-01 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry, but <i>"The page if recreated needs to be seen and judged by the community"</i> is completely wrong. If an article is speedied validly (under A7, for example) and is recreated, it can happily be speedied again <b>under A7</b>. The existing criteria still apply, and these are what should be noted as the reason for deletion. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 23:26, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Aaron, I have a lot of respect for your work on WP and your opinions on policy that I've read elsewhere, but in this particular instance I disagree with you. The CSD rule under which a recreated article can be deleted is G4. That rule specifically disallows speedily deleting an article that was previously only speedily deleted. The clause does <i>not</i> say:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"[G4] does not apply to...content that was speedily deleted under all CSD except A7..."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It says:
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"[G4] does not apply to <b>content that was speedily deleted</b>..." Period.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>If we admit your interpretation, what precisely does this clause mean? I may be reading something wrong, Aaron, if so please point it out; but from where I'm standing I can't see that your interpretation works.</dd>
<dd>In any case, the current Cam Wilson article does not meet A7, as I noted <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html#VfD_vs._AfD" title="User talk:Encephalon">here</a>. It asserts notability.

<li>Thank you. I've re-read my commentary on the front page and there is an assertion I should have made more clear: I personally would not have put a speedy tag on this article, I would have sent it to VfD. I try to be cautious with speedies. On another note, this is the most agreeable dissent I've ever experienced over deletion! Everyone should have a biscuit! (I know I haven't your question above, but I will soon.)<br />
