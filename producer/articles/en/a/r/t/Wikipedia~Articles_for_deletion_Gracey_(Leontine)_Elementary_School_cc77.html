<li>Why do you feel the burning need to query everyone whose opinion differs from your own? Many people believe schools are inherently notable, and vote 'keep', irrespective of the quality of the article, the potential for improvement, or the possibility of that improvement. Coversely, many people (I am one of them) believe a school is four walls and a roof, actually take note of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, which suggests a school (particularly a ratty little stub) not encyclopaedic in itself. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Proto_c67f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Proto">c</a></small> 12:24, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

The fact that some kids get free lunch is hardly an encyclopaedic fact. Nor is that for three weeks, some classes were held in a nearby fairground. And without those two 'facts', the article is one sentence and three external links, which leads to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>.

<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a> does not directly relate to this stub.

Should there not be some reason for why this article should be deleted? There are numerous articles about grade schools specifically (i.e. Kathy Caraway Elementary School, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freetown_Elementary_School%2C_Massachusetts_0f79.html" title="Freetown Elementary School, Massachusetts">Freetown Elementary School, Massachusetts</a>, and many many more), why should this one be discriminated fromt he rest? Define what makes Wikipedia a directory and what makes it an encyclopedia. This decision seems pretty arbitrary considering the number of schools listed on Wikipedia with no inherent notability whatsoever. This article is, granted, liable for deletion as it is only a stub, but this is the only reason thus far. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteven_Kippel_21ee.html" title="User:Steven Kippel">Steven Kippel</a> 14:45, 26 September 2005 (PST)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> doesn't even provide the info most other school articles include. And I do not agree with Yuckfoo. Schools are often named after famous people, but that doesn't have anything with the school as an institution itself. I don't particularly like school stubs, but if this is to be kept it should at the very least include enrollment info, ethicity of students, and any historically important aspects like the other schools we've got. As it stands now it doesn't even provide the most basic of information a good "definition" would have. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:11, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per the usual reasons. Constant nominations for school articles discourages any serious work at improving articles, since nobody wants to invest serious time, knowing it will probably be wasted. This article has *not* been made instead of another more worthy article. It has been made in *addition* to other articles. This AFD nomination has been *instead* of making more worthwhile productive contributions to wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 04:15, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>At the same time, constant, uncritical "keep" votes on school articles discourages people from nominating them for deletion, even when they are unverifiable hoaxes. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 04:49, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well actually I did vote against the last unverifiable school <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Oceanview_Elementary_School%2C_Clovis%2C_California_1e03.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Oceanview Elementary School, Clovis, California">here</a>. Take a look at who created that article, and you'll see it's not the "blanket keepers" who create unverified school articles. Now, for this school, I see different mentions of it in different places like <a href="http://www.maderaonline.com/news/news-6a.html" class="external text" title="http://www.maderaonline.com/news/news-6a.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a>, which mentions a former principal, who died in a car accident. It specifically named the school and the district. If this is a hoax, it's well done, involving multiple web sites, and a false death report. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 05:28, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I would like all those that vote keep on schools so they can get expanded to take a break from creating stubs and actually do some expansion of the schools that survived AFD. I would also like to see less of an US bias. Voting keep and expand and subsequently leave it lying around doesn't improve my trust that someone will ever expand them past stub level. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:45, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I probably should take the phrase, "those that vote keep on schools" to be a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>. Why make the assumption that it is "those that vote keep on schools" who are responsible for stub creation? Lately, "those who vote delete on schools" have been creating stub articles, including hoax schools to try to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>. As to an article "lying" [sic] around - give articles some time to grow, just because I believe a school article should be kept for later expansion, doesn't mean I have time to edit and change it right now. The call for immediate re-write is counter-productive.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 11:00, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
