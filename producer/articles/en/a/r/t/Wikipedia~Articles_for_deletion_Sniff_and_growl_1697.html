<li>Referenced on multiple occasions by comedian Jim Breuer, and by others, some sports figures. Is something my peers grew up with, probably regional to NYC metro area, but who knows?

As to the thing, there are no <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_your_sources_2f5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite your sources">sources cited</a> in the article and a brief search turns up no independent <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verification</a> that what is described actually exists.

<li>Are you a mind reader, Kappa? You're speaking for me now? This has nothing to do with this nonsense being "embarassing", and all to do with this being nonsense.

<li>I wasn't speaking for you, you didn't even use the word "non-encyclopedic". However I note that sometimes people describe things as "incomprehensible" when in fact it is understandable, but "reflects badly on the encyclopedia". <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 11:05, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Something <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fermat%27s_last_theorem.html" title="Fermat's last theorem">incomprehensible</a> is very different from something non-notable. And something "reflecting badly on the encyclopedia" is different again. Who exactly do you think operates this way? I sympathise with RickK in that when you raise this matter in out of the blue the implication is that you're talking about the people voting here. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus"><small>speak up!</small></a> 12:05, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well I said "often", this is my interpretation of a lot of "non-encyclopedic" votes around here. I'm try to help this outsider to understand the situation, and what they need to do/show to get this article kept. In my opinion it will be more difficult because the topic will sway people to vote "nonsense" or "non-encyclopedic". They need to know that when they are deciding how hard they should look for evidence. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 13:03, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am trying to find google references (is this the criterion) but I am wondering if it'stermed under something else as well. We call it "sniff and growl".</p>
<p>As for non-encyclopedic (e.g. "embarassing" topics) I give you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goatse" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goatse" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goatse</a> by way of example.

<li>Even if it is true, <i>in its current state</i>, it is unencyclopedic, as any dictionary definition (if this is one) needs encyclopedic context to merit inclusion.

<li>I noticed that the previous deletes are per'ing the other's reason, which is that they can't seem to google it. Is Wikipedia just a googler's yellow pages as it were? I affirmed this because I've heard of it. But I wonder if this makes it hard for other instances whereby there isn't sufficient coverage on a topic due it's obscurity. If Jim Bruer makes reference to it, and he is a wiki article, then by extention, does this become encyclopedic because it's a theme on his show? Think before you just bandwagon! — <i>This comment by User:68.246.35.33.</i>
<ul>
<li>If there isn't sufficient coverage of a topic due to its obscurity, then it is either not notable or unverifiable (or both). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 17:23, Mar 31, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>What I'm hearing is that if it isn't googleable, it doesn't exist. Using your criterion, it's notable because Jim Breuer makes frequent reference to it, and verifiable by anybody who listens to his show. Should I write up a web page about this and wait a few weeks for the googleverse to spider the page so you'll be satisfied? -- GTSmelon
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: The top-level referent of the "per so-and-so's reasoning" (Uncle G's comment) doesn't mention Google. It mentions verifiability via cited sources. Plenty of sources not indexed by googlebots are considered authoritative primary sources. A reference to mentions on a regional radio show probably isn't. Presence of a <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Breuer_5e09.html" title="Jim Breuer">Jim Breuer</a> article in WP does NOT confer encyclopedicity on everything his show mentions. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 20:36, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> What is the issue here? Is disk space at a premium or something? I did NOT know about sniff&amp;growl before. Which means this was a USEFUL entry to me. Or is purity now a higher goal than usefulness? 66.238.210.208</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. My vote has nothing to do with provencialism, googlism, or what have you. It's thoroughly implausible that a group of modern sportsmen will sniff the winning team's asses while they growl as a rite of defeat in public. And the author provides no evidence that it exists. On the other hand the author, who says "he doesn't give a fart" about this entry, has spent far too much energy monitoring, editing, recruiting and arguing this entry. It doesn't add up. It could only be an April Fools practical joke. Dump it.

<p>Oh brother. Isn't there a policy that says if the original author wants something deleted then go ahead and delete it? I honestly didn't think this article would merit this much arguing and the attention of some psycho who gets his kicks putting anti-semitic and homophobic rants on people's pages. (moved to discussion)</p>
<p>I agree with you all. It's not worth it. Neither is half of the stuff that IS given a free pass here. You can't take yourself this seriously AND have a Klingon Wikipedia, ya dig?</p>
<p>For all of you that did vote keeps (and I know at least three of you are REAL) thanks fellas.</p>

<li>To be clear, above you said, <i>"... I honestly didn't think this article would merit this much arguing and the attention of some psycho who gets his kicks putting anti-semitic and homophobic rants on people's pages. (moved to discussion)"</i>. There are NO such rants on the discussion page for this entry. And the link you provided is unrelated to my question. --82.96.75.4 02:41, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
