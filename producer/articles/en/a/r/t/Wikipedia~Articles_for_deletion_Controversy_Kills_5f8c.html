<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> This is one of my favorite bands! Please do not delete this page as it is an excellent source of information on the band. Pinkpisces222</li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>, We are fans and followers of this band and stand by the article as a whole. We tried to help edit the article today for the author and if there is something that needs to be change then we have no problems with that but to delete it seems to be a more personal issue with these users and not a fair action. We were to be making donations to this site but if this is how they will handle articles that we find relevant then we must reconsider since we thought this was a site based on information for those that wish to seek it not bias negative feedback from those who don't speak for us or the fans of this band. <strike>Fans of CK</strike> 05:45, 26 March 2006 <i>No such user; comment actually by User:Controversy Kills.</i>

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> I think it's a bit ridiculous that a site that is made to provide information for people would try to delete a band bio page that provides information for it's fans. I have seen other bios on this site and do not see that this bio is any less adequate to be left on the site. Furthermore why would you delete a webpage that provides information about Controversy Kills on the basis that when you "google" them you find no information. It only seem logical that in order to solve that oh so horrible problem that you would need to create pages like this one to provide the informaiton people are looking for. As far as I can tell, the only reason people have wanted this page deleted because they personally don't have a preference for the band. Although I'm sure it seems the world should revolve around their whims and desires, I just don't see that it is valid reasoning for deleting the page of band who is just trying to get their information out their for people to see.<strike>LOGIC</strike> <i>No such user; comment actually by User:68.220.87.26.</i>
<ul>
<li>Unfortunetly, we can't keep an article that asserts no nobility just for the sake of a few fans.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b>, Just because it's not notable to you doesnt mean it's not to us. This doesnt hurt you then why degrade as if it does? It helps the people that are interested in what it has to say to able to access it and to delete shows us that maybe this site isn't as notable as I thought it was since it can't provide information on something we are interested in knowing about. As per the person above that was going to make a donation but was rethinking that now, I side with them, since my family wanted to provide a donation to something that we once consider a vital site, we must know look to see this as a site that only wants to provide information that is of interest to them. I think to have anyone one person that is interested in information about this band is more enough reason to keep it. If this is so then I will make my familys donation.

<li>You keep posting your band comments and we are the ones that worked on it, not the band though we would had loved to get there insight on this article. Do we really need a thousand people to say the samething here? We love the site and we love the fact this article is on here. Why delete something we enjoy that brings no harm to you. If this how your editors work, then maybe they need to understand what is important to the some of the people who use this site and not just their own opinion of what is important. Why fight about this? Can't we just agree that some things are not for everyone but are important enough to have up for those of us who need it can come look at it here?
