<li>My old vote confused some people. straight up <b>Delete</b> -- not worth noting because there are thousands of bands who shared the same fate. There is nothing worth mentioning about this unheard of band unless there was something they did that make them stand out from the rest of the dead and still insignificant bands with similar histories. If you can make a compelling case for how they differ, I will change my vote.</li>

<li><b>Redirect</b> per nom.

<p><b>Do Not Delete.</b> Come on people, this is totally not fair. I know of this band (having been into this typw of music when younger). They are totally legit. They were a music scene phenom in the mid-1990s among the LI Hardcore cult outside of New York City. Just becuase there is vulgarity in the title (which many bands have, I can refer you to many others) doesn't mean it should automatically be detected. What do you want them to do? Edit history and change the name of the band? I can't say that I agree with the presentation of the article (in terms of boosting the band), but hey, I've seen much worse on Wikipedia in terms of promoting the band rather than being objective. I will be looking for back-up cites, but in the meantime: Please Do Not Erase. I thought it was nice that something like this about long-dead local music appeared on Wikipedia... as it adds credence to the idea that the internet can be a source for finsing information about subjects that the mainstream media cannot deal with.

<p><b>Keep and Categorize</b>. I am the author of this page. Human Shit is the band's name. It was real band. They played between 1994 and 1995 just outside of New York City. Some say there will be a reunion. I don't know what more I can say. To those of you who know nothing about this subject (Mr. Kilgore below excluded from this category), don't make recommendations you cannot support intelligently!!! If it is non-importnant to you, it may be importnant to someone else. If it is considered vulgar by you, I would direct you to the entry for <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a> which is much more vulgar and intelligently classified on Wikipedia. Do not delete. It should be categorized under Heavy Metal, Music.</p>

<li><i>Comment</i> I have no problem with the band's name. I have no problem with it being an heavy metal band. I do not find the name agreessive (although that is propbably the band's intention and they'd be sad to read this...). Plus I like heavy metal and went to some very minor underground band's concerts, so I don't think the subject is non-important. The article's tone is no reason to delete but to cleanup. It was nominated for none of these reasons.<br />
The main issue is «only released one indie album». That is a little short for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines</a>. Show up something fitting one of those criteria, or even a little short of that (one good shot is telling for which label they recorded), and I'll be glad to change my nomination. <a href="../../../n/a/b/User%7ENabla_d282.html" title="User:Nabla">Nabla</a> 20:14, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>To Nabla: Listen Mr. Smarty Pants. Yes, you figured that the two entry's above came from the same computer. Very good for you. As it turns out, one of my colleagues here at work (I'm a newspaper editor, not merely some online know-it-all critic) knows of the band from way back then. So, he wrote the entry from the same computer. Big Whoop-te-do. It is a part of local history. And (I feel the need to repeat), it is history. This is why my friend was gracious enough to include his name and e-mail address. I keep seeing these "delete" directives from people with profiles indicating they are from the mid-west and even Australia. Let me ask you: Who are you to determine what is history and what is not. I'll be looking for supporting links, but you know what, it's not too easy. I have a CD sitting at home that tells me the band is history, and that's all I need to feel vindicated. Thank you.</p>
