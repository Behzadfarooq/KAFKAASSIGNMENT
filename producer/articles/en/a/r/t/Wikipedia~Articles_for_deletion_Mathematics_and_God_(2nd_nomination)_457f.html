<p>not article but a collection of citations; <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> says: Wikipedia articles are not lists or repositories of loosely associated topics such as quotations, aphorisms... Due to the vagueness of the subject, the article looks like <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and is a battlefield for POV warriors from both sides. Mathematics is basically not about God, and when mathematicians speak about God, they speak as philosophers and not as mathematicians in the narrow sense. <a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 10:58, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Abstain</b>. The previous AfD is at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mathematics_and_God_3b0c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mathematics and God">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mathematics and God</a>. It was argued there that "Mathematics and God" (more properly, "Mathematics and religion") is a proper subject for an article. The article is not only a collection of quotations, though I agree that there are too many citations and that there is little coherence. It has been in a bad state since the previous AfD, more than a year ago, so I think it's better for Wikipedia to delete the article. However, I also think that would be against the deletion policy: bad articles on a encyclopaedic subject should be sent to cleanup. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 11:45, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for the link. - There are of course encyclopedic facts on the border between mathematics and religion, but they are very disparate (from the pagan Pythagorean number mystic over Christian Pascal's Wager to the atheistic philosophy of Bertrand Russel) and IMHO cannot be summarized into a single coherent article.--<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 12:01, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I voted strong delete the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mathematics_and_God_3b0c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mathematics and God">first time</a> this came up for deletion. I'm still not happy with its contents, though I tried to improve it once it was kept (for lack of consensus). It is not <i>just</i> quotations, but it is little more than that; there has never been any attempt to add context and discussion, which it still needs. If, say, Plato, Newton, Euler, and Erdős all used the word "God", they had rather different ideas in mind. (Plato was a pre-Christian, Newton was an idiosyncratic alchemist, Euler was Christian Protestant, and Erdős was agnostic.) You'd never know it from the article. Worse, it seems that fans of believing in God (presumably in the Judeo-Christian tradition) stop by from time to time and delete the section with dissenting voices ("God as human invention"). I like history and human interest; I do not think this article has enough of either to justify its persistence. --<a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a><sup><a href="../../../k/s/m/User_talk%7EKSmrq_bfac.html" title="User talk:KSmrq">T</a></sup> 11:59, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. There is apparently a list of quotes on the same theme at the Wikiquote site, so there is no reason to host the same thing here, especially since the article, such as it is, pretty much is just a list of quotes. I agree that a `mathematics and religion' article may be a good idea, but it would be tough to do it without lapsing into original research and generally making an obnoxious mess of things. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosenkreuz_8bdd.html" title="User:Rosenkreuz">Rosenkreuz</a> 12:08, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The topic of the article is rather broad and ill-defined. We have references on everything from ontological proofs of God's existence to philosophical references to Platonic mystical remarks. This article seems to be a collection of any kind of semi-spiritual-philosophical quotes about mathematics. This in itself is a problem, but a more serious one is that I get a feeling that NOR is being violated. This may be one of those cases when it is an unpublished synthesis of an assortment of topics. An article like Mathematical proofs of God's existence would be clearly defined and easily writable without violating any policies. Same goes for articles like <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_mathematics.html" title="Philosophy of mathematics">philosophy of mathematics</a> or Greek mysticism and mathematics. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho Suh</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chan-Ho_Suh_182d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chan-Ho Suh">contribs</a>) 17:42, 22 December 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Although I voted to keep during its first AfD, I now find that I agree with most of the comments above. I would like to save this article — I still think there is encyclopedic potential here — but no one seems to be inclined or able to do the necessary work, and more importantly I now begin to think that it might be impossible to stay within NOR. I'm more of an inclusionist than deletionist, but I can't really vote to keep, given its present state, and its predictable future. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 18:49, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I agree with <a href="../../../c/r/g/User%7ECRGreathouse_d93e.html" title="User:CRGreathouse">CRGreathouse</a>. The subject is one that has arisen over the course of intellectual history. It deserves coverage here. I endorse <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a>'s view that the proper title should be "Mathematics and religion," since deism is one of the points of contention.

<dd>The most important deletion reason is not its poor state (although I do not believe that somebody here is able to write it better) but <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. If you make the topic even broader by the renaming, then this problem will be even more accute. I agree that many pieces of information in the article are notable, but not under this title - it should be separated into different articles divided by schools of thought and so on. I am not against a category named Mathematics and religion, but an article like this is a biased mess and will be a mess forever.--<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 11:00, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>POV and poor quality was discussed in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mathematics_and_God_3b0c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mathematics and God">the previous AfD</a> more than one year ago. Nobody from users voting keep was able to write it better since then, and you also do not offer any idea how to proceed to this end. But there is another important deletion reason: the article seems to be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and nobody knows how to avoid it. It is perhaps based in the fact, that the subject is too broad and not clearly defined. A simple observation: After three years of existence, the article has many religion-related quotes from different mathematicians (and interestingly no mathematics-related quotes of theologians), but no one single non-trivial sentence about its subject, the relation of mathematics and God.
