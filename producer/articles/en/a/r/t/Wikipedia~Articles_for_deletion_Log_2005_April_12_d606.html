<p>A local amateur league.

<li>RickK and I have clarified some of the issues involved. Anyway, I created the article so the links to the league in the articles about the cities in it would have an article to link to, not to make the league sound like anything it isn't. The league is not, though, just "a bunch of guys who like to get together and play baseball." It is a commercial enterprise whose results are covered by major media outlets in southern Ontario. I'll be happy with whatever decision is reached here, because even if the article is deleted, the deletion will set a standard for other articles. Which I intend to see exercised. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_FitzGerald_1eab.html" title="User:John FitzGerald">John FitzGerald</a> 12:30, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>But you know what? Even if they are a minor semi-commercial, semi-rec league now, they are 86 years old and notable historically. For a historically important period of time, <i>all</i> baseball in North America was minor semi-commercial, semi-rec league stuff, and this was the highest level of baseball play around, and it was popular, and while most players would not be encyclopedic, the longstanding large regional leagues <i>absolutely</i> would be. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22barrie+baycats%22+OR+%22brantford+red+sox%22+OR+%22guelph+royals%22+OR+%22hamilton+thunderbirds%22+OR+%22kitchener+panthers%22+OR+%22london+majors%22+OR+%22oshawa+dodgers%22+OR+%22stratford+storm%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22barrie+baycats%22+OR+%22brantford+red+sox%22+OR+%22guelph+royals%22+OR+%22hamilton+thunderbirds%22+OR+%22kitchener+panthers%22+OR+%22london+majors%22+OR+%22oshawa+dodgers%22+OR+%22stratford+storm%22" rel="nofollow">3270 Google hits</a>, none double-counted, discussing either of eight of the nine teams (you can imagine the trouble with <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Maple_Leafs_bc61.html" title="Toronto Maple Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>.)

<li>So when someone adduces the importance of the league to Canadian culture you call that nonsense. Now why might you say that?

<li>I voted keep because I think this baseball league is notable and worthy of being included in a truly great encyclopedia. Anyone who has hung around VfD, knows that I am almost as inclusionist as <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> is; especially when it comes to topics that might not be included in a paper encyclopedia, such as this baseball league. I'm just trying to add a little humor to the VfD process which is often filled with sourpusses, and people who make 1-3 word votes. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 06:17, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Yes, it sounds potentially dangerous. For example, <i>The older magnetic ballasts will self-destruct if you try to rewire them.</i> I know also that overdriven fluorescent lights also generate more heat, and can be a fire hazard or melt objects nearby. It's not something relatively safe, like overclocking a CPU. As mentioned, I don't see this being useful in a general-interest encyclopedia. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 19:45, Apr 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>

I do not support this proposal, but feel it should remain where it is and be given the chance to succeed or fail on its own, there's already a vote on the Talk page (it's not doing well either). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 01:25, Apr 12, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I oppose this proposal strongly. That said, the way to get rid of it is to express why it's so distasteful on the talk page; there's even a nice section explicitly for voting and commenting.

<ul>
<li>The (somewhat spurious) argument that, since all pokemon are covered in Wikipedia, anything that is more notable than a pokemon should be kept. But note that millions of people worldwide can recognize any pokemon on sight, so arguably there aren't that many things more notable than pokemon. Also note that the pokemon test is usually invoked by people who have the POV that pokemon are stupid, and that they use it as an argument for keeping anything that they do not consider stupid. Using it like that is, obviously, fallacious. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 08:36, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is nothing spurious about that argument at all, how do you figure? Saying there are millions of people worldwide who can recognize Pokemon on sight is no different than saying the same millions can recognize a school on sight — these are fairly easily and obviously recognizable things. Now, if you start asking for specifics, things change dramatically. Not even my son, an avid fan of Pokemon, would be able to tell you the specific <i>name</i> of every Pokemon character on sight — yet we have a complete and all-inclusive index of Pokemon on Wikipedia, some of which are completely empty and vacant stubs. (!) This is just one reason why I, and presumably others, make reference to the so-called Pokemon Comparative Notability Test. Sure, it sounds funny, but Wikipedia is not paper and I've yet to meet a school article which didn't have the potential to be expanded and useful in an encyclopedic capacity. This horse has been beaten up long enough— fix your sig already. —<b>RaD Man</b> (<i>talk</i>) 02:46, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is spurious because <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">WP:WIN</a> consistent, and an argument applying to one topic (fictional creatures) does not generally apply to an entirely unrelated topic (schools). It is often used fallaciously because it relies on the assumption that more people, worldwide, would recognize or be familiar with the item in question (the school in this case), than with individual pokemon. For the <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smithsonian.html" title="Smithsonian">smithsonian</a> or <a href="../../../e/i/f/Eiffel_tower.html" title="Eiffel tower">eiffel tower</a> that would be obviously true.

<li>I think that various people have provided <b>more than enough</b>. Like I said, it's about time you either quit arguing, or actually come up with a good counter-argument that answers the <b>real</b> issues, such as reputation, credibility, coverage, storage (something people would appreciate if they <i>read</i> <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINP_a8ac.html" title="WP:WINP">WP:WINP</a> instead of simply <i>quoting its title</i>), maintainability, usefulness, duplication of information, and the inclusion of trivia that is removed everywhere else. Is it too much to ask that someone actually comes up with a good argument why pointless articles on schools that are for all intents and purposes near-identical <b>aren't</b> harmful, relevant to the points I've mentioned? Is it too much to ask that people stop making dumb comparisons between schools, which are infinite on WP scale, and other finite sets (Pokemon, railway stations, albums)? Is it too much to ask that you even <i>consider</i> the other points of view, instead of dismissing it? Finally, is it too much to at least take the suggestion of articles on <i>generic</i> school types (face it - 95% of US high schools are unremarkable, we should have articles for the few that are remarkable, and a generic article describing the general common features of the rest) to replace these endless stubs seriously? Is it too much to ask? Of course not.

<li><b>Keep</b> - the three pages are quite different in content, but I no longer believe there is any justification for deleting honest efforts at providing information to this encyclopedia. The amount of esoteric make-believe covered in Wikipedia requires far more attention and consideration for "notability" than whether any particular school is or is not. I can only think that those who express the opinion that these articles are not important enough to keep have not spent much time looking around at what all is in Wikipedia! Schools are and will always be an important part of any community, and what is significant about any community is really to be judged by those familiar with that community. Each school was a big deal to all who attended it and is of interest to those who might someday attend. If an article remains stubby, then make it into a redirect and move the info to the proper political entity (city, county, borough, etc.) until someone comes along to develop it into a real article, like this one: <a href="../../../m/o/a/Moanalua_High_School_24b1.html" title="Moanalua High School">Moanalua High School</a>. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 01:14, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This would be a valid argument if school deletion arguments were about hard disk space. They aren't. Wikipedia has plenty of disk space. Wikipedia is not paper.

My autobiography is factual and verifiable and there is enough disk space for it, but if I were to create it as an article it would be deleted. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a></li>

<br />
Truely, It has <b>never</b> been established that <i>school's are not encyclopedic by nature</i>. So that leave's it open for people who feel that all school's are encyclopedic by nature. I've researched this issue quite extensivly, and to the best of my knowledge, the issue of intrinsic school inclusion is still very much in the air and has not been resolved to anyone satisfaction.<br />
<br />
And I will advocate for the inclusion of all school's, and try to convince people of the merits of beliefs, because I beleive that my beleifs lead ot a better encyclopedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Honestly, this debate is stupid. It really shouldn't matter whether it is a redirect or a separate article. Apparently, multiple people want this to be a separate article, even after it was turned into a redirect by VfD's last decision. Why not placate them by letting them have the separate article? It isn't as though the information itself is in dispute; if that were the case, then the article would not have been merged. Since we're only talking about whether or not the content should have its own article, then why in the world should any of us care one whit? There are <i>lots</i> of stubs with less info than this page that we are all apparently okay with keeping. Why are so many of you continually arguing about this? It's so stupid. If we redirect it, someone will just reinstate the article, and it will just get listed on VfD again. Since it really doesn't matter one way or the other as to where the content is listed, why not just let them keep their separate article? I vote <b>keep</b>, and urge everyone voting 'redirect' to reconsider their reasoning. — <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_Herboso_fb30.html" title="User:Eric Herboso">Eric</a> <a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EEric_Herboso_ef91.html" title="User talk:Eric Herboso">Herboso</a> 04:44, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. If high schools sell alumni goodies and photos commemorating proms, a high school is important enough to have a Wikipedia article (elementary schools and junior highs are still under question).

<li><b>Keep</b>: I believe that all school articles should be kept, if they are more than stubs. For me this goes for elementary and middle schools too. It's not just about the impact that they have on lives and communities, or about using Wikipedia as a repository of information on more than famous whos and whatwhens. Schools may not have a big impact on history individually, but with few exceptions, celebrities don't either, and yet Wikipedia tends to keep them. It seems rather odd to me that people think we should only keep articles about things well know by a lot of people, and get rid of articles on things less well known.--<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuintucket_ce2b.html" title="User:Quintucket">Quintucket</a> 03:38, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Personal opinion: a) If the school article is more than one full page of traditional print, say 5-10 paragraphs, then it is no longer possible to glance from one school to another on the same page. And it will take more than one mouse click to scroll past it to the next school. So at that point it's at least reasonable to break out a separate article. b) If the BEEFSTEW score of the broken-out article would be somewhere up in the eight-to-ten range, as a practical matter it's unlikely that anyone will even nominate it for deletion, much less get consensus for deletion. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:19, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Fair use for our limited purpose of demonstrating what the logo of the station was. The law of fair use permits displays of copyrighted material so long as it for a primarily non-profit purpose (obviously this is), is primarily for an educational or research related purpose (both apply to us), has a minimal impact on the market for the copied material (what market?), and so long as no more of the copyrighted material is used than is necessary to fulfill the needs of the education or research at hand (for a logo, you really can't use less than the whole thing). My <i>opinion</i> is that we're safe. -- <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">8^D</a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="DarkGreen">gab</font></sup></a> 05:02, 2005 Apr 12 (UTC)</li>

<p>Nominated as speedy, but clearly not a candidate for speedy deletion, so I moved it here. <b>No vote</b> from me--do we have a policy regarding museums? The institution clearly exists, and gets 13,600 Google hits (compare 500,000 for "Art Institute of Chicago", 166,000 for "Los Angeles County Museum of Art"). <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 05:58, Apr 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The quality of the official web site and the design of the building should be reason enought. Reno only has 180,000 residents how many in LA and Chicago?

<li>OK. In looking at that article I searched on the AAM and found a couple of other wikipedia entries that had that. Those articles are not much different in size to the NMA.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Looks like a substantial not-so-terribly-little museum. And unlike some other things I won't mention, art museums are very different from each other. Peeking at the website... oh, I'm so tempted to say something snarky about Maxfield Parrish but in fact if I were there I'd sorta like to see that exhibit. And an exhibit on pinhole photography sounds interesting. I am quite sure I wouldn't find exhibits on either of those at the Peabody-Essex Museum in Salem, nor the <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvehjem_Museum_of_Art_31a1.html" title="Elvehjem Museum of Art">Elvehjem Museum of Art</a> in Madison. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:11, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This occurred to me, too. But from reading what it actually says, and from checking the deletion log for New York conspiracy theory, it appears that this isn't an orphaned talk page.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is an important codeword in current right wing politics (See Dbiv's comment below). This is the british equivalent of "Hardworking Americans" who deserve a tax cut.

<ul>
<li>Well, not in principle, no. But in the UK election it's being used as a code: the parties all want to lower taxes and provide services for "hardworking families", by which they mean to include everyone who might vote for them but exclude feckless benefit recipients (right-wing use) or those who have unearned income (left-wing use). Which is what I suspect <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaihsu_59f0.html" title="User:Kaihsu">Kaihsu</a> was trying to say, but I think it has extremely limited value as a separate page. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">Dbiv</a> 21:53, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I really appreciate the job <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaihsu_59f0.html" title="User:Kaihsu">Kaihsu</a> done with the new version of the article. But what he did is a brilliant example of <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>, to supporthis point of view that the expression in question is interpreted differently by different societies/parties/whatever. What is still lacking is <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_source.html" title="Secondary source">secondary sources</a>, i.e., respectful researchers (no disrespect to Kaishu) who described of this phenomenon in authoritative sources. Also, so far the article is a mostly about the <b>usage</b> of the term, i.e., more in the dicdef section.

<li>I looked to see what rhetorical device this would be classified as, and found that we didn't cover this in anything listed under <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rhetoric.html" title="Rhetoric">rhetoric</a>. However, <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rhetoric.html" title="Rhetoric">rhetoric</a> does not link to the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_for_Propaganda_Analysis_b0f5.html" title="Institute for Propaganda Analysis">Institute for Propaganda Analysis</a>, which in turn fails to link to <a href="../../../g/l/i/Glittering_generality.html" title="Glittering generality">glittering generality</a>. And with that knowledge to hand, both problems here are solved. This phrase is <i>an example of</i> a <a href="../../../g/l/i/Glittering_generality.html" title="Glittering generality">glittering generality</a>, so we know how to treat it, and <a href="http://www.propagandacritic.com/articles/ct.wg.gg.html" class="external text" title="http://www.propagandacritic.com/articles/ct.wg.gg.html" rel="nofollow">the IPA's article on Glittering Generalities</a> is one good secondary source dealing with this phenomenon, ameliorating the secondary source issue to an extent. So I suggest a <b>merge</b>r of some kind, with some refactoring, to <a href="../../../g/l/i/Glittering_generality.html" title="Glittering generality">glittering generality</a>. Note that this phrase is <i>not</i> an example of a <a href="../../../c/o/d/Code_word_%28figure_of_speech%29.html" title="Code word (figure of speech)">code word (figure of speech)</a>, because it doesn't meet the definition of "code word" given.

<li>Sam, thank you. I know how to use internet. The reference you gave is a <b>usage</b> of the term, not its scientific/encyclopedic discussion. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 15:16, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>No. That's simply yet one more use of the glittering generality. Nothing in that series of television programmes purports to describe the concept of "hardworking families". Instead they describe <a href="../../../f/o/s/Foster_care.html" title="Foster care">foster care</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adoption.html" title="Adoption">adoption</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_support.html" title="Child support">child support</a>, and the like, and <i>use</i> the glittering generality to attempt to gain widespread appeal and to imply that this is positive action for the benefit of those who inarguably deserve it. This is why a redirect from the phrase to an article <i>about such phrases in political discourse of which this is but one example</i> is I think the best approach. It solves the problem of people in <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaihsu_59f0.html" title="User:Kaihsu">Kaihsu</a>'s shoes. Such people come to the encyclopaedia not knowing what a "hardworking family" is, and the encyclopaedia tells them that there <i>is no</i> definite meaning to the term, but instead shows them that politics has a long history of such deliberately vague terms (or, at least, a history that goes back at least as far as the 1940s, when the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_for_Propaganda_Analysis_b0f5.html" title="Institute for Propaganda Analysis">Institute for Propaganda Analysis</a> analysed these things) to which politicians expect the audience to ascribe their own meanings. They may not have been instructed in the way that they expected to be, but they've been instructed. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:25, 2005 Apr 15 (UTC)

<li>The problem here is secondary sources. But it's a limited problem. We don't have a problem with the concept of <a href="../../../g/l/i/Glittering_generality.html" title="Glittering generality">glittering generalities</a>; we have the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_for_Propaganda_Analysis_b0f5.html" title="Institute for Propaganda Analysis">Institute for Propaganda Analysis</a> as at least one source for that. We don't have a problem with all of the quotations mentioning "hardworking families"; we (presuming the external hyperlinks to be correct) have full references for those. The core of the problem, the only part that remains, is whether anyone has considered the phrase "hardworking families" in terms of its propaganda value apart from us:
<ul>
<li>We certainly have plenty of evidence for its use, particularly in political strategy documents where politicians <i>prescribe the propaganda</i> that their party members should use.</li>
<li>We have uses of "hardworking", by itself, by people whose <i>job</i> was explicitly Minister of <i>Propaganda</i>.</li>
<li>We have sites such as <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article4433.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article4433.htm" rel="nofollow">this one</a> that analyse statements containing such phrases <i>as propaganda</i>.</li>
<li>We also have sites such as <a href="http://www.irib.ir/worldservice/englishRADIO/political/US%20media2.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.irib.ir/worldservice/englishRADIO/political/US%20media2.htm" rel="nofollow">this one</a> that analyse Nazi propaganda and that use the word "hardworking" as an example ("Using the Preemptive Strike doctrine, the Nazi propaganda machine actually managed to convince ordinary Germans that the National Socialist government was invading other countries and laying waste to their cities in defense of Nazi Germany. It all read like a quaint little story: <i>the racially inferior, parasitic, uncivilized, disheveled, excitable brute was out to kill pure, God fearing, <b>hardworking</b> Germans.</i>")</li>
<li>And finally (I've just turned this up.), we have <a href="http://www.midtermpapers.com/16240.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.midtermpapers.com/16240.htm" rel="nofollow">"Summary of Politics: The Art of Bamboozling"</a> which says "Another red herring is argumentum ad populum, also know as stroking. This is when a politician will compliment the people, such as <b>"hardworking ...</b>". (This mid-term paper is flawed. I suspect deliberately so, as a copyright trap. The spelling errors are probably deliberate, and the mis-labelling of this as <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argumentum_ad_populum.html" title="Argumentum ad populum">Argumentum ad populum</a> is probably deliberate also. But that's beside the point here, which is that someone <i>has</i> addressed this word as a propaganda word.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Without the last, I would have said that it was borderline and circumstantial. With the last, we have confirmation that "hardworking" has been discussed as a propaganda word by others, albeit that "hardworking families", specifically, may not have been. (It's a pity that "pay money to see the rest" cuts in at exactly the point that it does. ☺) So the question is: Is the adjective enough? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:30, 2005 Apr 16 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment on the votes to redirect</b>. I usually like redirects, but the Agatha Christie article has links to every single crime novel she made. Is it not better that the links to articles which we do <i>not</i> have remain red, so that we avoid having redirects to itself? I can imagine readers of the Agatha Christie article getting annoyed if they click <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mystery_of_the_Blue_Train_e9c6.html" title="The Mystery of the Blue Train">The Mystery of the Blue Train</a> only to find themselves at the top of the article they were just reading. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 08:21, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>It's all sort of academic, since the Agatha Christie article says nothing specific about this novel. Still, it's just barely possible that someone might see the title, look it up, and be pleased to find the author, so there's some justification for a redirect. Particularly since a) the global search feature keeps appearing and disappearing, I think it's been available less than 1/3 of the time I've been on Wikipedia, and b) the Google and Yahoo search features aren't terribly reliable. I do <i>not</i> approve of automatically linking every novel in an article about an author, because it encourages creation of substubs. I think it's much better to leave them unlinked in the article, add brief <i>notes</i> to each title, and create whole articles only when it's clear that the quantity of material about the book is too large for the article. So personally I'd unlink all the book titles that do not have articles already. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:35, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b>. I began this quest for deletion, but a merge is fine, as deleting this one article wouldn't solve the problem anyway. For all you who have argued to keep, what would Wikipedia be like if it wasn't just filled with American roads/highways? How about an aritcle on the Hume Highway between Albury/Wadonga and Melbourne in Victoria, Australia? Sound interesting? If every major road in the world was added then every time someone did a random page search, guess what would come up? The only people who care about an individual road are either people who travel on it, or who are going to. They wouldn't look for it on Wikipedia in either case - they'd buy a map. I appreciate a lot of people have gone to an effort to create these articles, but the information won't be lost in a merge.

<p>This is not only a substub that isn't going anywhere, it states that the Bushmaster XM-15 is the civilian version of the M16 rifle series. This is completely false, seeing that a.) many rifles are designed to look like the M16, and b.) if anything can be classified as a civilian version of the M16, it's the AR-15.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> but mark for <b>cleanup and expand</b>. When the October 2002 series of sniper attacks was ongoing around Washington DC, an ex-military friend predicted that this make and model of rifle would prove to be the primary weapon involved. That wound up being true. Thereafter, the Bushmaster XM-15 got a lot of mentions in legitimate news media and in all kinds of blogs. I would argue that (if only because of the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Beltway_Sniper_15f7.html" title="Beltway Sniper">Beltway Sniper</a>) it's the most widely known variety of rifle not made primarily for military use.
