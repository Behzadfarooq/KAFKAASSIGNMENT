<p>As there seems a developing consensus above to purge post-War Surrealist fancruft, this one gets 105 google hits. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 19:08, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Quite significant in history of surrealism as issuers of <i>Against the Dictatorship of Allah</i>. And purging information on postwar surrealism is POV. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C. Boyer">Daniel C. Boyer</a> 21:26, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Note I voted to keep the two Surrealism related articles above that got 1,000 or more google hits. I'll do likewise for any other article even with low google hits if notability can be shown in major published sources-- say, a mention in the N.Y. Times, the Guardian, whatever. As is, I find without the word "Wikipedia", google gets 56 hits for "Surrealist Group of Pakistan". "Against the Dictatorship of Allah" gets 23 hits, without the word "Wikipedia" gets 16, only 7 of which are displayed as unique. I'm open to being convinced some of these articles are about subjects more significant than the average garage band with a self-produced demo cd and occasional gigs at a neighborhood bar, but I've yet to see the evidence. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 05:51, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Infrogmation they are extremely <b>non-notable</b> and literally unknown in any literary reviews and lacking any credible information that can justify their work by critics, media, museums, etc. Plus the fact that Google brings up only 105 hits on this, "surrealist" group that was supposed to exist in Pakistan (of all places) since 1978 shows that this, "surrealist" group is bogus. Plus, this, "pamphlet" supposedly written by them, "Against the Dictatorship of Allah" is promotion on here anyway, I am surprised that this, "surrealist group" really could have written such a pamphlet denouncing Allah, in of all places in the world, Pakistan! This is bogus information and does not belong on Wikipedia.<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 00:37, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, Mustafaa, I am convinced that this,"pamphlet", "Against the Dictatorship of Allah" is just a goof.<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 18:04, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Regarding the above, "reference" from this, "Surrealcoconut" website. It is one of those FREE WEBSITES that you can build online(kind of like geocities, you know), and a virtual soapbox, especially when you look at the introductory statement to the site, "Surrealism is not an art movement, etc.etc.etc,". That is just the view of the website artist Eric W.Bragg, who is an unknown anyway, and a very close friend of Daniel C.Boyer's, go figure.<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 18:04, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Are you on something? Not only am I not a member of the Surrealist Group of Pakistan, I've never even been there. How can it be "vanity"? --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C. Boyer">Daniel C. Boyer</a> 15:24, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><del><b>Keep</b></del>. Seems to be a real group, mentioned in some surrealism sites. But the article needs expanding. E.g. what artists belonged to it? BTW has anyone searched Google in other languages than English? -<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHapsiainen_6f9e.html" title="User:Hapsiainen">Hapsiainen</a> 17:28, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you cannot find any evidence online about this group and its members, it really is a scam. I have been looking for a real long time and there is nothing! No mention of them in any art publications or literary publications at all. Maybe if there is a Wikipedia type encyclopedia in Pakistan that can dig up some dirt, but with a title like, "Against the Dictatorship of Allah", that could be a problem, you know, in Pakistan!<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 18:04, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The URL the statement is at is given above. And your webcentric, Googlecentric attitude you don't see fit in the slightest to justify. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C. Boyer">Daniel C. Boyer</a> 18:10, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Dan, I really am trying to work with you and everyone here in getting to the credible facts and quality research. We are examing the facts and I cannot find any substantial information on this group outside of the five plus, "surrealism" websites that are really not a legitimate reference source on surrealism anyway. Dan, both you and I can get a geocities website, or one like your friend Eric's, "Surrealcoconut" and build the site and then copy and paste anything that we find online from other, "surrealism" websites and then state that we are the voices of, "contemporary surrealism" etc., etc., etc., you know. Does the surrealism expert Mary Ann Caws recognize this, "group" as credible? Were did they exhibit their art and display their writings? Were did they met? Were did they get their publications published? WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? What are their names? Can we verify who they are? What do they look like? Come on Dan! If I was a college student doing a paper on Surrealism after 1950 to now, you know, Surrealism today, I would have nothing on this group, really, expect a handful of websites, (around five to six) that say they exist, but that is it!<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 19:35, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Once <i>again</i>, how about offline sources? (Books that you are going to find bases for criticism of as well.) --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C. Boyer">Daniel C. Boyer</a> 20:21, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ol>
<li>Re: <i>Does the surrealism expert Mary Ann Caws recognize this, "group" as credible? Were did they exhibit their art and display their writings?</i> Given that surrealism is not a literary or artistic movement, this is completely irrelevant. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C. Boyer">Daniel C. Boyer</a> 20:21, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Re: <i>Were did they met? Were did they get their publications published? WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? What are their names? Can we verify who they are?</i> And show pictures, perhaps? For we have to have photographs of everyone just to prove that they exist. And then when the photographs are produced raise a whole new set of objections about how they look. Oh, great. You haven't disappointed me. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C. Boyer">Daniel C. Boyer</a> 20:21, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have to change my vote to <b>delete</b>. Although the phenomenons in Pakistan are underrepresented in Google, the Lust for Life zine, which originally <a href="http://home.teleport.com/~rasputin/eLibrary-v2_1.htm#Against_the_Dictatorship_of_Allah" class="external text" title="http://home.teleport.com/~rasputin/eLibrary-v2_1.htm#Against_the_Dictatorship_of_Allah" rel="nofollow">published the pamphet</a> on the web, fails to tell where it found it.
