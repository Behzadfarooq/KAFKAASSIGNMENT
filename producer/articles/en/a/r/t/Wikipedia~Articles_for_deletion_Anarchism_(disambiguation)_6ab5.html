Kevehs keeps putting up a header on the Anarchism article saying that the article is going to be POV (that is, it's only going to include anti-capitalist anarchist philosophies. Putting up such a header doesn't release an article from the NPOV rule.) <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 19:16, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Here is the header he's putting up: ":<i>This article illustrates anarchism as it refers to philosophies and social movements that oppose hierarchy in all forms, such as the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">state</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>. There are other philosophies and movements that call themselves anarchist but differ from the definition given here. For other uses such as these, see <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Anarchism (disambiguation)">anarchism (disambiguation)</a></i>. This is clearly not a legitimate disambiguation but an anti-capitalist POV attempt to monopolize the word "Anarchism." An NPOV article would not make such judgement calls on what anti-state philosophy is or is not anarchism. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 19:24, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The article does not make any judgement call on what is or is not anarchism. The disambiguation header explains that this is one usage of the term, and that other political philosophies use the term different, and that those other uses can be found on the disambiguation page. As for removing the AC section, there isn't any point for it once the article has been disambigated, because AC philosophy is no longer being described in it. I'm happy to put a reduced version of that section back, as Nat Krause agreed, if that was the limit of AC referance on the page. And I don't know what you want RJ, but you are in fact overemphasizing capitalism in the general article by including AC counterpoints and perspective throughout. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 19:29, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's not a disambiguation article. It does not serve the purpose of letting "the reader choose between different pages that might reside under the same title." The title of the article says it's disambiguation, but it's not, at least not in accordance with guidelines. Also, therefore, there should be no link to it. I also helped create the so-called disambiguation page and supported it, but have come to the realization that its improper. The logic behind the guidline becomes clear when one sees what it's being used for, by anti-capitalist POV individuals such as Kevehs. The guideline is there for a reason and now we can cleary see what that reason is. The article is clearly inconsistent with Wikipedia guidlines and should be deleted. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 19:34, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Kinda funny how you never noticed that when Hogeye was shoving his POV into it, ah well. Anyway, but this article does "let the reader choose between different pages that might reside under the same title." It clearly directs the reader to both the anarchism page (under the anti-capitalist meaning which is far more predominate), and the anarcho-capitalism page (under the AC meaning). So, if you don't think this is directing the reader as described above, what exactly would? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 19:45, 15 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>You don't understand that guideline or are being purposely obtuse. It's saying that if there are other things that are called "Anarchism" then there can be a disambiguation page to direct people to those other meanings. For example, such a page would let the reader choose between "mutualism" the economic theory, or "mutualism" the biological phenomenon. "Anarcho-capitalism" is not another meaning of "anarchism." It's a TYPE of anarchism. Anarcha-feminism is not another meaning of "anarchism." It's a type of anarchism. Anarcho-primitivism is not another meaning of anarchism. It's a TYPE of anarchism.</b> <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 19:55, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm already aware of that, and that is precisely the point of the page. It is there to refer not to anarcho-capitalism as another meaning of anarchism, but to the meaning of anarchism that anarcho-capitalists use. It is clear that they use a different meaning, because they feel anarchism entails things that none of the other anarchists do. Further, the standard anarchism definition has not been allowed to be used in the anarchism article because of objections solely coming from anarcho-capitalists, which again arise from the fact that they use the word anarchism to mean something else. And that is exactly what the disambiguation page makes clear right now, it shows both meanings and links to the articles that use them. Now perhaps you are suggesting that there should be a specific anarchism (capitalist) article to deal with their different understanding of anarchism. That is fine, then it should link to the disambiguation page and then provide links to the AC article from there. But either way is fine with me. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 21:21, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Keep</b>. Wasn't this (more or less) what Hogeye was fighting for earlier? I see RJ's points in that this isn't really a classic "disambiguation" case where there are two completely different meanings or contexts of a word; it would be nice if everybody could agree on one "broad tent" that could fairly encompass all the varieties of anarchism, capitalist and socialist alike. But it doesn't look like <i>that</i> is ever happening, and I, for one, have no desire for eternal edit wars. A disambig page, and sub-pages giving the definitions of anarchism as seen by the disparate movements that use the word, is the best that can be hoped for. Let's all at least agree on this, and then work to "tweak" all the pages into a state that fairly presents their subject matter. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan*</a> 00:51, July 16, 2005 (UTC)</s> On second thought, <b>Delete</b>... the latest edits to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> have removed the need for this, so we should probably stick with <i>that</i> instead. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan*</a> 01:24, July 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Above vote was made before I found the section on anarcho-capitalism in the main anarchism article. That strikes me as reasonably satisfactory. The problematic thing, then, is that the link to the main anarchism article on the dab page reads "Anarchism (anti-capitalist)", when in fact it points to an article that is not entirely about anti-capitalist anarchism. That, plus the fact that the {{Anarchism}} template doesn't mention anarcho-capitalism. But if the main article points to the anarcho-capitalism article, we don't need the dab page. So: <b>delete</b> the dab page, and <b>add</b> anarcho-capitalism to the {{Anarchism}} template. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 06:13, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> article and template change many times a day.

<li><b>Delete</b> -- there is a lot more in the supposed disambiguation page than disambiguation; there is no ambiguity between these two, <i>Anarchism</i> means anarchism per the manifesto, or more generally as supporting abolishment of all forms of government; there is a reason the word <i>Anarcho-capitalist</i> is used, the very use of that word <i>implies</i> a difference from Anarchism, and that it is not what users will be looking for when they want Anarchism: let <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> briefly explain the distinction and link to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 02:48, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> After reading the current version of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a>, this disambiguation page seems entirely unnecessary. There's a section that describes anarcho-capitalism briefly and links to it in the schools of thought section. I don't see what purpose this page serves other than to game the NPOV rules to support someone's agenda. It'd be a bit like saying that you can't give the skeptical response to paranormal phenomenon or CAM in their articles, but instead must have a disambiguation page for each of them. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 06:02, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
