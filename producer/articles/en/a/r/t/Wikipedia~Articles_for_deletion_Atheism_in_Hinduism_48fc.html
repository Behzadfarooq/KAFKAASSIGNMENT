<li><b>Reply</b> Atheist hindus is completely a misleading heading, Just emphasising atheists as infidels. We are talking about philosophies here, not personal views. You may say samkhya to be a non-hindu philosophy, but all scholars define it as a Hindu philosophy <i>(with no exception)</i>. And even if you read a three line text about Samkhya anywhere(reliable), you will come to a statement that Samkhya was a atheistic philosophy.<a href="../../../n/i/d/User%7ENidhishsinghal_5350.html" title="User:Nidhishsinghal">nids</a><a href="../../../n/i/d/User_talk%7ENidhishsinghal_a3a7.html" title="User talk:Nidhishsinghal">(♂)</a> 18:44, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for the above reply. So now, atleast i will not have to fight to define it as an hindu philosophy. You can check hinduism archives, there were a few users who contested this claim by saying that this is an extinct philosophy and does not have any contemporary followers. Now, the only thing required is to prove that they were atheistic.

<li><s><b>Delete</b>.</s> Apart from the hardly authoritative sources, the notion of "atheism in &lt;a religion&gt;" seems to be a contradiction in and of itself, and the article does nothing to resolve this, apart from possibly misunderstanding <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheism</a> to mean the disbelief in a <i>creator</i> deity, specifically. There may be a real religious encyclopedia topic around here, but this particular article is mislabeled at best and probably just rather confused <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. The notion of Hinduism as a not (principally) religious, but political movement is already covered at <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindutva</a>, if that's what at issue here. (Incidentally, an <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheist_Jew_093d.html" title="Atheist Jew">atheist Jew</a> is just an atheist member of a cultural/ethnic group, no contradiction there.) <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 21:04, 7 September 2006 (UTC) [<i>Vote changed, see below. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 07:17, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</i>]</li>

<dd>Dear Sandstein, atheism in religion may be a contradiction in Abrahamic religions which are bound to what their books say. Hinduism is like science. Views are not put forth or discarded summarily. If science puts forth the idea of multi-verse or strings, it is considered without bias by other scientists. Scientists who cannot keep their biases separate from research are no scientists. The same thing happens in Hinduism. The guiding factor is the search for truth. If this search leads someone to discard the theory of a creator God, that is perfectly alright. Hinduism is more than just God. Family, society, and traditions also are important. There is nothing political about the search for truth. Yes, Samkhya, Vaisesika, and Purva Mimamsa are atheistic, there is nothing supernatural about them, this was the belief of those people, just as much valid as anybody else's. <a href="../../../a/u/p/User%7EAupmanyav_8378.html" title="User:Aupmanyav">Aupmanyav</a> 05:44, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Let me further elaborate why I think a Hindu atheist is possible. I believe a Hindu can be described as a member of a cultural group. Growing up in a Hindu family, I identify with many aspects of the culture and philosphy. I even participate in communal religious rituals such as <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durga_Puja_198d.html" title="Durga Puja">Durga Puja</a> which I identify with wholly on a cultural level. I do not believe in the deities themselves. Further, if Jews can claim a term "atheist Jew" on the grounds of lineage and culture, how is it that I cannot when I belong within the purvey of the caste system which is also hereditary and part of practical Hindu culture?--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntorjal_c04f.html" title="User:Antorjal">Antorjal</a> 04:10, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Let me also add that in that sense, it is hard to be an "atheist" without the tag "Hindu atheist" if one is from a Hindu family and one resides in India. Such a person is constantly evaluated on the basis of their caste, their food habits, and their place in the social and cultural hierarchy, which for such a person is predominantly Hindu. Even by my not being a believer, had to perform certain rituals at my grandmother's cremation because it was expected of me at a cultural level. No one cared what I believed or if I believed in the deites themselves. I am not taking a POV on this, only a dispassionate view of a fact.--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntorjal_c04f.html" title="User:Antorjal">Antorjal</a> 04:19, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Reply</b> It doesn't have "atheistic properties". Historically, Samkhya and Mimamsa philosophies did not believe in a creator god, much like the <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhists</a>. But they believed in <i>gods</i>. Specifically, Mimamsais a philosophy built on sacrifices for the gods.

Madhava Acharya, the remarkable 14th century philosopher, wrote this rather great book called Sarvadarshansamgraha, which discussed all the religious schools of thought within the Hindu structure.

<dd><b>Reply</b> The article you quoted is of five pages. Have <i>you</i> gone through the entire thing? Where in the article does he say Atheism has been always a part of Hinduism? I once again went through it. He talks about "Indian culture" throughout. His observations may or may not be in line with the beliefs of present-day Hindus, that is a different issue. "<i>Sen believes Hindu nationalists (and American "clash of civilizations" theorists) distort India's history with their singular focus on the Hindu tradition, a theme he again takes up in Identity and Violence</i>" Therefore he is in favour of removing the "singular focus" on "Hindu tradition" and favours atheist/ other views too. But how is this a source for Atheism in Hinduism, as this needs to be in Atheism in India? <sup>Babub</sup>→<a href="../../../b/a/b/User_talk%7EBabub_afb5.html" title="User talk:Babub"><font color="DarkBlue">Talk</font></a> 15:13, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Hinduism is not simply a religion in the conventional sense of the word. There is scope for agnostism and athism while being a Hindu. In the <i>Wonder that was India</i>, Prof Basham details a Hindu sect that practiced athism. - <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenu62_2094.html" title="User:Venu62">Parthi</a> 04:06, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - There are two aspects of question. (1) Whether there was any atheism in Hinduism in history. This question may be debated. The Atheist Hindus will clearly find it in the Darshanas. The Theist Hindus will fail to see any evidence. But there is a second angle also. (2) Hinduism is not an Abrahamic religion which is limited by what is written in a book or has been declared as truth by a representative of God. It is an evolving religion. At one time we were worshipping local Bhairavas and Kshetrapalas, then we were worshipping Vishnu, Shiva, and Shakti, we were joined by people who were worshipping Indra, Varun, Surya, and Agni. Sri Adi Sankaracharya believed all-inclusive Brahman, Sri Madhvacharya informed us that God and jiva are essentially different, Sri Ramanujacharya said that in special conditions God and Jiva are same, Sri Nimbarkacharya said God and Jiva are separate as well as different. We revere all these Acharyas and also the writers of verses in the Vedas and the Darshanas. Hindu Atheists of today may or may not believe in the existence of a Brahman, may or may not believe in a God creator. The controversy is as old as the Nasadeeya Sukta. Please explain, how any one can fetter our Hinduism into believing this or that. That is our birth-right. We go by what Valmiki made Rama say in his Ramayana: 'Satyam eva eeshvaro loke, satyam padmaa samaashritaa; satyamoolaani sarvaani, satyaan naasti param padam.' (Truth alone is god in this world, all virtues are established in truth; all are rooted in truth, there is nothing higher than truth.) <a href="../../../a/u/p/User%7EAupmanyav_8378.html" title="User:Aupmanyav">Aupmanyav</a> 05:29, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Dear friend Babub, I am not being emotional. I am explaining a basic principle of Hinduism so that it does not become an Abrahamic religion. Hinduism is a multicolored tapestry and at least, I am proud of it. It is the only religion (even Buddhism has its own prejudices) in the world which is that brave. Had it fettered my search for truth in anyway, I would perhaps not have been a hindu. It is possible that in the days to come there would be more people like me. Keep the article wherever you want, but asking for its deletion would not be fair to Hinduism.

<dd>Aup, I appreciate, as a Brahmana that you perform the duties required of you. I totally agree that our tradition empahsises solely on karmas, rather than "philosophy" as such. And this means that one can have any philosophy one wants but should do the karmas. This is basically the philosophy of the Gita. <sup>Babub</sup>→<a href="../../../b/a/b/User_talk%7EBabub_afb5.html" title="User talk:Babub"><font color="DarkBlue">Talk</font></a> 11:58, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, obviously. In reference to DaGizza's comment above, to say that none of the modern cultural side of Hinduism has any traces of atheism is incorrect if one chooses to define Hinduism as some people do, which is a belief in the accuracy of a way of thought or pattern of inquiry, rather than of a single set of beliefs and strictures. I quote the first line of WP's article on religion: <i>Religion is a system of social coherence based on a common group of beliefs or attitudes concerning an object, person, unseen being, or system of thought considered to be supernatural, sacred, divine or highest truth, and the moral codes, practices, values, institutions, and rituals associated with such belief or system of thought.</i> . It should be clear that Hinduism,including monotheistic, polytheistic, atheistic, and even "whatever, dude" agnosticism, can be defined, even today -perhaps especially today - as an (a) socially coherent (b) a common group of beliefs in a system of thought considered to be the highest truth and (c)morality and institutions associated with that system of thought. This is more than abstruse philosophy, it is a central question about self-identification. If I choose to say I am both an atheist and a Hindu, and also have historical precedents for my beliefs going back as far as anything in Hinduism, it ceases to be philosophy and becomes practice. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 06:16, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So i guessed correctly. You must have also wrote the Hinduism article extensively, that is how the brahmana part in the intro came from. A clear POV. I dont know any vaishnavite or shaivite who regards his gods as a Brahmana. Just understand that Advaita Vedanta&#160;!= Hinduism. Advaita vedanta is just a subset of hinduism. Dont try to impose your faith on others. Take a break for yourself and understand that Hinduism is much more than Advaita Vedanta.<a href="../../../n/i/d/User%7ENidhishsinghal_5350.html" title="User:Nidhishsinghal">nids</a><a href="../../../n/i/d/User_talk%7ENidhishsinghal_a3a7.html" title="User talk:Nidhishsinghal">(♂)</a> 15:26, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
