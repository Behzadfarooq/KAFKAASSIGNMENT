<p>Aside from the "Worldwide Campaigns" material (which is discussed <a href="../../../g/a/m/Games_Workshop_bae0.html#Worldwide_Campaigns" title="Games Workshop">elsewhere</a>), is nothing more than advertising links for fan websites.

<li><b>Keep</b>. As outlined on the <a href="../../../g/a/m/Talk%7EGames_Workshop_Online_Community_e365.html" title="Talk:Games Workshop Online Community">talk page</a>, it is not an indiscriminate list of advertising links for fansites. The article outlines the official Games Workshop Online Community, the wider fan-based community and the Worldwide Campaigns run by the company (which are a part of the community). Games Workshop itself has encouraged fansites, especially in regard to "house rules" (<a href="../../../g/a/m/Games_Workshop_Online_Community_bb6c.html#_note-house_rules" title="Games Workshop Online Community">1</a>). However, to be included in the article, any fansites must first assert some form of notability, be neutral, and most importantly, be verifiable. Between the 23rd and 30th October, a number of articles underwent AfD:

</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The result was to delete these articles, but the emerging consensus was that they be mentioned in this article or at <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_the_Ring_Online_Campaign_e542.html" title="War of the Ring Online Campaign">War of the Ring Online Campaign</a> where appropriate, by merging important information that could <i>cite sources</i>. This was supported both by the deletion nominator <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> and closing administrator <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a>, with no objections.</dd>
<dd>Also, no site can be mentioned if it has fewer than 2000 members. The Lord of the Rings sites listed do not fail <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, as they outline their notability; for example, they demonstrate that they have won indepedant awards, been published in independant and verifiable sources, distributed through independent online websites and publication, been the subject of 'non-trivial published works', appeared on radio, run e-zines and online campaigns, and provided articles on the aspects of the Games Workshop hobby. Personally, I think the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_Rings_Strategy_Battle_Game_b876.html" title="Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game">Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game</a> it long enough already regarding the online community, and that the detail which asserts notability with sources is best off here.</dd>
<dd>As for the Warhammer sites, they can undergo review individually and be removed or copyedited as appropriate. Also, the small sections given to them within each system (LotR SBG, WFB &amp; W40K) could be merged into three single, more managable sections. --<a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrimhelm_9989.html" title="User:Grimhelm">Grimhelm</a> 16:38, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - the only website that asserts any real notability is the "Last Alliance" one, which has some citations. No other website listed does so - I don't believe hosting your own awards, having "comprehensive submission guidelines" or having a few members who have had a fan-submission published in <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Dwarf_%28magazine%29_aeee.html" title="White Dwarf (magazine)">White Dwarf</a> makes a website notable. <s>It should also be noted that that "emerging consensus" was only for the Last Alliance site, because, as mentioned, notability has been asserted.</s> --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthBinky_672c.html" title="User:DarthBinky">DarthBinky</a> 16:49, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - it was also suggested for "Cheeseweb" and "The Dark Council". In regard to the One Ring, it is the oldest continuous forum site on the internet for LotR SBG, and the first to publish a fan supplement (on material which was later covered in an official GW supplement). It also runs campaigns and e-zines. --<a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrimhelm_9989.html" title="User:Grimhelm">Grimhelm</a> 17:01, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - running your own "e-zine" or online campaign does not provide notability, per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>- <i>The content is distributed via a medium which is both well known and <b>independent of the creators</b>, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.</i> (emphasis mine). Simply being the oldest website is trivial.

<dd>As for consensus, it is clear from the editors' comments at the AfD's, and how no one objected.

<li><b>Comment</b> - all I see with this article is an attempt to circumvent the AFDs (note that both "Last Alliance" articles were speedy deleted) for these websites' articles by lumping them into this quasi-directory (and directories fail <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>). The "Worldwide Campaigns" section is word for word out of the Games Workshop main article; other than that, this article is nothing more than a web directory (with nothing more than the arbitrary threshold of 2000+ members being the prerequisite for inclusion, it seems). The only comment I can find that supports the "emerging consensus" is from <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> in the "Dark Council" AFD- and it supports what I already suggested, that the little meaningful content in this article can be mentioned in already existing articles (in external links). --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthBinky_672c.html" title="User:DarthBinky">DarthBinky</a> 17:40, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The article is not trying to circumvent the AfDs - note how "Cheeseweb" and "The Dark Council" are <i>only mentioned in name</i>, whereas their respective articles were considerably longer. The "threshold" is merely a guideline to quickly identify non-notable sites - they still have to assert notability and be verifiable. --<a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrimhelm_9989.html" title="User:Grimhelm">Grimhelm</a> 17:55, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<b>Keep</b> - I'm in the process of getting together a list of the "best" forums for Specialists Games, using the Moderators of the SG forum (of which I'm one), which in itself was one of the few GW forums to survive the cull. I could just pull out any old list, ut I'm trying to find the ones that are worthy of being mentioned. In my opinion, as an old-time GW gamer, it's the community outside of my own little gaming circle that keeps me interested. For example, without the biggest Bloodbowl forum (talkbloodbowl) I'd never got into tournaments, and wouldn't have met so manypeole that I consider as friends. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkson_9263.html" title="User:Darkson">Darkson - BANG!</a> 00:25, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: This article is about how the Games Workshop has created an online community, and how it has influenced the company's games. For example, as Darkson has noted, GW's support for its specialist games is almost exclusively via its forums. The same is true of their Middle-earth naval ruleset, <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_at_Sea_44c9.html" title="All at Sea">All at Sea</a>, which aside from a few White Dwarf articles, is entirely on the internet. Of the 300000+ registered members of the Games Workshop website alone, not all of them post on the fora; many of them are there to receive newsletters or use the site's article resources.<br />
In regard to the community as a whole, the unofficial sites of the fanbase are just as important; for example, the articles produced by each respective site for the public, and the content featured in White Dwarf, are key hobby resources; also, the influence the community has had on the Worldwide Campaigns, and indeed in creating their own; and indeed the huge backlash by <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle-earth_canon.html" title="Middle-earth canon">Tolkien purists</a> against the company's rendition of the Knights of Dol Amroth. All these have impacted the hobby and the sales of the products. --<a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrimhelm_9989.html" title="User:Grimhelm">Grimhelm</a> 15:16, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: no, it's not. The article is about "the registered members of any internet fora or websites specifically for the Games Workshop miniature wargames" (or at least, that's what the first sentence says) and it is currently not much more than a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">directory</a> of forums related to GW's games, very few of which appear to actually be notable. An article along the lines of "Influence of the fan community on Games Workshop's products" (preferably with a less clumsy title) would be encyclopedic if decent sources could be found, but this isn't.

<li><b>Comment</b>: That is not a reason for deletion - that is a strong motion for cleanup. The reason the notable ones don't have articles is for "forumcruft", etc. By limiting the length of entries, it helps avoid superfluous NPOV edits from anons - in fact, you could easily cut down non-notable material, and restructure it per some of the points I have outlined above. I would be willing to undertake this cleanup. --<a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrimhelm_9989.html" title="User:Grimhelm">Grimhelm</a> 15:16, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Firsty, there are a broad number of sites within the community, as is stated in the article (hence having to cut out the site directory). The article covers how these sites collectively contribute to the community, and a lot of the information is spread across the internet. The "broad notability" of this community of sites is the influence they have had on Games Workshop miniature wargames; a non-community member would, for example, be interested in the hobby articles and rulesets available on these sites, or in how the community has influenced the production of miniature figures. (<i>Eg.</i> In one magazine, the community was mentioned as having "huge wealth of material").<br />
It should also be made clear that the community is <i>not</i> a computer game, and the online campaigns are just an organising of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Miniature_wargames.html" title="Miniature wargames">miniature wargames</a> collectively, to play out the effects of each game on a map (so these more similar to a chess tournament than to an online game - in fact, they were originally run by mail before the internet). This article is very important for the <a href="../../../g/a/m/Games_Workshop_bae0.html" title="Games Workshop">Games Workshop</a> parent article (and also the parent <a href="../../../g/a/m/Games_Workshop_bae0.html#Miniatures_games" title="Games Workshop">articles covering its games</a> and products), and you would not find out everything on the official site; this article covers the contributions of other sites to games such <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_Rings_SBG_d5fb.html" title="Lord of the Rings SBG">LotR SBG</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warhammer_Fantasy_Battle_df5e.html" title="Warhammer Fantasy Battle">WFB</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warhammer_40000.html" title="Warhammer 40000">W40K</a>, and also the specialist games for which they are almost the sole resource. --<a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrimhelm_9989.html" title="User:Grimhelm">Grimhelm</a> 19:05, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> addressing Grimhelm's last comments:
<ol>
<li>Except, as already mentioned, most still fail <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> for notability.</li>
<li>There is no proof that "the online community" has actually influenced model production. That's a big assertion that would require some reference to back it up; I haven't seen such yet. Same goes for the claims about the website that affected Orcs during Storm of Chaos- you have no citation that proves that that website actually influenced it in the way this article claims. In fact, there are absolutely no secondary sources to this article, and it shows- the descriptions of each website read more like advertisements than neutral commentary.</li>
<li>Your example is flawed because that magazine was White Dwarf, which is directly tied into this- it's a primary source, and it wasn't referencing "the community" as a whole, it was referencing exactly one website (The Last Alliance).</li>
<li>Again, none of those sites are notable- not a single one of them would survive an AFD (the only one that <i>could</i>, TLA, has already failed), which is what I meant earlier- this "article" is nothing more than an attempt to avoid an AFD for each website by collecting them into a quasi-directory and claiming it's an article about a "community". Yes, it's slightly better now that it's not just a big list of websites, but not much better. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthBinky_672c.html" title="User:DarthBinky">DarthBinky</a> 03:56, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: As mentioned above, this is not about the individual websites. It is about how a group of websites have influenced a company and a hobby. In the Warhammer section, we now have only two mentioned in passing, and mererly to illustrate the point. I also added two references to the statement about sales as you asked - and one of them <i>is</i> a secondary source. I would improve this more, but with it so close to AfD closure already I'm not sure if it would be worth the efferot. <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrimhelm_9989.html" title="User:Grimhelm">Grimhelm</a> 07:58, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b>: I beg to differ. It <i>is</i> about the websites. There's no content to the article besides discussion of the websites. There's no secondary sources proving its assertions- yes there's the single secondary source, but it doesn't support what the article states (it is a financial statement saying that GW had a shortfall in 2005, but it doesn't mention the online community's effect at all, making it worthless as a reference). As I said in my last comment, not one of the assertions are backed up. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthBinky_672c.html" title="User:DarthBinky">DarthBinky</a> 12:38, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: But this is collectively, and not individual random advertising as you assume. For example, you said: "<i>Same goes for the claims about the website that affected Orcs during Storm of Chaos- you have no citation that proves that that website actually influenced it in the way this article claims. In fact, there are absolutely no secondary sources to this article, and it shows- the descriptions of each website read more like advertisements than neutral commentary.</i>"<br />
What website do I claim affected the Orcs? <i>Anyone</i> who took part in that campaign was part of the community, and the article merely states that the community influenced the campaign. It does not credit it to one website, and the two sources given are the secondary GW sources (in this context GW was reporting on the progress of a campaign played by the fanbase). Also, there are no "descriptions of each website"; any websites cited are only mentioned as sources in relevant context to the community and the hobby as a whole - not a directory of advertisements as you claim.<br />
And for the financial statement, that was the year Games Workshop started releases non-film related material, to which many Tolkien purists had an adverse reaction. I have given a source of a reaction to the release and one on the sales that coincided with that time, but if I did some more searching I could easily find additional sources. And even now, that still only leaves <i>one</i> assertion that you dispute. --<a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrimhelm_9989.html" title="User:Grimhelm">Grimhelm</a> 17:52, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
