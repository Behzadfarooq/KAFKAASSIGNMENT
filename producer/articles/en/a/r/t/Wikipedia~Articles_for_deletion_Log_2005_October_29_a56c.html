<li><b>Weak keep</b> I guess. The movie role is IMDB-verified, but apparently quite minor (he's almost at the bottom of the cast list).

<li><b>Keep</b>. aaron c. donahue has proven his worth as a remote viewer, the many predictions he has made are accurate. but thats not what this is about. aaron played a minor role in a movie, in the search off and on tv asahi in japan, he was on coast to coast a few times see <a href="http://ummo.cc/Media/Media.html" class="external text" title="http://ummo.cc/Media/Media.html" rel="nofollow">coast to coast tv asahi and in search off</a> and on a internet based radio show called <a href="http://www.ghostlytalk.com/ContentExpress-display-ceid-2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ghostlytalk.com/ContentExpress-display-ceid-2.html" rel="nofollow">ghostly talk</a>.(you have to scroll down a bit) he has his own online radio show. which broadcasts continously, featuring his shows and music. there are over 30 recordings of his shows, and he is know among people on the internet. the luciferian movement has there own <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Luciferian_Remote_Viewing_Group/" class="external text" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Luciferian_Remote_Viewing_Group/" rel="nofollow">luciferian yahoo group</a>, who have over 230 members. they have there own <a href="http://luciferian.diydating.com/" class="external text" title="http://luciferian.diydating.com/" rel="nofollow">dating site</a>, which is not very good (my opinion of course). and a news site, forum, chat and numerous spinoff sites like <a href="http://www.luciferianrvg.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.luciferianrvg.com/" rel="nofollow">luciferian rvg</a>. if any one is interresting i could post more links but i am not advertising, the fact is that many people know aaron and are familiar with luciferianism. there is a luciferian community, aaron is resposible for its creation, and he has made enough public apearences both on tv and radio to justify a article about him. if the size about the article is the probleme i could do something about that, but mind you i am not a native english speaker. i am dutch and i do not control the english language to such a degree, that i am able to make a lot of good wikipedia articles.</li>

Keep! There is an entire community started by him.

<p>The same arguments hold true. Sources can be found only for "Caschera" being a surname, and we don't generally keep surnames. Despite repeated requests, the anonymous editor who asserts that the Caschera were a "group of legandary figures" "accredited with the founding of Brocco" has failed to come up with credible sources. Please see the talk page for the discussion. <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keep.html" title="Keep">Keep</a> The Murgatroyd reference is real. I have a copy right in front of me. Page 98 talks about the characters. How do you assume a hoax when there is evidence and references made about them throughout classical history; please see suetonius and plutarch. Pliatas has his heart on killing the story, for some reason we can not figure out. Most other sources are in Italian. They are mentioned heavily thorughout the history of Sora. Given that this is not considered a major city today, you wont find many of these books, nor will they be in English. The locations are real, and the history is also real. There is a monument in the town attested to the Cascheras. Also, lets not forget that this is more likely a legend rather than historical fact. If it is history, it was most likely written several years after the fact. Similar to the stories of Romulus and Remus, which can actually vary according to Author. A set of twins who were raised by a she wolf is very unlikely. Italians, especially ancient Romans and other mediterraneans love to come up with aetiological stories. What other cedible sources would you like? Go to the area ask a native, they will tell you. I find it a bit hilarious that wikipedia can be so ignorant and stubborn about this story. By not allowing this story, we are limiting our users' knowledge of ancient and possibly even mythological history.

<p>vanity article; not significant person</p>

<p>Being the Christopher M. Knight that is the person in question, I disagree with the delete entry nomination. How can a user "Carax" nominate me for deletion if Carax is not a valid Wikipedia User? Carax posted only 35 minutes before DakotaKahn... Doesn't that look a little coincidental?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep: The case for why this entry should not be deleted:</b> I've been on the net for more than a decade and my thousands of articles and permission-based email newsletters impact more than 1 million unique humans on a monthly basis. While it appears I am not significant to DakotaKahn, I am significant to the 82,000 people who visited just one of my websites today. Please do not delete this entry. Thank you, Christopher M. Knight of Wisconsin. 06:31, 29 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: User:Carax is a registered Wikipedia user; the fact that his name is in red just means that he hasn't created a user page (there's no requirement to do so). If he were a non-registered user, he would only be identifiable by IP address. Also, I see nothing unusual about somebody responding to an AfD nomination within 37 minutes; at any time of day, various Wikipedians are reading the Articles for Deletion page. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 16:03, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Mr. Knight, nobody is suggesting deleting *you*--only an article about you. Was it you who originally wrote it? I don't think it is proper for you to either write an article about yourself here or vote against it's deletion. There's a reason for calling such actions "vanity." Having said that, the subject of the article is somewhat notable. I think the article should stay and be expanded, but it wouldn't hurt my feelings if it were deleted.</li>

<p>The above are just a few of the 8,600+ references on the 'net which prove the legitimacy of the publication. For a "non-biased" group, you guys are pretty quick to declare something a hoax or a fraud and do a poor job of research given that the candidates are registered on dozens of government websites as given above, which is all the more reason why the article should be in the wikipedia.</p>
<p>However, maybe this article should be represented on the wikipedia under another topic and refined as more of a research article. We would be open to suggestions. Our campaign staff is still learning the "wikipedia" forum and would like to have this article posted similar to "Patrick Fitzgerald", which is the format we followed. The original user's page (drezac) was created as a means to access the wiki and publish the "profile" of this Vp candidate. The "source watch" issue is because we are still learning your system and followed the Patrick Fitzgerald format.</p>
<p>John Joseph Kennedy was the candidate who ran for President, is a direct descendant of Francis Michael Kennedy (first Kennedy in U.S. politics who served as a Congressman in South Carolina House of Reps in 1882-1886), is related to the Kennedys of Boston, and is running for 2008 (see www.johnjosephkennedy.com), so we know this will become even more newsworthy as time goes by. We have a national campaign staff of hundreds of members (required in order to have electors and register in all of the states). If you want us to prove it, give me your phone number and we can have over 100 people call you in a matter of minutes since we do weekly conference calls with all of the staff.</p>
<p>We published it under different article names (Daniel Robert Rezac, Dan Rezac, Daniel R Rezac, and Daniel Rezac) because your search engine does not pull it up unless it is an "identical" match and we don't care to have it under the login name of "Drezac", which is why it is identical to the user homepage. We apologize if we have fumbled it up. We are still learning your system. We can clean it up and put it under one article name (preferably "Daniel Robert Rezac" and redirect the others to this one) if you give us the chance to make the correction and still allow it to be posted on the wiki. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrezac_2fda.html" title="User:Drezac">Drezac</a></p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: There are a tons of century-old buildings around the United States and they don't all deserve their own encyclopedia entry. In a lot of older, more-established countries, a century-old building barely registers on the radar because there are so many. We can't put every single old building in the world on the site (uh, at least they can't get all their own entries). For the record, I'm not hugely opposed to keeping this entry, I just don't think it's necessary unless they can prove that there's more to it than "the oldest building on campus, once a hospital and now a dorm". That's not much for notability. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDevotchka_2455.html" title="User:Devotchka">Devotchka</a> 01:28, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

The First Hill page has been up for mere minutes and it already has several dedicated members of the hall (myself included) adding everything we know and love about 1HL's present and past. The article will be visited by many more members of the hall and of the school soon and more pertinent info delving into <a href="../../../n/c/s/NCSSM_62e9.html" title="NCSSM">NCSSM's</a> history will surface.

Though the statistics on those pages (and those on the hundreds practically identical to them) are absolutely mesmerizing, I don't think they would "warrant entry into Wikipedia" as they are solely about existence. Pages about small towns are trivial; a 1HL page would discuss the people and events that tie the hall together making the page infinitely more interesting than some of the tidbits that <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html" title="User:Rambot">user:Rambot</a> (the bot that creates many of those geography pages) adds. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowmanmelting_ab56.html" title="User:Snowmanmelting">Snowmanmelting</a> 02:27, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>As the "SLI" on first hill (and a wikipedia lover), I'll weigh in some. First, take a look at the deletion guidelines, especially, "What wikipedia is not."</p>
<ol>
<li>1 What Wikipedia is not</li>
</ol>
<pre>
   * 1.1 Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia
   * 1.2 Wikipedia is not a dictionary
   * 1.3 Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought
   * 1.4 Wikipedia is not a propaganda machine
   * 1.5 Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links, images, or media files
   * 1.6 Wikipedia is not a free host or webspace provider
   * 1.7 Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information
   * 1.8 Wikipedia is not a crystal ball
   * 1.9 Wikipedia is not censored for the protection of minors
</pre>
<ol>
<li>2 What the Wikipedia community is not</li>
</ol>
<pre>
   * 2.1 Wikipedia is not a battleground
   * 2.2 Wikipedia is not an anarchy
   * 2.3 Wikipedia is not a democracy
   * 2.4 Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy
</pre>
<p>Nothing in there except Potentially "indicrimitate collection of information" fits the bill as reason for deletion. Here's that list.</p>
<pre>
  1. Lists of Frequently Asked Questions. 
  2. Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics such as quotations, aphorisms or persons.
  3. Travel guides. 
  4. Memorials. 
  5. News reports. 
  6. Genealogical entries, or phonebook entries. 
  7. Directories, directory entries, or a resource for conducting business. 
  8. Instruction manuals 
</pre>
<p>In a positive sense, here's reasons to include it. As a random collection of dorm-related information... no, I don't think think that's wikipedia worthy. That would be more a blog or other vanity page.</p>
<p>However, 1st Hill definitely has an unique character that has not yet come across in articles. From our soap-making success/fiasco (1st Hill Fight Club Soap at party) to the assasins spoon game, there's a lot of quirky stuff happening. Is everything quirky worthy of a webpage...maybe. Is everything quirky worthy of a wikipedia entry? Probably not.</p>
<p>But my case would be, given enough interest in writing articles related to first hill, its inclusion would benefit those folks interested in applying to the school of science and math who are interested in its personality and fit as a school. School web pages are not an option... and merging into the greater NCSSM wikipedia is too much of a scope shift - 1st hill has its own flavor, most definitely, and it would be like deleting an entry on chocolate (complete with bean information and histories of creation) to include that material under the general ice cream category. information which may be useful to more people than just chocolate growers would be lost in the subsuming.</p>
<p>There's my weighing in. merge if it becomes poorly added to.Aspiringbodhisattva 04:27, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I thought i'd add my support for the retention of this article. Here at Oxford, we recognise that gentlemen's clubs are an eccentric yet delightful feature of the nation's social history, but not one that should be hermetically sealed in a museum display case. Nor indeed should it forever be associated with the upper classes. Since the inclusion of this article would represent both a recognition of a fine and very much living tradition, and also a strong endorsement of honourable friendship even amongst those without good breeding, such a move surely deserves approbation. I can submit that many of my fellow scholars feel much the same way. Coll. Magd.

<p>Indeed - and moreover, the Gentlemen's Shaving Club is not only notable for being a feature of the nation's social history, but for in itself being a profound socio-political experiment. In very few such groups in the UK are social classes and opinions so mixed. Nor, in fact, do they permeate so widely outside their original area of influence. As a social, cultural and political entity of renown, I promote retention. Coll. Sanc. Ioh. Bapt.

<li>I thought the purpose of Wikipedia was to let people who are experts in particular areas contribute articles. To most people swinging might be just dancing but you can't ignore millions of people who are looking for specific sexual terms like "hot wife" and "slut wife".

<li>You're more than welcome to write more on the "hot wife" article if there's more to it than a simple definition. Definitions don't get their own entries here; they go to the Wiktionary.

<li>I'll add my last comments on the matter. Ask yourself this question. If you were in charge of a public library, would you ban books that you think might not interest people? probably not. Swinging is a sizable subculture, to throw it all in one single page would be unfair to the whole concept of Wikipedia in the first place. This should be the perfect place to share specialized information not selective information --<a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwinger1_d555.html" title="User:Swinger1">Swinger1</a>
<ul>
<li>I'd very quickly ban a book if the only thing in it was a paragraph-long definition for one term. Nobody is trying to ban your subculture. We're all aware that it's huge. These rules on definitions and everything apply to every subject and not just particularly controversial ones. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDevotchka_2455.html" title="User:Devotchka">Devotchka</a> 01:47, 29 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How and why would you ban a book that has not been even written? the article is up for deletion because some people think the term is not worthy of an article or public interest. The problem, with that is that the ones judging don't know enough about the matter in the first place. It would be like me giving opinions on articles about rocket science or gardening. People are proposing to lump everything in swinging which in itself is a whole article. How are people going to find out what is what with policies like these? Wikipedia should be place to expand specialized knowledge.</li>

<li><b>Comment by author</b>. As a resident of Ithaca and creator of the subject entry: Ithaca's nickname "City of Evil" dates back to its earlier name of "Sodom" and a road to Ithaca by that name still exists; the usage is neither new nor original with me, but has a long-standing history. Ithaca's reputation for liberal politics is huge, with both left and right acknowledging it as a nexus of liberal political activity. If you spell "Ithaca" correctly, the Google hits on the topic go way up (first commenter misspelled it): <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=ithaca+%22city+of+evil%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=ithaca+%22city+of+evil%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">644 hits</a>. The "City of Evil" nickname is in common use locally and nationally, with both detractors and supporters of the city using it (the latter with cheerful ironic pride), so while it may originally have been intended as a slur, it has been reclaimed in the same sense that Wiccans have reclaimed "witch". This important transition and usage is sociologically notable, and hence (IMO) worthy of addition to the store of information about Ithaca.

<li><b>Comment</b>. If there are verifiable sources, they should be added to the article. At the moment, all we have is a Cafepress link. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 08:28, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment by author</b>. Good points, so I have added verifiable sources for the historical name, also corrected some context about the resurgent modern usage, and clarified the point of the entry, namely the dual usage of the same nickname by both detractors and supporters. The main article on <a href="../../../i/t/h/Ithaca%2C_New_York_ef00.html" title="Ithaca, New York">Ithaca, New York</a> originally had much unsuitable provocative POV material (if you think mine is POV, you should see how the earlier posts started) which I edited down extensively, and then decided to make a separate detail page for this particular aspect. However, the argument for a merge is compelling, and I would be pleased to merge the separate page under discussion here into the corresponding section of the main Ithaca article. Does that address the concern that landed this article in the "to be deleted" section? If so I'll do the merge. --<a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDayglored_8400.html" title="User:Dayglored">Dayglored</a> 09:11, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment by author</b>. Thanks for the continuing excellent input; I'm learning a lot about how Wiki pages need to be done... BTW, I added a Yahoo-maps link to the remnant of an old road into the city, which still retains the old name "Sodom Rd."

If the consensus is to keep, I can certainly write an article under this title, which would contain a description of the breakdown of the Milky Way Galaxy in the 40K universe (placement of various races, 'notable' planets and sectors, empires, etc), but feel that this kind and level of information has no place on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 12:22, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

Re verification: if I had a phone number for the fraternity, I could do a reverse lookup with Anywho and see what name and address it turns up. There is no (nonprofit) corporation named Phi Pi Rho chartered in Indiana. If I knew the state in which it is chartered and the name it is chartered under, that too would be easy to verify.

<li><b>Comment</b> it's likely that this page stems from a discussion on <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clef.html" title="Clef">Clef</a> which used to contain extensive information on the use of archaic C-clefs for sight transposition, a technique commonly taught in Europe. The weight of that info was too much for <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clef.html" title="Clef">Clef</a>, and the last person to edit it took much of it out but left a redlink for <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sight_transposition.html" title="Sight transposition">Sight transposition</a> where it could later be re-introduced.

<p>Now this one is a bit tricky. The article states that he was ISHR Prisoner of the Month in June 2005, but there are no sources to support it. The <a href="http://www.ishr.org/press/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ishr.org/press/index.html" rel="nofollow">press section of ISHR</a> says nothing about him. A google search for "Yemane Gebre Loul" +ISHR gives 1 - one - hit when excluding Wikipedia mirrors. <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunkmorten_c486.html" title="User:Punkmorten">Punkmorten</a> 10:51, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Seaching for his name throws up a fair bunch of hits - such as <a href="http://www.kath.net/detail.php?id=10807" class="external text" title="http://www.kath.net/detail.php?id=10807" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://www.compassdirect.org/en/newslongen.php?idelement=3817" class="external text" title="http://www.compassdirect.org/en/newslongen.php?idelement=3817" rel="nofollow">this</a>. No idea if this article should stand on its own or if it should go into something like Religious persecution in Saudi Arabia, thus <b>No Vote</b> <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 12:30, 29 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I know, but should we have articles for all religious prisoners? By the way, we already have <a href="../../../s/t/a/Status_of_religious_freedom_in_Saudi_Arabia_452a.html" title="Status of religious freedom in Saudi Arabia">Status of religious freedom in Saudi Arabia</a>.
