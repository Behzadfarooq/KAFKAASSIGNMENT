<li>Longcat extends beyong merely the realm of 4chan. Longcat is not exclusive to one site only. I truely believe that there should be an article explaining what Longcat is so that when they here mention of it, they can find information on the subject.

<li>And a little known fact: Longcat is so long that he can dig from Ohio, through the center of the Earth, and just almost reach China, not quite but almost, by about 2 miles lacking.

<li>I'm not trying to imply that you're a sock, I don't think that you are, only that you're new. There are some who prefer a higher margin of edits to determine suffrage, I'm not sure if that debate ever got settled or not. I'll have to check on that 25 votes thing, I couldnt remember what the stated minimum was when I posted the comment, thanks for reminding me. I'm simply trying to unravel a lot of confusing posts to this discussion, and anytime I have found a user that is not an established editor, I have noted that in this discussion. If you'll note a bit further down, I tagged one other editor similarly to how I tagged your vote, and that editor was voting Delete. I'm not trying to be partisan, only reflect the truth behind every vote to this discussion. In your case, you seem to have enough to count for a bare minimum. The closing admin may not take your edit count into consideration at all.

<li>Wow, are all of you like this? I can't believe I donated to this project. Longcat <i>is notable</i>. How are memes not encyclopedic? This is completely ridiculous. I'm very disappointed. 4chan and /b/ in particular are right up there with the likes of Genmay and <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_6a6b.html" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a> -- notable. If memes don't belong in the Wiki, then what exactly is <a href="../../../i/n/t/Category%7EInternet_memes_6268.html" title="Category:Internet memes">Category:Internet_memes</a> supposed to be? If anything, tracking and documenting memes should be one place the Wiki excels in particular over other encyclopediae. If you were unfamiliar with Longcat (as most of you seem to have been! Guess what, you'd still be unfamiliar with Longcat if it weren't for this Wiki article) and wanted to learn about it, where's the first place you would look? That's right: the Wikipedia. Stop being such elitist pinheads. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 132.239.142.229 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_132.239.142.229_bf3b.html" title="Special:Contributions/132.239.142.229">contribs</a>) 22:23, September 15, 2005.</small>
<ul>
<li>Yes, we generally are all like this. We are interested in facts, and articles of encyclopedic interest. There is disagreement on whether this article is notable enough for inclusion in the encyclopedia. That is why we have the current <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">deletion process in place</a> for Wikipedia. Our goal is to build <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a> on what should be done with questionable articles. If you'd care to look around at some of the other articles being discussed, you'll note that some will probably be deleted, while some will be kept. It's all part of the process. If you want to voice your opinion, you're welcome to, but be aware that we frequently delete articles about various internet forums, and are frequently flooded with anonymous edits from members of that forum seeking to keep the article. That certainly seems to be the case here. We're not really elitist, <i>anyone</i> can get a username, <i>anyone</i> with a username can vote, and votes from established users are considered, no matter what side of a discussion they are on. Votes from anonymous users are not. That is longstanding Wikipedia policy. If you feel there are holes in Wikipedia's coverage of Internet phenomena, I would encourage you to join the site and participate in the process of building an encyclopedia. However, some of the behavior that has been seen in this discussion, such as engaging in sockpuppetry, is quite frowned upon. As far as 4chan, <a href="../../../4/c/h/4chan.html" title="4chan">4chan</a> does have an article, but this discussion is not over that article. Personally, I've heard of Something Awful, but not 4chan. But that is not what this discussion is about, this discussion is about whether Longcat is notable enough for it's own article.

<p><s>*<b>Keep</b> Even though I have an incredibly low chance of being accounted for in this vote, I would like to offer my vote anyway as well as propose a topic for discussion. Why, exactly, are anonymous contributors to this site held in such low regard? Does one's opinion become effectively null when its source is unknown? Whatever happened to the concept of judging one's opinions on their own merit rather than the eminence of the name of the one who speaks? It seems a bit counterintuitive to me to have anonymous posters able to speak their mind freely and yet be completely disregarded. Why are the posters here so dead-set on furthering the perceived values of their internet identities, which at their very core are indeed effectively anonymous?

<li>Anonymous contributions are welcome at Wikipedia, but anonymous users are just as likely yo have their contributions to articles edited as regular users. That's the nature of a wiki. Our policy is to allow established Wikipedia users to vote. Why? Because we are trying to establish a consensus, and we want each person to be able to express their opinion. We do not want that distorted by one person trying to appear as several people. If we allow anonymous votes, what is to stop someone from posting multiple votes from different IP addresses? We have no way at all of trying to ascertain if ten anonymous votes are posted by ten people, or two. So, if you want to vote in RfA discussions, feel free, but you will need to have a username at Wikipedia, and not merely be coming in because of one particular article. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">Ëvilphoenix</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvilphoenix_c095.html" title="User talk:Evilphoenix">Burn!</a></b></small></sup> 21:20, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
