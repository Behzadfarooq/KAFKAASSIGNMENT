<li><b>Keep</b>. For those of you who say that we in Jews Against Circumcision are not really Jews, I hate to break it to you but all you need to be Jewish is to have a Jewish mother. That's Jewish law. Circumcision IS NOT required to be Jewish. My mom is Jewish. I had a Bar Mitzvah and I had a Jewish wedding. So guess what guys, I am a Jew. Now, about the subject matter. Why are you all so threatened? Is it because you don't want to have to be faced with the decision that mutilating your baby's penis is barbaric, mean, wrong and against the mitzvot (we are commanded to not mark our bodies or hurt others - remember that?) It's a no-brainer. Mutilating your son's penis and damaging his future sex life is despicable, and all of you are smart enough to realize that. Yes it's difficult to deal with the fact that our people have been wrong all of these years, but guess what, they have been. Think about how easy it is to look at other religions and see how their practices are wrong (like africans and female genital mutilation, mormons and polygamy, the lack of women's rights in all religions, etc,.) and then take a step back, look at your own religion, and realize it's shortcomings. Circumcision is wrong. Judaism is in your heart, not in your penis! Jews Against Circumcision 02:54, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Was that a personal attack? Is your vote based solely upon your dislike of the nominator? Or do you have a rationale for voting "Keep" that has something to do with the merits of the article? <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 02:24, September 8, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not only was it a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>, it is also an example of failing to <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">assume good faith</a>, and demonstrates complete ignorance of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, which means that no article should be for or against anything. <i>Sigh.</i> - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 11:51, September 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is not a personal attack, but an observation. Another observation is that when someone points out observations like this, you write personal attack. Indeed, One several people including me, pointed out that a supposedly neutral editor was about as neutral to <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genital_Integrity_1e09.html" title="Genital Integrity">Genital Integrity</a> as Professor <a href="../../../s/e/v/Severus_Snape_75dc.html" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> is to Mister <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_James_Potter_59bb.html" title="Harry James Potter">Harry James Potter</a>, you write personal attack, totally ignoring the edithistory of that one. I have no problem with circumcisionadvocates as long as they advocate circumcision only to consenting adults and present those adults with all of the information, not just ⅛ of information favorable to their position. — <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalabio_fa80.html" title="User:Walabio">— Ŭalabio‽</a> 01:01:37, 2005-09-09 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Does this not just state that you're not considering the significance or non-significance of the article to Wikipedia, which is the question here, and rather taking a POV on the issue discussed in the article and using that as the basis for your "keep"? I was the one who proposed a VfD, although I did not create it, on the talk page in question, and I did not propose it because I disagreed, but rather because I think it does not need its own article, at least at this stage, and would much better be found in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brit_milah.html" title="Brit milah">Brit milah</a> where the information is already available in no less quantity than this article. Furthermore, the concept is much more important than the organisation itself. --<a href="../../../j/n/o/User%7EJnothman_5c31.html" title="User:Jnothman">jnothman</a> <a href="../../../j/n/o/User_talk%7EJnothman_b83a.html" title="User talk:Jnothman"><sup>talk</sup></a> 01:51, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Walabio, my personal feelings towards 'genital integrity' do not and furthermore should not make the slightest bit of difference. The same is true of your feelings towards 'circumcisionadvocates'. They are <i>irrelevant</i>. Wikipedian <i>actions</i> are all that matter, and here that means just the vote and reasons stated. Your observation that personal attacks are noted for what they are should come as no surprise. Neither, for that matter, should an RFC on this behaviour if it continues for much longer... - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 09:28, September 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>
