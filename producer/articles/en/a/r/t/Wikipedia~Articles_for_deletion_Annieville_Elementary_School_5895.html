<li><b>Delete all</b>. School articles like this are the shame of Wikipedia. Our critics point at them, and their endless trivialities about the most utterly banal things, and their endless duplication of "facts" which are the same for every one of millions of identical schools across the world, as evidence that Wikipedia is good only for children. They are essentially wrecking our dreams of gaining some credibility as a serious encyclopedia. Do you see hundreds of articles about individual elementary schools in Britannica or Encarta? Nope. Think there could be a reason for that? Hmmm, I wonder. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 18:12, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you're ashamed of Wikipedia, and prefer those other encyclopedias, you should go buy them. They need the sales. People aren't buying enough, because they get what they need here instead. Why on Earth are you editing an encyclopedia with over a million articles, if you hate the existance of those very articles? --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 18:26, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't see the need for WP to pander to our detractors. Besides, their main cause of derision is the <i>edit this page</i> link on every page, something which is WP's major distinction and strength. Having articles that neither encyclopedia will touch is a part of WP's charm and a major distinction between them. I don't see a need for WP to turn into a clone of either. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 18:32, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> all per nomination. Schools have no inherent notability. No individual notability or importance for any of these schools has been suggested or advanced. That said, I still don't like these mass noms, and I'd be willing to reconsider any individual article where someone can show verifiable proof that any particular school listed here is notable or distinct enough from the average school to merit an article (though I don't suppose that will actually be necessary, nor will it likely influence the eventual outcome).--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:05, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reluctant Weak Delete</b>. My reluctance isn't that I'd be sorry to see these articles go, but because of the broad-block nomination. I'd rather be making a strong statement one way or another. While I believe schools are <i>not</i> inherently notable, and there is <i>no</i> policy on keeping or deleting schools, I also concede that some schools may, for very specific reasons, be notable. Until there is a firm policy, I'd prefer to consider each article on its own merits, notability, or non-notability. That all said, none of these articles appears to be about an encyclopedic or notable school. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 02:04, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

I continue my belief that elementary/middle schools' claim to notability is weaker than that of high schools, but I also prefer more info than just a list entry with no further info. Also, block noms of this type are unhelpful, some of these had more info than others. Please start a policy discussion off AfD if you want to change what seems to be current consensus on these articles. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanG_1aea.html" title="User:BryanG">BryanG</a><sup><a href="../../../b/r/y/User_talk%7EBryanG_f39b.html" title="User talk:BryanG">(talk)</a></sup> 06:39, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm going to say the same thing I say every time schools come up on AFD now: I don't particularly <i>like</i> the established consensus in favour of elementary and high school articles, but the consensus is what it is and there's no particular reason to single Canadian schools out as somehow less notable than schools elsewhere. If you'd like to pitch for a rethink of the whole shebang, start a policy discussion (and good luck trying), but in the absence of that there are no valid reasons to treat these differently than other schools. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:12, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Schools are all important. We need more school stubs, not less. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 19:59, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I agree that it doesn't seem appropriate to delete schools on a piecemeal basis when the community has not arrived at consensus on a policy or guideline. I further agree that this is not the place for said policy discussion. The merge or keep and expand comment has good merit however again, this is not the place for policy discussion whether that policy is pro- or anti-deletion. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigNate37_8426.html" title="User:BigNate37">BigNate37</a> 06:59, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. If students' interest in knowledge is increased slightly because they can find their school here, then let Wikipedia err to their benefit. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeetdeet_53b9.html" title="User:Deetdeet">Deet</a> 04:39, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
