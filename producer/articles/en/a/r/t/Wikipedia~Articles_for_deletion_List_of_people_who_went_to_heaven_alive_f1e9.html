<p>I do not believe this topic deserves an article. Putting aside the correctable issue of a misleading title, a "list of people" is inappropriate in this case. An article on the supposed phenomenon of persons entering heaven while still living <i>may</i> be notable and should contain examples but this is not that article and, as far as I know, that article does not exist. An online search for information reveals that there are plenty of sources about <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22elijah%22+%22heaven%22+%22alive%22+-wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22elijah%22+%22heaven%22+%22alive%22+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Elijah</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22serach%22+%22heaven%22+%22alive%22+-wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22serach%22+%22heaven%22+%22alive%22+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Serach</a>, and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22enoch%22+%22heaven%22+%22alive%22+-wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22enoch%22+%22heaven%22+%22alive%22+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Enoch</a> that mention the aforementioned entry into heaven while still alive. However, that information belongs in the individual articles. So, I propose that this article be <b>delete</b>d because:</p>
<ol>
<li>The article does not prove the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> of the subject by providing at least one substantial or multiple non-trivial secondary sources, and I have been unable to prove the topic's notability through my own search.</li>
<li>The article does not provide clear standards of inclusion or exclusion, in violation of <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a>. For instance, not too long ago, this list boasted <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheech_and_Chong_b5c0.html" title="Cheech and Chong">Cheech Marin</a> (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_who_went_to_heaven_alive&amp;diff=111756796&amp;oldid=99156898" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_who_went_to_heaven_alive&amp;diff=111756796&amp;oldid=99156898" rel="nofollow">diff</a>).</li>
<li>Any listing of the handful of characters who supposedly entered heaven while still alive should be contained in an article on the phenomenon itself rather than existing as a stand-alone list.</li>
</ol>
<p>As I believe the problem to be endemic to the topic rather than the just the article, I am skipping the usual steps of tagging the article with various cleanup tags or requesting that the article's author (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Gausie" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Gausie" rel="nofollow">inactive for a month</a>) try to fix it. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 03:32, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>In lieu of the changes made to the article within the past 20 hours (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_who_went_to_heaven_alive&amp;diff=118896092&amp;oldid=118692611" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_who_went_to_heaven_alive&amp;diff=118896092&amp;oldid=118692611" rel="nofollow">diff</a>), I am changing my recommendation to delete and now believe the article is worthy of being <b>kept</b>. The changes have made this a wholly different article that proves the notability of the topic, provides clear(er) standards of inclusion (as clear as we'll have with 2000 year old texts that are disputed), and addresses the general concept of ascension into heaven rather than merely listing persons who could fall in that category.</dd>
<dd>That said, I do not think this AFD should be closed early (i.e., I do not withdraw my nomination). A few editors have already suggested deletion, and even though their comments apply to the old version, a <a href="../../../s/k/_/WP%7ESK_0a05.html" title="WP:SK">speedy close</a> is no longer possible. Additionally, other editors may be able to contribute to the article or to the discussion regarding a new title, currently ongoing at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_people_who_went_to_heaven_alive_fabe.html" title="Talk:List of people who went to heaven alive">the article's talk page</a>. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:04, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> because the list could be improved enormously. I take deep offense at calling this a joke. If you don't know enough about a particular religion, or religion in general, don't go calling subjects related to what people hold sacred a "joke". I'm no expert myself, but I know "People who went to heaven alive" is usually called "translation into heaven" or "assumption into heaven" or "ascension into heaven". From Christianity you could add <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_of_Nazareth_2b3e.html" title="Jesus of Nazareth">Jesus of Nazareth</a> and (at least in Roman Catholic doctrine) <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary%2C_mother_of_Jesus_a284.html" title="Mary, mother of Jesus">Mary, mother of Jesus</a>. The day commemorating her assumption into heaven is a holy day of obligation for Catholics. See <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assumption_of_Mary_03d6.html" title="Assumption of Mary">Assumption of Mary</a>. It's also celebrated in art. See: <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assumption_of_the_Virgin_Mary_742c.html" title="Assumption of the Virgin Mary">Assumption of the Virgin Mary</a>. This hardly indicates that the "topic of people ascending to heaven is extremely minor within Jewish tradition, <i>let alone in the context of a general-interest encyclopedia.</i>" (Emphasis added.) Muslims might also beg to differ, since many believe that <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> also ascended into heaven at the Dome of the Rock. Wikipedia has a short article on it: <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitab_al-Miraj_5eab.html" title="Kitab al-Miraj">Kitab al-Miraj</a>. In Polynesian (or at least Maori) religion, there also seems to be a person (maybe more) who ascended into heaven, but I don't have time to read through <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/pac/grey/grey06.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sacred-texts.com/pac/grey/grey06.htm" rel="nofollow">Rupe's Ascent into Heaven</a>.

<dd>As a <i>subject</i> the list is certainly important enough for an encyclopedia. Since some explanation of which religion(s) consider certain figures to have ascended bodily into heaven is necessary to help a reader navigate through the topic, so a category would be inadequate. I haven't found any source that considers all bodily assumptions into heaven from all religions, but it seems to me it isn't origional research to simply state that the concept exists in various religions and describe how each religion treats the concept in theology and tradition. One day I expect we'll get individual articles on bodily assumption in Judaism, Catholicism, Islam, etc. Perhaps a fuller account of how assumption into heaven relates to how these people are understood is best left to the individual articles on these people, but something is needed for this concept, and I think a list with short descriptions is a worthy start. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 06:07, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><s><b>Keep</b>, as problematic but salvageable. Although not a fan of lists, the nominators first two points, I think, are not valid. #1...Most, if not all, biblical person's existence and actions are attested to only through that document, all other sources derive from that and they are abundant. #2...Vandalism to an article is not a reason for deletion of that article and standards for inclusion could be addressed through a more qualifying title for the article. #3 Raises the best point but could be addressed through renaming...<i>in Christian/Jewish/Muslim theology...</i>, or some such way.

<dd>My second point was not vandalism, but rather a lack of clear criteria for what consitutes "going to heaven alive".

<li><b>Comment</b> Since this article is undergoing some revision, editors in this discussion should take a look back later and see if their opinions still apply. I've begun to make some changes, many more are needed and by editors who are more familiar with the various religions involved, but the article is already a lot different from what it was when nominated. I think this can and should evolve into something more than a list. I'm starting a discussion on the article's talk page about what to name it.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 18:27, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This certainly isn't a joke, and there are sources for the individuals given. However, there are significant <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> problems not solvable simply by changing the title. One difficulty is that there are enormous differences between the degree of belief and sourcing for various individuals. In <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>, for example, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elijah.html" title="Elijah">Elijah</a> is specifically mentioned in the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>, while other figures are mentioned only in relatively minor <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midrash.html" title="Midrash">Midrashic</a> sources. Simply listing them creates an appearance of commonality of belief and importance which simply doesn't exist in the underlying religious traditions. A more fundamental problem is that the whole topic, as it stands, represents <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> -- it claimss a commonality among figures who have different stories. for example it presents them as going to a common, a place called "Heaven", which is impliedly represented as being common to every religion listed, even though not every religion listed has this concept. I'm not sure that changing the name would solve the problem. I'm not questioning that this could be a valid topic. It's the business of original researchers to identify common themes in disparate cultures and to provide explanations why regarding the themes as common is legitimate. But I don't believe it's the business of Wikipedia to do this sort of original research. And it's even less the business of Wikipedia to do it in a way that treats commonality as a hidden assumption which the reader is required to take for granted. The article should at least address the question of whether other religions actually have a comparable concept of "heaven" rather than fitting them into the framework of ones own worldview unquestioningly. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 01:18, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response</b> I've posted requests for editors to look at this article and deletion discussion at WikiProject talk pages for Bible, Christianity, Judaism, Islam and, I think, Religion hoping to get some useable insight of this general sort. But I have to respond that absolutely none of Shirahadasha's points show any reason at all to delete, only to further improve the Judaism section of the article (there's already a notice at the top of that section calling for improvements). There is a Wikipedia article, <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven.html" title="Heaven">Heaven</a>, which is linked to in the top paragraph of this article and where the Jewish concepts of the afterlife are discussed, and it would be proper to note some differences in the concept of heaven or note the absence of the belief in heaven in Judaism, if that's the case. Of course, that explanation would have to address the citations from Genesis and 2 Kings already in the article. I'm going to copy and cross post S's valuable comment above to the article's talk page and respond to other points about article content, which don't need to be addressed further here.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 19:05, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm under a bit of time pressure so I'll just drop a quick note. Noroton, can you discuss the pros and cons of just merging this article into <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven.html" title="Heaven">Heaven</a>? Does it really merit a separate article? --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 19:28, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sure. I think the only reason to separate one article from another related article is to keep article sizes manageable and help readers navigate. If this article and Heaven were smallish and couldn't be expected to grow more, then I think we could merge them. Heaven is 47 Kb long right now and, although I haven't looked closely at that article, I can easily imagine it could grow more (there's a lot of information out there). After Googling this subject, here are the areas where I know or have reason to suspect this article might grow: The entire Judaism section, which should show the significant viewpoints on ascension within Judaism, including, I assume, something on midrash; Christian views on Enoch and Elijah's ascensions; more information on Roman Catholic views, Orthodox Christian views and various Protestant views and how they differ and are alike each other; Islam's significant views on Enoch and Elijah; an adequate explanation on Islam's views on Jesus and ascension; the same for Muhammad; ascension in Polynesian religion; more information on Apollonius of Tyrana and ascension; possible ascension of Chinese emperors (I get intriguing whisps of this but can't find anything that really confirms it). All of these sections should eventually show similarities and differences. Ideally, every major part of this article would summarize better, fuller accounts in other, more specific articles, as well as discuss what reliable sources have to say about the similarities and differences of different religions and sects (this would be the best spot for that information and I'm frustrated that I haven't found it yet). This article is about ascension and belief, but it's not hard to imagine ascension in myth and ascension in fiction.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 20:35, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ouch! Well <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a>, not to waste a lot of time - (a) inaccuracy: the article lists Jesus as someone who entered heaven without dying, however it is a fundamental Christian belief that Jesus died on the cross. The article states "in Christian belief, the privilege of entering heaven without dying is reserved for those who are considered to have been without sin" - but most Christians do not consider Elijah sinless, yet he did enter heaven without dying ... the article states "Belief in the ascension of Christ is part of the Reformed churches tradition" but it is actually part of all orthodox tradition (b) ascension is after death (ie with dying), assumption is before death (ie without dying), (c) hence the whole thing is, imo, incoherent - and un-necessary.

However, those are just arguments that the article could be improved not that it should be deleted. As stated above, one argument for deleting an article is that there should not be an article on this topic because the topic is inherently unencyclopedic. A somewhat different line of argument would assert that the topic is encyclopedic but this particular revision is so hopelessly flawed that it would be better to throw it out and rewrite it than to attempt to save it. I don't think either of these arguments is applicable here. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 22:37, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

It should drop the pretense to being a "list" and be expanded as the article it already is. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html" title="User talk:Askari Mark">(Talk)</a></small> 05:05, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> but <b>rename</b> - This is not a joke as claimed by a self-proclaimed atheist, but a seriously held subject in the three great monotheistic religions. However 'List of' should be dropped from the title. Since it is combining various different kinds of entry into heaven (Translation, ascension, and assumption), perhaps St Paul should also ne mentioned, as he claimed to have been taken up into heaven temporarily, though he did not know if it was in the body or out of it. Some one claimed the reference to Enoch is a minor literary reference - that is true but much has been written and preached about it. The article <a href="../../../t/r/a/Translation_%28Mormon%29_7104.html" title="Translation (Mormon)">Translation (Mormon)</a> has nothing to do with this, and I would <b>oppose</b> any merge with that. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterkingiron_03d3.html" title="User:Peterkingiron">Peterkingiron</a> 22:02, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Strong Delete</b> for the reasons set out in detail over several posts in the article's talk page. To summarize briefly:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mary did not go to heaven alive, her body was assumed after her death.</li>
<li>Jesus was not a 'person,' an ordinary mortal as is meant by all other persons in this list, and experienced death prior to ascension.</li>
<li>Elijah's status, although superficially qualifying, is subject to different interpretations as laid out in the WP articles, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elijah.html" title="Elijah">Elijah</a>, and <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosom_of_Abraham_09ea.html" title="Bosom of Abraham">Bosom of Abraham</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/r/a/Translation_%28Mormonism%29_3114.html" title="Translation (Mormonism)">Translation (Mormonism)</a> was added to the article, but this doctrine does not, as far as I can find, say anything about 'going to heaven.'</li>
<li>Enoch and Sirach, problematic for several reasons, not the least of which is the ambiguity of Judaism on the topic of heaven in general and these personage's fate in particular.</li>
<li>Appolonius of Tyana, not a part of Abrahamic tradition, thus use of the word 'heaven' really cannot be accepted.</li>
</ol>
<p>What we have is a list of disparate persons arriving at arguably different 'destinations' by various means. Assumption, ascension, translation, no commonly accepted terms or processes. I supported this nomination and have spent much time looking into the persons and processes and have to say that all are covered in specific detail in the relevant articles, a list of this type would have to say something like...'List of people/dieties who went somewhere either before or after dying.' I just can't see any way to tie it together in one article. Please, no replies to specific points here. Take it to the article's talk page. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilling_sparrows_c660.html" title="User:Killing sparrows">killing sparrows</a> 01:05, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Please don't since a CfD would likely have a consensus for a list. With a list you can add the date they went, the source, their religion and other information.
