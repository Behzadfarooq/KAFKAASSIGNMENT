<p>The day after Thanksgiving, as celebrated at the University of Colorado - Boulder.</p>
<p>The annual matchup of the CU Buffaloes and the Nebraska Corn Huskers occurs in Boulder, Colorado, every other year, making this one of the few "Biannual" holidays on many people's calenders. It is a major day in every CU fan's fall schedule, as a bitter rivalry is played out on the gridiron of <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folsom_Field_e89d.html" title="Folsom Field">Folsom Field</a> only once every 730 days.</p>
<p>It is said that rivalry between the two schools first started to heat up in 1988, when the "Ghost Fumble" occured. Two years later, Eric Bienemy would go on to score 4 fourth quarter touchdowns to lead the Buffs 27-12 against the Corn Huskers. The next year's game though "the Icing of the Kicker" resulted in a tie as unruly CU fans at <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folsom_Field_e89d.html" title="Folsom Field">Folsom Field</a> threw snowballs onto the field and literally iced the kicker with 4 seconds left in the game. This was just the start of a fierce rivalry that would begin brewing. Other CU highlights include beating the number one Corn Huskers in 2001 62-36 at <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folsom_Field_e89d.html" title="Folsom Field">Folsom Field</a>.</p>
<p>The term Black-Out Friday was invented by Christopher Sorensen and Geno Tavella while driving up to Boulder from Denver for the CU vs Nebraska football game in 2005. It refers to the art of turning the entire day into one big party, which will hopefully be fun for all of the 50,000+ fans that pack Folsom Field that day.</p>
<p>Many people like to practice the art form of Black-Out Friday on a weekly basis, but the offical holiday is reserved for the day after Thanksgiving, when the game is played on Folsom Field, in which everyone nation wide is invited to be part of the celebration.</p>

<p>Leidensneid - taken from the German meaning 'Envy of Suffering'</p>
<p>A psychological explanation of why otherwise prosperous, middle class people, especially young students, voluntarily travel to conflict zones, refugee camps and other seemingly unpleasant places, or support causes or groups who proport systems of government they wouldn't want to live under themselves.</p>
<p>Believed to be based primarily on misplaced idealism on the first hand, with guilt also being a strong but subconcious factor - caused by the acute awareness of never having seen or experienced suffering, pain or violence first hand, and of shame or rejection of a comfortable or problem-free upbringing.</p>
<p>Leidensneid is currently manifested in forms such as young students (and indeed older people) travelling to places such as Iraq, the West Bank etc and becoming involved in conflicts, kidnappings and other violence. Some have been killed or seriously injured in the process. Those involved share many similarities in that they come from comfortable middle class and politically aware backgrounds, and all appear to be motivated by strong idealism. The Iraq war and the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts in particular seems to have motivated such people to act.</p>

<p>a.k.a. "land contract" is normally used to convey equitable title of real property to the purchaser while holding legal title in the sellers' name until a pre-determined agreement has been reached (e.g. payment of a certain percentage of the principal balance due). Equitable title for all intent and purposes makes you the "owner" of the real property. The seller of a land contract is commonly referred to as the "vendor" while the purchaser is commonly known as the "vendee". There are various "land contract friendly" states in the US, while in other states it is extremely difficult to sell a property by means of land contract.</p>

<p>Gary MacLean and Blair MacLean were a well-known Canadian comedy team. MacLean and MacLean performed together for 26 years from 1972 to 1998. The brothers produced 7 albums, playing at least 150 shows each year.</p>
<p>MacLean and MacLean were once prosecuted for "presenting an immoral theater performance". The dismissal of their prosecution was an important milestone in Canadian free speech jurisprudence. Undoubtedly, this helped open the doors to popular new Canadian television shows such as <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trailer_Park_Boys_7c2d.html" title="Trailer Park Boys">Trailer Park Boys</a></p>
<p>The MacLean Brothers appeared at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland and also performed in England and Germany. Their recording of 'Dolly Parton's Tits' was a huge hit in England, making it to the top 100 charts and being chosen as the theme song for a British TV show called "Over the Top". Their performances took them across Canada hundreds of times as well as into the United States.</p>
<p>The MacLean Brothers performed at the first Just For Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal, Canada in 1983. They were also chosen to host the first 'Nasty Nights' at the Festival in 1986 and again for the Nasty Nights 10th Anniversary in 1996. They toured and performed on numerous occasions with Burton Cummings of The Guess Who.</p>
<p>MacLean and MacLean created the popular comedy character 'The Champ' and formed a partnership with Brother Jake, the voice of The Champ. Fans will be familiar with some of their other characters, including Slim Chance The Crying Cowboy and Bing Buff to name a few.</p>
<p>Their touring brought them to some of the largest and most renowned clubs in Canada including the Commodore in Vancouver, The Back Alley in Calgary, the El Mocambo in Toronto, Barrymore's in Ottawa and The Palace in Halifax.</p>
<p>After retiring from touring in 1998, Gary MacLean became a DJ with KY58 radio in Winnipeg and Blair MacLean developed his art. Blair is currently a well known international artist known for his unique works of Grain Art</p>
<p>Gary MacLean died of throat cancer on December 5, 2001.</p>

<p>Deeds of trust are used in some U.S. states as an alternative to the mortgage in terms of real estate financing. The deed of trust is similar to a traditional mortgage arrangement but instead is executed through a third party. Typically, the borrower or "trustor" delivers the deed of trust to a third-party trustee instead of directly to the lender. Usually, this trustee function is performed by the lender's attorney. The trustee holds the deed until the lender or "beneficiary" notifies him or her that one of two conditions has been met. The first of these is the full payment of the debt by the borrower. When this is the case, the trustee is ordered to give the borrower a deed for the property, indicating full satisfication of the loan and free of any encumbrances. This is commonly referred to as a delivery in escrow, as all of the loan terms and conditions have been met. The second condition occurs when the borrower defaults on the loan. In this case, the lender instructs the trustee to proceed with a foreclosure sale, pursuant to state law. The states use a deed of trust to secure loans for real estate include Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-13_1623.html" title="Edit section: North-South divide in Italy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">North-South divide in Italy</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, like many countries, has a <a href="../../../n/o/r/North-South_divide_8e2e.html" title="North-South divide">north-south divide</a>, with the northern part being the wealthiest and the southern the poorest.</p>
<p><b>Origins</b> The divide came into being in the late <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> when the city-states of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Italy_89ac.html" title="Northern Italy">Northern Italy</a> prospered economically and culturally as a consequence of the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, while the south was a <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spanish</a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colony.html" title="Colony">colony</a> all but in name. As a result <a href="../../../m/e/z/Mezzogiorno.html" title="Mezzogiorno">the South</a> was exploited and ripped of the money and resources it needed to prosper.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> the division became more marked as the northern states, which were ruled by rulers who were friendlier to <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrialisation.html" title="Industrialisation">industrialisation</a> than their southern counterparts, industrialised. Furthermore Northern Italy was more suitable for industrialisation as it was located closer to the industrial heartland of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> (the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> and Northeastern <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>) than the South.</p>
<p>As a result the North became industrialized while the South remained agricultural. This division has magnified until the present day as time progressed as the North had gained an industrial base for <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_growth.html" title="Economic growth">economic growth</a>, with major Italian corporations (such as <a href="../../../f/i/a/Fiat.html" title="Fiat">Fiat</a>) originating in the North, while the South has a fragile agricultural base that doesn’t offer a lot of economic perspective. The emergence of the <a href="../../../m/a/f/Mafia.html" title="Mafia">Mafia</a> in the South hasn’t helped it either.</p>
<p><b>Consequences</b> The north-south division has a large economic, social, cultural and political impact.</p>
<p><b>Economic consequences</b> The economic consequences are huge with the North being twice as wealthy as the South. The GDP per capita of the North approaches that of other Western European economies, while the South would have the one of the lowest GDP per capita of the former EU-15 if it were independent, scoring only slightly better than <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a>, but far worse than Spain.</p>
<p><b>Social and cultural consequences</b> The divide has created social and cultural differences as well. The <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mentality.html" title="Mentality">mentality</a> of Southern Italy corresponds more with the stereotype of the easy-does-it, colourful <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_people.html" title="Italian people">Italian</a>, while the mentality of the North resembles the average Western European mentality of punctuality and even stress. The mentality of Southerners is generally more <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservative</a> as well, with <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extended_family.html" title="Extended family">extended families</a> being more common in the South than in the North, which has a <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_family.html" title="Nuclear family">nuclear family</a> model. Family is socially more important in the South than in the North as is the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">church</a>. It should be noted that these descriptions are mostly stereotypes and that the truth is more balanced.</p>
<p><b>Political consequences</b> The huge differences between North and South have given rise to separatist movements in both North and South, even though Italy has been one country for almost 150 years. The most notable separatist movement is <a href="../../../l/e/g/Lega_Nord_db84.html" title="Lega Nord">Lega Nord</a>, who wants Northern Italy to declare independence as the state of <a href="../../../p/a/d/Padania.html" title="Padania">Padania</a>. Seperatist tendencies are less marked in the South but the South wants more money and autonomy for its economic development. Northerners and Southerners feel disdain for each other with Southerners being characterized as lazy, illiterate and criminal by Northerners, while Southerners see Northerners as arrogant, selfish and aloof.</p>

<p>The family business C. Cramer, GmbH &amp; Co. KG was founded by Carl Cramer in 1947 and is now – in the second generation – under the management of Johannes Cramer. The company specializes in the production and sale of high-quality industrial fabrics and enjoys a reputation of a weaving mill with the highest innovative excellence in the world. The company premises cover an area of over 22,000 m² accommodating upgraded production facilities. The product range includes more than 2,000 products, 70 % of which derive from its own mostly custom-made development. The company is represented in almost all segments of the technical textile industry, it supplies customers worldwide and is market leader in a number of segments. The foundation for this success was already laid in the year the company was established. It was at that time that the company received its first bulk order for 300,000 rm of canvas, a heavy cotton, by the British Defence Ministry. With this first major order the then fledgling company was given a basis for further constant growth. Today, innovation, quality and long-term customer relationships have a long tradition and are highly esteemed by end users and major customers alike.</p>

<p>Activity5 is a project management technique. The purpose of this moderation and managemant technique is to remove useless participants from meetins, work packages and teamwork. The technique basically works by creation of a subcommitee on some irrelevant aspects of some topic. The non-providing team members or advocates of irrelevant details will join the commitee - and leave the rest of the team alone to be productive. It is important to make the subcomittee look important and relevant. The art of project management is to deploy titles and desriptions in ways that only the target persons are attracted into the subcommitee. A usual way is to include some work item, action item, commitee or activity into the overall project workplan that has been designed to collect certain people out of other activities. The international secret project manager code for unproductive subcommitees is the number 5, resulting in any large project scheduling meetings and milestons for Activity 5, Workpackage 5, Team 5, etc.</p>

<p>STRATEGICALLY DESIGNATING FIGHTERS AND CORVETTES -</p>
<p>When you have completely built all of your Fighters and Corvettes, spread them out in several areas across the map. Make sure you build the maximum amount of platforms and make them surround the mothership to substitute for the fighter and corvette defense. Suggested: 15 ION TURRETS, 10 GUN TURRETS. This means that the defenses around your capital ships' location will not be altered much, and if your fighters and corvettes are attacked, you will only lose a small portion (the smaller the squads you divide the ships into, the smaller portion of ships you will lose per attack.) Also, this gives you good radar abilities because you have ships all over the map.</p>
<p>THREADING THE NEEDLE - A PLATFORMS + SCOUTS TACTIC -</p>
<p>First of all, construct the maximum amount of scouts that you can. Send them all over the map, looking for the opponent, and the most wanted target that you wish to destroy. Have the max. amount of platforms built by this time (an efficient mix for targeting the enemy you're focusing on with your scouts.) When you locate the enemy, select all your gun platforms and send them on a MOVE-ATTACK order to just behind the enemy you want to destroy. Wait until they reach the target, and send out your Ion Cannon platforms on a MOVE-ATTACK order to the destination of the gun turrets. If you want some decoy ships, send some of your scouts in. For best results, send around 3 squads in at a time. Once they're destroyed, send another three scout squads in. Repeat this as long as you can. This will substitute the enemy's fire to your scouts and take some attention away from your platforms.</p>
<p>ULTIMATE FLEETS - A TACTIC FOR THE HOMEWORLD EX. MOD (MODIFICATION) V2.0</p>
<p>Set your enemies as Protogenior on a Skirmish v. CPU mission. The enemy will not attack you until you attack them - perfect for getting maximum-capacity fleets without the rude interruptions of the enemy!</p>

<p>The fourth novel (chronologically) written in 1967 by C.S. Forrester was the last work in the Horation Horblower series. Forrester died before this novel could be completed, however in its published form possible outcomes are submitted for the reader's examination. These outcomes come from notes belonging to Forrester that may have been used to finish his novel had he not passed on.</p>
<p>In "Hornblower and the Crisis" (known as "Hornblower during the Crisis" in America) the newly appointed Captain Hornblower takes part in the funeral for the venerable Admiral Nelson who died at the battle of Trafalgar. After the funeral, not having been posted to a ship, Hornblower is unsure if he will be among the many unposted captains living on half pay. It is during this time that the Admiralty (the Naval Office for the British Navy) asks for Hornblower's assistance with a sensitive matter that will require Hornblower to travel incognito into France to take part in an act of subterfuge.</p>
<p>This is where the novel ends and the speculation begins. In an attempt to avoid inaccuracy, these speculations will be left to the reader. Whatever the outcome, the next novel chronologically is "Hornblower and the Atropos" where Horatio is posted to his first true ship, the Atropos.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-13_1623.html" title="Edit section: Elbe Cycle Route">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../e/l/b/Elbe_Cycle_Route_c06b.html" title="Elbe Cycle Route">Elbe Cycle Route</a></span></h2>
<p>The Elbe Cycle Route is part of an international network of cyling routes all over Europe. It is integrated in the system of currently 37 river cycling routes in Germany and by far the most popular route for cyclist in this Country.</p>
<p>The Elbe Cycle Route starts in <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prague.html" title="Prague">Prague</a> on the <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moldau.html" title="Moldau">Moldau</a>, which joins with the Elbe river about 50 km from Prague. It then runs for about 980 km until it ends in <a href="../../../c/u/x/Cuxhaven.html" title="Cuxhaven">Cuxhaven</a> at the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Sea_f231.html" title="North Sea">North Sea</a>.</p>
<p>[Edit] After a failry adventurous part of the Route on the Czech side of the river one reaches the famous Elb Sandstone Mountains and crosses the border to Germany. Shortly after this the Route leads through Dresden and later through other cities like <a href="../../../m/e/i/Mei%C3%9Fen.html" title="Meißen">Meißen</a>, <a href="../../../l/u/t/Lutherstadt_Wittenberg_de33.html" title="Lutherstadt Wittenberg">Lutherstadt Wittenberg</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/s/Dessau.html" title="Dessau">Dessau</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magdeburg.html" title="Magdeburg">Magdeburg</a>, Tangermünde, Lauenburg, <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamburg.html" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/x/Cuxhaven.html" title="Cuxhaven">Cuxhaven</a>.</p>
<p>There are many small villages with old churches and other interesting sites along the way. A lot of restaurants and pensions offer their service to the weary after a day of cycling.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons however for its popularity is probably the fact that there are no significant level changes from Dresden on. It is practically downhill all the way from Dresden to Cuxhaven.</p>
<p>The Elbe Cycling Route is marked throughout Germany with a special sign.</p>

<p>The best reason to leave your car at home! A bus service provided by some bars and clubs to take a group of people attending the venue directly to and from their homes. These services usually incur a small fee but are sometimes free. However these buses are usually bound to an area which is close by to the venue hence it is mostly local residents that use these buses. It is considered courteous because bars and clubs do not have to provide this service. They are popular because it reduces drink driving and is alot more cheaper than catching a Taxi home.</p>

<p>In 1997, DLR Ltd commissioned consultants to undertake a study to review potential extensions to the existing network and to develop a ten-year strategy for the development of the railway. The objective was to identify schemes that were technically, financially and economically viable and capable of implementation. The core recommendations of the study were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extend the DLR to London City Airport</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Further extend the City Airport line to Woolwich Arsenal; and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Create a new DLR route from Canning Town to Stratford through conversion of the existing North London Line to DLR operation.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Following this study, in Spring 1998 the then Department of Environment Transport and the Regions (DETR) asked DLR Ltd to develop the proposed London City Airport link to a stage where a Transport and Works Act Order application could be made.</p>
<p>The aims for the London City Airport extension are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To create a new link that will significantly improve access to the communities of Silvertown, and provide a reliable public transport service to the area.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To provide a direct rail connection to the City from London City Airport that will enable future growth potential to be realised without adverse effect on the environment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To build a railway that will act as a catalyst for substantial regeneration of Southern Royal Docks, and help bring new jobs, homes, shops and other leisure facilities to the area.</li>

<p>Walt Disney Classics is a video series from <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Disney_Home_Entertainment_1be1.html" title="Walt Disney Home Entertainment">Walt Disney Home Entertainment</a> that was started in the fall of 1984 with <a href="../../../d/u/m/Dumbo.html" title="Dumbo">Dumbo</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Hood_%281973_film%29_8736.html" title="Robin Hood (1973 film)">Robin Hood</a>. The series launched in the United Kingdom in 1985 and Japan that same year. It was created to release animated Disney features to video.</p>
<p>The series discontinued in 1994 in North America, but it continued up until 1998 in Europe and Japan. The Classic series mostly released their videos on <a href="../../../v/h/s/VHS_078b.html" title="VHS">VHS</a>, but they were also on <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beta.html" title="Beta">Betamax</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laserdisc.html" title="Laserdisc">Laserdisc</a>, and <a href="../../../c/e/d/CED_Videodisc_0214.html" title="CED Videodisc">CED Videodisc</a>. The label was known for releasing titles from the 1940s to the 1970s on video, but after the controversial video release of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Little_Mermaid_%28film%29_8270.html" title="The Little Mermaid (film)">The Little Mermaid (film)</a>, the label released contemporary films.</p>
<p>Fans nickname it the Black Diamond series, due to a black diamond on the spine, the back (on the mid-1980s prints), and on the videotape labels (up until 1992 and used one last time in 1994), it contained text saying,"The Classics."</p>

<p>Sir Loholt Arthurian Literary Character Sometimes called Ilinot or Borre, Sir Loholt was an illegitimate son of King Arthur by Lady Lisanor of Cardigan, with whom he had a brief fling prior to his marriage. Loholt was both a handsome and noble Knight of the Round Table who entered into a number of adventures. He helped his father rescue Queen Guinevere when kidnapped by King Valerin of the Tangled Wood; and fought and killed a giant named Logrin in the Perilous Forest. Sir Loholt fell in love with Lady Florie of Kanadic and died while in her service. He was apparently captured by Sir Caradoc of the Dolorous Tower (or Sir Brian of the Isles) and incarcerated in his prison. There he contracted a rather unpleasant disease and died soon afterward.</p>
<p>His Welsh original is called Llacheu.</p>

<p>The Safari Cat is a hybrid cat first developed in the 1970's. It is a cross between the Geoffroy's (Sometimes spelled Jeffrey's) cat, a wild cat which is indigenous to South America, and a domestic house cat. The Geoffroy's Cat resembles a Margay or an Ocelot-- though it's coloring is different: It's markings may be a little less distinctive than the beautiful rosettes found on the pelt of an ocelot. In the same spirit of people who have developed the "Savannah Cat" (a mix of the African Serval and a domestic cat) or the "Bengal Cat" (another hybrid-- in this case between an Asian Leopard Cat and a domestic cat) the Safari Cat was bred to be an exotic, wild-appearing animal with the sweet nature of a housecat. Reputedly, the Safari Cat has a lovely temperament. This may be due to the fact that wild Geoffroy's Cats have been kept as pets in South America-- reportedly. Or at least due to the fact that the Geoffroy's Cat-- while wild-- is less timid around humans than other species of wild cats. The breed has failed to become as popular in the pet-trade as, say, a Bengal Cat, because it is a very difficult cat to breed. The reason for this difficulty is that a Geoffroy's Cat carries a different number of chromosomes than a domestic cat. Were this not a problem, it would likely be a popular exotic pet as varied reports speak quite well of its good nature. Hybrid cats are gaining in popularity, as many people admire the spotted pelts of wild cats and have been pleased with the temperaments of these "living-room leopards." The Bengal cat has been a fantastic success in the pet trade and is legal to keep as a pet in every state in America but Georgia. Currently, there is a great deal of interest in the Savannah Cat-- but it remains illegal to keep as a pet in more than a few states. This illegal status may have something to do with the size of the Savannah. It is closer in size to its larger Serval heritage than to its domestic cat heritage. There is a renewed interest in breeding Safari Cats, though they will likely remain rare as house pets because of the difficulty breeders have in obtaining offspring. There are other hybrids being developed and kept as pets, including the "Pixie-Bob" (part bob-cat, part domestic); the "Bagral" (part Asian Fishing Cat, part domestic); the "Cheetoh" (a mix of domestic Ocicats and Bengals) which is a larger sized cat; the "Toyger" (part Bengal and other domestic cat) which is bred to resemble a small tiger-- hence the rather cute name: Think of Toy Tiger. As well as the "Serengetti Cat" (which is a mix of Bengal Cat and certain breeds of Oriental domestic cats with large ears. The Serengetti cat is being developed as an alternative to the Savannah-- The spots of the Bengal Cat combined with the large ears of the Oriental domestics create a cat that resembles an African Serval (which are spotted like leopards and have enormous ears) without actually introducing any Serval blood into the animal. Servals are wild animals and are very unpredictable, some even refer to the Serval as being a surly and vicious. The "Chausie" is another hybrid in development.</p>
