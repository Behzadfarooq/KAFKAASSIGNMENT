<dd>The UNHCR website referenced for many of the supposed attacks is simply a link to a litany of accusation made by the the SL government to the UN. If someone was trying to legitimize the source by saying its from UNHCR .. thats a joke. The additions user Ruchiraw has made are clearly NPOV. Repeatedly, "LTTE Terrorists" is used.

<dd>Just to add this even though the point of the deletion is not for factual reasons; I read that UNHCR page and it seems the poster above is correct, Ruchiraw what you claim to be UNHCR statments on these attacks are taken from a letter sent to the UNHCR by the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the Centre for Human Rights, i.e. these are just the claims of one party to the conflict, the GoSL, and not any sort of endorsment by the UNHCR that these claims are factual nor can they be considered to be NPOV.</dd>

<dd>I don't want to get into the details of the items listed here, we can discuss the facts on the 'notable attacks' page if this is settled. The point of this delete request is that this article is redundant, as for copyright you are probably correct if that is public domain then so be it, that was not my main point for requesting a delete anyway. As for the items themselves, as a party to the conflict, we cannot accept the GoSL’s statements as fact any more nor any less than we can accept statements from the LTTE without proof from non-interested third parties. Thus you are being quite disingenuous by trying to pass off the list of attacks as something endorsed and accepted by the UNHCR, when it was just a letter sent to them by the GoSL. So no one is accusing the UNHCR of posting lies, since it is clearly stated that they are only posting a copy of a letter sent to them, this should not be passed off as something that it is not.--<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealstarslayer_f0b8.html" title="User:Realstarslayer">Realstarslayer</a> 05:04, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think some of you are missing the point, the discussion is not whether items listed here are factual or not, it is just to determine whether it makes sense to have three different pages to cover the same thing.

In any case it contains a lot of information that is not included in the notable attacks page which I think is worth preserving.<br />
It could be argued that both pages be merged with each other / with the <a href="../../../l/t/t/LTTE_021c.html" title="LTTE">LTTE</a> page, but that will make it unwieldy and quite hard to navigate.<br />
I also don't think it can be labeled POV since most information is from the UNHCR website and from BBC, CNN etc. Besides POV is not a normal reason for nomination for deletion. --<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowolfd4_dd28.html" title="User:Snowolfd4">snowolfd4</a> 09:03, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hi snowolfd4 my issue with this page is that it is a division of effort and redundant if some of these items are not covered on the 'notable attacks' page then we should discuss it there and add those that are deemed worthwhile. As for the actual items on this page please see the comments above, this is <b>not</b> a posting by the UNHCR, they have merely posted a letter sent to them by the GoSL, so certainly all these 'hundreds of attacks' cannot be verified by independant sources.--<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealstarslayer_f0b8.html" title="User:Realstarslayer">Realstarslayer</a> 04:15, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I think it may be best to have just one article List of attacks attributed to the LTTE, with the sections <i>Attacks on civilian targets</i> and <i>Attacks on military targets</i>, with each divided into sections listing attacks <i>proved</i> to have been by the LTTE and attacks only <i>attributed</i> to the LTTE with no conclusive proof. This will avoid issues with verifiability, and also the problem that if the word "terrorist" is included in the title the article will not be NPOV. -- <a href="../../../p/o/n/User%7EPonnampalam_c484.html" title="User:Ponnampalam">Ponnampalam</a> 12:51, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

If there is citation from Amnesty for a particular incident then it has weight.. otherwise it doesn't mean that it didn't happen but it is just that the source is not credible. If the SL government's fairy tales are to be believed, then we might as well add items from LTTE peace secretariat as well. Trincomanb 04:02, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sri Lanka has a democratically elected government which is more than can be said for the LTTE which relies on violence to remain in power, is banned in over thirty countries and whose leader is wanted by Interpol for terrorism<a href="http://www.interpol.int/public/Data/Wanted/Notices/Data/1994/54/1994_9054.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.interpol.int/public/Data/Wanted/Notices/Data/1994/54/1994_9054.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. You cant equate the two. You are missing my point , there are many citations from Amnesty International, BBC, MIPT terrorist database as well.

<dd>Sri Lanka has the second highest number of disappearances after Iraq.. this includes a lot of Sinhalese missing since the JVP insurrection which some have comfortably forgotten. Democracy for who, everyone or just Sinhala Budhists&#160;? The fact of the matter is that world has threatened to impose sanctions on both parties and very soon send some of those that give you orders to the criminal court for war crimes. LTTE's proxy the TNA is by far the most popular party in the North-East. Why would you want to participate in flawed, decaying democracy such as Sri Lanka&#160;? There maybe many citations of events that occured, but you are using that to sneak in govt. fairy tales as well, thinking the rest of us dim enough not to notice it. Reputable sources are careful not point the finger without proof and most of the incidents have not been proven to be comitted by the LTTE. Wikipedia is not a place to speculate. If you want to speculate become an astrologer. Trincomanb 13:11, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is the third time I am reminding you that there are plenty of citations from BBC, Amnesty International and MIPT terrorist database. Which members of the Sri Lankan government are wanted by Interpol. I believe Japan is also contemplating banning the LTTE. The US has also promised substantial military help to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is a world recognised government. The governments of 1.5 billion people have benned LTTE as a terrorsit group. Where is the proof Al Quaeda committed teh Twin Tower bombigs. Perhaps you deny that as well. Sri Lanka is a vibrant democracy. As I mention again it is the responsibility of the government to find out who is massacring its civilians. <a href="../../../r/u/c/User%7ERuchiraw_fe8e.html" title="User:Ruchiraw">Ruchiraw</a> 22:30, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Ruchiraw, I think you stated it quite well: <i>There is no point to include hundreds of minor terrorist attacks and thousands of minor military attacks into this page</i>. This is why I started the deletion request for this page, the notable attacks page is more than enough to cover the main attacks and we can discuss any others that you feel should be included and do so when a consensus is reached, otherwise we are going to have a myriad of pages for all sorts of things. Should we start a page for all GoSL human rights violations? The Human Rights Commission of SL just recently decided to abandoned 2000 cases because of pressure from the president, in their own words; further investigation would require the government to pay out compensation <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/statements/mainfile.php/2006statements/646/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ahrchk.net/statements/mainfile.php/2006statements/646/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>? So should we start a page and list each one of those 2,000 cases? And that is 2,000 out of more than 16,000 cases still pending? So should we have an entry for each one of those 16,000 cases?--<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealstarslayer_f0b8.html" title="User:Realstarslayer">Realstarslayer</a> 02:57, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>we have tried to incorporate the below list to the main artical of LTTE. But the users of that page dont allow any NPOV on that page and our contributions got reverted all the time. Below is the list of attacks we tried to incorporated but they kept deleating them and finally moved in to the descussion page. Then they compleately took off that part from the main LTTE page and opened up a new page to avoid readers to see these attacks. I dont think that this page should be deleted and I vote to keep it.

<dd>RavenS, I'm really not sure what you are going on about, I did not make any comment as to the collective intelligence of the UNHCR. Some interested parties were trying to pass off that list as having been compiled by the UNHCR when it wasn't. It is <b>only</b> a letter sent to the UNHCR by the GoSL and thus not a valid citation for these attacks, as they are one of the parties to the ethnic conflict and so cannot be considered as an independent non interested third party. Those are just the facts no matter how much you may wish it otherwise. --<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealstarslayer_f0b8.html" title="User:Realstarslayer">Realstarslayer</a> 15:47, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
