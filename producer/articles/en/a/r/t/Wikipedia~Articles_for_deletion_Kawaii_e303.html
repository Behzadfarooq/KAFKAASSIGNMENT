<li><s><b>Keep.</b></s> <b>Keep and tag for cleanup,</b> as per discussion below. It seems like a reasonable entry to me, with considerable bits of useful information. The anime/manga community seems to have co-opted this word for its own purposes, and the aricle addresses that. It's notable, it's interesting, it contains useful information for a researcher; why would we want to delete it? --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 03:51, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What do you consider "useful"?

<dd>In this case, I consider the topic "notable" because I hear the word in this sense in common use, and I consider the article "useful" because if I were researching the anime/manga subculture in the US, this article would be a helpful source (along with the other articles in its categories). Your opinion, it would seem, differs. My vote remains keep, however. If you believe the article has problems, you can certainly improve it. Given your list of concerns below, perhaps it would be beneficial to alter the article to recast the term as something used by Americans, where the usage is apparently not the same as it is in Japan; better yet, one could make a comparison out of it. I can't comment on that, not being knowlegeable on Japanese culture. I agree with Ikkyu2 and <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> on this one. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 07:19, 17 February 2006 (UTC) (I'm not sure how my comment here got mangled with someone's sig, or why other people took it upon themselves to mangle it further, but I've corrected it, I think. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 02:00, 18 February 2006 (UTC))
<dl>
<dd>This is the same conclusion I've come to after hours spent banging my head against the brick wall that is certain users on the article's discussion page. While the word has been adopted by a specialist interest group, (which doesn't mean it's becoming a loanword) it's meaning has been altered in the process. The current article doesn't address this and operates under the mistaken idea that <i>kawaii</i> is some specific, defined style of anime / drawing / fashion. If this can be rectified then there may be a place for the article to define what the word has come to mean when used in manga and anime fan circles and then this can be contrasted with the meaning in Japanese. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarryvalder_f05c.html" title="User:Barryvalder">Barryvalder</a> 13:24, 17 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would like to remind you that etymologies that are limited to small fan circles are not presently considered worthy of Wikipedia articles, although they may be in the future. Do not correct me on my word choice with "small fan circles". While there is a considerable following in the US, there is no "altered meaning" for the word for the majority of these people, who merely use the word as-is, along with other "trendy" Japanese words that they have pulled from anime, such as "genki", "kakkoii", "ohayo" etc. If you can find some kind of proof that the word is being used in a non-Japanese fashion (that would be a loanword by the way) then it may be advisable to rewrite the article, but as you just stated the article doesn't address this issue and thus contains no valid information. As per the previous comment, if you were a researcher looking for information on Anime/manga culture ... wouldn't you rather check out <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a> (which explains the word <i>kawaii</i>) and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a>? <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshgavin_9ad7.html" title="User:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="white" style="background:blue">&#160;freshgavin</font></a><a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreshgavin_46e9.html" title="User talk:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="blue">ΓΛĿЌ&#160;</font></a> 13:53, 17 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My initial conclusion was that which I could make from the views of those who pushed the article for all they could. I was assuming, probably naively, that those people spoke for fans of anime and manga. Anime / manga fan culture is not my area. The everyday use and meaning of Japanese words is. If it's the case that fans of Japanese culture use the word with the same meaning as it holds in Japanese, and not as the name of a specific style etc, then the article is entirely without value beyond it's initial dictionary definition. As you note below, the vast majority of the article should either be employed elsewhere, or deleted outright. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarryvalder_f05c.html" title="User:Barryvalder">Barryvalder</a> 14:08, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>To answer your question, Freshgavin, I'd check out <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a>, and anything else that looked interesting or relevant in the related topics or category sections. A good researcher doesn't just read one article and stop, especially when using a source of possibly dubious validity. By the way, I'm with <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarryvalder_f05c.html" title="User:Barryvalder">Barryvalder</a> and others on this; it should be kept, IMHO, but it should also be cleaned up. So, I'm altering my vote somewhat to <b>keep and tag for cleanup.</b> I really don't believe a strong case for deletion has been made, though there might be a case here for merging what may be useful from the article (which, again, is speaking more to US anime/manga subculture as far as I can tell) into another article and changing this into a redirect. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 22:59, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>, now <b>Weak keep</b> per below. I think this one is a judgment call. I judge that the article should be kept; I can respect others' opinions that it might be unencyclopedic. I think, however, that since we are not to act as though we were constrained by space, and since this is clearly a good faith effort to explain the English-language significance of a loanword, that we should keep. If there were blatant advertising or evidence of other bad faith, I'd reconsider. -<font color="#2000C0">ikkyu2</font> (<a href="../../../i/k/k/User_talk%7EIkkyu2_7356.html" title="User talk:Ikkyu2"><font color="#00FF00">talk</font></a>) 04:05, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My bad, I was thinking of the "Anomalous Female Teenage Handwriting" fad, which was apparently studied by Yamane Kazuma, along with the merchandising, fashion, and pop-culture media marketed and referred to by this term in Japan, the US, and Australia. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 06:17, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't see why you're being sarcastic. If it was considered fashionable to be "cute" in hollywood, and the London Times posted an article that said so, would you consider that a reason to make "cute" a valid Wikipedia article? Also, the whole "Anomalous Female Teenage Handwriting" section doesn't belong here anyways. It has nothing to do with the word "kawaii" except for the fact that girls like to write in a "cute" or "pretty" style. I would have thought the fact that the research was called "Female Teenage Writing" and not "Kawaii writing" would stand for that. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshgavin_9ad7.html" title="User:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="white" style="background:blue">&#160;freshgavin</font></a><a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreshgavin_46e9.html" title="User talk:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="blue">ΓΛĿЌ&#160;</font></a> 06:33, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The one place that "the merchandising, fashion, and pop-culture media" <i>isn't</i> marketed and referred to by this term is in Japan itself. My conclusion from the endless war-of-words on the article's discussion page is that the fundamental misunderstanding over the words's use in it's native country is a huge factor in the unreliability of this article. <i>"Animals are often drawn in excessively Kawaii style"</i> one user insists on writing. What I've attempted to get across is that in Japan there is no such thing as <i>Kawaii style</i>, making the statement meaningless OR. If any article is to exist on this topic, it has to address the Japanese meaning and the meaning being given when used in English. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarryvalder_f05c.html" title="User:Barryvalder">Barryvalder</a> 10:22, 17 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Explained above. Also, the misunderstanding with "kawaii style" comes from the fact that it is common in Japanese to suffix "-kei" onto some adjectives which may be translated as "kawaii type" or "style", but there is no implication of a specific <i>style of kawaii</i>, simply that X is of a "cute"/"pretty" persuasion, as opposed to a "sexy"/"ugly"/"glamorous"/etc. one. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshgavin_9ad7.html" title="User:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="white" style="background:blue">&#160;freshgavin</font></a><a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreshgavin_46e9.html" title="User talk:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="blue">ΓΛĿЌ&#160;</font></a> 14:06, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't really want to classify it as "original research", though there is obviously quite a bit of that. I'm just more concerned about the collections of material that has no relation to the actual word, many of them POV.
<ul>
<li>Kawaii characters typically (but not exclusively) are drawn with large eyes and small noses and mouths (<i>this comment refers to anime style, which has no relation to the word kawaii</i>)</li>
<li>Pets are often drawn in a kawaii style (<i>this statement means nothing more than "pets are drawn cutely"</i>)</li>
<li>Kawaii characters generally have angelic personalities (<i>original research, I see no reason why the author would want to say this if not just to get a picture of his favourite anime character added to the page</i>)</li>
<li>Kawai is a Japanese term (<i>it's not a term, its a word. by saying "term" the author is trying to bloat its importance</i>)</li>
<li>Kawaii should not to be confused with "kowai" (<i>Japanese speakers have very little trouble distinguishing the two words, this is a statement fit for an introduction to Japanese textbook</i>)</li>
<li>The term can be subjective as Kawaii can be used to describe anything an individual considers cute which can include attractive women. (<i>a completely worthless statement. Saying an adjective is "subjective" is no more useful than saying that "good" is POV</i>)</li>
<li>Kawaii merchandise is extremely popular in Japan (<i>should say "cute/pretty things are popular [to certain groups] in Japan" and be moved to "Japanese culture"</i>)</li>
<li>The two largest manufacturers of such merchandise are <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanrio.html" title="Sanrio">Sanrio</a> (manufacturers of "<a href="../../../h/e/l/Hello_Kitty_61f0.html" title="Hello Kitty">Hello Kitty</a>") and San-X. (<i>original research, sourceless, and POV</i>)</li>
<li>The proliferation of mechandise regarded as kawaii is considered by some to be an expression of a female-led youth movement (<i>equals: girls like cute things. Useless information.</i>)</li>
<li>Kawaii can be also used to describe fashions. (<i>another useless statement. It is a widely used adjective and can be used to describe almost anything you like, much like "cute" or "pretty" can. The author then goes on to describe fashions that are considered cute in Japan, which should be part of "Japanese culture"</i>)</li>
<li>When the kawaii 'craze' began to develop in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> during the 1970s (<i>sourceless OR. A correct statement would refer to the "boom" that Japan experienced in the early 1980s, thus allowing women greater freedom of choice in fashion, another tidbit for the "Japanese culture" article, or possibly one on the boom itself</i>)</li>
<li>Previously Japanese writing had been written vertically using strokes that vary in thickness along their length. The new style was written laterally, preferably using a <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanical_pencil.html" title="Mechanical pencil">mechanical pencil</a> to produce very fine, even lines. (<i>absolutely rediculous OR statements. Japanese has been written horizontally as well as vertically for more than a hundred years, nothing to do with "cuteness". Mechanical pencils are just another example of influence from western cultures, again nothing to do with "cuteness".</i></li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> now <b>Rewrite needed</b> This article, as it stands, is horrendously inacurate. The article is full of OR, pointless information and misunderstandings as shown by <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshgavin_9ad7.html" title="User:Freshgavin">User:Freshgavin</a> who expertly picked the article to pieces above. My main objection with the article is the fundamental misunderstanding of the word's use in Japan. It means cute, adorable, darling etc and that's it. What is put forward by some authors of this article is that <i>kawaii</i> is a specific style or writing (it isn't), a specific type of animation (it isn't), a specific type of fashion (it isn't) etc. I've been attempting for a few days to correct this misunderstanding, but some users are insistent on the existence of a specific, definable <i>kawaii</i> style. My conclusion is that the word has gained a different, distinct meaning when used in English. The Japanese meaning and meaning when used by fans of Japanese culture are two different things. If this is the case any article on the topic has to make this clear from the start. A large percentage of the article is also given over to the idea that the word is becoming a loanword in English.

<dd>I agree with you on that, but where <i>moe</i> (I actually prefer the Hepburn, I just copied from the article's redirect) is the slang term there, <i>kawaii</i> seems to be gaining currency as the slang term <b>here</b>.

In any case, if we cannot save the article, that is why I recommended a redirect as a fallback.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and <b>Rewrite</b>. Having lived in Japan for several years, I can tell you that "kawaii" (or "cute", since many young people there use the words interchangeably) is definitely a cultural aspect of Japan. Even big tough guys can be very frequently seen with cutesy character goods (such as Hello Hitty). "Kawaii" permeates the culture in Japan. The post office has cute mascot characters; almost every corporation has cute mascots; it really is everywhere. I do agree that the article needs some work, but it absolutely should not be deleted. --<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">nihon</a> 20:21, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nobody is disputing that cuteness is very popular in Japan. That information should be represented within the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Japan_02eb.html" title="Culture of Japan">culture of Japan</a> article. A huge problem with this article is the fundamantal misunderstanding that the word <i>kawaii</i> represents a definable, distinct style or movement (wether it be anime/clothing/writing/etc). Living in Japan, you'll be aware that if you went into a manga shop and asked for the <i>kawaii comics</i> you'd get met with blank expressions. There's no such thing, just subjective judgement. This article, if it's to exist at all, can be made up of two or three sentences. The rest of the details as it stands are sourceless, lacking in evidence, and worthless POV. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarryvalder_f05c.html" title="User:Barryvalder">Barryvalder</a> 08:16, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

As for walking into a comic shop and asking for "kawaii comics", you would be met with blank stares because they would assume you were a stupid gaijin, not because they wouldn't know what you're talking about. No, there is no specific genre of "kawaii comics", but that's because "kawaii" is so ingrained in the culture. --<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">nihon</a> 19:10, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The culture of Japan can be any length it needs to be. With regards your startement as to how Japanese people will react to a question based on the race of the person asking it, well that is a very daft arguement Nihon. Would Japanese shop staff regard Africans as "stupid blacks" for asking the same question? Best to keep your sweeping generalisations and borderline racism to yourself.

<dd>Where do you get off calling me racist? If you can't form a coherent argument without calling someone racist, then I suggest you find someplace else to play.

<li>Kawaii Craze is similar to the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic.html" title="Comic">Comic</a> craze of the US in thelate 30s to early 50ies. During the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Age_of_Comic_Books_1c51.html" title="Golden Age of Comic Books">Golden Age of Comic Books</a> superman merchendice etc sold at ridiclous levels. In the US more people are likely to know who superman is rather than who the president is. Any native english speaker may/should thake comic craze for granted. It is perfectly casual for people to wear superman outfits in haloween. You do not reference people wearing superman outfits as a product of "comic craze" even though thats what it is.</li>
<li>Of course comic-craze and kawaii-craze are poor comparasions. After all Kawaii was never restricted to paper and has been an <i>ongoing</i> craze spreading overseas.</li>

<dd>I'm getting a bit weary of being misrepresented on this subject. Yes, cute things permeate Japanese culture up and down, top to bottom, in and out and I've seen it firsthand. I have seen 50 year old men with Hello Kitty seatcovers on their cars. I'm not disputing that cute things are popular in Japan, mmkay? Nobody is disputing that. I'm disputing that "kawaii" is anything other than an adjective used to describe what someone's vision of cute is. It's always subjective. The Hello Hitty industry is not classified as "the kawaii industry" in Japan. Retailers do not order another lorry of "kawaii merchandise". There's no "kawaii" section of idol mags or manga shops or video rental places or clothing retailers or food or absolutely anything at all. There is no central authoritative body of work that can rule out something -not- being kawaii. Reading more than this into it is a common error of <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orientalism.html" title="Orientalism">orientalism</a>, the tendency of uninitiated Westerners to project novelty and significance onto elements of Asian culture beyond their true significance. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hokkaido_Crow_7bd1.html" title="User:The Hokkaido Crow">The Crow</a> 16:09, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Cuteness is highly valued in Japan and it has an impact on many aspects of Japanese culture, but suggesting it's a movement like <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_Lolita_a498.html" title="Gothic Lolita">Gothic Lolita</a> is entirely without evidence or factual accuracy. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarryvalder_f05c.html" title="User:Barryvalder">Barryvalder</a> 11:51, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Honestly I find this nomination somewhat worrying. People who come to an encyclopedia wanting to know the meaning and context of Kawaii in Japanese culture should be told, not directed to an entry in a dictionary. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 04:45, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - to the statement by nom that the Culture of Japan article "can be any length it needs to be", I do not agree. There is an optimum length which should be exceeded only with good reason, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_size_0593.html" title="Wikipedia:Article size">Wikipedia:Article_size</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary_style</a> among other places. The article is not bad as is in its current state and I see no reason for a delete. Calling it "japancruft" seems rather pejorative. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 05:36, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, its obvious concensus is agaisnt the nominator.

<dd>I agree the consensus is against a deletion. The strength of feeling in favour of a rewrite what comes across most strongly for me. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarryvalder_f05c.html" title="User:Barryvalder">Barryvalder</a> 11:56, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I hope everyone realizes that "rewrite" does not mean anything productive here. At best it means "do nothing" and at worst it means "add a lot of original research". I look forward to the vigorous participation of "keep" voters to remove the OR from the article as it is, and guard against addition of more OR. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hokkaido_Crow_7bd1.html" title="User:The Hokkaido Crow">The Crow</a> 16:09, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
