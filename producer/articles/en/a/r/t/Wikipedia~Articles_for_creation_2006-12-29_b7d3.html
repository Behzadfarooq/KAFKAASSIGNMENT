<p>clamping an oval tube or pipe to another object can be difficult. Pipe clamps are not designed for this. The term "pipe clamp" refers instead to a system where the pipe is a channel or brace for the clamp assembly. Pipe clams are often used in woodworking.</p>
<p>Joining tubes side to side: A band clamp consisting of a strong flexible strap and a method of tightening the strap is a simple way of clamping two tubes or pipes. Sticky sided tape (such as duck tape) falls into this category. The tape being the strap and the pull exerted by the applier as the tape is wrapped as the method of tightening. The disadvantage of the band clamp is that the entire clamping force is exerted at the point the tube contacts the other object. Depending on the physical properties of the tube the force generated can easily deform the tube.</p>
<p>A better method is to distribute the force more evenly around the tubes such as with a worm clamp, U-Bolt, Saddle Clamps, or hinged clamps.</p>
<p>still better is a soft polymer pad and attachment system such as Vermatic clamps (<a href="http://www.vermatic.com/hose.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.vermatic.com/hose.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.vermatic.com/hose.htm</a>) a polymer pad also acts as a shock absorber and can reduce vibrations due to pressure changes in the fluid.</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> - I'd like to accept this article - but it's not really clear from what you've written how this is different from a <a href="../../../p/i/p/Pipe_clamp.html" title="Pipe clamp">Pipe clamp</a> or maybe from a <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hose_clamp.html" title="Hose clamp">Hose clamp</a>. Since the word 'Pipe' and 'Tube' are more or less synonymous, it's hard to see what you are getting at. The article <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clamp_%28tool%29.html" title="Clamp (tool)">Clamp (tool)</a> has a link to Tube clamps - but that was only added (by you) yesterday. There was no preceeding mention of Tube clamps - which worries me. Are you in fact talking about one of the other kinds of clamp listed there - for which an article may already exist under some other name? If you could perhaps explain in more detail - and provide some links to pictures of the various kinds you are talking about, that would help. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 16:28, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The purpose and objective of the game, is to forget your playing the game. After someone loses the game, by remembering the game, they must verbally establish their loss of the game, by stateing "I lost the game". After one loses the game they have 30 minutes to forget about the game again. Your job now, is to go forth, and spread news about the game to as many people as possible. Good Luck</p>

It was first mentioned on a map of Sturzelbronn in 1313 under the name Ludenschiedt. The name was derived from two two sheperds Leudo and Scheide. The town has also shifted hands many times from France to Germany and also been the scene of much battle particularly during WWII.</p>
<p>This has also resulted in massive population shifts. In 1817 the village was home to 459 residents and by 1852 had reached a peak of 650. Today though the population has since decreased to 132 people in 1999. The shift is mostly a result of WWII and the movement of people from Liederschiedt to the nearby town of Roppeviller.</p>

<p>Stanley H. Klein, born Oct 15, 1908 (died April 12, 1992) was a noted New York City Architect. The son of Hungarian immigrants, Ferdinand and Regina Neudorfer, he was a graduate of the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art and of New York University.</p>
<p>Among his most well-known designs was the single family, six room house shown at the 1959 American exhibition in Moscow, where Richard Nixon and Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev held their televised "Great Kitchen Debate." Designed to help the Soviet people get the feel of "an average American home", the home was similar to hundreds of homes he designed on Long Island and the NY metro area.</p>
<p>Larger homes built in Jamaica, Queens, NY, and elsewhere featured a symmetrical colonial style; many of these larger brick homes still exist throughout Jamaica Estates and Queens.</p>
<p>He also designed the Hillcrest Jewish Center, the Queensboro Jewish Center and Temple Beth Sholom, all in Queens, and the Pine Hollow Country Club Clubhouse.</p>
<p>He was married for 50 years to the late Audrey Klein and had three children, the late Michael F. Klein, Roberta Klein, and David Klein, AIA.</p>

St Joseeph's High School, Pashan, Pune, was established in 1961. It is an all girls school run by a Catholic institution. It is one of the most reputed schools in Pune and is run by the Congregation of Jesus and Mary, India. The current principal of the school is Sr. Flory. The school prepares its students for the SSC examinations and it recognized by the Govt. of Maharashtra. It is situated amidst a lot of greenery and has one of the largest hockey grounds in Pune. St Josephs' girls, commonly known as 'Josephites' are given the opportunity to excel both, in sports (mainly hockey and basketball) and academics (excellent SSC history). All secondary school students are divided into four houses in order to encourage a healthy competitive atmosphere throughout the year. The four houses, mainly the green house (House of Loyalty), the blue house (House of Integrity), the yellow house (House of Endurance) and the red house (House of Enterprise), compete with each other in various sports throughout the year for the General Championship Trophy, which is awarded annually to the winning house on sports day/P.T display. The school's marching squad has had a particularly distinct and successful history, closely followed by the school's choir and hockey team. The school motto, 'Count Not the Cost of Giving' and the school song by the same name, are engraved in the students from their primary school years.</p>

<p>John Brewer, The man that is more recognized and liked than any other Republican politician in the area. The name being catchy enough, Brewer, decided to run in the 2006 State Legislative Race against Incumbent Charles Miller (Democrat) for the seat to represent the 28th District. He appeared to be a heavy underdog until situations and scenarios worsened for the long time representative, Miller. Months of hard work and eventual radio spots gained a heavy reputation and liking by the majority of his district. His campaign was driven by the closing of the areas most known attraction, Nortons Southwest Hospital which was converted into a limited medical facility. He was also inspired to run due to his past runs against the Homosexual groups of Kentucky when he campaigned around the entire state Of Kentucky to impact the vote on the Gay ordinances that were suggested back in 2004.</p>
<p>After being recognized by many from his past statewide work, he was bashed by the very much Liberal Courier-Journal newspaper when they pleaded that area voters should vote for the opposition, Charles Miller. The paper later displayed his response that counter-acted the original article in which was posted by one of the state's well-known Democrats. He gained the help from local Councilman Doug Hawkins who in previous years fell victim to Mr. Miller in two unsuccessful attempts. He teamed with the American Family Association of Kentucky, several pro-family and pro-life associations, and was being referred to by several Republican and Democrat politicians within the city such as Betty Drextler, Renay Davis, and Tom Burch.</p>
<p>Though he had been endorsed by longtime Senator Dan Seum and Mayoral Candidate Kelly Downard, Brewer fell short by about 3,00 electoral votes within the district but was said to be the largest threat to not only Mr. Miller in previous races but to the Democratic majority within the State Legislature because of John Brewer's Conservative morals.</p>
<p>He is still undecided on running a second political campaign.</p>

<p>Wilson trained and worked as a painter throughout the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> undertaking medium and large-scale oil on canvas and also acrylic on vinyl paintings which addressed two concurrent themes: first, the politicalization of the image in the mass media and second, the politicalization of narrative in the mass media.

<p><i>OJ Simpson Mugshots</i> (1995-06): 59 small and medium sized paintings examining the politicalization of the image as portrait in the mass media using the O.J. Simpson mugshot as a thematic and conceptual device.</p>
<p><i>L.A Drive-Inn</i> (1996-97): 21 medium and large scale paintings based on Wilson’s first hand experience of <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> in the several days that proceeded the LA riots in 1992.</p>
<p><i>Millennium Bugs</i> (1998): 48 medium and large-scale paintings with colourful screen printed bugs as a play to the (then) current issue of the Y2K bug.</p>
<p><i>Bigotscapes</i> (1998-99): 25 large scale paintings on coloured stretched vinyl reappropriating Australian impressionist landscape paintings, such as <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Roberts_17ab.html" title="Tom Roberts">Tom Roberts</a> and <b>Author Streeton</b>, to thereby respond to the role of landscape during the rise of nationalism in Australian minority political parties such as Pauline Hanson's <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Nation_326a.html" title="One Nation">One Nation</a>.</p>
<p><i>Popscapes</i> (1999-2000): 128 small, medium and large-scale paintings that appropriated Australian post-war landscape paintings, such as <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidney_Nolan_1bf2.html" title="Sidney Nolan">Sidney Nolan</a> and <b>Authur Boyd</b>, through candy-like, brightly coloured and thickly applied interventions into the picture plane.

<p>Wilson began three noted series of miniatures: <i>Crash</i>, <i>Disasters of Small</i>, and <i>The Empire of Small</i>.. These detailed works began as a response to the role of the scaled object in contemporary art and later evolved to embrace themes of memory and place through issues and tensions between narrativity. Materials used are both commercially manufactured model kits and scratch-built cardboard/plastic objects attached onto various types of vintage hard-cover books.</p>

<p><i>The Empire of Small series 1</i> (2002-04): 75 small dioramas mounted on vintage books found in op shops and second hand book stores responding to how memory and trauma inter-relate. Selected examples, such as the sub-series <i>Bomber Command</i> reconstruct aspects of memory and place through the hobby war diorama genre. Australian curator <b>Malcom Bywaters</b> describes these works as 'Dresden, Normandy, Iraq and 9/11 at maximum reality [1]. The complete installation was exhibited at the Academy gallery, Launceston in July 2004 and one individual diorama was exhibited in 2002 at the Centre on Contemporary Art Seattle, USA.</p>
<p><i>The Empire of Small series 2</i> (2006-): 150 small dioramas mounted on vintage books found in op-shops and second hand bookstores responding to the notion of the ‘death of the book’ from digital media by reconstructing a conceptual reclaim of narrative structures using scale as a mode to articulate such themes of reductionism. A second series within this dialogue probes how narrative structures changed post <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_4153.html" title="9/11">9/11</a> in the mass media and uses scale to measure this shift in its ensuing politicalization. Exhibition of this installation will be displayed in Australia and the US in 2009.</p>

<p>Wilson began using video from 1998 onwards as a temporal response and extension to painting. Since 2004 he has produced over 200 video artworks under the title of <i>Mememoria series</i>, <i>The Memory Palace series</i>, <i>Filmic Memorials series I-IV</i> and <i>Ubber Memoria I &amp; II</i>. These particular works that Wilson himself describes as ‘video paintings’ explore the nature of memory and place through the moving image and its subsequent affect on autobiographical memory. In these works, Wilson has deconstructed family home movies, vintage 8mm film, found 9mm film and from late 2006 onwards, incorporated these filmic images with High Definition Video (<a href="../../../h/d/v/HDV_37ae.html" title="HDV">HDV</a>) to convey tensions of fractured memory. Film theorist <b>Leon Marvell</b> describes Wilson’s later work in <i>Photofile</i> as “an ambitious and exquisitely realised exploration of the tension between artefact and memory” [2] while other reviews, such as <b>Diane Clausen</b> in <i>Realtime</i>, have described his videoart as 'hypnotic'.[3] Filmic influences include <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Hitchcock_0cee.html" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>, <b>Michel Gondry</b> and <b>Oliver Hirschbiegel</b>. Videoart influences include <b>Brendan Lee</b>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Viola_3b9b.html" title="Bill Viola">Bill Viola</a> and <b>Eija-Liisa Ahtila</b>.</p>

<p><i>The Memory Palace</i> (2002-05): 35 video art works that raise questions about the role of false memories in places of trauma described by Briony Lee Davies in <i>Artlink</i> as crafted with 'a deep sense of foreboding'.[4] Early works were screened at CAST, Hobart in 2003; ten works were exhibited at the Academy Gallery, Launceston in 2005; at the Institute of Modern Art Brisbane in its Small Black Box curated program; and its sister work, <i>Gone</i> screened at Bed Superclub at the Thailand New Media Arts Festival in 2005.</p>
<p><i>Filmic Memorials series I</i> (2004): 65 video art works that deconstruct vintage 8mm home movies derived from Wilson’s personal archive of family footage. Selected works were screened in 2005 at the Perth Institute of Contemporary Art, Perth; Hera Gallery, Rhode Island and at Federation Square during the Melbourne International Arts Festival 2005.</p>
<p><i>Filmic Memorials series 2</i> (2004-05): 50 video art works that reappropriate mnemonic narratives with source footage from 8mm home movies. Selected works were screened in a video installation at the Memory Grid, Australian Centre for the Moving Image, Melbourne in 2005. In 2006 additional works were screened at the International Festival of Videoart of Valencia, Spain; the International Festival of Videoart Don Benito; and in Art Tech Media 06 at the Bilbao, Centre for Contemporary Culture Barcelona, Da2 Museum, Museum Centre of Contemporary Art (atrium), Vitoria, Parraga Centre, Murcia, Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Mallorca, National Museum Centre of Art Reina Sofia, Madrid and at Museum of Contemporary Art Fenosa Union, Coruna.</p>
<p><i>Filmic Memorials series 3</i> (2005-06): 22 video art installations that question the role of memory in the visual dialogues set up by vintage home movies and the viewer. One noted installation was exhibited at the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art in <i>New06</i>, described by <b>Luke Benadictus</b> in the <i>Sunday Age</i> as 'being the barometer for the hottest emerging talent in the Australian art world'[5] and by Australian art critic <b>Charles Green</b> in Artforum.com as a 'spooky, noir, digital doctoring of family home-movie memories.'[6]</p>
<p><i>Filmic Memorials series 4</i> (2006-): 10 video art installations that facilitate a merger between the miniature and vintage film.</p>
<p><i>Ubber Memoria series 1</i> (2006): 25 video art works filmed in Germany in 2006 that reposition memory and art in a filmic context. <b>Doug Church</b> describes this series by saying that 'at first glance these works appear 'pretty' but as the duration of the video progresses one cannot help but feel discomforted by the Schizophrenic film speed coupled with the intrusive stares of the characters looking straight at the viewer. [7]</p>
<p><i>Ubber Memoria series 2</i> (2006-): 35 video artworks filmed in Germany and the UK that dissect the role of the portrait in video art while at the same time question the affect of memory through places thus articulated through performative narratives.</p>
<p><i>Gothic memoria series 1-6</i> (2007): 1000 video paintings exploring Gothic Romanticism through video art. These works are scheduled for filming in May 2007 onwards in the UK, Germany, France, New Zealand and Australia.</p>

<p>In 1996, Wilson and Melbourne-based painter Monica Adams opened <i>Indigo Studios</i>, a private art school located in the suburb of Burwood, Melbourne. The intent of the venture was to introduce contemporary art to audiences who were not traditionally art focused. A total of 45 exhibitions by art students and emerging artists were held in the gallery between 1997-2002 at the three different sites that <i>Indigo</i> occupied between these periods. The second site was a derelict shopfront and residence previously used as a backstreet brothel also located in Burwood and was. The third and final site was a derelict two-storey Federation shopfront and residency located in Camberwell renovated by Adams and Wilson into a two-gallery floor space with studios and accommodation upstairs. It was also haunted. In 2001, Wilson left <i>Indigo</i> and Adams later closed the business in 2003.</p>
<p>Wilson was a curator at the Jackman Gallery in St.Kilda, Melbourne in 2000. Independant projects have included over 20 exhibitions in Melbourne, Seattle, Berlin and Hobart. These include <i>Australian Gothic</i> (2007) at Project Space/Spare Room, Melbourne and the Directors Lounge, Berlin (2007) and <i>Post-Cinema</i> touring Australia and Germany in 2007 and 2008.</p>
<p>In 2006 Wilson established a curatorial project titled <i>Vault Nine Contemporary Art</i>, an online commercial gallery specialising in contemporary painting and videoart.</p>

<p>HAMSANADAM is a very beautiful raga in carnatic music(one of the 2 forms of indian classical music, the other being hindustani music).The notes are sa,ri(chatusruthi rishabham),ma(prathi madhayama),pa,ni(kakali nishadam).The main mood of this raga is happiness,that is listening to a song composed in this raga evokes happiness, gloom flies away.When we refer to the raga HAMSANADAM,the song or composition which comes first to the music lover's mind is the beautiful and splendid 'BANTURITHI KOLU 'composed by Saint Thyagaraja which is a composition dedicated to Lord SriRama.Even though compositions are less in this raga,almost all film songs composed in this raga are super hits.Another aspect of this raga is that listening to a song composed in this raga evokes a feeling of being in a celestial communion with the Lord.</p>

<p>Pham Ngu Lao (1255-1320)</p>
<p><br />
Pham Ngu Lao was a native of Phu Ung village, Duong Hao district (currently belonging to An Thi district). He was born in 1255 and died in 1320.</p>
<p>Since he was small, he was agile and excellent in martial arts. In his essay "Notes taken on rainy days", Pham Dinh Ho described the meeting between him and Tran Hung Dao as followed:</p>
<p>On that day, Hung Dao Vuong and his entourage were heading for the royal capital. There was a man sitting by the side of the road weaving a basket. When the vanguards approached to clear the way, he continued sitting patiently as if he did not notice anyone. When they used their lances to stab him into his thigh, he continued sitting without stirring. Seeing that, Hung Dao Vuong stopped and asked him questions, he then answered that he was thinking of a sentence in a military manual, so he did not notice anything. Knowing that he was a talented man, Hung Dao Vuong let him sit with him in his palanquin and left for the royal capital. Since then, he became a special guest of Hung Dao Vuong, who had fondness for him and married off his daughter to him. He also recommended Pham Ngu Lao to the royal court. In the two resistance wars against the Nguyen invaders (1285-1288), Pham Ngu Lao made many contributions.</p>
<p>Under the reign of Tran Nhan Tong, he was in charge of the right back army. Under the reign of An Tong (in 1924), he followed Thuong Hoang to fight Ai Lao in Dao Long river.</p>
<p>He took the position of Kiem Nghiem general in 1298 and Than Ve general in 1299. In 1301, he defeated the Ai Lao troops in Muong Lai and was promoted to Than Ve chief general. Under the reign of Minh Tong, in 1318, Chiem Thanh army staged an invasion; he led the army to defeat the enemy. He died in 1320 at the age of 66. The king ordered a five-day recess of court to mourn over him.</p>
<p>Pham Ngu Lao is an excellent army general who trained his troops with strict disciplines. His career was renowned in the Tran dynasty. As Pham Ngu Lao's military career, wherever his troops came, their enemies were frightened. Pham Dinh Ho wrote about Pham Ngu Lao as followed: “When alive, Pham Ngu Lao was a chief general. When he died, he was titled a good genius. A temple of his worship was set up to replace his own house. He had a famous poem:</p>
<p>Hoành sóc giang sơn cáp kỷ thu Tam quân kỳ hổ khí thôn Ngưu Nam nhi vị liễu công danh trái Tu thính nhân gian thuyết Vũ Hầu.</p>
<p>(Practicing lance-dancing throughout the longevity of the country The army was strong enough to swallow the Buffalo star As a man, I have not completed my position and fame I am ashamed when listening to the story of Vu Hau)</p>
<p>This poem was evidence of his strong mettle.”</p>
<p>Pham Ngu Lao’s works include:</p>

<p>Kaydee were a 4 piece rock band from Kilkenny, Ireland. Original lineup Jan Kealy - vocals, Kevin Bruce - guitar, Bob Murphy - Bass, Joey Shore - drums.</p>
<p>In 1995 they signed an international record deal with EMI. The band's debut single, 'Cradle', was released on Lime Records / EMI Records Ireland on 20th june 1997 and entered the Irish charts at No.18. On September 5 1997 Kaydee released 'Falling Down', the group's second single.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards Jan left the band and was replaced by Tara Egan-Langley ( eventually to become <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tara_Blaise_06e7.html" title="Tara Blaise">Tara Blaise</a>) on vocals. Mark McCorry was now playing bass as Bob Murphy had already left the group a couple of months earlier. In April 1998 the group released their third single, "Mr. Sweeney", which had a sting section written by Will Malone who had worked with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Verve_e47e.html" title="The Verve">The Verve</a>. Two more singles appeared, 'Seven Days' on July 3 1998, and a remix of 'Cradle' in August 1998. Both had Jan's Vocals replaced by Tara's. On August 17 1998, "Stop! I'm Doing It Again", the group's long awaited debut album, was released to critical acclaim, however the group announced that they were to spit up before the end of the year.</p>

<p>The Brain Tumor Funders’ Collaborative (BTFC) is a partnership among eight private philanthropic and advocacy organizations designed to bridge the “translational gap” that prevents promising laboratory science from yielding new medical treatments. Formed over a period of two years, a group of private funders supporting brain cancer research convened a series of workshops with researchers and clinicians and challenged each other to identify what new forms of research and new structures within the research community are needed to produce effective therapies for brain tumors. The result was a broad outline of a new funding initiative, hoping to provoke creativity and novel approaches. Collaboration among investigators is a key ingredient, to span the gap between basic science and clinical application, and among the various disciplines and institutions which currently operate independently.</p>
<p>Each participating member of BTFC also maintains its own grantmaking program and, in some cases, patient information and advocacy program. These are accessible through their individual websites <a href="http://www.braintumorfunders.org/about/" class="external text" title="http://www.braintumorfunders.org/about/" rel="nofollow">BTFC Member Websites</a>.</p>
<p>On March 14, 2006, the Brain Tumor Funders’ Collaborative announced results of their first joint funding initiative: three grants of $2 million each awarded to multi-institutional teams of researchers and clinicians to promote translation of scientific discoveries into effective new treatments for brain cancer patients. <a href="http://www.braintumorfunders.org/news/3-14-06.php" class="external text" title="http://www.braintumorfunders.org/news/3-14-06.php" rel="nofollow">Press Release</a></p>

<p>By definition mean camber line has to do with aerodynamics.It is goes part and along with the subject of airfoils and chordlines. The mean camber line is an imaginary line which lies halfway between the upper surface and lower surface of the airfoil and intersects the chord line at the leading and trailing edges. But between the leading and trailing edge the camber line can curve above or below the chord line. The camber value specified here gives the highest value above or below the chord line divided by the chord length.</p>

<p><i>Girl In Landscape</i> is the third novel by Jonathan Lethem. The protagonist is 13 year old Pella Marsh, who finds herself transplanted with her family to the Planet Of The Archbuilders following a tragic family death, a desolate location littered with crumbling structures previously built by these bizarre aliens, who have abandoned the planet. The book combines sci-fi themes with the imagery of the American frontier; one of the epigraphs is a quote from John Wayne, and the jacket copy cites John Ford film <i>The Searchers</i> as an influence.</p>

<p>The American Sanctuary Association is a <a href="../../../5/0/1/501c3.html" title="501c3">501c3</a> nonprofit organization dedicated to providing guidelines for accepted exotic animal refuges and <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_sanctuary.html" title="Animal sanctuary">animal sanctuary</a>'s. These guidelines are to ensure that wonderful care and maintenance of accredited facilities is rigidly maintained.</p>
<p>There are thousands of international rescue efforts that would all benefit from common practices and communal knowledge and assistance. That way when an animal is in need of relocation, transport, or rescue the appropriate facility will be in contact and of high quality.</p>
<p>ASA acts similarly to the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_Zoos_and_Aquariums_4aef.html" title="Association of Zoos and Aquariums">Association of Zoos and Aquariums</a> but for refuges instead of zoos and government facilities.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/i/p/Tippi_Hedren_6f96.html" title="Tippi Hedren">Tippi Hedren</a> whose name is very common throughout hollywood is the founder and president of the organization. Her high standards are followed by many corresponding animal organizations throughout the US</p>
<p>Some of the criterion for participating organizations require that the facility does not breed its animals. Exotics are high in number and the facilities that can afford to take them is very low comparatively. Breeding only increases the problem in captivity. Animal Sanctuaries and refuges must also maintain governement non profit tax exempt status to show that the facility is not making money, but using it solely to help the animals under its care.</p>
<p>These requirements are just 2 of many that maintain high credibility as educational facilities and safe houses for needy wildlife.</p>

THE SI STUD YEARS 1988-2005 Sean Hollywood was orignally known as the <i><b>SI STUD</b></i>.He originally became known as the SI STUD on December 9th,1988 and was given this name by 3 girls that were from Nutley,NJ.He got the name SI STUD mainly he used to come into New Jersey from Staten Island,NY to see alot of concerts.Originally the name SI STUD started out as a joke but it simply became really popular among many on the east coast.</p>
<p>Lamour(Brooklyn,NY),Studio One(Newark,NJ),Limelight(N.Y.C.,NY),Redspot(Staten Island,NY)are a few of the clubs that the SI STUD hung out at on a daily basis.You could basically walk into a club and you would hear the DJ announed that the SI STUD was in the building which brought cheers to many.There was one instance in 1992 when the SI STUD was hanging out at Lamour in Brooklyn and the DJ even went as far to announce that the SI STUD left the building which definitely made him sound like he was hotheaded.Simply he's the SI STUD and everyone respected that.</p>
<p>In 1994 the SI STUD released an underground home video entitled SI STUD Volume 1 that was featured on Staten Island Cable in October of 2004.Originally released in July of 1994 the SI STUD was featured hanging out in a few nightspots in the NYC/NJ area.One funny part of the video was the SI STUD in a sumo wrestling contest with Lamour DJ Tony Mecca where the both wore sumo wrestling suits.Also featured in the video was LUSCIOUS LAURA(Laura Magliola)who played the valet of the SI STUD.SI STUD and LUSCIOUS LAURA went their seperate ways(many have said it was due to the unprofessionalism of LUSCIOUS LAURA that forced him to fire her.Despite the tension the video was still considered an underground success.</p>
<p>The SI STUD also released SI STUD Volumes 2 and 3 in 1994 and 1995 respectively.</p>
<p>From 1998 thru 2000 that SI STUD appeared as a co-host on The Wrestling Connection.This was a show that appeared bi-weekly on Staten Island,NY cable and the topic of course was pro wrestling.There have been talks that the cast may come and do a reunion show but nothing has been etched in stone.</p>
<p>From Feb 2000-June of 2000 and from June 2001-Sept 2001 the SI STUD was a DJ for Nutley,NJ internet radio station Future Now Radio which featured only new music.The SI STUD simply played new music from 80's style artists as well as new songs from 80's artists. - - From June 2002 thru the present the SI STUD is currently a DJ for the internet based radio Station Extreme Radio(<a href="http://www.extremeradio.co.uk).The" class="external free" title="http://www.extremeradio.co.uk).The" rel="nofollow">http://www.extremeradio.co.uk).The</a> show features the SI STUD playing the best hard rock music of the 70's.80's and beyond and is on every Friday 8pm-9pm EST and every Sunday 7pm-8pm EST.The SI STUD also has featured interviews from time to time.</p>
<p>SEAN HOLLYWOOD 2005-PRESENT</p>
<p>On 11/5/05 the SI STUD shocked alot of people when he added the name SEAN HOLLYWOOD to the SI STUD monicker.Some were confused and some were upset when they first heard SI STUD being called SEAN HOLLYWOOD.</p>
<p>SEAN HOLLYWOOD(SI STUD)was quoted as saying that with his popularity rising(especially in the college crowds)that SI STUD can come across to some as a porn name or someone that has a big ego.The name SEAN HOLLYWOOD was suggested to him by a co-worker(one day when the stud was wearing sunglasses and thought the name SEAN HOLLYWOOD was cool.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you know him as the SI STUD or SEAN HOLLYWOOD you all can't dispute that he is the greatest 80's metal fan of all time.</p>
<p>One place that SEAN HOLLYWOOD hangs out at today on a daily basis is PUB 46(<a href="http://www.myspace.com/pub46" class="external free" title="http://www.myspace.com/pub46" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/pub46</a>) in CLifton,NJ.Especilly on Saturday nights for their Saturday Night 80's Party which is hands down the number 80's party around.</p>
<p>SEAN HOLLYWOOD also works in the security industry as well.</p>

<p>Participating in the new museums411.com, will be an exciting undertaking that we hope will benefit the Museum community. We have 2049 New York State Museums, Historical Societies, Zoos, and Aquariums listed on our website. This is the largest and most comprehensive list of these institutions on the internet.</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce the addition of a new feature on our web site. It is called Kid's Corner and will be written by my 11 year old daughter Lexi Mae. This feature will highlight museums and exhibits that are of particular interest to kids. She will interview museum personel to get the inside scoop on all the exciting programs and exhibits that have been created especially for kids.</p>
<p>As a parent and a Museum advocate, my choice of Museums doesn't alway agree with my children's, so we decided to let the kids express themselves, and let both the kids and parents know what they think.</p>
<p>This Kid's Corner feature will be interactive with our web site visitors. Children and parents will be encouraged to e-mail Lexi Mae at our website to share their views and experiences. We will try to post as many of these e-mails as possible.</p>

<p>James Colwill (aka LiStEnIo) is an unsigned British artist and 15-year-old guitar player with only three years of experience. His official myspace site is the only place that he promotes himself from as a solo musician, and on demo recordings he arranges and produces them himself. His music consists of a collaboration of RnB and Rock, as well as the use of lead/backing singing and rapping in his more Hip Hop influenced material. Listenio's overall innovative sound involves experimental hybrid mixes of varied guitar studio takes and physcadelic computer effects (an influence from his hero Jimi Hendrix), as well as such for his many vocal takes involving lead singing, backing and sometimes rap, and ultimately a Keyboard-based hybrid combination involving various synthesizer uses (particular influences in his music involve Blues artists like Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker, to later musicians of the Blues and Jazz era such as Miles Davis, Eric Clapton and Cream, John Mayall and the bluesbreakers to RnB/Funk legends Prince, Stevie Wonder and James Brown) . Listenio's wish is to one day speak against world politics and government views like that of president George W. Bush and his decision to invade Iraq, a war Listenio despises as he wishes to persuade his listeners through peace and love in his anti-war protest songs (these influences ranging from folk artist Bob Dylan to the similar figure he models himself upon when writing daring songs like George-in-the-Box: controversial sportsman Muhammad Ali who similarly despised the war in Vietnam).</p>
<p>James has low GCSE grades even in Music and struggles in educational skills, and his determination to make a mark in Music history is the undoubtful driving force behind his belief that the Industry is his only way to make a living.</p>

<p>“Welcome 2 Detroit” is a song by rapper Trick Trick, released in 2005. It was the first single off his album The People vs. The song was produced by and features fellow Detroit rapper Eminem. It peaked at #40 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and it is the most successful single of Trick Trick’s career so far. A video was created for the song which featured both Eminem and Proof.</p>
<p>In the first verse Eminem calls up Trick Trick and tells him to "Quick come pick me up, bring them guns, Come to the club, meet me out front" because "There's some chump up in this bitch, Poppin' some junk cause he's drunk, And we may have to fuck his ass up". He follows by stating that "Ask around and they all know Tricky" in the chorus, implying that everyone in Detroit knows who Trick Trick is.</p>
<p>In the second verse Trick Trick introduces himself to the listener. He explains how he has "been bangin' the underground since 95" and that "You heard about me, you just didn't know it was me".</p>
<p>In the third verse he tells Eminem of his loyalty to him stating "From now on every beef that you get in homie I'm in it". In this final verse he also thanks Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre for signing Eminem "So peace to Jimmy and Dre for signin' my n***a".</p>
<p>Eminem expressed an interest in working with Trick Trick more than 10 years ago and this is one of two tracks in which he is featured on in this album.</p>
<p>The song was also included on the Anger Management 3: The Exclusive Shade 45 Mixtape on track 21.</p>

<p>Sirromar 01:40, 30 December 2006 (UTC) Lorraine Gill was born at Yagoona, Australia outside Sydney, in 1941, and from the age of 15 was winning art scholarships and awards.</p>
<p>As Michael Goedhuis of Studio International observed, Lorraine Gill "embarked with Cartesian rigour on a painting career."</p>
<p>The artist has lived, studied and painted in Spain, England, France, Italy and Australia. Lorraine has also been the subject of chapters in two books devoted to exceptional women, has had a television documentary of her life and work produced by the BBC, and appeared with Henry Moore in a feature one-hour BBC television documentary on the work of Cezanne.</p>
<p>One of Gill’s most significant accomplishments was being invited by the Australian Aboriginals to live with them on their settlements as an 'artist in residence'. They befriended and protected her, and knew her affectionately as "that women with them sticks" - her pencils and paint brushes.</p>
<p>For the last 18 years Lorraine has been working on three books and three series of large oil paintings. Two of these series were featured in a major exhibition at the Air Gallery in London 9-20 September 2002.</p>
<p>The first of these, the 'Australian Series', chronicled her journey and travels in the Australian Outback. The second, the 'Kraken Series', featured an exploration of the human subconscious through the metaphor of the Kraken.</p>
<p>Further exhibitions followed at Australia House, London in 2004, and the Henley Festival in 2004.</p>
<p>Following an extended return trip to Australia in 2005, Lorraine is currently working on a series of watercolours inspired by the Australian outback.</p>
