<p>This article was a result of a move from <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_occupation_of_Norway_406c.html" title="Nazi occupation of Norway">Nazi occupation of Norway</a>, as well as apologist edits for the Nazi regime, e.g., that the invasion was a result of Allied aggression against vital supply of iron ore from Sweden to Germany.</p>
<p>The original article is correctly titled, for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Although there haven't been other German occupations of Norway, labeling it "Nazi" makes it precise and less ambiguous</li>
<li>It was not only a military occupation - in addition to the role of Quisling's illegal regime, Terboven ran the civilian organizations that occupied Norway but had no control over the military forces there</li>
<li>In truth, not just Germans were involved in the occupation - there were Norwegian collaborators and Austrian troops</li>
<li>There is no reason to embellish the fact that this was a Nazi act of aggression. I'm certainly not trying to diminish the fact that the Nazi leadership was German, but the responsibility should be laid at the feet of the Nazis first and foremost. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 17:55, May 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If there existed a "Nazi occupation", there must also exist a "Zionist occupation" or "Likud occupation" of Palestine, and a "neo-con occupation" or "republican occupation" of Iraq.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Concerning the Austrians, Norway was occupied by <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> as a state. Austria did not occupy Norway as Austria did not exist as souvereign state at the time in question, Austria was part of Germany. Also, military occupation is the correct term here. Consider checking what a <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_occupation.html" title="Military occupation">military occupation</a> actually is.</dd>

<dd>We might as well include the Palestinian occupation of British territory, the British occupation of Turkish territory, the Turkish occupation of Crusader territory, the Crusader occupation of Muslim territory, the Islamic occupation of Roman territory, the Roman and Greek occupation of Israeli/ Jewish territory, and the Jewish occupation of Canaanite territory.... and on and on and on, back to when Homo erectus occupied the territory of whatever animal was king or queen of the Levant before his or her coming. It's ALL relevant, but it makes quite a bit of work to do. Besides, it's easier to refer to border changes and conquests than occupations, and, even then, "occupation" should refer to takeovers that are temporary. Much of Israel's "occupied" territory is under Israel's jurisdiction in a manner intended to be permanent or long-lasting; therefore, "colonizing" or "annexation" is really a better term.

Or expansionism.) <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickyrab_21c2.html" title="User:Rickyrab"></a> â€” <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickyrab_21c2.html" title="User:Rickyrab">Rickyrab</a> | <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickyrab_2fd1.html" title="User talk:Rickyrab">Talk</a> 18:46, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I would argue that the Nazi regime in Germany was illegal in and of itself; please see point 3 above.

<dd>Leifern, you are correct. We unfortunately have a number of people who attack those who are Jewish (or anyone who doesn't hate the State of Israel), and usse any debate as a pretext to use anti-Jewish polemics. I would think that this Judeao-obsessive anger is reason enough to disregard their views on any subject, including this one. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with AYArktos. Following the logic of those who prefer term: "Nazi Occupation", for consistency purpose, ALL of the occupations during the last 60-70 yrs. by Germany, Soviet Union, China, Japan, US, Israel, etc. should be renamed using the name of the political party in power at the time. --<a href="../../../t/t/y/User%7ETtyre_65d2.html" title="User:Ttyre">Ttyre</a> 15:39, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Leifern's explanation above. As he points out, the occupation was not just military, it was political. The analogy between Nazi/Germany and Bush/USA is faulty. However much a shmuck our president is, he was legitimately elected and complies iwth our constition about as well as most presidents. While the Nazi party was a political party, it was also a paramilitary organization; Hitler was legally named Chancelor, but no one seriously believes his government has any kind of legitimacy (one of the issues at the Nuremburg War Crimes Tribunal). World War II was unique in many ways, because of the ideological and political dimensions of the conflict â€” it was not just another war, and Germany was definitly not just your typical occupying power. And, as Leifern points out, the occupation involved not just the self-interested kind of collaboration that always occurs, but politically motivated collaboration. "German military occupation" is history without politics. This is bad history, <i>especially</i> in this case. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 23:16, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Doc, note very carefully, I did not write "<b>just</b> 'following orders' ", what I <i>did</i> write was that the German army "<b>was following</b> orders" of the Nazi party, not as a judgment of its "morality", but as an aspect of how the occupation worked and how the system worked as a totality as a whole in Nazi Germany and beyond its borders: It was a clear "<a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyramid.html" title="Pyramid">Pyramid</a>" with Hitler at the top, the Nazi party below him, and below them came the army and then the rest of the German people and below them their foreign (Axis) allies and collaborators, all of whom share "moral" guilt, but this is not about guilt as such, this is about how the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_system.html" title="Political system">political system</a> of Norway functioned at that time. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 00:07, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - the government of Germany was recruited from the Nazi party, but it was not the Nazi party who occupied Norway, but the German army, German government and German police forces.

Further, I suggest not to hype the supposed difference between the attributes "Nazi" and "German". The above objection that speaking of a "Nazi occupation" would necessitate to speak of <i>"'Zionist occupation' or 'Likud occupation' of Palestine"</i> or <i>"a 'neo-con occupation' or 'republican occupation' of Iraq"</i> by analogy does not hold water, neither does Halibutt's comment that it <i>"was not the Nazi party who occupied Norway</i>" - Halibutt, is it possible that you are reading too much stuff of <a href="http://www.wprost.pl/ar/?O=72714" class="external text" title="http://www.wprost.pl/ar/?O=72714" rel="nofollow">this</a> kind?&#160;;-) The Nazis were not just another party that happened to be in power at the time, but a <i>totalitarian</i> regime which established a firm grip on German society. By the time WW II broke out, the German government, state apparatus and society at large had become largely synonymous with the Nazis. It is a commonly accepted practice to prefix the name of the country with the name of the totalitarian regime which controlled it (that is why we have a "Fascist Italy", a "Nazi Germany", a "Soviet Russia", but no "Republican United States" or "Likud Israel"), and to use the ideology's name as interchangeable with the name of the country proper. Thus, "Nazi occupation" and "German occupation" are equally correct. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 09:59, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Not really, I neither like nor read the Wyprost weekly, they are far too rightist for me. My oppinion is equally valid as yours, BTW. As to the Nazi being synonymous to Germany - not really. There is a strong belief in many of contemporary historians that the German army was not that Nazified - and it was the German army (not Nazi military units!) that carried over both the invasion and the occupation. Also, the civilian German authorities were not always Nazi. The Nazis were indeed a totalitarian regime, but it is the governments and armies that wage wars, not the regimes as such. It is John Doe and Jane Smith who might be Nazis, but the whole army and whole state? Of course, there is a common practice to add a prefix to the country's name in order to make it clear to which historical period we are referring. However, here the case is not about adding the prefix, but about replacing the whole name of the state with a name of one of the political factions. Also, as someone pointed out, there was only one German occupation of Norway, and there was only one German state at that time, so there's really no point in disambiguation. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a>

<dd><i>"Not really, I neither like nor read the Wyprost weekly, they are far too rightist for me."</i> I am pleased to hear that, no offence intended.&#160;:-) However, it seems that their opinion-forming power in Poland, even over those who try not not swallow their polarising line, is easily underestimated. Quite irrespective of that, you are, of course, entitled to your opinion that there are people who <i>"promote the view that it was a bunch of Nazis that were responsible for WWII, and not the state and the government of Germany"</i> - even if it <i>is</i> strikingly close to certain conspiracy theories emanating from Wprost's editorial office. However, those unnamed "people" seem to receive more attention in Poland than elsewhere, including Germany - the situation is similar as with the ominous <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_death_camps.html" title="Polish death camps">Polish death camps</a>, a term actually rarely heard outside Poland. I have a vague idea that this <i>might</i> be why you are reading more into the issue of "German" vs. "Nazi occupation" than there actually is (or should be, in my opinion). Note that I was not arguing for or against either attribute; my point is simply that the difference is not really as defining as you (and the author of this article) seem to think.</dd>
<dd>As for your comment on the German army - yes, ironically the German foreign service and military, milieus shaped by traditional, aristocratic conservatives, were a stronghold of anti-Nazi opposition. However, "stronghold" is a highly relative term here. In the end, the uppish generals executed the orders of the proletarian Nazi upstarts; and it should not be overlooked that every German soldier was obliged to swear an oath to Hitler as a <i>person</i>, not just as an incumbent of a constitutional office. The few officers who actively or passively opposed the regime, and attempted to assassinate Hitler as late as 1944, did so on their private initiative, not as representatives of the military or any constitutional body. The government consisted of Nazis, the army would not have started the war without receiving an order, and would certainly not have occupied Norway. In this light, your objection that it is <i>"governments and armies that wage wars, not the regimes as such"</i> appears like a distinction without much difference. <i>"It is John Doe and Jane Smith who might be Nazis, but the whole army and whole state?"</i> No, the army and the state were obviously not Nazis, as party membership was restricted to physical persons such as John Doe or Jane Smith. However, while not every single German John or Jane D. was a party member, the army and the state as a whole were executioners of Nazi policies. As for replacing <i>"the name of the state with a name of one of the political factions</i>" - I am sorry, but this statement does not reveal much historical competence. In Nazi Germany, the Nazi party was not simply "<i>one of the political factions</i>"; Germany was a one-party state, membership in many of the party's affiliated organisations (most notably the Hitler Youth) was compulsory. The party was not just one political faction - it was the only and defining political force from 1933 to 1945, and it was not governing within an existing state structure, but reshaped the state to fit its own ideology. It controlled each and every aspect of social life, leaving a degree of autonomy only to the two major churches. A key difference between Italian Fascism and German National Socialism was that the former saw itself as a kind of deus ex machina to preserve and strengthen the state, whereas the latter considered the "party" as the supreme incarnation of the general will. Although the Nazis never bothered to formally revoke the Weimar Constitution, it became waste-paper within weeks of Hitler's appointment as chancellor, and you will certainly not find any authority to refute that the Nazi state was an entity essentially different from the Weimar Republic. In the light of all this, there is really no compelling reason to replace the existing title "Nazi occupation" with "German occupation"; although, on the other hand, there is no compelling reason to keep the original title, either. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 15:26, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is simply incorrect that "the government consisted of Nazis". The government consisted of people from different political camps. The minister of finance was not a National Socialist, but a conservative which did not belong to any party. Anyway, this has nothing to do with the discussion. It is absurd to claim it was "Nazism" and not Germany which occupied Norway, and <i>no serious Norwegian historian</i> would support this ridiculous claim. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECourage_94d7.html" title="User:Courage">Courage</a> 19:46, 20 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>So you found a minister who was not a party member&#160;? Eureka, the history of Nazi Germany needs to be rewritten!&#160;;-) Not all ministers during the 12 years of Nazi rule were party members; in the very beginning, there were only three Nazis in the entire cabinet, and Hitler was hoped to be outmanoeuvered within months. As any history book will tell you, this did not help much. While the Nazis still had to be considerate of the conservative political establishment in the beginning, foreign minister von Neurath's replacement with Ribbentrop in 1938 marks the definite end of that period. The occupation of Norway occured afterwards. Apart from that, nobody claimed that <i>"it was "Nazism" and not Germany which occupied Norway"</i>. If you choose to read this <i>"ridiculous claim"</i> into the title "Nazi occupation", that is entirely your business. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 20:23, 20 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd><s>You are absolutely right that Nazi Germany never was the name of Germany. However, the names 'Third Reich' and 'Nazi Germany' are widely accepted names for the temporal phase of <i>Germany</i> (then officially <i>Deutsche Reich</i>) during which Hitler was its ruler. Nazi Germany is wider accepted in English, yet neither was an official name. In German the term Third Reich is more commonly used. See also the article <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and its talk page. A hardly used term is the 'Thousand Year Reich'. To overcome the trap that someone may think that Nazi Germany was not Germany, I believe it is good practice to use the names interchangeably in the text of articles on this era (that is Germany for Nazi Germany; not the other way around). In the title, however, the specificity of Nazi Germany can add to a better identification of the article's content. <small>I do not see what Israel or the US have to do with this issue.</small> <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb"><font color="green">gidonb</font></a> 21:30, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</s>

Nazi Germany, on the other hand, was a totalitarian state shaped by Nazi ideology. Not only were there no functioning democratic procedures to change the governement again or to articulate dissent; dissent itself was forbidden on pain of death. Similar can be said of the U.S. I repeatedly explained the difference; your consistent refusal to consider this gives me an idea that you are not really seeking to discuss the German occupation of Norway at all: Is it possible that you are really just looking for a venue to criticise Bush and Sharon?
