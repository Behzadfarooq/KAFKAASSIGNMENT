<li><b>Delete and Salt</b> I'd genuinely like to say keep for this article, if only because the authors have taken a degree of care in creating it that's uncommon for up-and-coming groups. However, a simple google search for "Profound Intent Play the Field" only gets hits for the band's (and it's frontman's) own websites. Per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> this band needs to be covered in multiple non-trivial secondary sources. Wikipedia will be happy to have an article about this group...once they become notable. It is not a place for them to build notability. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 16:42, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> so your saying that their manager or someone from their camp is using Wikipedia to promote the group. That's a misleading and slanderous account to make carrying some serious repercussions. We (as in the public) learn that with Scott Harris when he made a mockery of the group in an article he wrote. The magazine coverage did happen in the March 2007 issue of On Tap Magazine. The article “Profound Intentions” was retracted. Now if everyone here puts just as much time into visiting the group’s website and reading what they find on Google and other search engines as much as you gather to make slanderous yet unproven allegations regarding their notability and who started the article you’ll see your wasting your time. If you say the group isn’t notable then ‘what the hell’ is all the discussion about. Profound Intent is notable enough for the simple fact that you can Google the group, visit a legitimate official website and purchase their music from major retailers.68.239.77.10 23:40, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I am saying that someone associated with the band is using Wikipedia to promote the band, yes. It's neither misleading nor slanderous. I'm sorry if you feel that way, however the evidence points to this. The rules are quite simple and are outlined in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a>. Feel free to see them and if you want, attempt to get the rules changed.

<li><b>Comment</b> This article is too complex. It should only contain the critical facts. Not doing so has caused many of us to dispute the group’s notability. I think just focusing on the Retraction of a magazine article about the group which has made headlines across the country and the mentioning of their record Play the Field at this point should be the only things in which the article is based upon. In my opinion their notable for "disputing a reporter in the media" regarding a article viewed by a great amount of people and has now been retracted and slated to be re-written according to Robert Fulton the magazines editor. The current criteria for determining such notability for Bands is currently “unreasonable” which has led to this discussion. The group has a lot in common with every standard of the current criteria. However it doesn’t necessarily meet each standard fully simply because their not on a “Major” label and have a “Chart Hit” but they are on a indie label with a major distribution deal with “Catapult” (distribution) which makes their music available worldwide both in stores and online. They’ve performed more than, but 15 live performances they’ve made have aided in their establishment and notability as a group or band. I think it would be reasonable for there to be an article on Profound Intent at this point. Make it a stub and allow it to expand with provable content as the group progresses. As long as the information is true it wouldn’t hurt Wikipedia or us (its contributors). <a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQueen_Amber_Rice_04d4.html" title="User:Queen Amber Rice">Queen Amber Rice</a> 20:38, 7 March 2007 (UTC)<small>— <a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQueen_Amber_Rice_04d4.html" title="User:Queen Amber Rice">Queen Amber Rice</a> (<a href="../../../q/u/e/User_talk%7EQueen_Amber_Rice_a90e.html" title="User talk:Queen Amber Rice">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Queen_Amber_Rice_ba7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Queen Amber Rice">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The claim they are on an indie label with a major distribution deal is totally incorrect. The article refers to their labels as "LaPret World ENT" (LaPret is the name of one of the members strangely enough) and "Catapult". <a href="http://www.catapultdistribution.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.catapultdistribution.com/" rel="nofollow">Catapult</a> are a vanity distributor, anyone with <a href="http://www.catapultdistribution.com/howitworks.html" class="external text" title="http://www.catapultdistribution.com/howitworks.html" rel="nofollow">$35</a> can distribute an album through them. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney"><span style="color:#009">One Night In Hackney</span></a><sub><i><a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_0433.html" title="User talk:One Night In Hackney">303</a></i></sub></font> 22:55, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> Oh no Catapult is not the same as Catapult Digital Distribution Services. You can't pay no $35 fee, you have to be signed to a distribution deal.

<li><b>Comment</b> So there's two Catapults that have distribution deals with stores and online then? Until you provide evidence to the contrary, my claims stand, so perhaps instead of making veiled legal threats you could provide a link to the Catapult you allege to be different from Catapult Digital Distribution Services? <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney"><span style="color:#009">One Night In Hackney</span></a><sub><i><a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_0433.html" title="User talk:One Night In Hackney">303</a></i></sub></font> 00:24, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
