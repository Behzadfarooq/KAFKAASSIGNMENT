<li><b>Delete</b> This article does not deserve article status, it's non-notable and it's nothing more than a whacky idea/joke of which it's kind has no place or perpose on wiki. It's impractical and much less impossible. <a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFaris_b_ef04.html" title="User:Faris b">Faris b</a> 06:04, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> this article. However much one may dislike the subject matter there are no grounds for deletion of this article. The <i>Globus Cassus</i> project was proposed - and published - by a notable architect in notable circumstances (the Venice Architecture Biennale), it has been widely discussed and is therefore worthy of an article. It is worth noting that <i>Globus Cassus</i> is largely a thought experiment, since there is no pragmatic basis for its implementation in the near future anyway. With that in mind, the project is akin to many other "futurist" proposals such as <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terraforming.html" title="Terraforming">terraforming</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstellar_travel.html" title="Interstellar travel">interstellar travel</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_travel.html" title="Time travel">time travel</a> or <a href="../../../c/l/o/Closed_ecological_system.html" title="Closed ecological system">closed ecological systems</a> that if ever realised would undoubtedly pose major problems, but that are unlikely to be realised anyway and that, right now, serve as thought experiments. There are articles on myriad horrendous subjects (<a href="../../../m/e/i/Mein_Kampf_b165.html" title="Mein Kampf">Mein Kampf</a> springs to mind), but none should be deleted merely because they're horrendous. There is no way deletion is justified in this case. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 13:23, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The newness of an idea is not grounds for its being described as non-notable. Far from it. Look, if you want to argue against any proposal to actually implement <i>Globus Cassus</i>, please go ahead, though I don't believe the necessity will ever arise, since the project is hopelessly impractical. Please re-read and consider this description of the project (from the article): <i>Globus Cassus <b>acts as a philosophical model</b> for the opposite-based description of the Earth/World and <b>as a tool to understand the World's real functioning processes</b>.</i> That is a critical caveat to the basis of your objections, which, anyway, are groundless since we're talking about an article about <i>Globus Cassus</i>, not the project itself. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 13:20, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Are you people kidding? This article is whacked. It's not a striking idea, it's horrifying, appaling, terrifying and just plain whacked. This idea is impossible, plus, what happens if it broke down which you know it would? Everyone dies! Fine, keep your dumb article as it's apparent I won't wint this, I don't care, but if it gets deleted, I'll be happy. No offense but I can't imagine anyone ever thinking this is something that anyone would ever want to know about. <a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFaris_b_ef04.html" title="User:Faris b">Faris b</a> 22:32, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The purpose of an encyclopaedia is not to keep articles about nice, happy, cute things everyone likes. It's a collection of notable facts and ideas. The (probably far far far away) day in the future mankind will discuss the Globus Cassus, just sit among the oppositors and let your voice be heard. I personally find the Globus Cassus one of the most beautiful hypothesis for the future of mankind. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclopia_3946.html" title="User:Cyclopia">Cyclopia</a> 13:02, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I can be construed the unimaginable anyone, for I want to know about. The implausibility and/or impossibility of an idea shall not be taken as a signal of innotability. This way all articles discussing "science" in fictional works (eg. Star Wars, Stargate, ...) shall be deleted for innotability. On the contrary, this fictional creation is more notable than those aforementioned.

<dd>It's a putrid concept for a number of reasons. 1) It's most likely entirely impossible regardless of reasonably imaginable future technology. 2) It would certainly destroy much life and destroy the world as we know it. 3) Most of the world's current problems are solveable by us with technology we already have. There's no reason for poverty, hunger, most disease deaths, environmental degradation, etc. except that these are the necessary price for maintaining the priveleged lifestyles of a very small percentage of the world's population. Globus Cassus presupposes that we cannot or will not solve these problems without resorting to a mega-project of monumental risk, expense and dubious (at best) viability... but if Globus Cassus were actually necessary, humanity would already have passed the threshhold of survivability. (And if humans had already settled such issues as competitiveness and conflict, then Globus Cassus would be unnecessary). 4) Even if it could be realised, it sets up an inherently risky dichotomy: there are two halves of the world facing each other which, given what we know of ourselves, suggests a future of terrible hemispherical rivalry and conflict. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 01:55, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Strong Keep</b> as per above.

<li><b>Keep</b> per keeps above. I came to the article via link in a post generally more reasonable/forseeable than this idea -- but it's part of a broader conversation. <a href="../../../22/a/l/User%7E_alyosha__c478.html" title="User:&quot;alyosha&quot;">"alyosha"</a> <a href="../../../22/a/l/User_talk%7E_alyosha__09df.html" title="User talk:&quot;alyosha&quot;">(talk)</a> 14:35, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article is in my mind comparable to Dyson spheres and other vast construction ideas. Also, as for the aesthetic objections, who is to say that this will be done on Earth as opposed to some other planet?
