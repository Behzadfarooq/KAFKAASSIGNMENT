<dd>He's probably just a fan of Mr. Rubinstein.&#160;:) As for Richter, he's up there, no doubt about it, but with Rachmaninoff, Cortot, Horowitz and Gould in the same century, Richter has some stiff competition for the title of "greatest pianist." 66.108.4.183 14:55, 19 September 2006 (UTC) Allen Roth
<dl>
<dd>Sure -- I totally agree that there are many candidates for the great pianists of the century. It's not Wikipedia's job to decide such contests. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> 04:55, 29 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, but it's good to have exchanges of views. For example, I love Cortot's playing, but I would never have put him in the same class as Richter, Rachmaninoff, Horowitz and Gould. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 13:38, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is a little devil's-advocate-ish for me, but if you go by "the consensus," the two greatest of the 20th Century were Horowitz and Rubinstein. The previous generation: Hoffmann (sp?) and Rachmaninoff. Previous to that: Liszt and Anton Rubinstein. Again, that's just "consensus." But it's a firmly established consensus. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELorenzoPerosi1898_5fc4.html" title="User:LorenzoPerosi1898">LorenzoPerosi1898</a> 13:53, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've tried to fix some of the worst problems with this article. Sentences such as</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>He [Rubinstein] never aspired to the stratospheric level of technique achieved by <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leopold_Godowsky_5f96.html" title="Leopold Godowsky">Leopold Godowsky</a> or <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Horowitz_63a3.html" title="Vladimir Horowitz">Vladimir Horowitz</a>, but was more than equal to the task of the standard repertoire.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>are great examples of the kind of thing that should <b>not</b> appear in a Wikipedia article. Do we actually know what level of technique Rubinstein aspired to? Is there any documentary evidence? If not, Wikipedia should not speculate about Rubinstein's internal state of mind. If so, this claim should be backed up with citations. See <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. Are the assertions that Godowsky and Horowitz achieved a "stratospheric" level of technique, or that Rubinstein was "more than equal" to the "standard repertoire" (whatever that is) an undisputed fact, or a statement of opinion? Surely the latter. See <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. I've deleted the most egregious violations. Please read these Wikipedia policies -- thanks. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> 04:40, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, Rubinstein stated in an interview with Harold Schonberg that a flawless technique was not his goal. "Look at Godowsky. It would take me five hundred years to achieve that kind of mechanism. But he was a slave to the instrument, unhappy away from the piano." I think that pretty clearly illustrates Rubinstein's thinking. As to the comments about Horowitz's or Godowsky's technique, I suppose one could say ANY pianist has good or bad technique. But it's generally accepted in musical/pianistic circles that Godowsky and Horowitz were technical masters. THD3</p>
<dl>
<dd>Great -- if you have the citation information for that Rubinstein quote, please include it in the article. The "stratospheric" quote is still problematic according to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <i>even</i> if it would be agreed to by most critics. Instead of saying "Horowitz has a stratospheric technique", we should rephrase as "Critic X says that Horowitz has a stratospheric technique", including citation information. I would also add that a decent case could be made that Horowitz's technique was somewhat less than "stratospheric" in all its aspects: for example compare his recording of Scriabin's Fifth Sonata with Richter's; it is very difficult to deny that Richter operated on a wholly different technical level, at least in that piece. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> 21:34, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Good idea. I think I may have a solution which is to base the technical talk on a quote from Rubinstein's memoirs, where he professed envy at pianists who could perform Scarlatti sonatas to perfection. I'll look up the quotes and add documentation. As for Horowitz, remember the guy was past his prime in 1976 when the recording was made. I'm familiar with Richter's Scriabin 5th--stunning. THD3</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ahh I had forgotten that the Horowitz Scriabin 5 was such a late recording. You have a point (and indeed I am a great Horowitz admirer myself). <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> 23:15, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rubinstein's memory was formidable, and photographic in the sense that he actually SAW the score in his mind as he performed. Harvey Sachs' biography of the pianist goes into some detail about Rubinstein's memory, to the extent that the pianist stated he would see a stain from a cup of coffee on the page--in his mind's eye. However, there is no evidence that Rubinstein would memorize a piece after only a single read through. In fact, Rubinstein's memory lapses, and his deftness at covering them up so non-professionals would not notice, is legendary. As regards the Franck Symphonic Varations, the story of Rubinstein learning the piece on a train is recounted by Harold Schonberg, a reliable source. THD3 15:14, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I was mistaken regarding the source for the account of Rubinstein learning Franck's Symphonic Variations, although not the story itself. The source is Part 2 of Rubinstein's own memoirs, My Many Years, page 198. He learned it while en route, via train, to <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madrid.html" title="Madrid">Madrid</a> for a concert, without benefit of a piano (Rubinstein practiced difficult passages in his lap). It was not memorized in a single read through, but took more than one day. Rubinstein's memory, while formidable, was not infallible. He suffered from occasional memory lapses, as evidenced in pirate recordings and recounted by his son, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Rubinstein_abe5.html" title="John Rubinstein">John Rubinstein</a>.

<p>I love the quote about Rubinstein, Brahms, and Scriabin. Upon reflection, I think that more could/should be said about AR's love for Brahms. I recall that AR was quick to point out (a) that he was 10 years old when JB died, thus he always thought of him as a "contemporary" composer; (b) that from the moment he heard the first piece of Brahms, he immediately had to have every piece he could get his hands on by him; (c) that he had cherished contacts with Joachim and several other musicians who knew Brahms. In fact, would it be fair to say that after Chopin, Brahms was AR's favorite composer? Anyhow, I humbly suggest that the Brahms connection could be expanded by a sentence or two.

<p>Rubinstein briefly visited Paderewski and the elder pianist may have coached Rubinstein. But to say Rubinstein studied with him is exaggeration. Rubinstein did study extensively with Heinrich Barth - - also a teacher of Wilhelm Kempff. Barth was quite exacting and whenever Rubinstein did anything Barth didn't approve of, from wrong notes to wayward interpretation, Barth would bite his lip to his beard went horizontal!</p>
