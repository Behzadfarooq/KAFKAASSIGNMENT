<li><b>Delete</b> I was going to include the word "weak" before the word "delete" because there is so much info on the game, but no matter how long the article is, the game is still pretty non-notable. It was a World Cup qualifier (not even an actual World Cup game) that did not <i>directly</i> lead to England qualifying; even if qualification had been the direct result of this game, England didn't even make the semifinals for this World Cup, much less win it. The game had no particularly spectacular qualities- hell, it wasn't even close. The article is also highly POV, written entirely from the British perspective. Thus, the game doesn't really have any notability, and thus, shouldn't really have a WP article. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 15:48, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> — Well I'm a football/soccer fan, but I have a difficult time seeing the notability of individual matches except in a few cases. I can see a case for World Cup final games and European Cup final matches (e.g. <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_UEFA_Champions_League_Final_a0e0.html" title="2006 UEFA Champions League Final">2006 UEFA Champions League Final</a>), but qualifier games? It's a bit much, regardless of the result. Perhaps a summary paragraph could be added to <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_World_Cup_2002_%28qualification_UEFA%29_3e69.html" title="Football World Cup 2002 (qualification UEFA)">Football World Cup 2002 (qualification UEFA)</a>. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 15:50, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This was a remarkable result that impacted on both the German and English football cultures. It cannot be included in the articles of the national teams bcause it would unbalance them. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 16:04, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> If this result really did impact both cultures, the article makes absolutely no claim of such (aside from a slight amount of POV material). The article itself claims that England had beaten Germany at <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euro_2000.html" title="Euro 2000">Euro 2000</a>, less than 14 months prior, so this couldn't be such a spectacular upset. Germany's team was obviously not particularly demoralized, as they were the World Cup runners-up. Meanwhile, England's team couldn't have been particularly boosted, as they still only reached the quarterfinals. In hindsight, it's rather obvious that much more was made of this match than it should have been. As far as "unbalancing" the national teams' articles... well, this article is already quite unbalanced. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 16:16, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge or Delete</b> This is a silly article that will not attract much interest from anyone except English football fans but it is an important event for some and perhaps the section at the England-Germany football rivalry can be expanded. If the article stays then the <b>name needs to be changed</b> as the score is not enough to identify when or at what level of competition this happened and isn't a decent name for an encyclopedia article.

<dd>It is a silly article IN MY OPINION, not exactly something an encyclopedia can do without is it. But I leaned more to the merge option than anything else. The lack of a decent title alone makes me sceptical about this being some pivotal moment in pop or sports history. As far as I am concerned it should be merged into the section on the England-Germany football rivalry. Despite it significance for some English people I really don't see much for a single article, there are literally thousands of football games at the national, club, or amateur level that have great sentimental value for some group somewhere and this is just one of them and nothing else. This article should go to England-Germany football rivaly or maybe even a brief mention in world cup 2002 article.Sorry, but really if you take away feelings of national pride there isn't much to make to discuss here except for one normal qualifying match to a championship --Westee 13:41, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep in some form</b> Can't decide between a merge or straight keep, although would probably lean towards a merge. Certainly this game had a significant impact on English sport, culturally and psychologically. I wouldn't be against a rename and certainly a general tidy up of the article is warranted. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 00:35, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> In my opinion it it's the nomination that is "silly" Westee, when Wikipedia is full of pop culture fancruft. This wouldn't be found in EB, but it is way above the level of notability that Wikipedia usually accepts. <a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwittenham_f571.html" title="User:Twittenham">Twittenham</a> 15:44, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This was a very important match in English footballing history, and is still available to buy as an indivual match on DVD. Clothing stores produce t-shirts with a replica of the scoreboard on. I believe a whole book about the match is in the works.

<li><b>Keep</b> This was one of the best results in the history of English football and is still talked about to this day as the greatest of the past 40 years.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> This is one of the greatest and most significant matches in soccer history, well worthy of its own article. For those who don't seem to know, the high scoreline for a match between two strong footballing nations is an extremely rare event. I find it an outrage that its worthiness is even being questioned, and the pro-delete comments are preposterous, particularly the description of it being "non-notable". The match is still discussed in the bars of England and Germany to this day. Neither does the article justify the comment of "silly" - it is appropriately titled and well-written. I would question the impartiality and policy of the whole encyclopedia should this unfortunate unreasonable and provocative proposal be carried out. Instead I look forward to the degrading "scheduled for deletion" banner being removed pdq and this amazing soccer encounter being rightfully immortalised without further question.

<dd>Whatthe hell?? Why on Earth would this be considered one of the most important matches in football history. Now that claim I have never ever heard before. It was a qualifier last time I checked and neither Germany's worst defeat nor England's highest win and considering Germany went on to be second in the actual tournament it certainly can not be called a turning point in German football or the beginning of a spectacular winning streak for England. This match has been largely forgotten outside of England, mostly because of relative insignificance outside of that country. And beleive me mate this match is not regurlarly discussed in bars in Germany, now that I can guarantee you. One of the greatest matches in football history... uh no. A relatively average qualifying match that is celebrated by some England fans like an actual world cup victory; yes! --Westee 11:27, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
