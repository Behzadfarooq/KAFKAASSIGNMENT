<p>I nominated this for PROD a few weeks ago, but the notice was removed, and per the agreement on the talk page, I agreed to not nominate it for AfD until the preliminary NTSB report was released. That has now happened, but the report, in the words of one of the article's defenders, "not very interesting". Basically, this is a non-event. Aircraft have minor technical failings leading to emergency landings all the time. No-one was injured or killed in this accident, and it does not look like much is going to come of this. I am not convinced this is notable enough; this year alone, there have been 748 aviation incidents that the NTSB has reported on (did a search on <a href="http://www.ntsb.gov" class="external text" title="http://www.ntsb.gov" rel="nofollow">their website</a>). Unless you are proposing articles for them all, we need to be selective about which ones we keep, and, in my opinion, this is not one of them. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 10:04, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I am the quoted "defender of the article". I'd like to thank Batmanand for holding off on bringing this to AfD until the NTSB preliminary report is out. However, I'd like to clarify that my remarks about "not very interesting" was in regards to the NTSB report specifically, not the entire event. It is still just a preliminary report. I find the event to be interesting, well documented, and notable. I don't claim it is a hugely important event, but I do think it is notable enough to be included here. This incident is very similar to <a href="../../../j/e/t/JetBlue_Airways_Flight_292_52ed.html" title="JetBlue Airways Flight 292">JetBlue Airways Flight 292</a> which did survive AfD. I don't suggest that we should have an article on every incident that generates an NTSB report - some of those reports are even less serious than an emergency landing - such as someone getting injured in the air because they tripped going to the bathroom. However, emergency landings of commercial airliners are not common, and when they generate coverage in the reputable media, as this one has, then they are legitimate topics for articles. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 13:24, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The JetBlue 292 article only survived AfD because it was nominated the day after the incident and a whole crowd of people failed to grasp that it would be forgotten within months. As it indeed was. Nine-odd months down the line, I am not so sure it would survive a second AfD now that people have had a better chance to put the event into perspective. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 15:33, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Looking at other articles in Accidents and incidents on commercial airliners in the United States, it seems like the other noteworthy articles in that category either involved fatalities or extensive injuries, or at least substantial news coverage. Also, the other accidents and incidents in that category usually have some lessons learned and implications for future safety improvements. I don't think those criteria are true for this article (unless the final NTSB investigation shows that there's an issue with airworthiness or maintenance), so in that case, I'd recommend a <b>delete</b>. Not strongly, though. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> - <a href="../../../e/l/k/User_talk%7EElkman_bf81.html" title="User talk:Elkman">(Elkspeak)</a> 19:48, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. There are some instances where a non-fatal aviation incident is notable. A few weeks ago I wrote <a href="../../../g/-/t/G-TIGK_North_Sea_ditching_7ef5.html" title="G-TIGK North Sea ditching">G-TIGK North Sea ditching</a> because it was featured in an episode of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Crash_Investigation_a016.html" title="Air Crash Investigation">Air Crash Investigation</a>, and the investigation had ramifications for the design ofhelipcopter blades. Some other non-fatal incidents such as <a href="../../../h/a/p/Hapag-Lloyd_Flight_3378_37fc.html" title="Hapag-Lloyd Flight 3378">Hapag-Lloyd Flight 3378</a>, <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Transat_Flight_236_dee6.html" title="Air Transat Flight 236">Air Transat Flight 236</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Airways_Flight_5390_c3eb.html" title="British Airways Flight 5390">British Airways Flight 5390</a> had a sufficiently dramatic series of events (fuel exhaustion and the captain being sucked out of the window and surviving) that they are definite encyclopedic topics. In this case we have a nose gear failure and collapse on the runway, but an ultimately successful emergency landing. To me, the incident looks like a thing which will be fairly quickly forgotten. The NTSB makes it report, and takes such incidents very seriously as it should do. However, I fear articles on such minor incidents without any ramifications beyond the incident itself, are likely to clog up the aviation incidents category. If the report produced some findings which for instance led to the grounding of all MD-80 planes for fix-ups of the landing gear, I would reconsider. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:11, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It is not the policy of Wikipedia to delete articles due to non-notability (go check for yourself) and therefore the nom itself is bunk. To delete this article per nom, first change WP policy. Since past attempts to change that policy failed, consider that also the consensus of the WP community.

<dd>It is a news report of no "historical significance" (quoting the above policy) that links to a government report that is "not very interesting" (quoting yourself). It belongs at wikinews. In any case, I mostly responded b/c of Ephilei's comment above, which annoyingly suggested we were evading policy, while "there is no official policy on notability" (quoting <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>).
