<p><b>Keep</b> I'm a long-time reader of the Journal, and have found this list useful.

<li><b>Comment</b> The Journal's interviews are themselves notable-- even TCJ enemy Harlan Ellison conceded that they were the equivalent of the Playboy interviews. They are remarkable documents.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This article can usefully be expanded, but as it stands I see it as a good, encyclopedian resource.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The person who nominated this article for deletion, against all policy, hasn't bothered to justify his nomination.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I will give him 24 hours to do so, after which I shall take down the AFD template.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is interesting to note the timing of this AFD, in light of the current lawsuit by Harlan Ellison in large part over a TCJ interview. What a coincidence. <a href="../../../r/h/i/User%7ERhinoracer_4df4.html" title="User:Rhinoracer">Rhinoracer</a> 21:00, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I see no indication that he is doing so in relation to Ellison's suit. Also, please do not remove AfD templates from articles.

<p>That said: <b>Weak Keep</b>. The Comics Journal is as close as comics have to a scholarly journal, and its interviews are a significant (arguably, renowned) part of that. Although I agree with many of the delete votes that the article in its current state is inappropriate, I can't help but feel that improving the article -- perhaps so that it is no longer a list -- is the direction to go with this one. <a href="../../../c/s/4/User%7ECS42_8631.html" title="User:CS42">~CS</a> 00:41, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> If the consensus is that this shouldn't be an article, I would suggest that it become a Wikiproject Comics project page instead. It could be very useful to people looking for sources for comics-related articles. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><i><b><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelithemis_11c2.html" title="User:Celithemis"><font color="red">—Cel</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelithemis_923e.html" title="User talk:Celithemis"><font color="black">ithemis</font></a></b></i></font> 00:44, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure what the process would be, but this suggestion seems like a good idea to me. This seems like something that would fit in neatly as a directory to complement the project's sections on reliable resources for comics articles. <a href="../../../c/s/4/User%7ECS42_8631.html" title="User:CS42">~CS</a> 01:16, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Weak Delete</b></s> <b>Comment</b> (see later comment) I really can see the value of this, but I can't see it fitting the format, guidelines, and policies that are in place. Even as a "Project protected reference/resource page" I can't see this fitting. If someone could point out a ref to the process/precedent for that type of page, I'll support moving this, but otherwise, it'll, reluctantly, need to go. — <a href="../../../j/_/g/User%7EJ_Greb_e233.html" title="User:J Greb">J Greb</a> 01:43, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I don't know if there is an established process, as such, but there are existing pages in Wikipedia space devoted to helping people find sources for articles; <a href="../../../n/e/w/Wikipedia%7ENewspapers_and_magazines_request_service_a0a1.html" title="Wikipedia:Newspapers and magazines request service">Wikipedia:Newspapers and magazines request service</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResearch_resources_5936.html" title="Wikipedia:Research resources">Wikipedia:Research resources</a> come to mind.</dd>
<dd>Why would lack of precedent be a problem, anyway? Helping members do research for articles is an obviously useful thing for a Wikiproject to do. It helps the encyclopedia, so why not do it? <font face="Trebuchet MS"><i><b><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelithemis_11c2.html" title="User:Celithemis"><font color="red">—Cel</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelithemis_923e.html" title="User talk:Celithemis"><font color="black">ithemis</font></a></b></i></font> 03:11, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, there's a much closer analogy: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Video_games_Magazines_5a4b.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Video games/Magazines">Wikipedia:WikiProject Video games/Magazines</a>. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><i><b><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelithemis_11c2.html" title="User:Celithemis"><font color="red">—Cel</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelithemis_923e.html" title="User talk:Celithemis"><font color="black">ithemis</font></a></b></i></font> 03:13, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My main reason for wanting examples/precedent pointed out in this case is that I wouldn't want this being moved attacked as an attempt by editors to save a page they "like" that doesn't belong on Wiki.<br />
That being said, <b>Video games/Magazines</b> <i>is</i> a good example for moving this to a Comics sub-page. But in moving this a few other things would need to be addressed:
<ul>
<li>Page title. The title would need to be tweaked.</li>
<li>Layout. It needs to be converted from a bullet list to a table.</li>
<li>Information. While the subject and issue number are a good start, it should be like an expanded footnote/reference with the interviewer, month/year, and page(s). The title, if it's something other than "Interview wit..." should be there also.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>That would also set it up for expansion to a list covering TCJ contents in general, if there is such a desire.<br />

<li><b>Bloody STRONG Keep</b>. This is useful to researchers. This is useful information. This is entirely in keeping with the point of Wikipedia. There is no better reason to delete given here than "I don't like it". You know what? Tough. This is an extension of the article on the Journal, and were it a category people would say listify. It's solid, sourced information that is utilised by scholars. It does not violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> in any shape, manner or form. I would note the people who are trying to force their opinion through with the claim that it violates <i>Wikipedia_is not an indiscriminate collection of information</i> miss the vital point that policy makes, that <b>"there is a continuing debate about the encyclopedic merits of several classes of entries"</b>. The section even goes on to detail the only areas that have consensus, none of which this list meets. WP:NOT asks us to consider <b>what a reader would expect to find under the same heading in an encyclopedia</b>. I would suggest this article fits the bill. You don't personally happen to like it? Ignore it. Edit your style sheet to pretend it doesn't exist. But don't delete it. It's information which is of use. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 14:03, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, though the list needs plenty of expansion (like, in my opinion, at least the dates of the issues). This looks like it meets our <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a> and has potential to meet the <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_list_criteria_fbdb.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured list criteria">Wikipedia:Featured list criteria</a>.

</ul>
<p><b>Keep</b> Notable magazine and an academic source. The Journal is a respected, quality publication with a solid history in comics journalism and criticism, an its interview subjects (such as the likes of Robert Crumb, Harvey Kurtzman etc.) are definitely more notable than the list of people in Playboy. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECounterrestrial_c927.html" title="User:Counterrestrial">Counterrestrial</a> 06:28, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>, it is useful but I think something needs doing with it as it stands. Possibly best discussed on the Comics Project talk page after this deletion is decided. (<a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperor_dcf0.html" title="User:Emperor">Emperor</a> 19:05, 26 March 2007 (UTC))</li>
<li><b>A few notes</b> - First, to the person who's accusing me of colluding with Harlan Ellison, rest assured that I have no knowledge of said suit. The lawsuit or lack of same has nothing to do with this nomination and the notion that a lawsuit could somehow be influenced by the existence or non-existence of a list of interview subjects is ludicrous. Second, I have explained the reason for the nomination, which is that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>. That a number of people were interviewed by the same publication does not create the sort of association that would warrant an article. Compliance with <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>, which is a guideline and not policy, is irrelevant if the list itself fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, which is policy. Third, <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html" title="WP:USEFUL">It's useful</a> is an incredibly poor reason for keeping an article. All sorts of things that all sorts of people find useful get deleted off Wikipedia every day. Finally, <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERSTUFFEXISTS_ee3f.html" title="WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS">WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS</a> is also a horrible reason for keeping an article. If other articles which don't meet Wikipedia policy and guidelines exist, then the proper response to them is to deleted them, not to point to them in an attempt to save other non-compliant articles. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 12:48, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, "Is there any precedent for deleting such lists?" I'm all for setting a precedent if necessary, but I don't believe you've made any sort a case that this list fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, or that other similar lists fail <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. This list seems as much like a directory as any other list or category. Is there any reason you feel that this particular list fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>? Do you feel that the other lists I mentioned or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Oklahoma_birds_34bd.html" title="List of Oklahoma birds">List of Oklahoma birds</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_recordings_preserved_in_the_United_States_National_Recording_Registry_cc9f.html" title="List of recordings preserved in the United States National Recording Registry">List of recordings preserved in the United States National Recording Registry</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Fullmetal_Alchemist_episodes_00b0.html" title="List of Fullmetal Alchemist episodes">List of Fullmetal Alchemist episodes</a> also ought to be deleted? --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 16:21, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>With all due respect, you could list off a <i>million</i> different list articles and none of them have any relevance to whether or not <i>this</i> article should be kept. However, I have in fact put a couple of the lists you posted up earlier for deletion. Do I have a <i>specific</i> precedent of a <i>specific</i> list of interviews in a <i>specific</i> magazine being deleted? No. But there are any number of precedents of poor list articles being deleted. I have no idea if other such lists of people interviewed in a particular magazine have been nominated for deletion. It strikes me as rather irrelevant whether or not such a similar deletion exists if <i>this</i> list is one that should be deleted. If you read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> you'll see that it bars lists of loosely associated topics. The happenstance of being interviewed by a particular journal or magazine is just that sort of loose association. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 17:06, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
