<p><a href="../../../m/e/n/Mensa_International_ed5b.html" title="Mensa International">Mensa International</a> is a <i>social organization</i> that requires annual dues for membership, which they will neither confirm nor deny. Being a member does not represent a <i>lifetime achievement</i> (unlike <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Eagle_Scouts_9cb4.html" title="List of Eagle Scouts">List of Eagle Scouts</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Nobel_laureates_d9b6.html" title="List of Nobel laureates">List of Nobel laureates</a>), but merely a genetic predisposition to score higher than 98% of the population on a certain kind of test.</p>
<p>"Member" is also unqualified ... should former or deceased members be listed as well, such as <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Meldrum_9298.html" title="Ian Meldrum">Ian Meldrum</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Asimov_1d17.html" title="Isaac Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>?</p>
<p>Six million people in the US alone are "Mensa qualified", although less than 1% (around 50,000) are currently members ... most "famous" people (like anyone who has won a <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_Prize_c061.html" title="Nobel Prize">Nobel Prize</a> or a <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulitzer_Prize_e802.html" title="Pulitzer Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>) are by definition potential members, but for reasons of their own, they have chosen not to pay the annual dues.</p>
<p>Mensa may be "<i>the largest, oldest, and most well-known <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_IQ_society_5751.html" title="High IQ society">high IQ society</a> in the world,</i>" but there are several others whose requirements are much higher and restrictive (1:1000 as opposed to 1:50), and whose members are more worthy of being considered <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genius.html" title="Genius">geniuses</a>.</p>
<p>If anything, this should be a Category with a Tag, rather than just an arbitrary list that will require constant monitoring. The History of the article shows that it is a magnet for <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">trolls</a> and vandals.</p>

<li>That would only apply if the contents of the list were substantially the same. I honestly can't remember what was in the deleted list, but I suspect this is an original creation rather than a repost. However, arguments from that debate may well be relevant here, so it's good to have the link for people to review.

<li><b>Delete</b> The titled is too subjective, its basically a list of anyone thats been in Mensa that has a wikipedia article, cant we make it a cat and just put all the members in it? I mean if the person is famous enough to be mentioned then shouldnt they get an article, perhaps the red links if any will inspire people. Even then I am not sure if this is really appropriate for a category, but I will stay out of that discussion if it arrises. SO delete or make a category to slap on certain articles. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 16:14, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Plenty of problems here, like the fact that the hall-of-fame part of the list should actually be under the heading List of famous people Mensa wishes had been members, and the inherently subjective question of how one defines "famous" for the rest of the list.<br />
The existence of citations does make this stand out from most such lists, but the quality of those citations seems to be rather shaky; for example, Stephen Hawking is listed, even though AFAIK he is not a Mensa member, with a "reference" link which leads to something that appears to be an entertainment gossip website (!) that does not make any such claim! <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> this ain't.<br />
So, what do we have? A list that, if kept, must be split and/or retitled, and for which the verification process must be exhaustively repeated because the present citations are demonstrably unreliable, and which, after all that, will still be an original-research magnet and vulnerable to vanity entries and spam.<br />
The usual arguments for keeping lists do also apply. The subject is clearly of interest; Mensa is notable, and people reading up on it will naturally want to get an idea of what kinds of people join, and listing members they have heard of is an effective way of answering that question. And this list does things, like geographical categorisation and centralising citations, that a category could not do. As such, while I think this list should not be kept <i>in its current state</i>, please disregard my "delete" recommendation if a genuine effort to resolve the problems I have cited has begun by the time this debate is closed. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 16:42, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Uh ... better make that List of famous people American Mensa wishes had been members, since it is neither compiled nor maintained by <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mensa_International_ed5b.html" title="Mensa International">Mensa International</a>. And keeping this list is a slippery slope that leads to List of people in prison who are members of Mensa (there is a <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Interest_Group_4667.html" title="Special Interest Group">Special Interest Group</a> for them), or others who are "famous" by virtue of their infamy. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennette_c7df.html" title="User:Dennette">Dennette</a> 19:55, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> since there is no objective definition of "famous", and the list is potentially vast. I'd not even categorise it, unless there are actually a significant number of people who are notably connected with Mensa. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 17:36, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is only a subjective definition of "famous". There are probably many more Mensa members who are famous, accompanied with the number of people who are qualified for Mensa but have not joined <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mensa_International_ed5b.html" title="Mensa International">Mensa International</a>. Also, with the number of people who daily make articles on Wikipedia on non-notable people (which basically contributes to half of Afd), there is bound to be edit wars in the future on who should be on the list and who shouldn't. --<a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="color:red"><b>Nish</b></span><span style="color:blue"><b>kid</b></span><span style="color:green"><b>64</b></span></a> 21:24, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment/"Vote"</b> Since the topic itself is too subjective to stand on its own legs as a seperate article, an admin should <b>delete</b> the article, but perhaps a bit of this should be readded. It appears that the primary contributors to this were in the Mensa article itself, and that the information was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mensa_International&amp;diff=50370519&amp;oldid=50356474" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mensa_International&amp;diff=50370519&amp;oldid=50356474" rel="nofollow">removed and placed in its own article</a>. Therefore, I propose a bit of a <b>quasimerge</b> which places this list back into the article under "trivia" (albeit a bit abridged). <a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_fe3b.html" title="User:Ikiroid">The ikiroid</a> (<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_4fb8.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid">talk</a>·<a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_Desk_5611.html" title="User:Ikiroid/Desk">desk</a>·<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_Help_Me_Improve_8caf.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid/Help Me Improve">Advise me</a>) 00:55, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I thought that Categories were sorted <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automagically.html" title="Automagically">automagically</a> ... and this way, mention of Mensa membership in someone's article (referenced or not, like <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Meldrum_9298.html" title="Ian Meldrum">Ian Meldrum</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Asimov_1d17.html" title="Isaac Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>) can be found with a simple search, and the tag added. That also puts the burden of any dispute on the article in question and its Discussion, not the list article. Notability (they're <i>already</i> in Wikipedia) and current membership status (which cannot be verified anyway) then become non-issues. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennette_c7df.html" title="User:Dennette">Dennette</a> 03:35, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

A simple bot could then traverse "What links here" for <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mensa_International_ed5b.html" title="Mensa International">Mensa International</a>, add the tags, and create the initial list, which would be much more complete and authoritative than the current one.

<li><b>Comment</b> How is the Mensa list inherently different than <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Skull_and_Bones_Members_ab74.html" title="List of Skull and Bones Members">List of Skull and Bones Members</a> (where membership is dues paying and secretive, and does not reflect a life achievement), <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_tall_women.html" title="List of famous tall women">List of famous tall women</a> (no dues, hard to keep secret, but is no more selective than Mensa), and other such lists? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 21:06, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Everyone on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Skull_and_Bones_Members_ab74.html" title="List of Skull and Bones Members">List of Skull and Bones Members</a> is also in the <i>published list of members through 1971</i>, so they are all verified. Someone's height can be easily verified from public records (<i>e.g.</i>, <a href="../../../d/r/i/Driver%27s_license.html" title="Driver's license">Driver's license</a>). What makes having been a member of a social club for only one year notable if they're already <i>famous</i>? --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennette_c7df.html" title="User:Dennette">Dennette</a> 01:01, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Query</b> This list was already deleted last November after a single day's discussion (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Mensa_International_members_5c70.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Mensa International members">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Mensa International members</a>) and it was then recreated under a slightly different name ... what's the holdup?

<p><b>Delete with extreme prejudice!</b> This article is yet another bloody smeggy list and as all the lists I have found seems to be in violation of both <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_directory" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a directory</a>. The article has a very brief one sentence introduction. Also I really do not see how this article can ever be verified as either complete or accurate. It may be better if it were a category. <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisplaced_Brit_130f.html" title="User:Displaced Brit">Displaced Brit</a> 01:39, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
