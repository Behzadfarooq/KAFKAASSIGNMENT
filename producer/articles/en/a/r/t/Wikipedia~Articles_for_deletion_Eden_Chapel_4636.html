<p>Non-notable church. A Google search finds an article on the <a href="http://www.eden-cambridge.org/history/#ToC1" class="external text" title="http://www.eden-cambridge.org/history/#ToC1" rel="nofollow">history of the church</a>, but reveals nothing of significance that occured there, or anyone particularly noteable who preached/attended.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I would love to Keep this article however it is A. without referances and B. comes across as a church member wanting to write an article about their Chapal. --<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrince_of_Dharma_8b09.html" title="User:Prince of Dharma"><span style="color:red;">†hε þяínce öf ɒhaямa</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/i/User_talk%7EPrince_of_Dharma_54a7.html" title="User talk:Prince of Dharma"><span style="color:green;">Talk to Me</span></a></sup> 02:36, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> I don't see any confirmation of notability or verifiability. 129.98.212.67 03:42, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> No true assertion of notability. If it wasn't for this AfD, I'd have no idea it was an <i>old</i> church, as it doesn't even mention its age. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> 03:55, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Nothing proving any notability. Furthermore, what little information is present (it's a stub) talks is a short biographical account of the churches preacher and the names of its staff members. The age, as EVula mentioned, is not to be found in the article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 05:23, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as above: no assertion of notability, no other evidence of notability thrown up in discussion. It's also a very badly-written article: there is nothing that says directly whether it's in Cambridge, England or Cambridge, Massachussets and the only clue is that it refers to the Grafton Centre, which I seem to recall is a shopping mall in the middle of the city of Cambridge in England. But even with a tidyup, I can't see any reason to believe that it can ever make a legit claim to notability. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 08:48, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Without prejudice. If it is an ancient and notable church, maybe one of the scholars who are familiar with it will take the time to write up well referenced claims to notability.

<li><b>comment</b> According to the history linked to above, this chapel was opened in 1825 - in the UK, most people wouldn't consider this a particularly ancient building. Many of the churches where I live are getting on for 1000 years old! -<a href="../../../l/a/d/User%7ELadybirdintheuk_176f.html" title="User:Ladybirdintheuk">Ladybirdintheuk</a> 12:43, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course that's true, but mere age isn't crucial to notability. You'll certainly not find a thousand-year old Baptist congregation anywhere! They appear to trace their roots back to just after the Restoration - fairly significant in the context of Baptism. <a href="../../../b/p/m/User%7EBpmullins_987c.html" title="User:Bpmullins">Bpmullins</a> 15:13, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete this version</b> The article makes no claim of notability. It looks like we <i>might want</i> an encyclopedic article about the church because of its history, but this is not that article, nor even a help to writing it. The links in this AFD are more of a help, but there is a shaky transition in the second paragraph about John Stittle that I'm not convinced would stand up to a real researcher. So delete this, with no prejudice against a future article about the church that is sourced as described in <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">WP:INDY</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/r/WP%7EFORGET_afc0.html" title="WP:FORGET">WP:FORGET</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 17:28, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Keep it but fix it:</b> Eden is notable for at least a few reasons. 1) Its history, I believe, goes back to the early Particular Baptists in England. 2) It is one of the two or three most popular places of worship amongst students at the University. 3)It was for many years pastored by Roy Clements who became known as one of the premier Evangelical leaders in the UK. There was quite a stir when he came out (or was outed)as a homosexual and resigned his post. 4) Mark Dever, a well known Evangelical /Baptist leader in the US was associate pastor there for a few years.</p>
<dl>
<dd>If those statements can be sourced and attributed, I'd happily change my mind about the deletion. But as it stands now, there's no reference to any of those things in the article. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 06:40, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hope to write a new article for this entry in the next few days, highlighting more of the history of this church as well as it's important place in contemporary British evangelicalism. (Note: I am not the writer of the current article)</p>
