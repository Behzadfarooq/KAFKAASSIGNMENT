<li>Delete: Material on the changes (and how prejudicial they are, and even how they were ramrodded by a particular party that receives money from the financial industry, and even possibly how the bill was drafted by lobbyists) should go in the general <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankruptcy.html" title="Bankruptcy">Bankruptcy</a> article.

<li>Actually, a redirect of this title anywhere would be problematic, since it starts with the word "new" - so the redirect will instantly become suspect whenver a <i>newer</i> bankruptcy law was passed somewhere. Logically, that would justify throwing 'new' in front of any topic - new civil rights law, new abortion law, new tax law - and making that a redirect to the main article on that topic, which just strikes me as a bad idea all around. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 19:47, 2005 Jun 16 (UTC)</li>

Chewbacca is a Wookiee from the planet <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kashyyyk.html" title="Kashyyyk">Kashyyyk</a>, but Chewbacca can be found <a href="http://lsolum.typepad.com/copyfutures/2004/10/the_doj_uses_th.html" class="external text" title="http://lsolum.typepad.com/copyfutures/2004/10/the_doj_uses_th.html" rel="nofollow">mentioned in discussions about the U.S. Department of Justice</a>, <a href="http://moorewatch.com/index.php/weblog/comments/1357/P50/" class="external text" title="http://moorewatch.com/index.php/weblog/comments/1357/P50/" rel="nofollow">about Michael Moore</a>, <a href="http://www.indcjournal.com/archives/000909.php" class="external text" title="http://www.indcjournal.com/archives/000909.php" rel="nofollow">about Dan Rather</a>, <a href="http://triptronix.net/ishbadiddle/archives/2005/06/14/15.00.55/" class="external text" title="http://triptronix.net/ishbadiddle/archives/2005/06/14/15.00.55/" rel="nofollow">about Randy "Duke" Cunningham</a>, and <a href="http://wizbangblog.com/archives/003315.php" class="external text" title="http://wizbangblog.com/archives/003315.php" rel="nofollow">about Michael Moore again</a>. Now, think about that. That does not make sense! Why would a Wookiee — an eight foot tall fictional <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i> character — turn up in commentaries on U.S. politics? That does not make sense!<br />
Look at me, I'm a Wikipedia editor discussing the deletion of a Wikipedia article, and I'm talkin' about Michael Moore. Does that make sense? Ladies and gentlemen, none of this makes sense!<br />
And so you have to remember, when you're trudging through <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_Old_dcc1.html" title="WP:VFD/Old">WP:VFD/Old</a> supposing and fussing on the closing of the discussion... does it make sense? No! Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed discussion, it does not make sense.<br />
If Chewbacca is used as a rhetorical tool in U.S. political commentary, you must <b>keep</b>! The defense rests.<br />

While I would vote myself into her dorm room, I don't think she has any particular notability or notoriety like the three actresses that you mentioned. I would vote "weak delete" (since the bar for the Google test needs to be higher for porn than for hand-carved woodcuts), except that that would bring me into agreement with BrowardDon. <b>Weak keep</b> based only on the Alexa and Google numbers. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 20:34, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</font></font></li>
<li><font size="-3"><font size="-3">The Internet pornography industry deliberately skews page rankings. Indeed, there's a whole sub-industry devoted to doing exactly that (that is happy to try to employ Wikipedia, and its sibling projects, for this purpose — Reverting pornographic link spam is a regular maintenance chore on all of them.). A ranking has to be <i>exceptional</i> for it to be a meaningful sole claim to notability for such a model; and this one isn't. There's <i>nothing else whatever</i> that makes this person notable. She's 18 and one of <i>thousands</i> of models that are set up on pornographic sites and (as <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> says) promoted like crazy by the people who own the photography rights, and that (as <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> says) never amount to anything and soon disappear. Wikipedia is not a directory of pornographic models with the career lifespans of <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayfly.html" title="Mayfly">mayflies</a>, nor is it yet another advertizing billboard for them before they have become notable.

It seems the main issue is that he's using his user page essentially as a web-hosting space without contributing much to any other articles. I'd say then that the content of his user page (and talk, etc) could be removed and the page protected until the user has made say 250 edits, or whatever,to show that he's more serious about Wikipedia. And then <i>if</i> he becomes disruptive, or is really not editing in good faith, then his user name can be blocked.

This user has engaged in pushing the completely unverifiable title "Reverend Cantor" in a dozen different (albethey related) articles, persistent insertion of images of copyrighted text into several articles, and destructively persistent insertion of irrelevant aggrandizing text into various other articles. If this were a RfC, I'd go to the trouble of seeking out actual documentation for my claims, but there are a number of other editors here (with access I lack) who can attest to my unsourced claims on this matter.

This multinamed user has claimed to be a rabbi-in-training, which is, as anyone with 3 minutes of Jewish learning can tell you, a completely uninformed and patently ridiculous claim, for reasons I can go into if anyone <i>other than the vandalism-prone user in question</i> requests rationale for that statement.

<p><font size="-3"><font size="-3">What you all fail to realize is that there are three organizations that are really upset with what you have been doing. We have had board meetings regarding your insistance on deleting any mention of the Papal meeting, or its participants. The fact that we were in touch with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon leading up to the meeting, apparently means nothing to you. Your actions of eliminating all references to the one event deemed one of the most highly important events in Judeo-Christian history by both the Israeli government as well as the Vatican is quite odd. It has angered three organizations, The Jewish Ministers Cantors Assn, the American Seminary for Cont. Judaism, and Pave the Way Foundation. We collectively feel a terrible injustice has been done by your organization. There was an historical event that took place on January 18, 2005, where a sitting Pope (John Paul II) was visited for the first time in history by 141 very grateful Jewish clergy, who wished to thank him for everything he had done for the Jewish people and for the State of Israel. The event was reported across the country in many publications, as well as the Vatican newspaper, The New York Times, and was covered on Italian television. We inserted a paragraph into your encyclopedia, and your editors have consistently chosen to eliminate all mention of this event from any article that had contained it. They also removed bios of Cantor Victor Beck, President of the Jewish Ministers Cantors Assn, Cantor Eliezer Kepecs, Vice President elect of the JMCA, Gary Krupp, President of Pave the Way Foundation and others who were deemed important to this event and other events. Upon trying to reason with these ill informed editors, that this event was extremely important in Judeo-Christian developments, endorsed by the former Pope himself, the Israeli government, and Cantors and Rabbis worldwide, they choose to ignore it and have erased all mention of it from your encyclopedia, thereby altering important history. In addition they have erased all mention of the participants, and the one who brought us there- Gary Krupp, knighted by the Pope, and President and founder of Pave the Way Foundation. The remarks in the discussion pages, that your editors make about Rabbis and Cantors, are not only incorrect, but are on the verge of lible, such as "There is no such thing as Jewish clergy", and "Rabbis and Cantors are just lay-people, who are not ordained clergymen." Voting on deleting our user page User:Cantors, and all its associated pictures, stating this user name is offensive, is a violation of our civil rights and liberties. You have also written that the event and its participants were not notable. We are extremely upset at all these deletions, consistently signifying religious discrimination against Jews, Rabbis, and Cantors. In addition an encyclopedia which makes the claim that everyone can edit it, is misrepresentative of what is really going on in its pages. Many people, from various organizations have been offended by this act. We have had board meetings and discussed the possible solutions to the problem at hand. We would like you to right the injustices that have been done to many by your institution. You should reverse the injustices that your editors have done. We appeal to you now on a colleageate level. Thank you, -Respectfully submitted, Reverend Cantor Gary Buchwald, Secretary JMCA; Reverend Cantor Tyrone Bauer, board JMCA; Reverend Cantor Leslie Rimer, Treasurer JMCA; Reverend Cantor Victor I.

<br />
I was made aware of the site and of the article placed there about me. This was done without consultation with me, but since I am a public figure I didn't give it much thought. No more so than the hundreds of newspaper articles that appear each year. I did check it out out of curiosity, and was appalled at the comments being made by some of the so called editors. I decided to try and correct some misconceptions which were being voiced and was attacked so vituperatively, and was accused of some remarkable things, that I decided that it was beneath my dignity to slosh around in the filth that was being spread. I really didn't need these so called editors to validate my life's work. That job is being done by those who actually know the value of what I have done and what I do. More importantly, when I am finally called upon to answer the question, "...have I been the Me that I could have been... I am hoping that I will honestly be able to say yes. It is to that goal that I guide my life's work.<br />

As for others who claim to be me or to speak for me, I neither know nor care to know anything about it. If they are saying anything in a positive vein, I can only assume that they are as disgusted by the manner in which I was treated as I was, and are trying, in good conscience to fight my battle for me. Until proven otherwise I will assume that this is the case, just as I am assuming that your information request was genuine. I generally try to give people the benefit of the doubt until proven otherwise.<br />
<br />
If you wish any other information, please feel free to write to me. By the way you might tell the self rightous fool ish editor who posted what he thought was my home phone number, that he has caused some poor little old lady in Tuscon, Arizona to become ill and disconnect her phone due to all the harrassing phone calls she was getting at all hours of the day and night. The Tuscon police were at a loss to explain it, but I'm told that they are investigating.<br />
<br />
Eventually we all have to answer for our actions,<br />

Regardless of how much Krupp flies around the world, that's not an indicator of encyclopædicity. He is <i>not</i> like an ambassador to the Vatican, as ambassadors represent governments. Not only does Krupp represent noöne but the non-profit he founded, but Krupp is not a leader in any Jewish community, in fact he is widely regarded as at best misguided, at worst as a prophet of apostasy. The deletion of the papal event itself was a result of the fact that you insisted upon text that effectively said that the meeting of 141 Jewish leaders with the Pope was the most significant occurrence in Jewish history since the construction of Solomon's Temple. I have no problem with mentioning the event <i><b>in the appropriate article, and ONLY in the appropriate article</b></i> , but the wording upon which you have persistently insisted is <i>not</i> appropriate for WP (which is why some editors have taken to calling it "cantor-cruft"). <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 16:02, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)</font></font></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> A reason I put this up for deletion among others, is that there are many schools in the US/World named Brandon School, how can we allow one school to take the control of the name, and not allow others? What if another Brandon school comes along, and changes all of the information to match their school information? I do agree with merging with the school district article, but the school itself shouldn't be able to hold sole possesion of the name Brandon School or any other school for that matter, IMHO. <a href="../../../s/r/c/User%7ESrcrowl_6314.html" title="User:Srcrowl">Srcrowl</a> 01:54, Jun 18, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Agreed. If anything, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandon_School_d900.html" title="Brandon School">Brandon School</a> should be made into a disambiguation page.

<li><b>Comment:</b> There is a notable Neil Mallender, a former county cricketer who played two tests for England and is now umpire (coincidentally, he also lived in both the UK and New Zealand).

<p><b>PLEASE STOP BLOCKING PEOPLE</b>- this is hotpants, having moved all the way over to the computer next to me in a lab full of computers. Listen, if people were trying to circumvent your system with sock puppets, they would have a hell of a lot more votes for keep. People are just getting their friends, like me, to vote with them after giving them reasons of various persuasions. You are encouraging people to circumvent your system by blocking them whenever they vote keep. It's absurd. I don't understand how your complaint process works, but you are not doing yourself any favours here. These computers MAY havw a shared IP due to people posting via the same ANU gateway (Ambi should know). I fail to see how this is a violation, stop arbitarily deleting people.</p>

<p>Now hold on! How is any one of us going and asking other people to vote sock puppeting? We are simply getting other concerned internet posters, some who may have used this site without ever wanting to make a change, for years to post. IF anything, we are strengthening the site by involving more people. They simply have a different point of view to you right now. Someone convincing friends to vote for them is no more wrong than you convincing your buddies on this board to vote for deletion, the difference being we don't stick up sock puppet pictures and launch baseless accusations at people.

<p>I am very upset with wikipedia admin, how are they allowed to say something is patent nonsense just because it has silly name? Do they have knowledge of every subject in exist? I doubt it, they should be forced to search google before being allowed to delete stuff with no vote! i think it is disgust. I recreate perfectly good stub twice and both times it is patent nonsese deleted by RickK and CesarB. well you are idiots, because it is real. Myabe if i put it on vfd you will have to spend the 10 seconds to put it in google and see the two hiundred thousand hits it gets. that is not bad for patent nonsese hey? <b>keep</b> the article, and <b>delete</b> the admins who delete without checking.</p>

<li>I do not think I was wrong on speedy deleting it as nonsense. The way it was written the first time ("vibration white finger turns fingers white and numb, miners get it. welsh miners sue the government if they get it.") makes no sense without extra context.

<li><b>Keep</b> I wrote this article, the one on Robertson, Blue Orchid and the Commune, and although they are clearly false (the Australian administrator who corrected the links and catagorized it early this morning has no excuse&#160;:-p) the several other spinoff articles which my less articulate friends wrote demonstrates how self-perpetuating the phenonemon can be. It seems an article like "painted whore" gets immediately cross checked and tagged for deletion, yet "the blue orchid scandal" is placed in the catagory 'australian political controversies" because it presumably was written eloquently enough to covince the administrators of its veracity. My arguement is this article should be kept as a monument to the historiographically duplicitious manner in which history is perceived and accepted. In saying that I'm quite aware this article will be deleted in the pseudo-fascist fashion by which all information that is poorly written, "not notable", or not immediately verifiably by the Oracle of Delphi (otherwise known as Google) inevitably is.

<li><b>Redirect</b> - Could also be "Make Impartial". I think this is a fair vote, and while some people have most certainly been vandalizing and behaving in a childish manner, it doesn't detract from the arguments that others are making. The page in question is of lower rank, and while it does have fans and interests, I don't believe it can be argued to be notable (note I am not suggesting it is necessarily non-notable either, just that notability is not an argument for preservation here). In addition, there is certainly questionable impartiality on this page that makes it borderline vanity, in my opinion. The whole thing takes place as a description of the fantasy world involved, without any noticeable distance or acknowledgment as such. Things such as comic history, controversies that may have arisen in the past, art style used, etc., seem more appropriate for wiki. A 'Comic Summary' (with an appropriate spoiler warning) should be a section, *not* the entire page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 132.198.147.195 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_132.198.147.195_e1a0.html" title="Special:Contributions/132.198.147.195">contribs</a>) 18:55, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<dd>I know what you mean, but remember that the same applies to every site listed on Alexa. Alexa doesn't count the Firefox(etc.) hits of its #135,056-ranked site, but it also doesn't count the Firefox hits of its #135,055-ranked site, or its #1-ranked site, for that matter. The only way I could see this really making any difference is with sites which are specifically about other browsers. Spreadfirefox.com is probably ranked lower than it should be, for example. Even if we go ahead and assume that Drowtales is a full one-third behind where it should be, it would still only be just barely in the top 100,000... which still isn't really very high. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 12:46, Jun 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment:</b> I can only comment on this, since I made a vote. I know I am not a member of wikipedia, heck I'll be called a "sock puppet". But on the argument of this Alexa, I move that it should not be considered part of validity because it's still only 67% at most, and not even everyone with IE use Alexa. Also, when comparing page results on "Drow" in general on google, Drowtales is still the second on the list to pop up on results. Now take into factor the international audience of the comic as well, and that Alexa is considered a minor search engine when comparing to Google, Yahoo, and even Altavista, though there seem to be a lot of biased for this search engine by some members here. Currently this is the first time I've ever heard of Alexa, and when asking others, only a few knew of it. As an associated webmaster, this comes as a surprise that if this were such a good traffic rating tool, that I never heard of it, in my humble opinion. So my argument on the Alexa results are their true validity to the argument. There are well more websites now then their are people in the world, and being in the top 100K doesn't really matter anymore, once again, in my humble opinion. As for who I am, I'm only a member of Drowtales, member name "Ravinous". That's just incase you are curious so I don't come off completely nameless. --66.82.9.17 16:58, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I suggest reviewing the history for the page before voting one way or the other, or making "sock-puppet" accusations.

<li><b>Comment</b> After carefully reading the Wikipedia guidelines on these subjects, I present the following argument:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vanity_page" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vanity_page" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia guidelines on vanity pages</a> indicate that "Lack of fame is not the same as vanity." "The most significant problem with vanity pages is that they often discuss subjects that are not well-enough known for there to be multiple editors." Page history shows there are indeed multiple editors making useful contributions.</li>
<li>Finally, I see nothing in the Wikipedia candidates for deletion that point to this page being out of place here. Additionally, I notice that the nomination was made by someone without even having an account here. --<a href="../../../t/o/u/User%7EToucheGnome_4d24.html" title="User:ToucheGnome">TouchGnome</a> 20:07, 2005 Jun 16 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As one of the people who have worked on the page in question, I will abstain from voting, even though my vote wouldn't be taken as seriously since I'm not a logged user. However, according to the description of a vanity page, this is not one. The author of the web-comic has not been participating in the creation of the article as far as we know. The editors that I know of have been people who are not paid nor associated with the comic other than as fans. While I admit that there is some issue with professionalism, it is something that has been discussed and is being worked on, and any contrabutions are welcome. As the author has been spending his time trying to get a work space to try and get the comic running more professionally, I personally find it unlikely that he is using sock-puppets to create it. Lastly, in argument for the article, I have noted that in other votes a google count has been used for validity of an article. Therefore I submit that Drowtales has a Google count of 6,790. 64.136.26.228 04:10, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Given the significantly less notable entries in <a href="../../../w/e/b/Category%7EWeb_comics_3a3b.html" title="Category:Web comics">Category:Web comics</a>, and how long this particular comic appears to have been online, I see no reason it should be singled out for deletion. FYI, it appears as though the Drowtales artist was recently targeted by a group of disgruntled <a href="../../../4/c/h/4chan.html" title="4chan">4chan</a> users, over not giving them free access to all of his/her work <a href="http://www.drowtales.com/drowforums/viewtopic.php?t=6327&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.drowtales.com/drowforums/viewtopic.php?t=6327&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.

Contributers on this article, of which there are apparently several, have stated that they <i>are not</i> the artist. It's hardly a vanity page, and I resent anon users using Wikipedia as a staging ground for their conflicts elsewhere on the internet.

<li><b>Keep</b>, I wrote this article, the one on Higgins, Robertson and the Commune, and although they are clearly false (the Australian administrator who corrected the links and catagorized it early this morning has no excuse&#160;:-p) the several other spinoff articles which my less articulate friends wrote demonstrates how self-perpetuating the phenonemon can be. It seems an article like "painted whore" gets immediately cross checked and tagged for deletion, yet "the blue orchid scandal" is placed in the catagory 'australian political controversies" because it presumably was written eloquently enough to covince the administrators of its veracity. My arguement is this article should be kept as a monument to the historiographically duplicitious manner in which history is perceived and accepted. In saying that I'm quite aware this article will be deleted in the pseudo-fascist fashion by which all information that is poorly written, "not notable", or not immediately verifiably by the Oracle of Delphi (otherwise known as Google) inevitably is.

It seems an article like "painted whore" gets immediately cross checked and tagged for deletion, yet "the blue orchid scandal" is placed in the catagory 'australian political controversies" because it presumably was written eloquently enough to covince the administrators of its veracity.

<dd>Actually, I don't use Google. I use <a href="http://www.dogpile.com" class="external text" title="http://www.dogpile.com" rel="nofollow">Dogpile</a>, which searches Google and several other search engines. If something is written eloquently, it is not immediately recognizable as complete lunacy, so the administrator categorized it and gave it the benefit of the doubt pending further investigation. Are you trying to prove that it is possible to insert hoaxes into Wikipedia? Well, it is. Fortunately, there are enough eyeballs on these kinds of things and mechanisms for removal to ensure that deliberate lunacy such as yours is corrected.

<p>Many web sites are notable in their own way, lots of google hits from other sites etc.</p>
<p>My arguuments are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia.com is not google.com</li>
<li>The page is unlikely to go beyond a stub. As the website is (obviously) an antiwar POV. The article if improved will unlikely be NPOV.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiwar.com.html" title="Antiwar.com">Antiwar.com</a> does not contribute to human kowlege. The site is about an ideology against wars hence Anti-war.</li>
</ul>

<li><s><b>undecided</b></s>. Not sure how to decide whether it is "notable" or not. I think the fact that they replace "wikipedia" by "smartpedia" in their version of our articles is outrageous, but that in itself is not a reason for deletion.

<li><b>delete</b>. It is directly related to wikipedia and it may be reasonably argued that this ugly rip-off must be explained somewhere.

<li><b>comment</b> -- I'm undecided because, while the site isn't notable, there'd be some value in keeping the article to dispel confusion. Not everyone knows about Wikipedia mirrors. Someone who encountered Smartpedia might be confused about the relationship and come here hoping to find an explanation. Having an article identifying Smartpedia as a copy of Wikipedia, and explaining the GFDL, would clarify matters for such a person. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 07:54, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>Does this article say anything coherent at all? It appears to equate historic Japanese nationalism/authoritarianism with fascism in an extremely idiosyncratic way, and... er, that's about it, apart from going on and on at great length in a rather peculiar writing style. This should be deleted unless cleaned up to be more meaningful (for example, there probably is something to be said about the influence of Western fascist movements on Japan, but this article isn't it). -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 13:21, Jun 16, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The topic is covered in some depth in the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_nationalism.html" title="Japanese nationalism">Japanese nationalism</a> article. This article doesn't quite mesh with the nationalism article, and the title and article appears rather POV. Perhaps it would make more sense to call it "Japan and fascism", then clean up as appropriate.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> but <b>cleanup</b>. As it stands now, it strikes me that it might be categorized as a personal essay or original research: hard to say, given its difficult grammar and syntax. The label <i>Japanese fascism</i> strikes me as justifiable, if only because Japan was one of the <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_Powers_169f.html" title="Axis Powers">Axis Powers</a>. A valid article could be written relating Japanese willingness to join the Axis, relating this to traditional Japanese chauvinism, mistrust of foreigners, and military expansionism, and the rise of a military authoritarian government in Japan. The content now here is not totally useless for the construction of that better article. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:03, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>DELETE</b> as it does look like <i>original research</i>. The fact that Japan was part of the <i>Axis Powers</i> alliance has nothing to do with fascism. Japan was not fascist because it was a member, just as Finland was not facist even though it was a member. Spain was facist and it was *not* a member. 132.205.95.65 16:08, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep and strong cleanup</b>; the article may need to be replaced. Suggest the editor contribute to wikipedia in his/her native language and then request translation. As it stands, text is nearly unusable. Defending distinctions between abstractions like fascism, nationalism, and totalitarainism requires a solid grasp of the language. However, Japanese fascism is a topic that has been widely discussed, most notably perhaps by Japanese historian Masao Murayama in <i>Thought and Behavior in Modern Japanese Politics</i> (Oxford, 1963). It does not take much searching to find quite a bit of literature on the subject. I'll start by adding references to the article. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 17:18, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>And I would urge those users, and you, to make the effort to wikify whatever content you can extract from the articles and put it where it belongs and stop wasting everyone else's time with this stupid bullshit. Why this consensus has emerged that this drivel is deserving of special treatment is beyond me. <b>Take whatever content is salvagable, put it in the numerous existing articles about Japanese history</b> and stop talking about it, voting about it, and discussing it.

Let me spell it out. <b>I agree that some of these should be integrated into other articles.</b>. However I think just putting these sections into other articles will result in them being deleted and the information will be gone. I think the articles need to be cleaned up as they stand (or under different titles) and then they should be merged. Just to be clear, if I <i>refuse</i> to do something on Wikipedia I will say something subtle like: "I refuse to do that". There will be no room for mis-interpretation.

<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b>. But I observe that those who voted for "delete" are mainly Japanese users. It is natural for Japanese to oppose to people who talk bad, or discuss about, about their own race, and this applies to all other races to those people who talk bad about, or discuss about their own race. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Tan_d5d8.html" title="User:Mr Tan">Mr Tan</a> 12:50, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Enough is enough. The author of this article has been posting his original research papers on various rather minor topics of modern Japan. The majority of them ought to have been written into existing articles in the first place and do not merit independent namespaces. Yet he keeps making these little articles to show his research papers on Wikipedia possibly because he cannot incorporate his broken English texts into the tightly written existing articles. Every time his articles are put on VfD they will be greeted by "Keep, cleanup, merge" support votes. The fact of the matter is that although some native English-speaking members might clean up the English a little, few would bother to merge them into relevant articles.<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHermeneus_cff0.html" title="User:Hermeneus"><font color="#111111" face="palatino,times">Hermeneus</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/e/r/User_talk%7EHermeneus_c680.html" title="User talk:Hermeneus">talk</a>)</small> 03:43, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Some, such as "<a href="../../../h/o/w/How_to_keep_a_genius_busy_for_hours.html" title="How to keep a genius busy for hours">keep a genius</a>" contain some analysis of it.

The proposed policy is not being able to vote on adminship, while the title is the inflamatory not being able to vote at all. After all that, the proper place for the discussion about whether admins can vote for nominated admins is not a policy page in the Wikipedia space, but the Requests for adminship talk page. Bottom line is, sure we can have a discussion on whether admins can vote on requests for adminship.

<li><s>Again, it was titled in an inflammatory manner and written in an inflammatory, and poorly formatted way by an editor with a large number of disruptive edits. What about that would lead anyone to believe it was created in good faith? Hmm bury a policy proposal on the talk page of a very highly watched page that is specifically about voting on new administrators? Sticking it at a page in the Wikipedia namespace with almost no links to it is burying it more. Besides <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_create_policy_4959.html" title="Wikipedia:How to create policy">Wikipedia:How to create policy</a> even tells you that of 70 proposed policies, only 4 have been accepted. That would tell anyone thinking about it that there is a better way to get what you want accomplished. Finally it's not really even a new policy, <i>it's just a change to the voting policy at requests for adminship</i>. Requests for changes to that policy should go on its talk page. The fact that there is such strong consensus to delete this page, and as of yet, no one has brought that discussion up there is further evidence this page was created in bad faith. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 18:23, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)</s></li>

<li><s>The corollary to "assume good faith" is "don't be a sucker".

I waited nearly six months to register an account, so I had an idea of how things work, and I know I'm not the only one who registers with some experience. It's a discussion, not a hand grenade. "Red flags" are a warning to take a closer look, but when I look, I find no danger here, except what I suspect is a whole new use for VfD.

<dd><s>Your zeal would have been better spent on drafting a new formulation of the proposal that is a lot less clumsy and inflammatory. That, in turn, seems to be more productive than lamenting the lack of good faith in others. Is suggesting that people are calling this trolling because they "don't like the idea" supposed to be good faith, then? It's quite obvious why people assume this is a troll, and it has not so much to do with the concept as with the way it's expressed. A proposal that outright states that admins often further "their own petty interests", true or not, relevant or not, is not the best way to encourage constructive discussion. As an aside: meta-squabbles over who can call whose evaluation of the situation bad faith, now <i>that</i> we might truly call "prevailing wiki-thought".

<li><b>Keep</b>. I fail to see why this entry is any less worthy than any of the other frissbee-based games currently listed. In fact, it seems to have a more fully developed rule system and folklore surrounding it than most of the others. I have a difficult time seeing how this game could be classified as improvised. The grammar in the entry is a little rough, but could easily be corrected, whereas the substance is quite extensive. -- dstevens23 13:06, 2005 Jun 17 (UTC) — <i>(dstevens23's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_dstevens23_9fa7.html" title="Special:Contributions/dstevens23">1st</a> edit.)</i></li>

<li>I don't agree with you that you must have prior knowledge of every single notable individual in Wikipedia. If you did, there wouldn't be a point to creating biographies, would there? (unsigned comment by 129.219.6.5)
<ul>
<li>I agree, and I admit that there is a lot of merit in learning about that which had previously fallen outside one's scope of knowledge. However, one of the strengths of a VfD is that it allows people who <i>do</i> know about a subject, or can do research on the subject to verify and validate its status as a Wikipedia entry, can comment and tell other users why the entry should stay. By you saying "I do not know this Andrew Harrison," it implies to me that you don't know him in any sense, and therefore cannot judge whether or not he is subject to inclusion according to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 04:12, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b>. PER Wikipedia instructions on the handling of vanity pages, "An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous." (Wikipedia vanity definition page) This means that being non-notable is not a basis for deletion. Further, this article includes pertinent accoplishments by the individual, and does not list irrelevant information such as hobbies, or aspirations. An official Wikipedia definition of unimportance includes: <b>1</b>. Patent nonsense, <b>2</b>. Original research, <b>3</b>. Unverifiability, <b>4</b>. Unexpandability, <b>5</b>. Small number of contributors, <b>6</b>. Does not belong in Wikipedia. This article satisfies none of these conditions except possibly (but far too early to say) 4 and 5. Wikipedia policy specifically states: "An article important according to the above guidelines should not be deleted on the basis of it being <b>1</b>. Insufficiently important famous or relevant, or <b>2</b>. currently small or a stub." Additionaly, a google search I performed returned many hits relating to this individual's academic career. Therefore, an article this new does not fall under the grounds for deletion. All information included in this article should be considered encyclopedic for inclusion. Postpone deletion until sufficient time has passed in order to establish unexpandability and a small number of contributors, and at that time we can determine whether we shall declare it unimportant. --CatTracker 22:28, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Note</b>: This is CatTracker's first and only edit or comment. Also, "being non-notable is not a basis for deletion" is just plain wrong - being non-<i>famous</i> is not a basis for saying an article is <i>vanity</i>.

<li>First off, I am <i>not</i> an administrator. And yes. I am pointing out partisan facts. Point out any truths that you feel will support <i>your</i> case, as well. I suspect that there are very few, as arguments for inclusion of this article have not focused on proving his notability, but rather on arguing over the question "who is notable?" and for inclusionism in Wikipedia (which I find warranted in some examples: for example, my feelings as to school listings in WP have changed dramatically; but not here). <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 07:44, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

But, in principle, I suppose I agree with you - just that the content of the article, right now, does <i>not</i> justify keeping it. The article does not even contain a full sentence - merely a fragment. If he is to be remembered, it will be as more than simply a "major benefactor" to a single university (though that may be part of his legacy), but as the head of a financial institution - which is <i>not even mentioned</i> in the article. <b>Cleanup</b> or, as I said before, <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 01:06, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

Well I'm sorry Jason, I don't have alot of information on the articles I am making, but my INTENT was to get things started, and have other users contribute the rest. You've gone and marked for deletion more than half of EVERYTHING I created, which was kind of rude considering that they all had only been on Wikipedia for LESS THAN AN HOUR!!! I'd appreciate it if you stopped marking all my articles for deletion, when you honestly had no idea what it was you were removing. <b>Keep</b>. (I am the creator of this and all the other articles appended to my IP address. Please vote to keep all of the articles I made. I promise they are all relevant, contrary to how small or short they may be.) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.251.21.122 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.251.21.122.html" title="User talk:24.251.21.122">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.251.21.122_f9cd.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.251.21.122">contribs</a>) 02:26, 17 Jun 2005.</small></p>

<li>Several of the articles that you have created <i>are</i>, in fact, I still feel, subject for deletion (<a href="../../../s/d/i/SDIC_2a11.html" title="SDIC">SDIC</a>, Andrew Harrison, and <a href="../../../a/s/u/ASU_Cares_529e.html" title="ASU Cares">ASU Cares</a>). I was wrong to add WP Carey to the VfD page, but please keep in mind that, at the time, the only text on the page was "William Polk Carey - Benefactor to the Arizona State University College of Business." I agree that I ought to have done more research before adding him to VfD, but there are many articles added every day with text like that (or, in some cases, more carefully thought-out and thoroughly written text) that are absolute hogwash.</li>
<li>The fact that one of your creations has encyclopaedic relevence does not affect the status of the other articles, which have little pertinence to anyone outside of your immediate university community; if an event such as <a href="../../../a/s/u/ASU_Cares_529e.html" title="ASU Cares">ASU Cares</a> is encyclopaedic, then so is my university's Community Day. I might also add that the most important fact about Mr. Carey - that he heads a large financial institution - was <i>not</i> mentioned in your article. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 03:25, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Why not create these in one section on the ASU page. If they do grow to be encylopedic there to the point that they need an article then you can merge the text to a new page. Also being in one place it is more likely that someone will see them and work on them as a group. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 05:53, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not really a big job. these are the only three that I identified as being problematic. The other live links from the original article were to (a) articles about the territories' electoral (H of C) districts which included references to the senators; and (b) articles about the Quebec Senate divisions, which are legitimate, as far as i know. And then there was only one in the (b) category. The person who started this ill-advsied project didn't get very far before abandoning it. As far as unlinking, I have no problem doing that.

My first, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Liberal_landslide_ae11.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Liberal landslide">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Liberal landslide</a> went through yesterday, and I dutifully cleaned up the links to that. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 13:03, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b> per Ground Zero and Jord. Any non-Quebec senate divisions do not exist (are not fixed) and should therefore be deleted.

<li>From what I know, Senate seats are assigned by province.

<li>Really what this becomes is a "List of Ontario Senators", and includes those "representing" Toronto, Northern Ontario, and Punkydoodles Corners. But is this needed? Do we not already have categories for present and former Senators?

<li>I can see how a <i>List of Ontario Senators</i> would be useful. When I looked at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Canadian_Senators_3243.html" title="List of Canadian Senators">List of Canadian Senators</a>, which is in alphabetical order, I could see how someone would like to see a list of the senators by province. Perhaps this list could be divided by province, then by surname. Such a discussion is probably irrelevant to this VfD, but I'll agree with your <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_%28Senate_division%29_c86c.html" title="Ontario (Senate division)">Ontario (Senate division)</a>. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 14:45, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Based on comments from DeathPhoenix and Cloveious, I think the best approach to this article would be to move it to "List of Ontario senators", instead of deleting, and use it for all present and former senators who represented Ontario and senate divisions within Ontario. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 14:01, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep, these articles are correct. and list Senators from the divisions listed historically, even if Senate divisions are secondary to regional distribution. I think people have a stick up there rear end on this one and it seems to me they are whipped up into a frenzy because they dislike the senate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Senate constituency offices do actually exist inside Senate divisions.</p>
<p>The Senate Consitituency Office for Calgary is</p>
<p>Suite 650, 1207 - 11 Ave.S.W. Calgary, Alberta T3C 0M5 Phone: 403-244-3111</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> it because, People have a right to see a list of Senators that have represented there geographical area, and the dates they represented that area.</p>
<p>Senate divisions were important more historically when people had to go to Senators to get Private bills introduced in the senate and house to get a divorce before, family law was deligated to the courts, and travel and communications were not very good compared to today. I can back that up with News Paper articles from the turn of the Century.</p>
<p>The Ontario division is stated as a Senate division "At Large" representing areas not covered by senators covering specific areas inside the article.</p>
<p>And no, they are not controlled by a boundaries commission like electoral districts, and that won't change until Senate reform happens.</p>

<p>The government of Canada actually took the time to note Senate divisions represented and days when senate divisions changed.</p>

<li>Cloveious, I have repsonded to your comments at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Talk%7ECanadian_Senate_divisions_c513.html" title="Talk:Canadian Senate divisions">Talk:Canadian Senate divisions</a> <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 13:50, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Cloveious, the point is that beyond the level of the province, a Senate division can be called anything the sitting senator wants it to be called (s/he could even call it "Hellsmouth-Sunnydale-Buffyverse", iffen s/he wanted to), but there aren't any formal boundaries and they're still constitutionally deemed to represent the whole province. Even with the divisional name "Toronto/Bloor &amp; Yonge", <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Stollery_7f65.html" title="Peter Stollery">Peter Stollery</a> is not <i>really</i> considered the senator for just one street corner in downtown Toronto, and that divisional name will most likely <i>never</i> exist again after Stollery dies or retires. I fully support a list of senators grouped by <i>province</i>, but outside of Quebec, senate subdivisions really, truly, don't exist except as null placeholders. (It's the political equivalent of buying a coloured faceplate for your iPod — it personalizes your iPod and makes it a little more unique, but it doesn't fundamentally change the iPod into something it isn't.) And if you think we're opposed to this just because we dislike the Senate, dude, you're <i>seriously</i> out to lunch. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 21:43, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As the papers of Masud Rahman are linked to this page I suggest this rather unnecessary commotion will wither away. Furthermore, comments about 'drinking' and 'sex' are highly offensive and completely unsupported by the content of the article. 163.1.227.76 23:26, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>I object! I am trying to compile a study of a young, eminent scientist. Surely, Wikepedia is designed to promote the spread of knowledge about eminent people, in any field. Thus, I urge you all to stop hounding my page on Mr. Rahman; Wikepedia is no place to criticise the development of science, or the merit psychological profiles.

<li>I find it not only sad but also infuriating that people create crappy vanity articles and then, when the inevitable VfD comes up, spin the whole thing into some kind of a sob story about how they're being oppressed for their religion. There are plenty of people out there who're hurting for real because of bigotry; whenever someone comes up with bullshit like this when faced with the consequences of their own vanity, it's a fucking insult to those who really <i>are</i> suffering from anti-Islamic sentiment, people who don't have the luxury of giggling over the big stink they're making on Wikipedia over a badly-written personal article about someone's infatuations and pretending that it's vital to the plight of Muslims everywhere.

<li>Well, ejking, the term "vanity page" does not refer to the vanity of the individual the page is about, but rather it describes the fact that it exists only because someone wants to promote that person. That, however, does not mean that the subject of the article is notable enough to interest the rest of the world. Of course, hey, maybe we're wrong and your grandpa is a notable guy. If that's the case, you have at least five days to convince us by editing the page accordingly to show why he's notable to the world at large and. That said, take my advice -- adding VfD tags on others' user pages isn't going to win you any goodwill here. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 00:02, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
