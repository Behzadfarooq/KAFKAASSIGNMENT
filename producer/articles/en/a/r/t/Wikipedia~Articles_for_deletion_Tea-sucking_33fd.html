<li><s><b>Keep</b> Firstly, I'd like to point out that this article <b>doesn't qualify</b> for <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_deletions_bb1d.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy deletions">Speedy Deletion</a>. Arguments for Keep: It's not neologism, it is something that people actually do. It may not be relevant to your life, but it is to many others. It has the potential to be encyclopaedic (though not if deleted). It's not vanity, because it's not about a person, nor was it created by a Tea Sucker. It's not a joke, nor nonsense. This is something that many people actually do, and this is a good place to collect information about why and how. I accept a more flattering photo could help, but I think the current one does well to convey the emotions involved when sucking on a tea bag. -- grlea</s> <b>Strong Delete</b> Someone has completely rewritten the original article to now be about Tim Tam Slams, and variants thereof. Firstly, Tim Tam Slams are most commonly performed with coffee, not tea, and I've never heard of them being done with tea, and a quick survey of my office shows no one else has heard of people using tea either. Secondly, I've never heard Tim Tam Slamming called Tea Sucking before, though the term Tim Tam Slam is well-known to me and in the circles I move in. If the new content does have a place on Wikipedia (as, strangely, a lot of people seem to think it does), it should probably be under <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Tam_Slam_4c8a.html" title="Tim Tam Slam">Tim Tam Slam</a>. Tea Sucking is something altogether different. I would prefer if the original content were restored and the VfD page reset to monitor the desire for a page that really is about Tea Sucking (as opposed to Tim Tam Slams), but this probably isn't going to happen. My recommendation is that the current content be moved to Tim Tam Slam and we forget the whole sorry Tea Sucking saga. I think I'm done with trying to contribute to wikipedia. Might go start a blog instead. grlea 5 July 2005 07:53 (UTC)

<li>I dunno, I think the guy in the picture is totally fakin' it. A lot of them do, ya know. Sure, they have the string and the little tag hanging out of their mouth, but it isn't connected to a tea bag at all. It probably isn't connected to anything. I think the article should cover this problem, because it's ruined a few perfectly good marriages and carpets. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> July 1, 2005 15:20 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. This is still a wildly non-encyc, not-notable article. To suggest that it originated in Australia is so other-planetary as to defy description.

<li>After further thought on this article, I was prepared to vote delete, as it just doesn't seem that unique a phenomenon.

<li><b>Move/Redirect</b> The article as it currently exists does not appear to be the article that got VFD. It's pretty obvious from the way votes have slid from all delete to mostly keep.
