<p><b>Weak Delete</b> Her earlier books show a peak amazon rank (for "The Way Home") of #232,909. Her homeschooling books may be more notable, however. Harvest House Publishers is a specialty company with a definate agenda, which may invalidate them as a source, they are not, however, vanity press. Her other publisher appears to primarily publish religious tracts, but is also not vanity press. The most serious issue for me is the fact that only one trivial non-publisher source is given for her. The lack of sourcing does not mean the nonexistance of sources, however, and I'd like to give the benefit of the doubt, but the new community precident, as derived from the AfD for 2, The Ranting Griffon, is that if an author is notable only to a very limited group or set, then they do not merit inclusion. I have to endorse this precident, seeing as given a narrow enough set of the population, anything could be notable. Sources would strongly help salvage the article, but I haven't seen anything so far that would indicate any more notability than any other minor author. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 06:51, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sure I can think of plenty, yes.

<dd>May I make a reminder, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is a guideline. She has had more than a couple of books published. I am concerned that common sense is not being used I am further concerned that the nomination comes not from naturally passing through wiki-articles but from a deliberate attempt to find articles of <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth's</a> to nominate. Comments on her talk page support this. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">Malla</span></a><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMallanox_41c6.html" title="User talk:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">nox</span></a> 15:58, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"This page is a guideline" does not mean "Ignore this guideline". We have to have some way of establishing notability. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is as good as any, and she doesn't meet it. Lots of people write lots of books, but unless they are notable outside their walled gardens, they don't belong on Wikipedia. Example: C. Stephen Evans has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/102-7082936-0324926?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=C.%20Stephen%20Evans" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/102-7082936-0324926?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=C.%20Stephen%20Evans" rel="nofollow">"more than a couple of books published"</a>, but he doesn't get a page on Wikipedia, because he's still non-notable outside of his little walled garden. As to the nomination itself, please assume good faith on my part. Yes, I was drawn to CyberAnth's user page. But I did not go looking for things to delete. On CyberAnth's user page, I was curious, he had linked to Prairie Muffins and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Pride_3059.html" title="Mary Pride">Mary Pride</a>, articles he was apparently proud of. The point of linking to such articles on one's userpage is to get others to click through, right? And I did. And what I found were horrible articles, unsourced, largely unverifiable, and probably unencyclopedic. Now, what was I supposed to do? Should I have backed up and said, "oh, what will people think if I nominate these?" Am I supposed to ignore bad articles just because of who authored them? That seems to me to be a poor choice if I care about the quality of this encyclopedia. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 02:35, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>CyberAnth, it is not my job to explain the policies here to you. If you're unsure what "source independent of the person" means, you need to go ask at <a href="../../../h/e/l/WP%7EHELPDESK_f3d8.html" title="WP:HELPDESK">WP:HELPDESK</a>. It is the responsibility of the editor who wants to content to stay up to establish the notability and verifiability of that content with reliable sources. When you think you have reliable sources, show them, and the editors in this AfD can discuss their merits. I am not going to run in circles for you, however. You need to start with a claim to notability. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 02:38, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Coelacan, I think it's important to give CyberAnth the benefit of the doubt here. When I look at the sources, both within the article and without, I see sources that don't successfully meet both prongs of the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> test. Either the article is not independent of the subject or she is not a primary subject of the article. For example, the <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_Library_Journal_6b78.html" title="School Library Journal">School Library Journal</a> article cited below doesn't mention Pride within the article itself, but instead cites her book as an undifferentiated one of many. It only establishes that she wrote a book on subject matter similar to the journal article. <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publisher%27s_Weekly_c64c.html" title="Publisher's Weekly">Publisher's Weekly</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazon.com.html" title="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> likewise only establish that she's a published author, not that she has "<i>been the <b>primary subject</b> of multiple <b>non-trivial</b> published works whose source is <b>independent of the person.</b></i>" I think she likely merits inclusion within the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeschool.html" title="Homeschool">homeschooling</a> article, but lacks independent <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> that can be established by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> in order to justify her being the subject of an article. --<a href="../../../s/s/b/User%7ESsbohio_59da.html" title="User:Ssbohio">Ssbohio</a> 05:05, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A merge would be a good idea. However, your expressed opinion is to keep the independent article. Is there more to the interpretaion? From what I've seen of the improved article, I'm still having trouble seeing the article as overcoming the hurdles of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">biography</a>, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> criteria in order to merit keeping under <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDELETE_1b88.html" title="WP:DELETE">deletion policy</a>. I'll go over the first three sources in the article to exemplify my point:
<ol>

<li>A five-year-old <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Herald_eb33.html" title="Calgary Herald">Calgary Herald</a> article by the same author as source 1. The title implies that the article's subject is the <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quiverfull.html" title="Quiverfull">quiverfull</a> movement, but the article's text is password protected and not accessible from Google nor from the Calgary Herald website. <a href="http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=207093851&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=6993&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD" class="external autonumber" title="http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=207093851&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=6993&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>

<dd>These are reliable sources, to be sure, but they do not establish Mary Pride in any way greater than her own writing already has. They all agree that she wrote books that are among the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon.html" title="Canon">canon</a> of the homeschool movement, but they don't focus on her or assert her notability outside of the fact of her being a published author &amp; sometime lecturer. --<a href="../../../s/s/b/User%7ESsbohio_59da.html" title="User:Ssbohio">Ssbohio</a> 05:05, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looking at <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a>'s comments above, it's important to keep in mind that the standard calls for the article's subject to have been the <i>primary subject</i> of multiple non-trivial articles in independent <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. See my analysis of the first three sources from the article above. The references CanadianCaesar makes are to reliable sources, but Pride is only referenced in passing in those articles, not their subject. --<a href="../../../s/s/b/User%7ESsbohio_59da.html" title="User:Ssbohio">Ssbohio</a> 05:40, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>CanadianCaesar's gut feeling aside, how, precisely, are we to establish notability if she fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>?

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I disagree with the suggestion that Mary Pride should just be mentioned at the "homeschooling" page instead of getting her own page. That page is already quite extensive, and while it could use a little bit more information about religious motivations for homeschooling, putting mini-bios about every author who is influential in homeschooling would make the page even more impenitrable. So, why is Mary Pride notable? <s>Because she is notable in the community of religious homeschooling, having written notable books. The religious homeschooling community is a large and powerful one, not a small walled community that anyone can be notable in. She has been interviewed by members of that community (although I'm doing a really poor job of getting good links or interview transcripts from google) about her opinions. Mary Pride is notable ONLY as an author, so of course references about her are very much related to her work. The article seems to have put together actual verifiable information about her background in a useful way. It would be non-NPOV to put large amounts of information about this person on lots of different pages about her books or on the homeschooling page. This small, concise article seems like a very good compromise to me.</s><a href="../../../e/n/u/User%7EEnuja_0ca9.html" title="User:Enuja">Enuja</a> 00:01, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, okay, perhaps she doesn't belong on any other pages either. That means she <b>definitely</b> shouldn't have her own page here. That whole "<i>I'm doing a really poor job of getting good links or interview transcripts from google</i>" bit is very telling though. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 00:36, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've continued to look around, wikipedia's <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quiverfull.html" title="Quiverfull">quiverfull</a> page has a min-bio of her already. But I've rescinded my position that she's noteable as a "homeschooling" personality. It remains quite possible that she's a noteable person in the american conservative evangelical movement at large, althought I can't tell which Google hits and interviews are outside of her organization. I did find google hits of interviews WITH her, it's just that the text of the interviews were not coming up. I changed my "keep" to a "weak" one, as there is quite an effective mini-bio of her already at the <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quiverfull.html" title="Quiverfull">quiverfull</a> page. <a href="../../../e/n/u/User%7EEnuja_0ca9.html" title="User:Enuja">Enuja</a> 01:20, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
