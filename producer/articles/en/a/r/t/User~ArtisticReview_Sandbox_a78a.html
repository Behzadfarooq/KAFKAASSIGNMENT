	    <p>What personal weakness would you like to work on in the next few years and how do you think you might do this?</p>
<p>A personal weakness I would like to work on and refine is my confidence in communicating and presenting in front of others. I am capable of expressing my ideas and knowledge very well in my writing; however I have slight difficulty in communicating and discussing my ideas and knowledge in a class, or in front of groups of people who I am not acquainted with. In the next few years, my first step in combating my weakness will be to visualize and set a goal for myself, which will serve as my motivation to become a more confident, proficient and competent speaker. As I will be entering first year next year and will be taking many seminar courses, I will be introduced to professors who are well versed in presenting. By listening to good speakers, I can become familiar with the techniques and principles of what it takes to communicate effectively. It is important to practice constantly, and seize the opportunity to speak whenever I can. Entering a small program such as the McMaster Health Science program is ideal in overcoming this area of dissatisfaction. Studying in a small, intimate group will greatly help by giving me many opportunities to communicate my ideas couple with my reasoning. I be more comfortable speaking in a smaller group of people, and also have an increased opportunity for class participation which is a necessary component to be involved in. Attending such a University such as McMaster with such a rich academic stratosphere will be helpful through mere presence, due to the fact that I will have a fresh start and will have the opportunity to improve my profile as a confident and adequate speaker. With a positive goal, optimistic attitude, motivation, and practice, I am on the road to overcoming my weakness.</p>

<p>A question that should not be asked is what an individual’s religion association is. As far as applicants are concerned, their religion should not affect their chances of being accepted into a university. Secondly, the role of religion in university should solely be academic. Religion has its place in academic disciplines such as history, sociology, and literature. However, outside of the academic fields, it should be of little or no importance. Despite the social leaps us as Canadians have made in the past forty years, religion and race still remain a source as racism, hatred, and conflict. Unfortunately, religious and racial associations continue to be subjects that cause problems in society. By asking such a question on a university application of all things, we are putting emphasis and importance to the matter, adding unnecessary emphasis. Incontestably, holding this true, some would feel compelled and uncomfortable both advertising their associations, and knowing that it is necessary to provide. Some may feel that it is relevant purely for statistical requirements; however this is unnecessary as it should not reflect intelligence or capability as a student. Allowing questions regarding race or religion to enter a university application would be crossing a social line indirectly supporting intolerant views that an individual’s religion or race may possibly affect their performance or behaviour as a student.</p>

<p>What are the values of the Program and what evidence can you describe to support that you subscribe to these values?</p>
<p>The values of the Program include the ability to work both independently and in small groups, an innovative and interdisciplinary approach to the study of health through problem-based and self-directed learning, inquiry skills and the application of critical thinking and inquiry to scientific study, creative experimental design, taking an active role in one’s own learning, and the interest in comprehending of all aspects of health. I believe my requisites and the work I have done in the International Baccalaureate Program provides evidence that I subscribe to these values. The IB requires students to take part in an interdisciplinary project called the Group 4 Project; a scientific investigation that requires a problem to be identified. With a team of six student over six weeks, we designed our own creative experiment, combined our knowledge and skills from Biology, Chemistry, and Physics, and applied our inquiry skills to make knowledgeable conclusions based on our results. Because each group requires one student from each science course, we were required to investigate the same problem from different perspectives; similar to the Program’s interest in understanding all aspects of health. Also, because I was the only chemistry in the group, I worked independently from a chemistry perspective, taking an active role in the project. Finally, we self-assessed our projects, and were peer-assessed, demonstrating self-directed learning and critical evaluation. I believe the extended essay which I wrote, I conducted independent research on the gender differences in mathematic ability. The essay demonstrated independence and self-directed learning, and honed my inquiry skills. A true testament of my subscription to the values of the Program</p>

Please describe a non-academic aspect of your life that you feel is important to your sense of self and explain why.</p>
<p>An aspect of my life that is important to my sense of self is my volunteer job at the Toronto Rehab Centre, the largest rehabilitation hospital in Canada. The focus of the hospital it to help those who experience disabling injury or illness to rebuild their lives through complex continuing care and long-term care. My role as a volunteer is recreational therapy for women. I get the opportunity to make conversation with the patients while helping them make crafts, playing games, essentially anything that provides them great comfort and escape. The experience with working with these patients, more importantly these people has helped reinforce who I am. I was initially attracted to volunteering at the hospital for two reasons. Firstly, I knew that unlike regular hospitals, I would get the opportunity to make lasting relationships with the patients. Secondly, as I am interested in an occupation in health, I wanted a first hand experience of what it would be like working in such an environment. My volunteer job confirmed my aspiration for this type of occupation. (motivation here?) My volunteer work at the hospital proved my caring and patient nature, and my desire to help others. It has been extremely rewarding knowing that I am a part of their healing process. Many of the patients are hard to understand; the majority cannot speak properly, and get easily frustrated often making it quite difficult while working with them. However if the right, "good bed side manner" approach is utilized, easing their tensions is possible and rewarding. --- add something --- It has also alerted me once again of my privileges???? Working at the hospital has made me realize how lucky I am compared to millions of others, in the sense that I can walk, speak, and have freedom that is not confined to a hospital. I want to make full use of this gift, this gift of a capable mind to aid those who are less privileged, whether they be injured, sick, or handicapped in any way. For me this is a priority in life, to help others lives, not only a medical capacity but in a personal way. For me like countless people, the reward felt through helping someone is fulfilling and a drive behind my quest through medicine. ---Well i wrote some stuff there, change it up a bit, add what you want. I love you.</p>
<p>Please tell us whatever else you feel we need to know to understand you as a "whole person" and one who would fit our programme.</p>
<p>--- No flow at the beginning, how do I start and connect the firs two sentences? ---Upon meeting me it is very clear that I am a very motivated and someone who places a high value on life and its experiences. Seeing me in an academic or professional environment one instantly see's that I am an active learner, always ready to learn more, to expand my horizons. When the International Baccalaureate program was offered at Branksome Hall, it was not mandatory for my grade nor was a tested program at my school as it was in its infancy. We were warned that it could potentially be very taxing on us and most chose not to venture into the unknown. However, I took the risk to enrol in the program, despite the fact that I knew it would be a challenge like nothing I've faced before. Being the IB diploma program itself has truly contributed to making me a person who would not only fit well into the programme but fit perfectly into it. IB encourages students to endeavour to be active learners, well-rounded individuals and engaged world citizens. It is goals set in this program that has helped model me into the person who I am today, through my dedication to the program I have become a well-balanced individual. Although I put a heavy focus on my academics, I maintain a balance with participating in school sports teams, being an active member of the community, and spending time with my family and friends. It is important not to ignore certain aspects of life in favour of others, it has always been my belief that one can maintain a fairly healthy and well rounded lifestyle without sacrificing the chances of attaining their goals. It is often said that university is a source of unparallelled learning and growth, McMaster is not merely and ideal place for this growth to take place, it is the best place for this to take place.</p>
<p>-- Well I added some stuff, add or remove where you see fit. I love you my princess. best of luck. --</p>
