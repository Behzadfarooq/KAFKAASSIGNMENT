<p>Minor concept, simply a webcomic drawn with ASCII, unsourced, likely unsourceable and with few chances of expansion.

<ul>
<li>How can there be no reference to Nerd Boy, when it is the most popular ASCII art comic? When an article is deleted, it doesn't mean that its topic cannot be mentioned anywhere on Wikipedia. This is just ridiculous. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 17:47, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

There was no consensus to merge or move the content elsewhere.

<li>It does if the article was deleted for being unverifiable, which was the argument made by several editors in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Nerd_Boy_%282nd_nomination%29_8ee8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Nerd Boy (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Nerd Boy (2nd nomination)</a> and not refuted with a citation of a single source, either then or in this re-addition of the same content. Unverifiable material does not belong in <i>any</i> Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:05, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> there seems to be a continued crusade to delete ASCII-art related content recently. It is just convenient to have this article on its own page, because it is related both to <a href="../../../a/s/c/ASCII_art_8901.html" title="ASCII art">ASCII art</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webcomics.html" title="Webcomics">webcomics</a>. It could be easily expanded with sections on various notable ASCII comics, such as "Red Baron", the first ever ASCII comic, legendary "<a href="http://www.asciiartfarts.com" class="external text" title="http://www.asciiartfarts.com" rel="nofollow">ASCII Art Farts</a>" and so on. Just because nobody bothered to do that up till now doesn't mean that it will stay stubby for eternity. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 17:43, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You'd fare far better by showing that the assertions that the article is unverifiable are false. You've nowhere addressed verifiability in your entire argument. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:00, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, first I need to know, what statement in the article do you find nonverifiable? <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 18:03, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Even if they are verifiable, verifiability is not the same as notability. I can't see a reason why this can't be a <b>Merge and redirect</b> into <a href="../../../a/s/c/ASCII_art_8901.html" title="ASCII art">ASCII art</a>, either <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR">EliminatorJR</a> 19:19, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it's unverifiable, which has been the challenge levelled at this content without answer since <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_3.html" title="January 3">01-03</a>, it cannot be. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:05, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I suggest that you read what I wrote again, and start to address verifiability. Looking at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Nerd_Boy_%282nd_nomination%29_8ee8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Nerd Boy (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Nerd Boy (2nd nomination)</a> it appears that people have been pointing out to you the lack of sources for this content (which is little different to what was written in the now deleted Nerd Boy) for at least a month and a half, now. You could save yourself a lot of trouble by citing sources to show that they actually exist. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:05, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>All of the content that is currently in the article is verifiable through the primary source (official website). You could save me a lot of time by pointing to which exact statements need sourcing. This stuff is pretty old, and a lot of web links are already dead. It's pretty hard to search for sources in this area. For example about 4 years ago I was doing ego-searching and found an article in Polish magazine with very thorough coverage of ASCII art (written by Blazej Kozlowski, no less, one of the greatest artists of the scene). It mentioned Nerd Boy and other popular ASCII comics. I can't find the link now. The printed version is probably stored somewhere, but the web version is dead. A lot of ASCII art references are in printed form and their Internet versions have phased out. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 21:22, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Note how Joaquim Gandara is mentioned as "creator of greatest, most interesting and most funny comic strips".

<li><b>Delete</b>. That which is verifiable only from primary sources, we call original research.

<li>Huh? This article was never previously deleted on AfD. In fact, it was kept.

I also find the fact that you think that English Wikipedia should have different criteria of inclusion than other Wikipedias extremely disturbing. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 23:06, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
