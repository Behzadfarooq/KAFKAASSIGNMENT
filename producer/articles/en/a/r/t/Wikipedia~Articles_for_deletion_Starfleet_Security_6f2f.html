<p>This is an article which has just been rescued from certain death as a copyright violation from Memory Alpha, but cites as it sole source a novel written from the perspective of a security officer (and I don't think it's canon either) and the MA article from which it was originally copied and now rewritten, albeit still primarily from an in-universe perspective. Seems to me this isa subject best left in Memory Alpha.

Nobody is disputing there are security guards in Star Trek: the dispute is whether they constitute a department at headquarters and suchforth, as the other branches do indeed appear to&#160;: (our article notes the distinction between random engineers on starships, and the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starfleet_Engineering_Corps_26e8.html" title="Starfleet Engineering Corps">Starfleet Engineering Corps</a>, for example). I have checked the dialogue from "The Drumhead" as you suggested, and it seems inconclusive (why is a judge being sent from Starfleet Security?) <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 22:41, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think Starfleet Security is pretty well established, but thats been beat to death. I dont have access to the Drumhead, but its always been one of my favorite episodes. I believe the line is something like "We will be joined by Admiral Heneley (spelling?) from Starfleet Security." And he's not a judge in the episode, hes a security specialist. That should be pretty definite if thats what was said. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 22:45, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I realise it must be a bit difficult to try to deal with this type of thing without access to any sources, but we can't use your recollections as a substitute. I don't have access to the episode, either (just blown my budget buying books and dvds to flesh out TOS episode articles), but the <i>Encyclopedia</i> says Thomas Henry was "admiral in charge of security" (lowercase). Do you agree there is, or at least could be, a distinction between "Starfleet security" (the redshirts, who are under line command) and "Starfleet Security" (some group back home that does high-level stuff), just as with the Engineering departments? <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 23:03, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_Encyclopedia_09ca.html" title="Star Trek Encyclopedia">Star Trek Encyclopedia</a> is a nice but incomplete source. Really a shame. But section 31 is established in canon to exist prior to the federation itself as far back as the first four years of the NX program. DS9 Section 31 arcs also established the organization pretty well. I do not see a problem with verifiability. As always a better citation would be better but we have article talk pages for such discussions.

<dd>I am not certain what the actual issue is. It may be a naming discontinuity though it doesn't appear that way. It seems to be a 'legal' Section 31. There had been numerous references to a "starfleet security" in the show but not much of an exploration of it. IIRC they just are a conviniant way to fork the plot with some random last minute report. I do not recall correctly but I believe Miles O'brien underwent a covert operation for starfleet security in a ds9 episode against the notorious Orion Syndicate... --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 22:13, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I think my problem with this page and the others listed by <a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> is that their existence appears to represent a misnomer as far as <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">WP:FICTION</a> is concerned. The question is not whether if Starfleet were real these bodies would be sufficiently notable for inclusion. They clearly would be. The question is whether they have played a sufficient part in Star Trek to deserve separate articles. These have at time been mentioned and various characters fall within their ambit. But the organisations <i>themselves</i> play only a fringe role. I would suggest coverage of them be limited to a subheading of <b>Departments of Starfleet</b> on the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starfleet.html" title="Starfleet">Starfleet</a> page. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe">WJBscribe</a> 01:03, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Fundamentally re-orient</b> or <b>merge</b> into the appropriate separate articles. The problem with having separate articles about fictional things is that it presents them as existing independently of the shows, in some "fictional universe". This is a problem for a few reasons on Wikipedia, but a major one is: when the show's writers change, the properties of the thing changes; the "history" of Starfleet Security might be changed by a 1990's show when there was some contradictory statement about it in a 1960's show. In comparison, the properties of chemical elements, for example, do not change and they are in themselves self-consistent. Our knowledge of them or theories about them might change, but when they do that is included as a historical element, with reference to the surrounding framework of people and places. Similarly, articles on fictional things must be made with reference to the surrounding framework of the books, television shows, etc. from which they come, which do exist in the real world. Articles ridden with statements like "The predecessor to the current branch of Starfleet Security were the weapons and security personnel of the Earth Starfleet" are not appropriate for an encyclopedia, while "They are frequently depicted in episodes as laying suppressing fire while one of the main characters, for example Captain Archer, runs for a certain objective." and "In the first episode of Season 3, "The Xindi", the MACOs participated in a mission on a mining planet to rescue Captain Archer and Commander Tucker." (<a href="../../../m/a/c/MACO_d65b.html" title="MACO">MACO</a>) are properly connected with the real world. This is to some extent separate from the sourcing issue. On that matter, if the several descriptions in books, official guides, and plot summaries are not acceptable then the featured article on <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html" title="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</a> is not (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulbasaur#Notes_and_references" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulbasaur#Notes_and_references" rel="nofollow"><i>all</i> its sources are like this</a>), nor are the many thousands of other articles on fictional characters and television episodes (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:24_%28TV_series%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:24_%28TV_series%29" rel="nofollow">24</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Friends" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Friends" rel="nofollow">Friends</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:CSI" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:CSI" rel="nofollow">CSI</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:That_%2770s_Show" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:That_%2770s_Show" rel="nofollow">That 70's Show</a>) it goes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Categories_named_after_television_series" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Categories_named_after_television_series" rel="nofollow">on and on</a>). These are vast categories of articles with no reliable sources (and invariably no sources cited whatsoever). This issue needs to be resolved, but these thousands upon thousands of articles are not going to be fixed piece-meal an AfD here and there. Whether reliable sources on a subject exist cannot be evaluated by a mass AfD, and some of these topics do have reliable sources and warrant independent articles. Also, these articles do have work and information put into them and should be transferred to other wikis; that is not going to happen en masse. Perhaps we need a template with a longer term deleting system; these thousands of articles should not be deleted in successions of sudden 5-day AfDs, but there does need to be some enforcement of Wikipedia content policies. (Separate note, if this is to be morphed in a mass nomination: based on a search of academic journals, newspapers, and magazines, "Starfleet Academy" is far more noteworthy, with many more mentions (though I did not look very hard for reliable sources). I did find, however, happen to find an article in the <i><a href="http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/(upmlppei1n3yo355zcfpke45)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,13,13;journal,37,42;linkingpublicationresults,1:119813,1" class="external text" title="http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/(upmlppei1n3yo355zcfpke45)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,13,13;journal,37,42;linkingpublicationresults,1:119813,1" rel="nofollow">Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology</a></i> which has an apparently thorough review of Star Trek medicine by episodes. These sorts of things exist in abundance for the famous Star Trek, and for other famous fictions. While we should not allow these articles to continue unaltered (or even unmolested), or permit new badly sourced ones to be created, a 5-day AfD is not going to suss out all the books (and Star Trek is the subject of third-party academic, analytical books) or all the magazine articles and this remains a wiki with some articles that are works in progress; these are not living persons.) —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 01:18, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>See, here's the thing. I agree with you, fundamentally, that if you can put together enough third-party sources that either discuss a fictional work's impact on the real world, or critically analyze the technical merits of the fiction (writing, cinematography, etc.). The problem <i>here</i> is that none of those things exist for Starfleet Security. No one has written a book about how the use of non-lethal methods by Starfleet Security altered popular opinion on alternative methods of law enforcement. And, even if they did, that article would probably be about <b>Star Trek</b>, not <b>Starfleet Security</b>. There is a profound difference between the two, and attempting to extrapolate the importance of Starfleet Security from our hypothetical article is a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.

<dd>That's because, unlike Starfleet Security, the Emperor has achieved iconic status in popular culture. The character is referenced continuously in other fiction media, and has been the subject of several critically analytical pieces from outside Star Wars fandom. The article reflects that -- consider the fact that 90% of the article isn't about his <i>fictional</i> life, but the real-world process that led to the creation of the character, and its impact on media. Your inability to distinguish between in-universe importance and real-world importance is a continuing theme in these debates, and a somewhat disturbing one. The important part isn't whether or not a person or thing is "real" or "fiction," but the kind of impact it has on culture and media. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 04:37, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was trying to at least lighten the mood by knocking Star Wars a bit, sorry you didn't see that (or didn't want to). Sorry also that I "disturb you". Starfleet Security has been around for 30 years with the "redshirt sent to the planet and killed by the alien" appearing in multiple other medai sources. I am kind of ending my defense of thsi article. I have said all that can be said and the article has pictures, good info, and sources, and room to expand. I am confident we will get at least a "No concensus" if not a firm "Keep". I still feel this article should never have been AfD, much less 5 minutes after I attempted to expand and rewrite.

<dd>In the grand scheme of things, this is probably a minor point -- but please ditch the hyperbole. The AfD did not come "5 minutes" after your revising -- it came 100 minutes after your last edits to the article (restoring content after Morwen's unrelated-to-this-AfD-copyvio-thing and adding an MA link). Indeed, it came over 13 hours after the end of your long revision process. --<a href="../../../e/e/m/User%7EEEMeltonIV_6dc8.html" title="User:EEMeltonIV">EEMeltonIV</a> 04:50, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Heck, a five-minute difference could be explained away as an error, i.e. AfD of pre-revision.

<dd>Its been around for 30 years because the series has been around for 30 years, and that is by no means an indication of Security's notability. Beyond that, the "expendable redshirt" is not synonymous with Starfleet Security. The phenomenon is already covered within Wikipedia, invalidating the need for an article specifically dealing with this plot device. There is a profound difference between exploring the dramatic significance of Crewman #40129 and what you're trying to do here. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 04:59, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It does exist, but needs some editing to get rid of the conjecture based on facts, and rewriting to clarify that it's about a fictional group in a fictional universe. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 12:26, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but obviously not speedy keep. It's pretty darned crufty, but it's notable anyway (the subject in fairly notable in the Star Trek universe); besides, I might like to point out that I got drawn into WP through fancruft. And lastly, I'm not very impressed with the delete arguments (e.g., OR, or "it doesn't exist in the real world - as if nothing fictional can exist on WP). <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 14:34, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, it's just that I find the OR argument to be an obfuscation in this case; really, I think your reasoning is you don't think it's notable, or it's fancruft. But the OR argument being used here seems to be saying, no one with expertise in a field can add anything to an article on it, even if their arguments are sourced. Strictly speaking, anybody who adds <i>anything</i> to Wikipedia, if it's not copied word for word from a source, is using some "OR". The OR requirement is meant to say, "don't quote your own research" - not "don't write an article which you know something about". <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 15:03, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I find two things wrong with your statement. One, I admonish people above that cruft is not and never will be a deletion criteria, for if it was, Pokemon would be my very FIRST target. But more importantly, can you explain how this unsourced section here is anything but OR, by which I mean "It introduces an argument, without citing a reputable source for that argument, that purports to refute or support another idea, theory, argument, or position;":</dd>

<p>Starfleet Security has also been influenced by Section 31 over its years of existence.

And anyway my position is the following: in order to justify the inclusion of a Star Trek topic in Wikipedia, the topic must have importance or notability <i>in the wider world</i>, i.e. outside the Star Trek universe. There are many Star Trek topics, people, objects etc. that are indeed notable outside Star Trek. <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worf.html" title="Worf">Worf</a> and <a href="../../../p/i/c/Picard.html" title="Picard">Picard</a> are well-known and notable; <a href="../../../k/l/i/Klingon.html" title="Klingon">Klingons</a> or <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warp_drive.html" title="Warp drive">warp drives</a> are also notable; but there are thousands of objects, people, organisations etc. that only have in-universe importance. These should not be included in Wikipedia. The Memory Alpha is exactly the place to put all these things. And anyway see my comment on Memory Alpha below. -- <a href="../../../e/k/j/User%7EEkjon_Lok_8b74.html" title="User:Ekjon Lok">Ekjon Lok</a> 12:30, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>An important and pertinent comment</b>. After clicking the Memory Alpha link from the "External Links" section, I see that the article on "Starfleet Security" there is extremely small, a barest stub, much smaller than the Wikipedia article that is under discussion now.
