<li><s><b>Currently Neutral</b></s><b>Keep</b> May be non-notable and certainly is a stub, but I did a search and it looks like it very well could be a well-known Bollywood, at least in India (which, keep in mind, has a population 3 times that of the US). Given Wikipedia's drive to remove <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a> it's important not to delete foreign movies and such too hastily.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> 1969 movie. The IMDB is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0176134/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0176134/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The lead actor and actress are accomplished Bollywood stars.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Positively minded because it is Bollywood after all, a bit dubious because I do not know how known this film is in India. It did not google too well, but that does not mean much, because of the different alphabet. There seem to be a lot of these films called "Shart". "Shart: the Challenge" (2004) seems better known than the 1969 one.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Bollywood is a high output genre, and even given the concern about removing systemic biases, most Bollywood films should be considered to be non-notable given that high output. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 17:41, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I would accept another reasoning for deletion, but not because "Bollywood is a high output genre", given the terms of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTFILM_6ee5.html" title="WP:NOTFILM">WP:NOTFILM</a>. The notability criteria of film does not talk about output of the industry it's involved in; it only cares about whether "The film has been theatrically released nationwide in a country, or into 200 or more commercial theaters." If this film has, then it passes. If not, it fails. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 18:20, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment (negative)</b> - IMDb lists 4 Bollywood films named "Shart"<a href="http://www.imdb.com/find?s=all&amp;q=shart" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/find?s=all&amp;q=shart" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> from 1954, 1969, 1986, and 2004 ... except for the 2004 film, each has received less than 10 votes, BTW, which certainly begs the question of "notability" ... OTOH, given the size of India, it was <i>probably</i> "theatrically released nationwide in a country, or into 200 or more commercial theaters." If this article is retained, then it should list the other three films as well, like a disambiguation page. (Please, <b>do not</b> create three new pages!) See the article's <a href="../../../s/h/a/Talk%7EShart_7f43.html#More_than_one_Shart" title="Talk:Shart">discussion page</a> for the list with IMDb links. —141.156.240.102 (<a href="../../../1/4/1/User_talk%7E141.156.240.102.html" title="User talk:141.156.240.102">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_141.156.240.102_bc0e.html" title="Special:Contributions/141.156.240.102">contribs</a>) 08:15, 26 October 2006 (UTC) <small>—updated 03:41, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> In regards to the above comment; the IMDB is an English website largely focuses on English films; foreign films tend to get far less attention on it and it is not a valid way of gauging how important a particular foreign film is. Especially given how old the film is, it's not surprising that the film only got a few votes on IMDB; this has no indication as to the notability of the film. Given the size of India, with a population of a billion, it's highly likely that this film meets Wikipedia's standards. Furthermore, given, as I noted above, Wikipedia's desire to counter systemic bias I think we should act in good faith and keep the article, though it certainly could be expanded. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 18:06, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>How many? As many as are notable in India, another English-speaking nation with many Wikipedia readers. If that means 100 or 1000, so be it. There's always more room for <i>notable</i> articles. A film that's notable in India is as deserving of an article as a film notable in the U.S. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A. B.</a> 04:06, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>That presupposes that it's notable in India, which hasn't been shown. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 04:41, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>So far, it has not been established that this film is <i>notable</i> in India or anywhere else ... there are <b>four</b> movies with this name, and we don't even know what "shart" means in English. Look at the Filmography sections in articles for Bollywood actors (like <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanjay_Khan_af1b.html" title="Sanjay Khan">Sanjay Khan</a> or <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumtaz_%28actress%29.html" title="Mumtaz (actress)">Mumtaz</a>), and the links go to <i>definitions</i> of Hindi, Sanskrit, or Urdu words ... not articles on the films. Articles for <i>award winning</i> films like <i><a href="../../../k/h/i/Khilona.html" title="Khilona">Khilona</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../g/h/u/Ghulam.html" title="Ghulam">Ghulam</a></i> establish their notability, but ones like <i><a href="../../../b/a/a/Baaghi.html" title="Baaghi">Baaghi</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../g/a/r/Gardish.html" title="Gardish">Gardish</a></i> <b>should</b> be deleted per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTFILM_6ee5.html" title="WP:NOTFILM">WP:NOTFILM</a>. There are currently 536 Bollywood films in <a href="../../../i/n/d/Category%7EIndian_film_stubs_44ca.html" title="Category:Indian film stubs">Category:Indian film stubs</a>, and most of them have a <i>lot</i> more information about them than just "a 1969 film by &lt;redlink&gt; starring &lt;unknown-outside-of-India&gt;". —141.156.240.102 (<a href="../../../1/4/1/User_talk%7E141.156.240.102.html" title="User talk:141.156.240.102">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_141.156.240.102_bc0e.html" title="Special:Contributions/141.156.240.102">contribs</a>) 05:01, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
