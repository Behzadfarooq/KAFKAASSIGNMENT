<li><b>Keep</b> Sex Wax has been around since the late '60s and is quite well-known. Potential to add further info about their drumstick wax and the mysterious Mr. Zog.

<li>Another <b>obvious keep</b>. I, too, grew up near the beach and Dr. Zog's Sex Wax stickers were on every other notebook at my high school. Apparently, the stuff works. Their slogan, BTW, is "Rub some on your stick." - Lucky 6.9 17:31, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Weak <b>keep.</b> Sex Wax is to surfboard wax as Heinz is to ketchup or Scotch is to sticky tape.

<dd>Vanity and original research are not about the information itself, but about the <i>source</i> of said information. To quote <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>: "Wikipedia is not a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a>. Specific factual content is not the question. Wikipedia is a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_source.html" title="Secondary source">secondary source</a> (one that analyzes, assimilates, evaluates, interprets, and/or synthesizes primary sources) or <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a> (one that generalizes existing research or secondary sources of a specific subject under consideration)." If an individual attends a certain school and then from his own experiences writes an article, he is engaging in original research as a primary source. As for vanity, if a page is written by a person that attends a school (not neccessarily an alum, but currently enrolled), then it is no different from writing about a website one has founded or a band one has played in. If the article is well-written, informative, and objective, then this may not be an issue, but for a sub-stub like this, it is. As to why this article is vanity, I urge you to check the history of the article, specifically an addtional sentence in the original, since removed, that confirms this aspect. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 20:37, Jan 24, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Nonsense. Unless the author founded the school themselves there is no way known writing an article about it can constitute "vanity" - particilarly if there's absolutely nothing self-referential about it. Under your interpretation of policy I can't write about my local church because I attended services there as a child. Nor can I write about the university I attended, railway stations I've made use of - or in fact any other public facility I may have found myself in at any time during my existence - and <i>that</i> is plainly ridiculous. In any case I've now rewritten this article myself, using data that is easily locatable on Google - and I have never been anywhere near Broward County - so your argument is moot either way.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 22:35, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>First of all, lets keep this civil please. You asked a question and I answered it. Just because the answer does not fit your world-view does not mean you have to get nasty. Second, I am glad that unlike other people who whine about this sort of thing you actually went out and fixed the problem so that it is no longer original research or vanity. Third, you have not "won" any competion with me, as there was never a contest to begin with, just two people who care about wikipedia and have different opinions, so you should try to be less smug in your responses. Fourth, you did not read my whole response or you would see that vanity does not matter in my opinion on school articles, or church, or subway stations, if they are well-written informative articles, so you are free to write such articles on these things in my opinion (I have never, by the way insinuated that this is anything but my own interpretation of policy that you are free to disagree with). Plus, this article was self-referential in its first form, check the history. Fifth, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Wikipedia:Vanity page</a> specifically mentions high schools, so I feel you should do a little research before laying into someone like you did above. Finally, I still feel this is not encyclopedic for notability reasons and should be deleted. You are, as always free to disagree, but I hope you can muster a bit more politeness when you do. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 23:17, Jan 24, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> as a stub or sub-stub. It neds improvement, but so do a great deal of articles in the Wikipedia. I've seen a great deal of the discussion regarding the deletion of schools, and read pleanty of arguments for and against their inclusion. The most common reasons given for deletion are, "it's just a school that nobody important went to." Think about it though: In developed countries, the majority of school aged people spend more than one third of their day in their school over the course of their day. Many children see more of their teachers than their own parents in cases where parents work shift-work. In small rural communities, the local school is often a centre of a community, and in many cases the only facility large enough for a major community event. In developing countries, the school is often the glue that binds an entire community together. I think WikiPedia should ENCOURAGE the organization and catagorization of articles on individual schools. Yes, there is the possibility that this could turn the Wikipedia in each different language version into something rivaling the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_Galactica_f801.html" title="Encyclopedia Galactica">Encyclopedia Galactica</a>, but ffs people... it's digital. It's the closest thing to the <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitchhikers%27_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_4c0f.html" title="Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy">Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy</a> that isn't pure fiction. By encouraging the inclusion of schools, we encourage the use of the Wikipedia by students and staff at schools. These two groups represent a huge segment of global population that we could get interested in contributing to the Wikipedia, and furturing its future development and growth. Isn't that one of our goals here?<a href="../../../w/e/a/User%7EWeaponofmassinstruction_5523.html" title="User:Weaponofmassinstruction">Weaponofmassinstruction</a> 22:35, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>think of it like this, if your experience of wikipedia is coming along and finding a whole load of boring uninformative sub-stubs, do you think that encourages or discourages you to write a decent article about your school? I have nothing against school articles, but a school article like this does active damage. If your argument (that much life happens in schools) is true, then almost every school should have something interesting and valuable to say about it. There should have been crime, punishment, disillusionment, joy, love, hate and maybe even education going on. An article which fails to reflect these, or even one of them is misleading, unverifiable, unencyclopedic, discouraging (even of other articles about schools) and just plain wrong. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozzerati_67af.html" title="User:Mozzerati">Mozzerati</a> 07:31, 2005 Feb 1 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah_Webster_882a.html" title="Noah Webster">Noah Webster</a> tells us that "Webster changed the spelling of many words in his dictionaries in an attempt to make them more phonemic. Many of the differences between American English and other English variants evident today originated this way." Thus there could be such a thing as "Webster spelling" and thus "Webster orthography": the capital "O" could just have been a typo. I vaguely remember having read that "thru" was one of his more striking (but lasting) innovations -- but I don't trust my memory. If somebody can be bothered to describe what "Webster orthography" was, I'll vote keep; otherwise I'll vote delete. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 09:20, 2005 Jan 24 (UTC)

<li>It is not the matter whether one can describe it; it is the matter whether the term is in use or not. AFAIK not all Webster's innovations stuck.

<li>Webster is cited as the source of many spelling varients in the large dictionary I have.

<dd>I noticed you made an edit to this page in which you modified several of the stereotypes. I'm not interested in debating any of these changes, but what if I did want to dispute them? How can a user show that stereotype A should be included but stereotype B should not? That's the main problem with lists of unverifiable information. This page will quickly devolve (if it already hasn't) into insults being hurled at every ethnic group.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is most assuredly unencyclopedic as it does not even qualify as an article. The point of lists, it seems to me, is either to organize groups of articles or provide a number of short entires on subjects of a common theme that do not deserve their own articles. This list fails to do either and provides no context for its entires. Furthermore, it is hard, though not impossible, to keep this NPOV when it is just a list with no context for any of its assertions. Some of these stereotypes deserve mention somewhere in wikipedia, maybe even their own articles, but this does not seem to be the place for it. The people that claim certain users are trying to hide from unpleasant information need to learn the difference between a content arguement and a structural arguement. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 20:14, Jan 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Several of these are not sterotypes, but rather racial slurs and unexplained associations. Such as, 'Rag head(s)' under Arabs/Middle Eastern. 'Rag head(s)' isn't a sterotype, it's a racial slur. 'Wearing of turbans' is a sterotype. '"They hate us" assertions.' This is meaningless without some explanation, who hates who? Look at the Italian section. The <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guido.html" title="Guido">Guido</a> link is irrelevant in context. Should be geographically qualified. Even if these issues are cleaned up, difficult to remain NPOV at best. This will ultimately become a list of things not interesting or encyclopedic enough to warrant their own articles, and thus confusing and useless.

<li>That's a bad advise. When one party of a discussion takes an unconstructive stance (any edits, just like with RickK above, is "deletion ... can be seen as ... to promote plain censorship"), the other side looses either way: if you talk, you are drawn to an endless pointless discussion and accused of all sins. If you don't talk - you are accused of not willing to discuss the edits with the other party. You said: "I'm rather appalled by the behaviour of both parties to this edit war". If you really believe so, why don't you show by example how such discussion should be carried? Look at the article and, for example, try to remove loaded language.

<p>This is a hoax article and should be deleted. Ebbinghaus, Flum, and Thomas are authors of a well-known logic textbook. This article clearly doesn't even try to pretend to be an article about the textbook. It's possible that it's trying to explain a theorem attributed to these three mathematicians, but that seems highly unlikely given the incoherent jumble (not even an introductory sentence!) currently on the page. To me, it looks like someone took a logic text (maybe even Ebbinghaus, Flum, and Thomas) and just started writing random stuff from it. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> 13:09, Jan 24, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>A VERY tough one to Google, as not only is "Forlorn Hope" a popular title for poems, books, etc, but there's also at least TWO other bands with this name (one from Pennsylvania and one from New London, UK). So I'm going to go mostly by the article itself. Seems band vanity (bandity) and not notable. Claims to have released an EP, but Google for <i>"Forlorn Hope" wilted</i> (the title of the EP) brings no relevant results. Note the statement "The band will start performing at various concerts soon after May 2005" so they apparently have yet to play a single show. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:55, Jan 24, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Delete as non-notable or unverifiable. As noted <i>"Forlorn Hope" wilted</i> gets no relevant hits.

Bulgaria was not known as Boldavia, it wasn't part of the Ottoman Empire yet, the Protestant Reformation did not occur in the 13th century, nor did the Black Plague, cellos did not exist yet, etc. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 19:39, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>My major problem with this article is that (1) it's a dicdef, and (2) it's way POV. It would be difficult to write this article from an NPOV perspective.</p>
<p>Furthermore, note that this is the traditional meaning of "snob" (a class ascendant) and out-of-tune with the most common American usage, which means "unpleasant, arrogant privileged person" and makes no claim as to class ascendancy. <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Hilton_9740.html" title="Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a> is probably "snobby", by the Amer. def, in her behavior, but she's not a class ascendant (if anything in that regard, she's straining the ropes that hold her). <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEventHorizon_687f.html" title="User:EventHorizon">EventHorizon</a> <a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEventHorizon_f083.html" title="User talk:EventHorizon">talk</a> 20:13, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a perfectly fine article; certainly <i>way</i> more than a dictdef. If you feel that it's POV, then feel free to apply the appropriate template. Fix what is bad; don't delete what is good. The article could do with some expansion, but that's true for the majority of our 450,000 articles. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeStepanek_8612.html" title="User:GeorgeStepanek">GeorgeStepanek</a>\<sup><a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorgeStepanek_0414.html" title="User talk:GeorgeStepanek"><font color="gray">talk</font></a></sup> 20:45, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> A well-recognized category of social behavior, well explicated in structural rather than judgmental terms, and a hub of apposite linkings needs no serious defense.

An insufficiently populist POV might be the secret issue— to anyone whose idea of an NPOV definition is "unpleasant, arrogant privileged person" (!).

<li><b>Keep</b>, this is not a dicdef by any means, and it is not too POV. Yes it can most definately be improved, but it certainly should not be deleted. Certainly there should be an article on this topic , and the current article should form the basis for this rather than be deleted out of hand.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Certainly <b>not</b> a dicdef, what are people thinking, are they looking at the same article I am? Better look at the history... Looks like it was fine to me when nominated. There's no prohibition on articles <b>containing</b> a definition, the only issue is with articles that are <b>merely</b> a definition and have no obvious potential for further expansion.
