<p>Sollog is not worthy of an encyclopedia article. He is of no significance or importance. Documenting his alleged crimes in this article also violates the guidelines of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, which indicate that such titillating details should be left out when they aren't important. Also this article has major problems with WP:Verifiability. It uses Usenet posts by third parties as primary sources of information. It also uses personal web pages and blogs as sources for claims. Sollog trolled for attention here and he shouldn't be rewarded for his trolling with an article about him. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 05:15, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please note that I (Vivaldi) added this for <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_Dufour_eabd.html" title="User talk:Steve Dufour">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Steve_Dufour_9335.html" title="Special:Contributions/Steve Dufour">contribs</a>) who put up the AfD. Mr. Dufour is a new user and appeared to have some difficulty getting all the procedures worked out, namely he forgot to use the procedure for (2nd Nomination), which I corrected. Here is Mr. Dufour's reasoning (copied from AfD/Sollog):</p>
<p>I do not think this article, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sollog.html" title="Sollog">Sollog</a>, belongs on Wikipedia. The person is not at all important, he made some kind of "psychic prediction" back in 2001 and has not done anything very notable since. Most of his "fame", as much as there is, seems to come from Internet postings from him or people who claim to be him or his "followers", there is no way to sort them out. There is also lots of discrediting personal information in the article which seems to be put there out of spite and has nothing to do with his alleged "notablity". I had never heard of him until someone mentioned his article as an example of the kind of unimportant person who can get a Wikipedia article. Thank you for considering this request. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 04:57, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak delete.</b> If he were someone who hadn't been involved with Wikipedia in a freakish way, we'd be agreeing to delete his article right now. However, that alone makes him somewhat notable. <a href="../../../1/n/e/User%7E1ne.html" title="User:1ne">1ne</a> 05:52, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Never heard of that guy before, but now I'm really interested. Also keep his crimes, since psychics are fraud or delusional anyway, so its no surprise that they commit "ordinary" crimes. All seem to be very well sourced. --<a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> 06:38, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - He's been mentioned in a few newspapers. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> seems to justify this article under "<i>Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events</i>". If nothing else, he gets 32,800 google hits. I'd say he's notable enough to have an article. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Olsen_0313.html" title="User:Daniel Olsen">Daniel Olsen</a> 06:09, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable enough and verifiable. I heard of this person even before I started editing Wikipedia. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../a/u/g/August_17.html" title="August 17">08-17</a> 06:23Z</small></i></span></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Doesn't seem to be notable. Note that almost all of the sources are primary, so much of the article constitutes a synthesis from these (a.k.a., <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>). What would be left is a non-trivial couple of articles by a journalist he antagonised, and little else. I do understand that self-published sources (such as his books and website) are admissible for <i><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a></i>, but they don't count when determining <i><a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notability</a></i>. We don't seem to have multiple non-trivial independent sources to satisfy the notability criteria. And, I must note finally, this is the state of affairs after two years: things are unlikely to improve. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 06:57, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as far as I can see, the primary claims to notability are posting on usenet and being involved in some not-very-special legal troubles. Sorry, but that's just not enough in my book. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 11:29, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> What are the arguments for keeping? "He's been mentioned in a few newspapers." Yes: <i>mentioned,</i> as opposed to described, written up, profiled, etc.; and <i>a few.</i> "<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> seems to justify this article under <i>Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events</i>." Very tenuously newsworthy non-events; no renown; minimal notoriety. "If nothing else, he gets 32,800 google hits." That's where chronic, relentless self-promotion (assisted by WP and its commercial recyclers) can get the more persistent and luckier of trolls. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 13:31, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, he was "described, written up, profiled, etc" in the articles about him. It was all in one Philadelphia paper, in one writer's columns. However, he hasn't been notable enough to merit a mention in any major newspaper and no other smaller ones. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 17:32, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Philadelphia City Paper that "profiled" him, is an alternative news weekly. Its headlines read like Jerry Springer show titles. Recent stories that made <b>the front page</b> of this "paper" include the plight of hermaphrodites in Philly. Being the subject of a single tabloid article in a single town is not a measure of noteworthiness. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 20:20, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't understand how "Sollog" meets <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">WP:BIO</a> guidelines, as claimed above. This has a list of ten alternative criteria. Of these, it's very obvious that the first six, the eighth and the tenth are utterly irrelevant to "Sollog". As for the seventh -- "Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work" -- we might allow "published" to include "self-published", but there are not multiple independent reviews, let alone awards. The ninth is "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events"; there's no renown whatever and there's very minor notoriety for his trolling and misdemeanors in events (or non-events) that are barely newsworthy, and of course for his risible attempts to claim <i>after</i> very newsworthy events that he predicted them. WP:BIO does add that failure to meet any of these criteria is not reason for deletion; I do not claim that WP:BIO is a license to delete the article, but I don't see that it gives any support for retaining it. (Incidentally, for me "Sollog" fails the "I heard of it before coming to Wikipedia" test; moreover, he fails any "I heard of it outside Wikipedia even after I read of it at Wikipedia" test.) -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:36, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"More notable than..." isn't a reason to keep. <a href="../../../1/n/e/User%7E1ne.html" title="User:1ne">1ne</a> 21:27, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why not? Wikipedia standards of inclusion are decided by consensus, and one way consensus is determined is by which articles are kept and which are deleted by consensus. The GNAA was deemed worthy of inclusion by six or ten or thirty VFD discussions and thus is a reliable indicator of consensus. If something is more notable than the GNAA, then it obviously meets the Wikipedia bar of inclusion. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 14:53, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think the GNAA article is a good metric as I think it's a special case. Not a special case by design, mind: It's systematically-connected to Wikipedia closely enough that I believe the Wikipedia system operates strangely in relation to it. (As an example, the huge number of deletion nominations is an obvious abberation indicating strange currents are at work.) Because I don't think the Wikipedia system operates as expected in regards to GNAA, I throw it out from the pool of data, as a statistician would, when trying to find a best-fit line that would indicate the cutoff point for notability. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 20:50, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Fascinating stuff. He has been covered by several mainstream media outlets including Washington Post and The Guardian. I also think that because he has explicitly accused Jimbo Wales of attacking him rhetorically deleting the article may appear to be a response related to that charge - regardless of whether or not it is related. --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstanhope_1188.html" title="User:Astanhope">AStanhope</a> 18:45, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: "Covered"? Hardly. The <i>WP</i> does indeed give him three short paragraphs within a longer article. (It's a strange article, seeming to imply that Dan Rather is the summit of news/punditry.) The <i>Guardian</i> gives him just two short sentences. Both dismiss him as just one among many internet trolls. But there's no accounting for fascination. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 22:55, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article doesn't seem to follow biographical guidelines and is argumentative, failing NPOV.

<li>I'm well aware of that. Guidelines are just that, they are not rules. Editors may generally agree on a lot of things, this is a debate, a forum for opinion.

<li>Fair enough.

<li>His lifestyle is very unusual. His name is a tetragrammaton which ties in with his apparent spiritual beliefs though this seems to clash with his brushes with the law. His is a personality that I would imagine only a very small number of people in the world will have met. He is high profile and has managed to get himself noticed by newspapers and has entered into a pitched battle with at least one of them. Plus, I'm not a fan of renominating articles for deletion with a very compelling reason. Confusing unverified with unverifiable is not good enough. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox">Mallanox</a> 23:02, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
