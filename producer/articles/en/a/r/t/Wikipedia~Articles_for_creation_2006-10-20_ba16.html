Parsi 13 Gang was first known as Parsi. Made in Shiraz,Iran. In around the early 1980's by a young activist named Haj. Speking out openly about the Islamic Republic. This lead to the execution of 2 members. With the arrest of 8. The remaining members fled to Turkey or Germany. A few made their to the United States (Los Angelas). The members noticed that the Persian community in West Hollywood were being frequently harrased by black gangs(Eight-Trey Crips). On a Summer day the members reformed their grop as a gang, and instead of Parsi they renamed it Parsi 13 showing alliance to the Mexican gang Sur 13. They can be noticed by their collared shirts which have the top 3 buttons missing, almost like 1960's fashion. Their usage of Finglisi (Farsi and English) is also unique. The gang rarely makes news, mostly getting involved with street racing and selling of Hashish or Marijuana. Their top enemys are Armenian Power, AFG, and most all Chinese or Black gangs. Their top alliances with gangs are San Gabriel Valley's Varrio Cyclones 13 gang, Nazi Low Riders, Logan Heights Gang, Aryan Brotherhood,and La EME. The gang only has an estimated 200 members. Dominating Sherman Oaks.</p>

<p>The Compromise of 1850 and the Fugitive Slave Act 1850</p>
<p>Henry Clay, U.S. senator from Kentucky, was determined to find a solution. In 1820 he had resolved a fiery debate over the spread of slavery with his Missouri Compromise. Now, thirty years later, the matter surfaced again within the walls of the Capitol. But this time the stakes were higher -- nothing less than keeping the Union together.</p>
<p>There were several points at issue:</p>
<p>-The United States had recently acquired a vast territory -- the result of its war with Mexico. Should the territory allow slavery, or should it be declared free? Or maybe the inhabitants should be allowed to choose for themselves?</p>
<p>-California -- a territory that had grown tremendously with the gold rush of 1849, had recently petitioned Congress to enter the Union as a free state. Should this be allowed? Ever since the Missouri Compromise, the balance between slave states and free states had been maintained; any proposal that threatened this balance would almost certainly not win approval.</p>
<p>-There was a dispute over land: Texas claimed that its territory extended all the way to Santa Fe.</p>
<p>-Finally, there was Washington, D.C. Not only did the nation's capital allow slavery, it was home to the largest slave market in North America.</p>
<p>On January 29, 1850, the 70-year-old Clay presented a compromise. For eight months members of Congress, led by Clay, Daniel Webster, Senator from Massachusetts, and John C. Calhoun, senator from South Carolina, debated the compromise. With the help of Stephen Douglas, a young Democrat from Illinois, a series of bills that would make up the compromise were ushered through Congress.</p>
<p>According to the compromise, Texas would relinquish the land in dispute but, in compensation, be given 10 million dollars -- money it would use to pay off its debt to Mexico. Also, the territories of New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona, and Utah would be organized without mention of slavery. (The decision would be made by the territories' inhabitants later, when they applied for statehood.) Regarding Washington, the slave trade would be abolished in the District of Columbia, although slavery would still be permitted. Finally, California would be admitted as a free state. To pacify slave-state politicians, who would have objected to the imbalance created by adding another free state, the Fugitive Slave Act was passed.</p>
<p>Of all the bills that made up the Compromise of 1850, the Fugitive Slave Act was the most controversial. It required citizens to assist in the recovery of fugitive slaves. It denied a fugitive's right to a jury trial. (Cases would instead be handled by special commisioners -- commisioners who would be paid $5 if an alleged fugitive were released and $10 if he or she were sent away with the claimant.) The act called for changes in filing for a claim, making the process easier for slaveowners. Also, according to the act, there would be more federal officials responsible for enforcing the law.</p>
<p>For slaves attempting to build lives in the North, the new law was disaster. Many left their homes and fled to Canada. During the next ten years, an estimated 20,000 blacks moved to the neighboring country. For Harriet Jacobs, a fugitive living in New York, passage of the law was "the beginning of a reign of terror to the colored population." She stayed put, even after learning that slave catchers were hired to track her down. Anthony Burns, a fugitive living in Boston, was one of many who were captured and returned to slavery. Free blacks, too, were captured and sent to the South. With no legal right to plead their cases, they were completely defenseless.</p>
<p>Passage of the Fugitive Slave Act made abolitionists all the more resolved to put an end to slavery. The Underground Railroad became more active, reaching its peak between 1850 and 1860. The act also brought the subject of slavery before the nation. Many who had previously been ambivalent about slavery now took a definitive stance against the institution.</p>
<p>The Compromise of 1850 accomplished what it set out to do -- it kept the nation united -- but the solution was only temporary. Over the following decade the country's citizens became further divided over the issue of slavery. The rift would continue to grow until the nation itself divided.</p>

<p>Gaetan Jacques Paquette was born in Drummondville, Quebec, on October 30, 1955, the last of a family of six. His father, Emile Hormidas Paquette, was a house painter and his mother, Rosanne Rosa Lepage, was a home builder. When he was only six years old, the family moved to St. Joseph of Sorel. The young Gaetan went to an English school because his parents were Protestants. Rapidly, he finds out that studying is easy for him. He finishes high school as the runner-up boy and he enters the College regional Bourgchemin, Campus Sorel-Tracy. Two years later, he's accepted at the Institut biblique Beree; this is where he studies to become a minister with The Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada.</p>
<p>Gaetan J. Paquette marries Nicole Tasse in 1978, a young girl from Montreal who is only nineteen years old. They will have two sons, Alexandre Gaetan Paquette (1980) and Jeremie Emile-Simon Paquette (1988). The couple starts in their religious ministry in 1979. While working as a pastor, Gaetan continues his studies. Among other degrees, he obtains a BA in History and a MEd in Andragogy from The University of Montreal. He starts to write and he continues to study. His success can be measured by the fifty-seven honorary doctoral degrees that he receives throughout the years.</p>
<p>Paquette was the Canadian Alliance candidate in the Chambly riding in the 2000 Canadian federal election. A few months beforehand, he had officiated at the wedding of Marc Dupre and Anne-Marie Angelil.</p>
<p>In 2006, Gaetan J. Paquette was accepted as a distinguished member of Global Who's Who and Heritage Who's Who.</p>

<p>Quotes from Derek Smith "The single biggest [environmental] issue is the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forests.html" title="Forests">forests</a>. Certain kinds of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forests.html" title="Forests">forests</a>, particularly old growth forests, are home to … plantlife, <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animals.html" title="Animals">animals</a> [and] people. And, as importantly, old growth trees have the ability to suck <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_dioxide.html" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> out of the air, and that limits <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a>. The <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boreal_Forest_a76f.html" title="Boreal Forest">Boreal Forest</a> is the key here.

The pivotal issue is the protection of these forests. You can plant as many trees as you like, for them to be cut down; but taking on natural forests, like the <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rainforest.html" title="Rainforest">rainforest</a> or the <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boreal_Forest_a76f.html" title="Boreal Forest">Boreal Forest</a>, is the problem."</p>
<p>“My belief is that each one of us has an individual and collective responsibility to protect the environment, for our families, for our fellow human beings and for future generations."</p>
<p>"That responsibility must be seen in our actions and in everything we do. If the price appears high, let us understand that the cost of failure, may be unbearable.”</p>

<p>Edward Gingerich is to date the only <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amish.html" title="Amish">Amish</a> man who has ever been convicted of murder. For several months prior to the murder, Edward had shown increasingly erratic behaviour and had been comitted to two psychiatric wards and prescribed <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-psychotic.html" title="Anti-psychotic">anti-psychotic</a> medication and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-depressants.html" title="Anti-depressants">anti-depressants</a> on both occasions, which he stopped taking as soon as he was released from the hospitals. On Thursday March 18, 1993 he savagely killed his wife Katie in front of two of their three children, kicking her to her death and then effectively disembowelling her. He was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to five years in prison on may 2, 1994. He was released on March 19, 1998, at the age of 34 after serving his full sentence. Having been <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shunned.html" title="Shunned">shunned</a> by his community, Edward Gingerich moved to Harmony Haven, in Evart, Mich., a community for troubled Amish where he still resides.</p>

<p>System High Mode (also referred to simply as System High) is a mode of using an automated imformation system (AIS) that pretains to an environment that contains restricted data that is classified in a heirarchial scheme, such as Top Secret, Secret and Unclassified. System High Mode is distinguished from other modes (such as Multilevel Security) by its lack of trust of the host AIS system to separate classifications. As a result, all information in a System High AIS is treated as if it were classified at the highest security level of any data in the AIS. For example, Unclassified information can exist in a Secret System High computer but it must be treated as Secret, therefore it cannot be be declassified (unless by reliable human review, which itself is risky because of lack of onmiscient humans.) There is no known technology to securely declassify system high information by automated means because no reliable features of the data can be trusted after having been potentially corrupted by the untrusted host. When unreliable means are used (including Cross Domain Solutions and Bypass Guards) a serious risk of system exploitation via the bypass is introduced. Nevertheless, it is has been done where the resulting risk is overlooked or accepted.</p>

Starting of as a threesome, Jores du treu ( drums ), Dirty dr Dente ( guitar ) &amp; Steven smegma ( gargling ) Wanted to create the kinda music they love most: Party groovin Goregrind. With sick downtuned vomit vocals. Inspired by bands like Utopie, <a href="../../../g/u/t/Gut.html" title="Gut">Gut</a>, <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impetigo.html" title="Impetigo">Impetigo</a>, Heamorrhage, Cock and ball toreture &amp; N.C.C. They had their 1st try out in 1999, but it realy started off after they found bassplayer Micheil The Menstrual Mummie at the Fuck The Commerce fest 2001. ROMPEPROP 1st gig was a fact in Sept of that same year at the famous <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynamo.html" title="Dynamo">Dynamo</a> club, <a href="../../../e/i/n/Eindhoven.html" title="Eindhoven">Eindhoven</a>. After that show they ware able to sing a small recorddeal with DISMEMBERMENT Rec. The releas of MCD “Menstrual Stomphulk” ( feb 2002 ) was suprisingly successfull! It soldout in just 3 months! Overwhelmed with tons of mail their popularity increased tremendouslyin just one year, also because of theur crazy live appearance filled with lotsa fun &amp; joy!! One year later ( march 2003 ) they released their 1st full length on bizarre leprous ( CZ ) . This album `hellcocks Pornflakes`caused their official breake trough. Other labels wanted to release the next one. Steven Smegma couldn´t combine his job any longer with the band &amp; after having more and more health problemsbecause of that, he unfortunately had to quit the band, but not after doing the studio recordings of their 3rd cd: A split with Tu Carne ( march 2004 ) The other 3 had to hit the rehearselroom again to take over stevens vocals, because they need to be ready to hit the stage as much as possible in 2004 and beyond! It turnt out in a big success playing as a threesome and they played some big fest in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> and in <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S.A._a0be.html" title="U.S.A.">U.S.A.</a> and end is not even near!!!!

<p>This information is taken from a book, published to celebrate the new millenium in 2000. Sir Jonathan Howley submitted his poem 'if i were a bird' into a competition and became a clear winner. Once the judges read his poem he was a clear winner through and through, and accordingly was granted a place within the book. Unfortunately early last year, Jonathan passed away from an unfortunate brain tuma and never had the chance to publish any more of his work, so i have decided to write this complementary article about the man and his work. When Jonathan began his writing career, it did not start as smoothly as his poems sound to the ear, his father Timothy Howley was never exactly approving of his work, and often beat him for writing what he called 'useless toffery', which never really sailed with Jonathan, being the proud and gracious man that he was he took his work and left the home of his father. They never did speak after that day. In conclusion Jonathan had a wonderfull life but after it all, he simply passed away, unrecognised for his shere genious. Thankyou for reading.</p>

<p>Continental Air Defence Command (CONAD) is a part of the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD). CONAD can act unilaterally of Canada if Canada declines to participate. It is based in Colorado Springs and is purely American. In 1954, CONAD was given operational control over all U.S. continental air defense forces. The Commander in Chief of CONAD is "dual hatted" as he is also the Commander in Chief of NORAD. He does not have a command, but operational control of forces that are lent to him in particular missions.</p>

<p>A temple story is a diverse tale of the lives of five young college students. CT and her twin, both have been raised next to each other for most of their lives; not to mention, that they both attend the same college. it was not too long before CT's twin ran into a computer geek on campus. their passion for each other has showed others how a relationship should be. their unquenchable love towards one another was priceless. nevertheless, this happy story would end soon. CT's twin sister suffered a major car accident and her death not only provoked the missery of her parents, but it also demolished DK's(the computer genius) world. CT, whom was busy with all her Honors college work, was unaware of this fact for couple weeks. it was not until she began having trouble with some computer technicalities that she found her sister's phonebook. browsing through it, she found the only number available that might help her, DK's.</p>
<p>DK at this point was unaware of CT, for her sister has never mentioned her before. when the call was made, astonished to hear his lover's voice once again, he ran to her apartment, confused, afraid, yet with a little sense of hope. at his arrival, DK knocked on CT's door. prior knocking, he heard some voices from the inside. they were shouts of two girls, one of them CT. the other girl was her evil roomate "S". after the second knock, "S" angrily opens the door and runs out the building. it was through an opening when DK sees CT, and is astonished with her resemblance to her sister. He tells her his there for her computer problems, and immediately she invites him in. silent throughout the whole stay, DK begins to question whether if it was real. It was then when CT tells him that she called him through her sister's phonebook. Shocked, they are intervened with some series of knockings. MT, a long time friend of CT had come over to visit her and hopefully try to help her himself with her computer problems, when he sees DK he gets frustrated, for they were rivals in Gunbound. The fight for her love began at that moment. It was seconds after MT asks DK his reasons for being there, that "S" comes back into the dorm. "S" seein the love of her life (MT) gets frustrated and leaves.</p>
<p>"S" vows then to never let go of (MT), MT sticks to his promise of always loving CT, and there is DK, confused and once again in love. A temple story will be continued</p>

<p>Little Hell Gate was a waterway in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>.

<p>The east end of Little Hell Gate opened into the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell_Gate_7fc7.html" title="Hell Gate">Hell Gate</a> passage, of the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_River_6749.html" title="East River">East River</a>, opposite Lawrence Point, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queens.html" title="Queens">Queens</a>.

<p>In 1936, the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triboro_Bridge_e660.html" title="Triboro Bridge">Triboro Bridge</a> opened, allowing easy access to Ward's and Randall's Islands.

<p>Few traces of Little Hell Gate still exist.

<p>Born December 9, 1946. Armed with a degree in journalism from Temple University, Peltz had secured a job at the sports desk of the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin. However, his future wasn't in journalism. Dubbed "The Boy Wonder," the 22-year old promoted his first bout on September 30, 1969 featuring Bennie Briscoe in the main event at the Blue Horizon. Since then, Peltz has become one of boxing's most consistent promoters and is synonymous with Philadelphia boxing and, in particular, the Blue Horizon, where he promoted bouts for 32 years. The quality matches &amp; fierce rivalries he developed over the past 37 years, especially during his spectacular run at the Spectrum from 1973-1980, have forever secured his place in boxing history. Among the fighters who boxed on Peltz promoted cards include Bobby "Boogaloo" Watts, Eugene "Cyclone" Hart, Willie "The Worm" Monroe, Stanley "Kitten" Hayward, Marvin Johnson, Mike Rossman, Billy Douglas, Antonio Tarver and Hall of Famers Jeff Chandler, Matthew Saad Muhammad, George Benton and Marvelous Marvin Hagler. Peltz was honored with the James J. Walker Award for "Long and Meritorious Service to Boxing" by the Boxing Writers Association of America in 1999. Noted for his ingenuity for making great matches, Peltz follows in the great tradition of Philadelphia boxing promoter Herman Taylor. In addition to promoting, Peltz is an avid boxing historian and archivist.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-20_ba16.html" title="Edit section: Harlan Hogan">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Harlan Hogan</span></h2>
<p><b>Harlan Hogan</b> (born September 30, 1946) is a voice actor and author. He's been heard on many of the most famous TV and radio ads in broadcasting history. It was Harlan Hogan saying classic slogans like: “When you care enough to send the very best...” "Strong enough for a man..." "Kills bugs fast, kills bugs dead...” "You never get a second chance to make a first impression..." "Who says you can't have it all?..." "Good things come to those who wait...” “That little itch should be telling you something...” and the timeless, "Quaker Life, It's the cereal even Mikey likes..." chosen by Advertising Age magazine as one of the 50 greatest ads of all time.</p>
<p><br />
67.175.92.250 17:17, 19 October 2006 (UTC)== Life &amp; Career ==</p>
<p>The foundation for Harlan’s future career was laid as he worked his way through Illinois Wesleyan University as a Disc Jockey on local radio station, WIOK. After graduating with a BFA in theatre he moved to Anderson, Indiana as program director of WHUT radio. Before long, spinning records and reading news flashes lost their luster and he tried his hand at everything from computer sales at Honeywell Corporation to speech coaching for J. Walter Thompson, to advertising copywriting at Advanced Systems, Inc.</p>
<p>After years of frustration - eased somewhat by acting appearances in local Chicago-area community theatre productions - Harlan threw caution to the wind, cobbled together his resume, head shots and first voice-over demo tape and began pounding the pavement as a full-time actor.</p>
<p>Luckily, he found himself in the middle of what - he was to realize much later - was a kind of golden age of voice-over. In the 1980’s a small handful of performers did the vast majority of voice-over work and small and not-so-small fortunes were being made. Meanwhile, no celebrity actor or actress even thought of deigning to do a “lowly” voice-over.</p>
<p>Today, his voice is still in demand for documentaries,educational programs,TV and radio imaging, Movie Trailers and - of course - commercials. Culligan, Disneyworld, Energizer batteries, Rust-Oleum, Just Tires and countless others use his "legendary" voice. He’s even one of those oh-so-happy Keebler Elves. And it's Harlan telling you that; “This program was made possible by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and by viewers like you - thank you.”</p>
<p>Harlan is also a published author and in-demand speaker. His first book, "VO Tales and Techniques of a Voice-Over Actor" demystified the world of commercial voice-overs; showing readers exactly what happens during a voice-over session, how the field has changed, and how they too, might forge a career as a voice actor. Hogan shared his secrets to success and a fascinating personal story that's informative, insightful, and often hilarious.</p>
<p>Harlan’s the author of numerous educational and corporate programs as well -winning both a Silver and a Bronze medal in The New York Film Festival for; "An Almost Painless Guide to Government" a light-hearted five-video series. He’s authored three plays and his second book, "A Voice Actor’s Guide to Home Recording" - co-written with audio engineer Jeffery P. Fisher - is in it’s second printing. It's prized by VO’s and Podcasters alike for it’s direct, non-technical and humorous approach to the art of audio. Hogan &amp; Fisher also teamed up on camera, to create a DVD for Vasst Training called; "Voice-Over Success – What you must know in today’s very different VO marketplace" HArlan conducts seminars for working voice-over professionals in San Francisco, Seattle, and New York entitled; “The Long-Haul - where do we go from here?" Recent speaking engagements included the National Association of Broadcasters in Las Vegas and The International Radio Creative and Production Summit in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The extent voice-over work he has done over the past three decades amazes even Hogan. Once, in a Twilight Zone like experience, he got a ticket for speeding and the judge ordered him to watch a National Safety Council film -that he had narrated.</p>
<p>Although more often heard than seen, Harlan returns from time to time to his theatrical roots appearing as Edvard Lunt in the Chicago production of Beth Henley’s "Impossible Marriage," Cantor Robinovitz in "The Jazz Singer" and instead of being the “Voice of God” playing the man himself, in a feature-length film: "Dimension".</p>
<p>Based near Chicago, Harlan "Tele-Commutes" worldwide via his home recording studio.</p>

<p>Although there are no actual meaning of the words, but this slogan is cheered mostly to celebrate accomplishments or victory by the students of Mohammedpur Boys High School, Dhaka, Bangladesh. The origin of this slogan is not known but the students of Mohammedput Boys High School claimed to be the pioneer of using this slogan. It is also claimed that the origin of the slogan came from the Geneva camp, adjacent to the school. There are two parts of the slogan, first part is "chatti patti labading chapatti" and the second part is "dha". This slogan is usually cheered in a group setting where the person with the loudest voice (conductor) yells the first part "Chatti patti labading chapatti" and the rest of the group cheer the second part "dha". Besides celebrating victory, this slogan gives a sense or solidarity among the group members.</p>

<p>I recently was looking for help on a game or two online. Then my friend told me about this site that if you post what you need help with then people can post tips to help you and maybe some cheats. I was so surprised how much help you can get and sometimes you can't get help but most of the times you can. I was glad to get help. The site is almost 1 year old and has almost 50 members. All you have to do to become a member is choose a user name and type a password. You can have your own picture or an avatar. Thegamingchicken.com is a okay forum and you can get help and maybe you can't.</p>

<p>If many of your outbound calls end up in voice mail, how do you make voice mail pay off for you?</p>
<p>Five Tips for a Successful Voice Mail Message</p>
<pre>
  (1.) Using first and last name; 
  (2.) Sounding professional, positive and polite; 
  (3.) Stating a description of your company and how your services can benefit the listener; 
  (4.) A clear and easily understandable voice;
  (5.) Repeating name and telephone number again at the end of the message. 
</pre>

<p><b>Did you Forget Something?'</b></p>
<p><br />
A sample voice-message began like: <i>"Hello, this is Jessica with [name of her company] and we have been in</i> business for 23 years . . ." What was wrong with this message?</p>
<p>1. She did not use her last name.</p>
<p>On a first call, using your last name sends a clear message of professionalism. Some telesales people feel that using only their first name in a cold call or voice mail message sounds friendly. But . . . not using your last name diminishes the importance of your message.</p>
<p>2. ". . . we have been in business for 23 years. . ."</p>
<p>Why would the listener CARE that Jessica's company has been in business for 23 years?</p>
<p><br />
<b>Answering the "What's in it for me?" Question</b></p>
<p>What should the caller have said after stating her first (and last) name? "We specialize in [benefit, like "saving time for businesses like yours by . . . “] [description of and benefits gained by using her products] . . ."</p>
<p><i>Following is an example of a good voice mail message that answers the</i> listener's mental "What's in it for me?" question within the first 15 seconds:</p>
<p>== "Hello Mr. Jones, this is Douglas Charles with the GSS America, Chicago based IT consulting and professional services firm.</p>
<p>I'm calling today to talk to you about the various open/vacant IT positions listed on your website in the ‘Careers’ section. With our experience and expertise we can save your time and effort by providing cost effective and efficient consulting and staffing solutions. If you would like to learn more, please call me at [his telephone number]. That's [his telephone number].</p>
<p>Thank you for your time." ==</p>
<p><br />
<b>One Chance to Make a Good First Impression</b></p>
<p>The other voice mail message went like this:</p>
<p><br />
== "Hi Ann, this is Monica. I'm sorry it has taken me so long to return your call. Please call me at [her telephone number]." == You might be asking: "In addition to not using her last name, what was wrong with that message?"</p>
<p>Nothing, if I had actually called Monica. Sure, her message made me curious enough to return her call because I had been making quite a few calls last week and thought I may have forgotten who Monica was. But once I called her back, it was clear she left that message just to get her call returned. I did not know Monica and had never called her.</p>
<p>With that deceptive message, she ruined her chance to make a good first impression</p>
<p><br />
<b>Make it Easy For the Customer</b></p>
<p>Did you ever listen to a voice mail message from a sales person with a good message – good enough that you wanted to return the call? But the telephone number at the end of the message was unclear?</p>
<p><i>No Problem… We have a solution for this……</i></p>
<p>"The voice mail message should start with first and last name but also the phone number at the beginning of the message (as well as at the end). This way if the person receiving the message misses the number at the end and wants to return the call they do not have to listen to the whole message again."</p>
<p><br />
<b>Getting prospects to return your voicemails</b></p>
<p>Effective voicemails must meet certain criteria. The following is a list of points for leaving great voicemails. After you understand the criteria, create specific messages that are in-line with these points.</p>
<pre>
                           <b>Criteria for effective voicemails</b> 
</pre>
<p><b>Be short</b> – Voicemails should be no longer than 20 seconds. Less is better. It’s more effective to leave prospects wondering who you are and what you called for, than for them to delete a long-winded message.</p>
<p><b>Arouse curiosity</b> – This is the single most important piece of advice. The only goal in leaving voicemails for cold prospects is to get them to call you back. If you tell them everything, they don’t need to call you back. Spark their interest by having them think about who you are. Being vague may sometimes create interest in the prospects mind. If they are curious, they will call you back.</p>
<p><b>Be different</b> – Think of all the voicemail messages that you receive. Do they inspire you to call back? If not, leave messages that are completely different than the ones you receive. Uniqueness will grab a prospects attention and will be more likely to compel them to return your messages.</p>
<p><b>What’s in it for them?</b> – If you decide to leave additional information on your call, only state information that is a clear benefit to the customer. What benefits of your products or your services will most likely intrigue them enough to call you back?</p>
<p><b>Warm up the call</b> – Take liberty in how you warm up the call. Use whatever you may or may not know about the company. Do you know any other people at the company? Do you know what they do? Do you know their competitors? Any information you know about the company can be used in a voicemail to make you sound more familiar with the prospect and his company.</p>
<p><b>Be confident</b> – Don’t ask them to call you back, tell them to call you back. You must believe that you are doing them a favor by contacting them, not vice versa. Successful sales calls ensure parity between you and the prospect. Failed sales calls are ones in which you are the subordinate to the prospect.</p>
<p><b>Be creative</b> – Think of new and different approaches every day. Even voicemail messages that seem odd at first may be the most effective in getting prospects to call you back.</p>
<p><b>Be prepared</b> – When customers do call you back, make sure you’re able to quickly and efficiently move into your sales call. Fumbling around, asking them multiple times for their name, telling them to hold on while you bring their name up in the database, or trying to find questions you want to ask, will kill your credibility with the customer. You should be able to easily and effectively move into a sales presentation with only a pen and a blank piece of paper.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
                                <b>Some Other Valuable Points</b>
</pre>
<p><br />
<b>Plan Your Message</b>: Consider the points you want to make and jot down a few key words. Limit the points to one or two per message.</p>
<p><b>Speak Slowly:</b> The listener needs time to process information and write it down. Be sure to pause as you say your telephone number. "My number is 530 (pause) 752 (pause) 5612."</p>
<p><b>Enunciate Clearly</b>: The telephone can distort high frequency sounds such as /f/ and /s/. Pronounce word endings and do not swallow syllables. This is especially important when giving your name.</p>
<p><b>Put Vitality in Your Voice:</b> A monotone voice lacks enthusiasm. Try to stand up or smile as you leave your message (standing to increase energy). People can hear a smile over the phone, really.</p>
<p><b>Modulate Your Volume:</b> A loud voice irritates the listener. A soft voice won't always be heard, and the listener may miss vital information or nod off. Stand or sit up straight and speak directly into the receiver. Do not cradle the phone in your neck or use a speakerphone.</p>
<p><b>Modulate Your Tone:</b> Avoid sarcasm and irritation if you want your call returned. Keep an even temper and state your request.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Avoid Telephone Tag:</b> Give the listener options. Tell them when you can best be reached to prevent frustration. "I will be out most of the afternoon and will return to my office at 4pm. Tomorrow I'll be at my desk in the morning."</p>
<p><b>End with your phone number:</b> Although you have already given your phone number, say it again and let it be the last thing the listener hears. This will give time to write it down.</p>

<p>Dare To Fail - A book whose time has come</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Our books are dedicated to all the millions of people who have tried and failed in whatever they have attempted; to those who have still not achieved the things they want in life; to those who have climbed to great heights but have fallen; to the multitudes who have suffered greatly in their journey through life. In a world where material achievement is being equated to 'success', many people give up, become very disappointed, some even commit suicide when they fail to get what they want. What these people fail to know is that in the lives of all the world's greatest achievers lie a path laden with many mistakes, set backs, disappointments and failures. But these stories are seldom told. Failing is considered Taboo!</p>
<p>Now for the 1st time in the world, a book has revealed it all - DARE TO FAIL</p>
<p>For too long we have listened to success stories, now let's listen to the other side of the success story. Who then is the best person to share this inspiring message other than Mr. Billi Lim, the world's first Failure Guru and No. 1 Best-selling author.</p>
<p>Billi, currently Asia's top speaker, is a highly sought after motivational &amp; inspirational speaker whose current speaking circuit covers Malaysia, India, Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, Japan, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, and USA.</p>

<p>Shin Gi Tai Kempo means the road of the three elements kempo. Shin means sky which refers to the mental aspect of the martial art. Gi translates as ground, this refers to the technical knowledge of the kempo style. Tai is the human body of the martial artist.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Shin Gi Tai is a style evolution of Shin Gi Kempo which was developped by Soke Ceuliman. Shin Gi Kempo had been synthesised out of the Chinese Pai Gai Noon Chuan Fa, the Kosho Ryu Kempo and the Nakamura's Kempo style.</p>

<p>In Shin Gi Tai Kempo we find Goho and Juho techniques. Goho techniques are techniques in which the use of the feet and fist stand central. Juho techniques are locks, throws, sweeps, immobilizations, and pressure points.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-20_ba16.html" title="Edit section: Messermeister">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Messermeister</span></h2>
<p>Messermeister is the smallest of 3 major forged cutlery manufacturers in Solingen Germany (Wusthof Trident &amp; J.A. Henekels being the other two). The two forged lines manufactured by Messermeister (Meridian elite &amp; San Moitz elite) are known by cutlery enthusiasts and professional chefs to be among the finest single piece forged cutlery on the market, primarily due to the innovative "bolster-less" heel and the sharper 16° polished edge (vs. the standard 20° edge found on forged cutlery made by Wusthof &amp; Henckel).<br /></p>
<p><br />
<b>Manufacturing</b><br />
Messermeister does not mass-produce cutlery, which is quite different from other German companies with far broader retail distribution. Each fully forged knife is drop forged from a single billet of German Krupp Tool Steel (.55% Carbon, 15% Molybdenum &amp; Chromium + Vanadium) and every segment of the knife is finished completely by hand.<br />
<br />
The resulting knife possesses:<br />
<br />
• A handle and tang which are contoured and rounded by hand (there is no change in texture from Bolster &amp; Tang to Handle).<br />
• A bolster-less heel on Chef’s knives (also see “Innovation”) which allows the entire edge to be sharpened from tip to heel (while the upper half of the bolster is left in-tact for the important finger-guard).<br />
• A razor sharp edge created by a detailed three-step finishing process which produces a sharper (16° vs. 20°), smoother angle (these are among the sharpest kitchen knives in the world).<br />
• A smooth, polished spine (provides comfort for professionals who use their alternate hand along the spine for leverage).<br />
• A thicker, more substantial blade on every knife, along with wider Chef’s blades.<br />
<br />
<b>Innovation</b><br />
Many design concepts now used by the top cutlery manufacturers were innovations brought to the culinary industry by Messermeister. Prior to one of Messermeister’s more important innovations, every forged Chef’s Knife had a full bolster reaching from the top of the knife where the spine meets the handle, to the heel of the blade. This meant that there was a thick, awkward piece of steel where the rear of the blade met the bolster. Messermeister was the first (and is still primarily the only) company to remove the bottom half of the bolster so that Chef’s Knives could now be sharpened from tip to heel. Meanwhile, yet another product improvement through innovation was to manufacture a Chef’s Knife with a gently curved blade. Many people have used a Chef’s Knife and rocked it back and forth in order to make cutting easier. Previous to Messermeister’s design change, the blades on Chef’s Knives were straight, making Chef's Knives less functional.<br />
<br />
Messermeister is also well known for developing new products that make working in a kitchen easier. The Culinary Torch for carmelizing sugar on Creme Brule &amp; similar deserts was introduced to the gourmet industry by Messermeister. Prior to this, hardware torches were used for this purpose. Other products introduced to the gourmet industry were knife-rolls for chefs and culinary students to transport their cutlery &amp; tools, as well as edge-guards for knife blade protection.<br />
<br />
<b>Distribution</b><br />
Messermeister does not mass-produce cutlery, allowing the level of quality control to be unmatched. These knives are manufactured and finished as individual pieces, resulting in a flawless finished product.<br />
<br />
You will only find Messermeister cutlery in the very exclusive specialty retail stores (primarily stores which are independantly owned) and on select specialty websites where consumers can be educated on the quality of the products and advised on product care, product warranties and general customer service information.</p>
<p><br />
<b>History</b><br />
The Solingen-based Messermeister factory dates back to the early 1800's and through 1865 the products were only available in Europe. Messermeister Cutlery and related kitchen tools were not available in North America until 1866 when a German immigrant named August Klinkerman began to establish the brand with home cooks throughout the Western United States. Following many years of increasing business, Mr. Klinkerman returned to Germany, thus ending the availability of Messermeister products in North America.<br />
<br />
Nearly a century later in 1967, August Klinkerman’s great-grandson Bernd Dressler immigrated to the United States from Germany and accepted a prominent position with a large German cutlery company. Years later, Mr. Dressler fulfilled his dream of owning the Messermeister brand in which his great-grandfather had been responsible for building within the U.S, when he and his wife Debra acquired the company.<br />
<br />
Following the passing of Mr. Dressler in 2002, the company continues to grow under the leadership of the Dressler family and the original Messermeister factory continues to manufacture what is considered by many to be the finest single-piece forged cutlery available today.</p>
