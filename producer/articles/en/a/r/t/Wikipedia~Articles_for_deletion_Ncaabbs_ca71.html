<li>MemphisTigers.org is a part of NCAAbbs.... and it meets the criteria of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB" rel="nofollow">WP:WEB</a> as mentioned below. If you're using Alexa to justify site rank and use, please bah like a sheep because you are one. As webmaster at NCAAbbs, I could throw up an Alexa button on every page and inflate our rank in Alexa greatly. Shame on you for trusting Alexa for anything beyond the top few hundred. It's really this simple... MemphisTigers.org... which is a part of NCAAbbs that has been given the name "memphistigers.org" due to its high activity... MEETS THE CRITERIA SET FORTH <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>. If you're going to delete the page then do it, but while you're at it be fair and delete that policy since it's clearly not used as specified... and don't forget to delete a few hundred (thousand?) other wikipedia pages for similar communities. --georgia_tech_swagger</li>
<li>I happen to disagree. NCAAbbs IS a notable forum. However it would be for someone not in the U.S. Over 13,000 fans..recently received an offer for xxx,xxx. The Memphis and UAB forums are recognized in the Memphis and Birmingham newspapers, and the UAB fans were even seen on ESPN(largest sports cable network in the U.S.) holding a sign that had NCAAbbs.com on it. Please specify more of what you want, and I am sure we can provide.

<li>I think it should stay. It meets the inclusion criteria as it has been in newspapers as well as syndicated radio talk shows frequently.

<li>Keep it. It is a valuable site for trading sports and non-sports information. MySpace has a Wikipedia listing and is not marked for deletion. I feel that NCAABBS has similar-type content for the 20-45 year old sports enthusiast. The site has also been mentioned in numerous sports radio broadcasts. I thought that Wikipedia was a place to share information and not a popularity contest. Removing this entry while keeping entries of "popular" sites would be a disservice to those who use Wikipedia. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 198.202.162.100 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_198.202.162.100_96cc.html" title="Special:Contributions/198.202.162.100">contribs</a>) 20:59, 9 March 2006.</small>

<p>If you delete NCAABBS how can you justify keeping something like the Dem Underground in respect to Neutral Point Of View) is a fundamental Wikipedia principle which states that all articles must be written from a neutral point of view, representing views fairly and without bias.

<li>Deizio - I'm not sure what kind of problem you have with NCAAbbs, but to say that MemphisTigers.org, BlazerTalk.com, and NCAAbbs.com have not had an impact on the college sports world, especially in Memphis and Birmingham, then you do not need to be judging it. The point on UAB fans is that they were not only seen, but mentioned and also on the UAB radio station. Was your cousin mentioned? --Techfan</li>

<li>I have made no comment about the "impact" of anything, the only problem I have is that this topic does not meet any part of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> or any other notability criteria and is invalid for inclusion in this particular <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a>. The appearance of people holding signs in crowds or unsolicited mentions on radio shows is not noteworthy. If you are going to argue that your site has received sufficient "media coverage" to make it noteworthy you should be thinking about verifiable and in-depth coverage in major national newspapers, nationally syndicated radio and / or popular national publications such as Time Magazine. I'm unfamiliar with "the UAB radio station", can you clarify what it's sphere of influence might be? By all means keep up the banter here but without an understanding of what makes a topic suitable for inclusion on WP, and the procedure by which pages get deleted, you aren't getting anywhere. If I do have a <i>slight</i> problem with anything it's the unsightly deluge of unsigned opinions from newcomers which are endemic to AfD debates on web forums. The encouragement of forum participants who have not previously edited on Wikipedia to make submissions here has the opposite of the desired effect - there is no surer way to ensure your site sticks in the minds of many WP editors for all the wrong reasons. Please check the links for new editors I've placed on your <a href="../../../t/e/c/User_talk%7ETechfan_cdac.html" title="User talk:Techfan">user talk page</a>. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><b><font style="verdana" color="#990000">D</font><font color="#669900">e</font><font color="#990000">izio</font></b></a> 03:30, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was referring to you saying "Did you mean '...not quite enough...'?" in reference to the influence on college sports and communities of fans. Think of it this way: <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musicianforums.html" title="Musicianforums">Musicianforums</a> is ONE OF MANY homes for musicians. NCAAbbs is THE home for fans of Memphis, UAB, Cinncinnati, NIU, etc. Now why is <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musicianforums.html" title="Musicianforums">Musicianforums</a> fine, and NCAAbbs not? I think that there are many problems other than our page to be worried about. The result of many "unsigned" users are here because they saw the big notice on the NCAAbbs page when viewing the page. It HAS made an impact. It HAS been mentioned in newspapers, radio, and TV. What do you want more of? What will get it "passed through"? If you could be more specific, I am sure we can provide what you want. Techfan 03:48, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"...not quite enough..." related to the point <i>"I think that having one of the component sites selected as third best Memphis related sites is <u>quite enough</u> to meet the bar"</i> by Capitalistroadster, as I believe he may have accidentally omitted the word "not". To answer your other points, each AfD is judged on its own merits and one should resist the equation: "If topic A is ok, why not topic B?" Let <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> be your guides in this matter. I'll be happy to answer further questions on my <a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk page</a>. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><b><font style="verdana" color="#990000">D</font><font color="#669900">e</font><font color="#990000">izio</font></b></a> 04:05, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Fair enough, but you still have not answered my questions. What do you want more of? What will get it "passed through"? However, I think that it would be unfair to delete the NCAAbbs page, but let another that serves its purpose just as we do, but I would argue that NCAAbbs has made a bigger impact. Ediquette or not, I think you SHOULD compare situations to what others have considered o.k., rather than your own assumptions. Also..it DOES meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, even if you do not consider the Memphis award enough. See "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself." Techfan 04:12, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The point is: the users would like to see this on here, and questions have NOT been answered or responded to. If you are going to say "delete", then answer our questions as to what more we would need on our page, because I am sure we can provide. NCAAbbs has never had an advertisement, only word of mouth, and since 2002 we have grown to 13,000+ users and have MADE AN IMPACT on the college sports world. The users that have posted here are not new to Wikipedia, they just do not contribute or monitor pages. We don't expect to get 1,000 new users from this, but we do want it to serve as a page for newcomers and others interested in the history of NCAAbbs. Our page is fine on the terms of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. See related links for reference. Techfan 05:39, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
