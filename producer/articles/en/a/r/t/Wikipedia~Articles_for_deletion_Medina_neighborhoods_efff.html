<p>These areas described as neighborhoods in <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medina_County%2C_Ohio_f9d1.html" title="Medina County, Ohio">Medina County, Ohio</a> are nothing more than mere <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subdivision_%28land%29.html" title="Subdivision (land)">housing subdivisions</a>. Although the notability guidelines do not address places, I expect that a subdivision must display some special significance (which these do not) in order to justify an article.

<li><b>Comment</b> There is clearly a need to establish what constitutes a neighborhood. Most of the neighborhood articles that I have read do not establish notability, even those that are in my mind notable e.g. <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Italy%2C_Manhattan_064e.html" title="Little Italy, Manhattan">Little Italy, Manhattan</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/e/Noe_Valley%2C_San_Francisco%2C_California_ebfd.html" title="Noe Valley, San Francisco, California">Noe Valley, San Francisco, California</a>. It is also true that unincorporated places are clear keepers on wikipedia. These neighborhoods do not seem notable to me and it is unclear to me that they are neighborhoods at all. Nonetheless it seems that true neighborhoods would always be notable, as they are often deliniated on maps etc. I don't think that suburban gated communities or subdivisions constitute a neighborhood.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 17:41, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

As I mention on that <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_neighborhoods_in_Medina%2C_Ohio_2589.html" title="Talk:List of neighborhoods in Medina, Ohio">talk page</a>, there seems to be a precedent for lists of neighborhoods as evidenced by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_neighborhood_listings_by_city.html" title="List of neighborhood listings by city">List of neighborhood listings by city</a>. I'm undecided on the individual neighborhood articles, but perhaps information from the other articles could be merged into the list. <a href="../../../l/b/b/User%7ELbbzman_23b1.html" title="User:Lbbzman">Lbbzman</a> 17:54, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Simply based on wiki guidelines (or lack there of in respect to sub-divisions), these developments "technically" seem to merit articles. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.12.116.137.html" title="User:64.12.116.137">64.12.116.137</a> 20:05, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I think that we should err on the side of keep, not because these are notable neighborhoods but simply because neighborhoods are notable.

<ul>
<li>Why err at all? They're not neighborhoods; they're subdivisions. The subdivisions are in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montville_Township%2C_Medina_County%2C_Ohio_a076.html" title="Montville Township, Medina County, Ohio">Montville Township</a>, and the township's website <a href="http://www.montvilletwp.org/html/subdivision.html" class="external text" title="http://www.montvilletwp.org/html/subdivision.html" rel="nofollow">identifies them as such</a>.

The main city article doesn't even link to the neighborhoods article and isn't large enough to justify separate articles of relatively indistinguished neighborhoods.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: "<a href="../../../l/u/x/Luxurious.html" title="Luxurious">Luxurious</a>" was used simply because many of the homes have a value of $1+ million - But if that term is a problem I will be happy to remove it.
