<li><b>Keep</b> - there seems to be a general consensus on Wikipedia that high schools are always notable, and that middle and elementary schools are not. Any high school of any reasonable size will eventually generate mainstream press and notable alumni. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 01:24, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Actually recent trends seem to make that claim difficult to accept. Among other issues, more highschools have been closed as "no consensus, defaulting to keep" than "keep" and recently some have even been deleted. There is therefore no such general precedent. Furthermore, I am unable to find much in the way of mainstream press on the matter. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 23:15, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, although I disagree that middle and elementary schools are not always notable. Currently all towns/cities/villages/communities are automatically considered notable - even if they're just a spot in the road. It stands to reason that a city's municipal functions - such as public schools - are included. Until there is an official policy/guideline on schools (currently there is not), there's no basis for deleting this, nor is there any basis for saying "No assertations of notability" when no one knows what constitutes notability for a school here yet. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighfructosecornsyrup_c20f.html" title="User:Highfructosecornsyrup">Highfructosecornsyrup</a> 02:25, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

No policy- or guideline-based rationales for keeping have yet been presented. Finally, the "consensus" cited by most keep&#160;!votes above clearly does not exist when the AfD record is examined; a significant majority of school AfD nominations are either deleted or kept via no consensus. Actual keeps are a minority, and the "all schools are notable" argument self-evidently lacks consensus.

<li>That's why closing admins should look at the comments and not just votes. Voting Keep and just saying that you think all schools are notable isn't enough and should pretty much disqualify your vote since that isn't a reason to keep an article. That wouldn't fly on any other AFD, so why should it be allowed on school related AFD's? <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 06:04, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>That argument is made when places are put up for AfD, and no-one seems to think that it's a problem there. Anyway, I see "delete because it's a school" arguments too so I don't see "keep because it's a school" as being less valid. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 23:27, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Many of us aren't happy with the attitude towards places and in any event if someone did argue "delete because it's a school" that would be just as invalid and should be given correspondingly low weight by the closing admins. There seems to be an almost two wrongs making a right attitude towards the above comment. In any event, the closest I've seen anyone come to "delete because it's a school" are people who when pressed actually mean "this is a school, schools have no inherent notability so delete as default setting" or something like that which is more of an issue of poor phrasing and shorthand than anything else. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 23:30, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> All schools are notable to the immediate community and those attending them--my elementary school was the most lasting positive experience in my life. But this article does not assert notability,nor could it prove it. Many many other high schools, including some of perhaps equal intrinsic merits, are more fully done, and demonstrate the reason they're here. I do not think we have a procedure for <i>article on probation--improve it by this time next moth</i> but that may be what we need. In its absence, the best we can do is delete, with a suggestion that the resubmit. The school district idea is a good one, but I think the se articles are inspired by local patriotism or perhaps school projects. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 06:03, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Against my better judgement. This is an AMERICAN school.

<li>Yes, when there is consensus or little likelihood of objection. But merging a school stub into its community's article is almost certain to be controversial to those who consider all schools (or all those of a certain level) to be automatically notable, so the nominator did right to bring it here for discussion. Sadly, little of the discussion is focused on how <i>this specific topic</i> and its current stub meets or fails to meet WP policy (as compared to either side's proposed guideline which lacks consensus). Other than an unencyclopedic "two schools merged", nobody has presented either a single reason that this particular school might be notable, nor a single source showing actual coverage by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.

<li>Actually, merging is a <i>lot</i> less controversial than deletion (very few people object to merging of schools). I would recommend trying it first. If someone wants to be a <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">WP:DICK</a> about that, an AfD nom may be appropriate at that point but I would suggest not before. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 23:27, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm confused by the idea expressed in several of the above comments that there is precedent or consensus that all high schools are notable. This particular article doesn't establish the notability of the school and of the dozens or even hundreds of articles on Wikipedia considered for deletion (AFD, speedy or otherwise) every day because they don't assert the notability of their subjects, I don't see why this one (or any other article about a questionably notable school) should be kept. Anybody could make a similar plea for their pet subject. Two schools were merged - so what? This happens quite often. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 22:57, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I have always felt that this is exactly the danger in making the blanket statement that "all schools are notable." We don't allow the statement that all structures are notable, or all people are notable, or all books or all bands. Each one must prove its own notability. Why do we exempt schools from this? Now, granted, there are some categories that are granted instant notability, such as incorporated communities, regardless of size. This, however, is official policy. In the absence of official policy on schools, all we have to go on are the policies that DO exist, and one of those policies is that an article MUST assert its notability. "I think all schools are notable" is no better than "I think all people are notable." --<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 03:54, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>There is <i>no</i> such policy that states that all articles must assert their notability or they get deleted.

<dd>You seem to forget that policy is not static but dynamic, consensus driven and constantly subject to reevaluation and change. I find minor Pokemon characters inherently unnotable and would vote to delete them on that basis alone. I find schools inherently unnotable and vote to delete them as such. You can disagree, but as fas as I am concerned, schools default to delete unless they are clearly and substantially noteworthy. It is quite simply a <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_fallacy.html" title="Logical fallacy">logical fallacy</a> to argue that we somehow need to justify a decision to delete based on some reference to policy, when by the simple dictates of community-driven consensus mean that the accumulated weight of opinion one way or the other is itself sufficient. The problem, of course, is that there is no such policy regarding schools, as evidenced by the failed attempt to beat out a compromise at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>. I am happy for you to disagree with me, but don't pretend you can invalidate a large body of opinion, mine included, by demanding capricious substantiation when the very essence of the question remains a matter of outstanding debate.

<p>Keep- This article is most certainly notable. Florence High School is a wonderful school that provides excellent eduations to over one thousand students in Florence, Alabama. Anyone who has ever walked into the doors of Florence High School knows that it is a fine learning facility. It is apparent that all Florence High School students have a close rapport with one another. The percentage of Florence students who "keep it real" is astonishingly high. Florence High School is seen by its students as "extra crunk" and many graduates have been quoted as saying that they miss the days when they had the opportunity to go to Florence High School "every day of their lives." Florence High School is a top-quality high school that should be broadcasted over the internet so that the world may know of its existance.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Davis_Price_ded6.html" title="User:Andrew Davis Price">Andrew Davis Price</a> 21:20, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I haven't made up my mind on this school but there are some references I was able to find. First, note that since there are many schools witht he same name as this one it isn't easy to go through google searches (it appears that there are Florence High Schools in at least Alabama, Missisipi, Colorado, Montana, Pensylvania, Tennesee and South Dakota). The school has what seems to be exactly one student who has done anything resembling anything of note- one Jennifer Ann Taylor who was an Intel Finalist and seems very accomplished in a variety of fields(although <a href="http://www.sciserv.org/isef/results/grnd2004.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.sciserv.org/isef/results/grnd2004.asp" rel="nofollow">this</a> lists her at a different school everything else puts her here). See <a href="http://www.intel.com/education/sts/visits.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.intel.com/education/sts/visits.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.ll.mit.edu/LINEAR/winners_2005.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ll.mit.edu/LINEAR/winners_2005.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20060128/fob7.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20060128/fob7.asp" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.wef.org/LearnAboutWater/ForStudents/SJWP/2005StateWinners.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wef.org/LearnAboutWater/ForStudents/SJWP/2005StateWinners.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://www.collegeboard.com/yes/fs/winners_0506_regsemifinal.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.collegeboard.com/yes/fs/winners_0506_regsemifinal.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://www.queuenews.com/NewslettersMay06/Alabama_Education_4.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.queuenews.com/NewslettersMay06/Alabama_Education_4.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. The school has a smattering of minor awards and students with minor scholarships such as <a href="http://www.horatioalger.org/geninf/pressrel/pdf/05%20National%20Scholar%20Announcement%20Final.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.horatioalger.org/geninf/pressrel/pdf/05%20National%20Scholar%20Announcement%20Final.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> and two of the school's athletes have been all-american <a href="http://www.hindscc.edu/Athletics/Soccer/WomensSoccer/Honors.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hindscc.edu/Athletics/Soccer/WomensSoccer/Honors.aspx" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>(I think, I may be misreading that). The school also at one point had apparently one very talented teacher <a href="http://www.una.edu/foundation/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.una.edu/foundation/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. However, all media mentions of the school give us little or no information.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> Unless all high schools are automatically notable, this one is not notable. I commend the probable efffort of the students to join in editing WP, and, now they have mastered the mechanics, they should be encourage to learn about finding evidence. If Andrew DP is among them, I suggest he look for some famous alumni as a first approach. The thorough investigation by JoshuaZ is a model of diligence, and comes to about as strong a proof of non-notability as one could get. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> (<a href="../../../d/g/g/User_talk%7EDGG_49c8.html" title="User talk:DGG">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DGG_009a.html" title="Special:Contributions/DGG">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>I'd also like to say that my own view is that having "famous" alumni is not per se notable, though I recognise that some people disagree with me. Since people have to be educated somewhere, the fact that some schools produce famous people seems to me to be a random event, and thus not notable. If a school consistently produces important physicists, say, or actors, this suggests that there is something non-random and thus notable going on - perhaps the school has a special teaching process for physics, or has special skills in training aspiring actors in voice production. Something like that is notable, but just doing a job isn't. Show us how this school does something that other schools don't, and I'll gladly vote the other way. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 17:19, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
