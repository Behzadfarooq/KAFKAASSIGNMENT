<li><b>Keep</b> - I really get fed up with AfDs that don't have any facts put to them. A bit of research wouldn't go astray here, rather than "not notable" assertions without any reason whatsoever which seem to be the norm on AfDs nowadays. Despite WP:SCHOOLS not being policy, it is persuasive, and we should take note of the criteria there. A search on some newspaper databases brings up a note in the Sydney Morning Herald in March 2006 about the school celebrating its 50th anniversary on June 16 2006. A look at WP:SCHOOLS shows that schools over 50 years old, for which this is now applicable, have been declared as verifiable. Precedent for public primary schools has kept schools that are over 50 years old. Another mention from 1999 (21 July 1999, "Schools told: stop saving for a rainy day" indicates that the school was in serious financial trouble under the Carr Government's education policy which left the school at one stage with only $5000 in its bank accounts. I'm happy to look for more articles if you want, but I think there's more to this article than most people think, but no one can be bothered taking a look. Even if the article is not verifiable still, there is worth in merging the environment stuff and financial problems in the late 1990s to <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jannali%2C_New_South_Wales_f5a9.html" title="Jannali, New South Wales">Jannali, New South Wales</a> as per <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a>. So how about it? <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 07:17, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Nominator seems to be a single purpose account created to undo a whole string of failed AfDs. Nominator falsely claims that <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> requires multiple non-trivial published works, when in fact, this is one of several criteria to support retention. As such, this vote is based on 1) Nomination was created in likely bad faith by a Single Purpose Account, 2) Nomination attempts to undo the precedent under which this article was Kept, and is part of a string of nearly a dozen such second and third cracks at undoing failed efforts at deletion (and as recreation of previously deleted articles is often used as a sign of bad faith and failure to observe precedent), all the more egregious in this case, in which the original AfD failed by a consensus of 14 keeps to a mere three deletes 3) Nominator falsely claims that article fails <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> standard when criterion mention is merely one of several such criteria justifying retention, and 4) this school was founded in 1956, meeting the fifty-year criterion set by <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, which specifies that article must meet at least one of the guidelines specifications, and as such, the article meets the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> criteria. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 13:32, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's one user's proposal that has been going for only six days. How can that be relevant in any way at all? Use the proposal that people are more familiar with; and as I have already said, please do some research too. You haven't asserted why it doesn't meet those criteria anyway. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 13:12, 14 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While I would caution using the current <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> proposal in so far as it is not fully stable and it isn't clear how many editors actually endorse it I would point out that requesting that he explain why it doesn't meet the criteria is unreasonable. Since the criteria are inclusive he would need to go through each one and just say "nope not that one" which is time consuming and unproductive. If you think it does meet one of those criteria why don't you point it out?<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 14:32, 14 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have actually - see my lengthy keep above. I'm sick of "not-notable" assertions that aren't backed up - all I'm asking is that this user explain why he thinks it is not notable. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 02:10, 15 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Um, none of your stuff above meets any part of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a>. What part do you think it meets? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 03:58, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article meets all standards of WP:SCHOOLS4, a new guideline that is only slightly less valid than <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a>. As neither has been presented to Wikipedia users for review, let alone reached any form of consensus, neither are valid for any purpose in an AfD. The original <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> is still the only standard that has undergone any level of scrutiny, and must remain as the only meaningful guideline until an alternative has undergone a corresponding review and attempt at reaching consensus. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 03:52, 15 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This seems pretty clearly to be a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 03:58, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Furthermore, as I said above, it isn't at all clear to me that anyone should be following any of the proposed school guidelines. <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> has about as much backing as the original defunct proposal had when it was tossed out (and multiple editors have tried to mark it as clearly rejected). Furthermore, the new <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> proposal has been "presented" - it is in Wikipedia space and editors over at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> and at the village pump were invited over to take a look. So far, far less criticism has been lodged at that proposal. We can at least say it isn't clearly rejected unlike the previous. Trying to make <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINTs</a> rather than engage in serious discussion is unhelpful. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:14, 15 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Based on votes on actual AfDs, WP:SCHOOLS4 seems to have as much potential support as <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a>, if not more. It's an exclusivist argument that's often heard and does not stand. Basically, <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> is an equal violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> largely created by those who opposed the original <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> and now want to create a deletionist-oriented guideline under which a small fraction of 1% of all schools would qualify. It's nice to wrap up an approach in a guideline, but all [WP:SCHOOLS3]] does right now is glom together a series of unmeetable criteria with lots of verbiage so it sounds like something meaningful. <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> still offers the only proposed guideline that has endured any level of scrutiny and has been used repeatedly as justification to Keep AND to delete AND as part of multiple nominations over the past several days. If even those seeking to hide behind sockpuppets to delete articles are referencing <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> as a policy, then we have something that is reaching de facto consensus. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 04:29, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>That's your reason? That, because the nominator was a vandal, the article is still valid? The issues raised by those requesting deletion do not matter at all? WP:SK points to an article being speedily kept if the nominator is a vandal and <i>nobody disagrees with keeping the article</i>, which certainly isn't the case here. Was this vote simply a way to say something besides "keep all schools"? -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 15:40, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>No, it was my way of saying that I hate sock puppets, that the entire nomination is a violation of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Wikipedia:Sock puppetry</a> - specifically the "Voting and other shows of support" and "Avoiding scrutiny from other editors" sections - and that those who participate are implicitly condoning sock puppetry. I will not participate in a debate that is inherently corrupted at the outset by the nominator's need to hide behind a sock shield, with the ensuing automatic suspicion of double "voting", because to accept that corruption is a far more grievous affront than the destiny of any particular article. I will not lend tacit support by engaging with a vandal who has repeatedly demonstrated bad faith. Let those who want to argue inclusion/exclusion show their faces. All of that equals a keep or speedy keep as far as I am concerned. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 22:06, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Would you prefer that we close this now, I'll immediately renominate it and I'll send a note to everyone in this discussion about the new nomination? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 22:13, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>My personal belief is that all nominations by sock puppets/vandals are de facto invalid and should be immediately closed by any admin aware of the situation. Any articles deleted as a result of those types of nominations are out of process and should be restored. What happens after that is a completely different issue. But my main concern- and this should be explicit in policy (but unfortunately is not) - is that socks/vandals/anoms should not be allowed to nominate on AfD. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 22:23, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> unless someone has the energy to properly merge to a local district.

<li>My desire to see this article to develop organically over time aside, this school has a history over 50 years old and meets the current iteration of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>. I am aware that some people do not share my belief that this and similar schools are notable. <a href="../../../b/a/h/User%7EBahn_Mi_d240.html" title="User:Bahn Mi">Bahn Mi</a> 03:06, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, that's a bit better. I still don't know what the words "organic" or "organically" are doing. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 03:08, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
