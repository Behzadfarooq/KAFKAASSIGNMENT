<p>This fellow won't go away. The first AfD debate was <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Michael_Salla_f46c.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Michael Salla">here</a>. It was speedied five times subsequently. This isn't a recreation, so I'll leave it for people to judge.

<li>Yes, I understand that. To elaborate: I am worried that his reputable academic work could be used as a Trojan horse to allow for his crankish material to be given space on the site. Look at his awards and grants: he basically drops off the radar at the beginning of this decade—I'm assuming because he decided "the extraterrestrial presence" was more important than peace studies. And there's nothing particularly notable about his early work; a solid academic resume, but nothing that demands a Wiki page. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 10:16, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The books are sufficient. The publication of four notable academic books by reputable publishers is more than enough notability. How to deal with his <i>[present</i> career is admittedly a problem. I suggest editing the lede to separate the two in distinct paragraphs. When a distinguished academic makes a fool of himself, he becomes if anything more notable, because really notable folly or even sharply unconventional views will certainly attract attention. It is certainly true that " one can be "worried that his reputable academic work could be used as a Trojan horse to allow for his crankish material to be given space on the site" but deleting the bio because of that looks a little like POV-pushing; there have been many AfDs here where the opponents of some view try to convince themselves that the notable exponents of it aren't really notable .<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:37, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>What I'd be interested in is independent reviews confirming the subject's notability. Simply publishing a book through a major publisher is not a notability claim, IMO. Ditto on his alien ideas. I'm sensible to the fact that kooky ideas, by virtue of their kookiness, may garner a response. Has any reliable source talked about this man? Perhaps the original author knows of some spots? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 08:17, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>His work for East Timor is also notable as a international politics in the practical sense service. And I really cannot decide whether his conversion to what most of us would judge as lunatic fringe social science, makes him more or less notable. To me, it makes him more notable. But I agree this is by no means a hard -and-fast judgment or an obvious decision. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:14, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for digging up reviews. I still tend toward "successful, but not exceptional" academic, but can see a contrary argument. His "conversion" only makes him more notable, IMO, if third parties have deemed it so. In the first AfD, an anon mentioned that he'd lost tenure; <a href="http://www.paradigmresearchgroup.org/Press_Releases/Press_releases.html" class="external text" title="http://www.paradigmresearchgroup.org/Press_Releases/Press_releases.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which actually supports the "lunatic fringe social science," notes he "lost his status at American University," which would be a kind of perverse, minor notability claim. Perhaps the university itself released something, but I can't find it. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 14:02, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
