<li><b>Keep</b>. It's been fifty years since historians first began to regret the fact that their histories were all histories of the rich and powerful elite. Since then historians worldwide have begun the process of redressing this imbalance. If Wikipedia starts refusing to host historical biographical articles that reference reputable sources, then Wikipedia shows itself to be stuck in the 1950s. <b>It cites a reputable academic source, people!

<li><s><b>Delete</b>. Verifiability&#160;!= notability. While I'm sure it's regretful that we don't have much information on the lives of common people in the past, one's existence and/or the ability to prove that does not qualify one for inclusion in an encyclopedia. I think I've suggested a wiki for people before, a long long time ago, and this is an excellent example of what would be a perfectly decent article there. But an encyclopedia?

<li>I think the article should be <b>kept</b> now. Ambi's point that "Some guy wrote about him a hundred years later, so he's worth writing about!" isn't really convincing. What <i>is</i> convincing is the article's new assertion of notability. After all, there has to be <i>a reason</i> why the biographer wrote about him, and that reason is usually proof of notability.

<li>I disagree. The fact that, more than a hundred years after his death, someone completely unrelated felt that his contribution was important enough to research enough to write about in a book would suggest to me that yes, there has been a recognised contribution to the historical record.

<li><b>Comment</b> The subject of this vote (i.e. an article about the individual John Warren) seems to be getting confused with the subject of "ex-convicts becoming schoolteachers in Australia". The latter may well be notable enough for an article, and it is this subject that the quoted source relates to. Nobody has written a book on John Warren, rather he appears in a book on the subject of ex-convict schoolteachers. Creating an article for each person mentioned in a book on a notable subject seems to be stretching the notabilty test. With regard to the notability test of <i>"Has the person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in the specific field?"</i>, in what way is John Warren's contribution widely recognized (as opposed to the contribution made by the ex-convict schoolteachers as a whole)? <a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigerShark_1e1f.html" title="User:TigerShark">TigerShark</a> 12:22, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why can't I say that John Warren made a widely recognised contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in the specific field of "ex-convict school-teachers of Western Australia"? On what grounds do you discount "ex-convict school-teachers of Western Australia" as a valid field in which a person might make a widely recognised contribution that is part of the enduring historical record?

<li>You can say whatever you like. I am asking <b>why</b> he should be considered to have made a <b>widely recognised</b> contribution (i.e. justify it, don't just state it).

<li>I don't think <a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigerShark_1e1f.html" title="User:TigerShark">TigerShark</a> is disputing the validity of the field, just Warren's notability within it. Until he got a bit part in a 1983 book, he seems to have been completely unremembered, in any field. How can that be construed as "widely recognised"?

<li>Okay, so the field is valid. And anybody wishing to do research in the field "ex-convict school-teachers of Western Australia" would have only 39 individuals to study, and so are hardly likely to dismiss any particular individual as not making a significant contribution to the field. I assert that 100% of people that ever have or ever will do research in the field of "ex-convict school-teachers of Western Australia" will recognise Warren as having made a significant contribution to that field. To the extent that "widely" can be used accurately in what is obviously a narrow field, I should say that 100% is wide enough.

<li>I think this is sheer sophistry, again based on cherry-picking an obscure non-notable subset of a notable group, then claiming notability for being in that subset. <i>The Brand on His Coat</i> <a href="http://www.liswa.wa.gov.au/erickson/pages/1983brand.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.liswa.wa.gov.au/erickson/pages/1983brand.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> is about "some of the 9,500 convicts transported to Western Australia between 1850 and 1868" so you're selecting a time-slot, a region and a profession, then claiming notabiity for being one of the few in that selection.

<dd>Apparent "sheer sophistry" is bound to accur when you're forced to justify the existence of an article against a criterion that you think is rubbish. I have had that blessed sentence quoted at me numerous times on this page; since it is apparently the be-all and end-all of notability, I have no option but to work within its constraints. If you don't think the "specific field" is appropriate, then I'd like to see you provide a definition of "specific field" that doesn't result in a circular definition of notability.</dd>
<dd>Meanwhile, Rica Erickson thinks that ex-convict schoolteachers in Western Australia is a sufficiently notable group to write a book chapter about them. You dispute this. On what grounds do you claim to be a better judge of the notability of a Western Australian group than the State's most respected social historian?</dd>
<dd>As for your suggestion that I solicited biased views, I think you're getting dangerously close to assuming bad faith here. In my view, the people who hang around AFD tend to be more likely to have a deletionist outlook. My stated intention was to get input from a wider range of people than the usual AFD crowd. Since the article is Australian, that is a reasonable forum in which to do so. I was very careful to state that I was looking for debate rather than support. What exactly is your objection to that?

<ul>
<li>I absolutely agree. Merging historical figures into books makes no sense. However, this article is about an individual whose only proof of notability seems to be that he is mentioned in this book. Daniel Connor, if mentioned in The Brand On His Coat, should absolutely be <i>mentioned</i> in the article about the book, though if he's notable enough to have his own article, he should have it. As for the Biographical Register of Members of Parliament of Western Australia, I'd say, knock yourself out! I'd argue only that it would conflict with the current apparent scheme of listing them nationally, and not regionally: <a href="../../../m/e/m/Members_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives%2C_1998-2001_dd91.html" title="Members of the Australian House of Representatives, 1998-2001">here's one for 1998-2001</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/m/Members_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives%2C_2001-2004_f999.html" title="Members of the Australian House of Representatives, 2001-2004">here's one</a> for 2001-2004.... Not only are they listed here, but many (if not all) of those members also have their own page. This is far more like redirecting, say, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Pirrip_338a.html" title="Philip Pirrip">Philip Pirrip</a> to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Expectations_11b3.html" title="Great Expectations">Great Expectations</a>: we wouldn't have anything to say about Pip or John Warren if it weren't for the respective books they're in. I must say I also agree with Tearlach's assessment of this being cherrypicking by calling him notable among the ex-convictts during a certain time period who became Australian schoolteachers, and with TigerShark's point that the book that is being used to show Warren's notability <i>isn't even about Warren,</i> but is simply about the group of people of which Warren was a member. On his own, without this book, he's entirely non-notable. The book still doesn't make him notable enough, but the book itself is worth discussing. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a> 23:59, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Okay, since this is a discussion and note a plain vote, what exactly makes John Warren notable? Surely you are not saying <b>everyone</b> mentioned in <b>any</b> book is notable, are you? So he must have done something that was of note. My question is, what? --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort"><font color="purple">LV</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 00:19, 16 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not really a big fan of making such sweeping statements, but in general, yes, I do think that any person who is mentioned in a reputable book is notable. If that is not sufficient for you in this case, I say again that he as one of a very small number of convicts who overcame the social stigma of convictism by obtaining a respectable place in Western Australian colonial society via a job as a school teacher. As I understand it, objections to this are based on the premise that I have only made Warren appear notable by providing a non-notable field in which to assess his contribution. As I've said <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FDaniel_Spillane&amp;diff=26586705&amp;oldid=26584444" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FDaniel_Spillane&amp;diff=26586705&amp;oldid=26584444" rel="nofollow">elsewhere</a>, you never know what fields people will want to do research in in the future, and if there is <i>any</i> field in which a person should be considered notable, then the person should be considered notable for Wikipedia purposes.

<li>I feel like we're losing focus here. I've harvested all the "pro" arguments made so far:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>"It cites a reputable academic source, people! How can it be non-notable?" (Then let's make an article about the book, eh?)</li>
<li>This article <i>isn't</i> promotional or vanity. (... which is why it wasn't speedied, but that doesn't make it notable.)</li>
<li>There aren't a lot of ex-con teachers in this particular time period. (Please please please tell me this means I get to write my JDoorjam article because there aren't a lot of quarter-German quarter-Norwegian half-Polish California-born East-Coast residents who went to school in up-state New York, and so I'm pretty sure I stand out in that field... but I digress.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Are there any other arguments? Because these don't really compel me to say this article is keep-worthy. The delete/merge arguments, meanwhile, seem rather valid: if you zoom out even a little bit, to, say, Australians in that time period, or teachers in that time period, or ex-convicts in history, this individual doesn't really seem to stand out.</p>
<p>Is this how it all breaks down at this point? It seems like an obvious delete/merge, despite the passion from the Aussie Posse here. (Sorry, it rhymed. I had to.) <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a> 02:04, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Um, your bracketed comments are coming across as ridiculing the "pro" position. If you want this to lead to a productive discussion, I suggest you re-factor. Also, the statement "it seems like an obvious delete/merge" may be your opinion, but it can hardly be considered a statement of how this discussion breaks down. We currently have 17 keep votes, 10 delete votes and 4 move/merge votes. Right now the only thing that's obvious is that there is no consensus.

<li>I apologize for taking this with some levity. With that said, are there more reasons to keep this article than those I've just listed? Again, those three don't seem very compelling. Are they compelling to you? I suppose the first one must be, as it's a quotation of a statement you made in this AfD. Clearly the second one isn't stunningly compelling either (or is that not clear?

<dd>I don't know the first thing about Samuel PÃ©rivier, David McCullough or <i>The Path Between the Seas</i>. In my view, every sailor who came to the Americas with Christopher Columbus is notable.

<dd>So every sailor that sails with Columbus deserves his own <i>encyclopedia</i> article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Needs rewording a bit but its a viable article. As someone who done quite a bit of research on British convicts in Western Australia, I know that we wouldn't know that much about the guy unless he was notable. You are lucky if you can find out anything more than their name, age, religion, crime and place of conviction. We aren't going to have a flood of these.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 04:04, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Some of the arguments for keeping seem to be rested on the idea that, for example, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Pasteur_5462.html" title="Louis Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a> has an article but The guy who lived across the street from Louis Pasteur does not, and that is some sort of "imbalance" that needs to be "redressed". Quite untrue. If a book were written about the guy we might have something, but being mentioned in a book really is not. I can pick one of any number of biographies or history books off my shelf and find hundred of people mentioned therein, does each and every one warrant an article? It seems the main argument here is "few convicts became teachers", making him something of a rarity. Well rarity is not the equivalent of encylopedicness or notability. Few common convicts become well-respected people today. When they do they do we writes on them? This seems to be an example of using a semi-random person as an example to write about an important subject (convicts in Australia). It's the subject that's important; he's just an illustration of that. Calling him a "historical figure" is a stretch. If he is, then just about everyone who lived back then was; only no one's mentioned most of them in a book (yet). If someone put their mind top it they could get as much significant information about anyone. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 04:45, 16 January 2006 (UTC)
