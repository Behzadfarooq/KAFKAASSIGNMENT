<p>The result of the debate was <b>No consensus.</b> While I seriously doubt the validity of this article, and question some of the votes, there's still no consensus after the most liberal vote-ignoring. When only taking into account users with 10+ edits from Nov. 1 to Nov. 8 or 100+ edits total, and throwing out users who provided no reason for deletion and who had virtually quit editing before this AfD, I nevertheless get 8 delete votes, and 5 keep votes. I can't make a call to delete.

<li>Like I said, it's up for debate, I'm not saying he did or didn't.

<dd>Irregardless, he's as relevant to society as say <a href="../../../m/a/d/Maddox.html" title="Maddox">Maddox</a>. (And gets more <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Ghits</a>) Should we delete his Wikipedia article? I agree that this sort of goes off on insignificant notes, such as his musical but that's the folly, in my opinion, of having to expand Wikipedia articles. The Internet is a very splintered, esoteric, and irreverent place, and part of the problem is Wikipedia's lack of guidelines for creating articles related to Internet culture. (Really, vanity articles are subjective. What's to stop someone for making a Wikipedia article about a really popular LJ article) As it is, I always think the solution is to improve an article rather than delete it. In this case, improving it might involve actually making it shorter, but I'm going on a tangents. The point is, the majority of Internet culture doesn't represent the interests of 99.999 percent of the population of the world, but unfortunately most Wikipedia editors seem to represent the .1 percent, so there's a sub-concious bias. Unfortunately, that's the problem with most encyclopedias or any attempt at an objective account of the world. (Most people probably don't care about many encyclopedia subjects) For now, I say it's easier and more constructive to improve an article, rather than delete it. 68.235.180.139 21:15, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I created this article under the premise that a biographical Salon article (for creating an entire genre) and continuous, popular work in the Flash movie scene makes notability. I stand by that. I can't say anything about his music, though, because everybody and his dog wants an article for their rock band, and those have strict guidelines. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a>) 20:36, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, that's my problem with the article for the most part. It seems his only claim to fame is animutation, and yet the article goes off on his musical diversions (which are definitely not notable on their own).

<li>That would best be discussed after (and if) the Animutation article survives deletion.

<li>No, you didn't miss it.

<li>How is his Animutation and/or Potter Puppet Pals "widely recognized"? How does his music being played eight times (over many weeks) on a show that plays 30 songs a week make him "well-known" right now?

<li><b>Comment</b> I have never registered for an account on Wikipedia... I have made a few contributions over the past couple years from various IPs, but since having no account destroys credibility I won't vote. Just reading through the comments I feel that the side for deletion is slanting search results to their benefit... for example, a more fair search comparison would be <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22neil+cicierega%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22neil+cicierega%22" rel="nofollow">"neil cicierega"</a> vs. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22George+Ouzounian%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22George+Ouzounian%22" rel="nofollow">"george ouzounian"</a> rather than a "Neil Cicierega vs. "The best page in the universe" comparison, since both have used various nicknames on the internet. On the other hand, this article is certainly at the very edge of allowable for vanity reasons. For the animutation article though, it is somewhat hard for me to imagine why a deletion vote was started on it, it is certainly notable enough to have an article, especially comparing against some of the other articles here on Wikipedia. I kind of like the idea of merging articles, and leaving a redirect to Animutation on the Neil Cicierega page. --<a href="../../../1/2/8/User%7E128.187.0.165.html" title="User:128.187.0.165">128.187.0.165 (This is a massively shared IP, please don't flame me for other people trolling off it)</a> 21:26, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah, the comparison was lame, that's why I used Alexa to compare "the best page in the universe" against his "potter puppet pals" page. The latter doesn't even meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, while the former does. One of my other replies (in this AfD) has details on the results. --Locke Cole 22:38, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>And besides, the onus shouldn't be on me to prove he's not notable, the onus should be on others to prove he <b>is</b> notable. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and all that. --Locke Cole 22:45, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was trying to prove notability by stating that he receives a comparable number of entries on google to maddox on a comparable google search. On a side note, are Alexa ratings really good indicators of anything? Doesn't it only rank people who go through sites with Alexa's search engine? In any case, I agree with Ssbohio below in that if this were a purely vanity article it would be split one way or the other more definitely, for example <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clockcrew.html" title="Clockcrew">Clockcrew</a>. Continuing Tgies complaint about the term "Soft Sockpuppet" above, it does seem to me to be a term that was invented for this article to discredit some people in this article; only 3 results in the wikipedia namespace show up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?ns4=1&amp;search=Soft+Sockpuppet&amp;fulltext=Search" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?ns4=1&amp;search=Soft+Sockpuppet&amp;fulltext=Search" rel="nofollow">see this</a> and none of them seem to have the exact text "Soft Sockpuppet" in them (though I don't know why this page isn't included in the results... --<a href="../../../1/2/8/User%7E128.187.0.165.html" title="User:128.187.0.165">128.187.0.165</a> 03:08, 14 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>IMO it wasn't really a comparable search though-- few people know Maddox by his real name (FWIW, Google searches on Neil's various nicknames turn up similarly low results; see my other reply(ies)). Alexa is relevant per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. As for Ssbohio, he isn't taking into account the effect sockpuppets have had on this vote. I didn't create the "Soft Sockpuppet" section, an admin did, however, if I were to guess, I'd imagine it's just a pairing of a modifier to an existing word. Much like pairing "soft" with "fabric" or "rough" with "fabric". I believe it is meant to indicate someone who could likely be a sockpuppet (or falls just outside the definition of sockpuppet). If you want the real explanation, I suggest you ask the admin on his talk page. --Locke Cole 03:27, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I was unaware of his name until I read the Wikipedia article, whch led me to the Salon.com writeup, before I came back and read the deletion discussion. On the minus side, I (subjectively) hadn't heard of him until now, and there are many better known people working in the fields of music and animation; On the plus side, now that Wikipedia has exposed me to him, I recognize him as a contributor to the evolution &amp; advancement of Internet animation. Also, there are plenty of people included in WP who seem even more obscure, though in different fields. My deciding factor was reading the comments here &amp; seeing that there is apparently an active, heartfelt difference of opinion. I feel that, were this a case of vanity, there would be a decisive, clear break in the voting, not the relative balance I'm perceiving here. I'd recommend deleting the sub-articles about his music &amp; merging them into his main article.<a href="../../../s/s/b/User%7ESsbohio_59da.html" title="User:Ssbohio">Ssbohio</a> 21:30, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Unless Neil whipped up the whole article himself, I would hardly call it a "vanity article" no matter what wikipedia's definition of one is. Neil may look at himself in the mirror and call himself a sexy, sexy beast but that is neither here nor there. You seem to be putting up a huge fight for deleting this, Mr. Cole. What did Neil ever do to you to make you hate him so much? He's a noteable internet celebrity.

<li>Neil has made a name for himself out of virtually nothing. He has potential, TALENT, and intelligence. Over the past six years, he's created an internet phonomenon and a fairly successful band. After two years of making animutations, he broadened his horizons to music, and written many entertaining songs on four albums. And still there are songs that are not on these albums that are just as clever. He's also not afraid to do things that other people didn't think of, or were afraid of doing because they thought they would be viewed in a negative way, like dying his hair blue and green, or protesting about a petty internet thief. Keep this article, and at the very least put a picture of the dude here. You owe him that much. Now, quit protesting about deleting decent people's articles and instead move to deleting Charlotte Church's article, her being nothing but a talentless slut. <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.128.182.106 (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.128.182.106_c8e2.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.128.182.106">contribs</a>) 14:47 and 14:50, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</small>

<li>Clearly he hasn't made a very big name for himself if his sites rank so low on Alexa and his name turns up so few hits on Google. I also doubt the "internet phenomenon" and "successful band" bits. Oh, and about "do[ing] things that other people didn't think of", I knew a girl in 1994 who dyed her hair blue and green. Unless he dyed his hair blue and green at the age of 8 (since he was born in 1986), I really doubt nobody thought of it before him. The "successful band" bit could be resolved if you could show (with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> how it meets the requirements of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. --Locke Cole 02:33, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but improve. Nix the discography move ppp up, elaborate on animutation since it's his most notable accomplishment. The music part should be more of a footnote in the general bio info section and a link in the links section. Although I admire and love his music he isn't that well know for it yet, perhaps in the future the section can be readded but for now there isn't much need. --<small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.191.168.209 (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.191.168.209_e4bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.191.168.209">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, but it needs to be cleaned up. Animutation and Potter Puppet Pals are clear internet memes. I think that wikipedia policy should be more resolved before articles with this sort of vanity dispute are deleted. Karmafist (the "strongest possible delete"), I'm at a loss as to why the presence of irresponsible (or uninformed?) users justifies deletion of an article over which there is legitimate controversy.

<li>You can get a guesstimate about the "trapezoid" thing by searching for trapezoid -quadrilateral -shape -isosceles and observing that half of the hits for it vanish - and the first page of google hits still has math articles, and it takes until page five for that search string to yield anything about Cicierega. I'm not sure what exactly this signifies, aside from the fact that the percentage of those 1.2 million hits that are about him are probably pretty small. <a href="../../../t/e/u/User%7ETeucer_4752.html" title="User:Teucer">teucer</a> 22:48, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Movie Magic must be a really poor magazine, I can't even find a home page for them. The only article about them said the magazine was done quarterly and had a print run of 250,000 per issue. <a href="http://www.bttf.com/index.php?/weblog/more/movie_magic_salutes_20_years_of_back_to_the_future/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bttf.com/index.php?/weblog/more/movie_magic_salutes_20_years_of_back_to_the_future/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> The Wall Street Journal article, while possible, isn't verifiable (at least by me, I'm not dishing out $50 to get access to the WSJ for purposes of verifying this).

<li><b>Comment</b>: The comments have already been separated into sockpuppet/soft sockpuppet/whatever else categories, and as long as the people voting are frequent wikipedia users I don't see how this matters at all. Posting a link of interest to a person in their blog is not illegal, last time I checked, and I see nothing sad or unfortunate about it. After reading the comments in the blog, it seems to me that he is more amused at this than asking for people to vote to keep the article. If he had posted "Please vote to keep this article" or anything to that effect I would see your point, but he didn't write the article and I seem to remember him stating in a comment that he doesn't care if the article lives or dies (correct me if I'm wrong here...) --<a href="../../../1/2/8/User%7E128.187.0.165.html" title="User:128.187.0.165">128.187.0.165</a> 18:06, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Unfortunately it would seem that some of the non-sockpuppet votes are also, in fact, sockpuppets due to this blog entry. Specifically, votes by <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillpg_d182.html" title="User:Billpg">Billpg</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/d/User%7EBodyTag_ffc4.html" title="User:BodyTag">BodyTag</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_stuart_c99c.html" title="User:The stuart">The_stuart</a> appear to have been made due to this blog entry. --<font color="blue">Locke Cole</font> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole"><font color="black">(</font><font color="blue">talk</font><font color="black">)</font></a></sup> 18:21, 16 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It seems to me that if they aren't sockpuppets that more votes would be better. I won't complain if you post on some website for people to look at this article for deletion, even if you imply that it should be deleted I wouldn't care. If the people make contributions on wikipedia, I don't see how it matters how they come to know of the AfD entry. And don't move my comments into the sockpuppets category, please, it is a direct comment on the notice you put at the top of the page (and which I have moved to the votes/comments section) and will have no effect if it is stuck at the very bottom of the votes that are ignored. --<a href="../../../1/2/8/User%7E128.187.0.165.html" title="User:128.187.0.165">128.187.0.165</a> 18:28, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>One more thing, quoted from User:Locke Cole above: "Bless you, I figured something was up... if it does lose and you renominate it before me, feel free to leave a note mentioning that it's back up for deletion on my talk page." Posting the article on wikipedia talk pages for people to vote against it is OK, but wikipedia users coming off blogs is not? --<a href="../../../1/2/8/User%7E128.187.0.165.html" title="User:128.187.0.165">128.187.0.165</a> 18:34, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
