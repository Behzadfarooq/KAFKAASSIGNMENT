<p>Danzig, in Schopenhauer's time, was not a "Polish enclave," although it was politically allied with and tied to the Polish crown.</p>
<p>In English, to say that someplace is a "Polish enclave" means first and foremost an ethnnically Polish area, which Danzig was not at the time. This would mislead English readers (this IS the English Wiki) who don't know the city's complex ethnographic and political history – which is most of them – to think that Schopenhauer either was Polish or grew up in an ethnically Polish community.</p>
<p>As a contrasting example: Kaliningrad today is a Russian enclave, or exclave, in that it is inhabited predominantly by Russians (and some other ex-Soviet people), Russian is its lingua franca, and it is de jure part of the Russian Republic.</p>
<p>The point of this article is to tell the story of Schopenhauer the person and philospher. I understand that Schopenhauer was free from the disease of nationalism, but that doesn't change the fact that ethnically he was German.</p>
<p>If readers wish to know more about Danzig/Gdansk, they can consult entries about the city and its history. One can safely assume that readers who look for an article on Schopenhauer are interested mainly in him, not his hometown.</p>
<p>I plead with our Polish friends to kindly desist from this irrational and pointless ethnocentric vandalism.</p>

<dd>And how would you call an enclave of the Polish state inhabitated primarily by Poles (of all ethnicities, Polish and German included)? Come on, Sca, you're really nitpicking now. Gdańsk was as Poliush back then as New York is American nowadays. Although the latter has incredibly low percentage of WASPs, nobody is arguing that the majority of its inhabitants are Italian Americans, Portorican Americans, Polish Americans and so on. Just like nobody is trying to break down the American population onto ethnic groups just for the sake of such a short article as this one. And, above all, this is an article on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Schopenhauer_22d8.html" title="Arthur Schopenhauer">Arthur Schopenhauer</a>, not on Complexity of Gdańsk's historical and ethnic pattern. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 22:16, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Ridiculous. What do you mean, "inhabited primarily by Poles"? Get real.</p>
<p>The history of New York is not remotely parallel with the history of the former province of Danzig-West Prussia.</p>
<p>Admit it, Halibutt, you would like the history of this area to simply be devoid of Germans. Dream on. You are a nice guy, but your head is in the ethnocentric sand.</p>

<dd>Sca, perhaps it's completely unbelievable for the Americans, but there were other societies formed in a similar way before the US were formed. Note that I'm not speaking of ethnicities, but of nationalities. Perhaps you simply started to discuss with your own view on what I might've said and not with my actual words. That's not what I expected of you.</dd>

<dd>Poland was one of such cases - you didn't have to be a Pole (ethnicity) in order to be a Pole (nationality). Danzigers were as Polish as Lithuanians of Grodno or Bambergers of Poznań, not to mention Dutch of Warsaw (Olędrzy of Saska Kępa), Scots of Pomerania or any other group of servants of The Republic. Part of my own ancestors were Poles yet were Lithuanians - and there was no contradiction in it. Just like nowadays, I can be both a Jew and a Pole. And you can be both a German and an American. Compare the articles on <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnicity.html" title="Ethnicity">ethnicity</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationality.html" title="Nationality">nationality</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizenship.html" title="Citizenship">citizenship</a> instead of accusing me of trying to make the Germans of Danzig look less German.</dd>

<dd>They were Germans, yet they were Poles by nationality, since the city they lived in was a part of Poland for ages. And their culture, traditions, or language have little to do with the political ownership of the city.

<p>Once again, Halibutt, you are missing the point. The discussion is not about the history of Poland or the history of Danzig/Gdansk. The discussion is about what the words "a Polish enclave" will mean to English readers today, in the 21st century. And as has been pointed out repeatedly, "a Polish enclave" to them will mean an ethnically Polish area, which Danzig in the time of Schopenhauer was not. For the umpteenth time: Schopenhauer was, ethnically, German. He spoke German as his native language and wrote in German ("Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung").</p>
<p>I understand the basis for your claim that Danzigers were of Polish nationality, but find it irrelevant to the basic issue outlined above. We are not talking about political history, we are talking about ethnicity.</p>
<p>I understand that there were several ethnic elements present historically in Pomerelia/West Pressia, i.e. Germans, Poles and Kushubes, and that there were some Dutch and Low German settlers in Danzig and the Vistula delta to the east of Danzig, where dikes were built to control flooding. But Danzig itself was overwhelmingly German in speech and ethnic character until the idiocy of WWII changed the region's ethnic composition forever.</p>

<dd>Politically, Danzig was not more independent in 1788 than Warsaw, Cracow or Wilno. It still had some specific privileges and was one of the richest towns of Poland, but much of its power was already limited by the reforms. And in 1791 it was directly incorporated into the Polish state, just like all other parts under the rule of king Stanislaus.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And this is the true basis of the dispute here. You are basically arguing that he was not born in Poland since Danzig was populated by Germans mostly. Poland is a geo-political term here while you prefer to use some strange ethnic-political mixture. While I find your reasoning an absurd, you might have a point here. After all why should political borders matter... when speaking of political borders?</dd>

<dd>However, if you really believe that the ethnic history of the city he was born near to is so important to this article, then feel free to expand it or create some sort of a related article on the [[ethnic and political status of the city of Danzig at the time Arthur Schopenhauer was born.

<p>No, Halibutt, I am not arguing that he was not born in Poland as it existed politically at the time. What I am arguing - and the point you still are not understanding - is that to English-speaking readers, "a Polish enclave" means ethnically Polish. If we say, "a Polish enclave surrounded by Prussia," English-speaking readers will think that Danzig was ethnically Polish, surrounded by an ethnically, so to speak, Prussian (i.e. German) area. This is incorrect.</p>
<p>In this article, we don't care about the political status of Danzig; what's relevant is its ethnicity at the time, and Schopenhauer, as the structure of his name makes obvious, was not Polish ethnically but German. To put it more simply in the context of our long discussions: Schopenhauer was not born in Gdansk, he was born in Danzig. Gdansk as we know it today came into existence only after 1945.</p>

<p>Pardon me for intruding on the world of thought, but isn't "Vorstellung" often translated as "Imagination" rather than "Representation," which to me seems awkward? I've also seen it translated as "Idea," i.e. "The World as Will and Idea," but this strikes me as simplistic.</p>

<dd>"Vorstellung" is "representation," in that it is the presence in a mind of the image of an object that is thought to be externally present. Understanding of this requires a certain amount of mental reflection. It was best explained by both <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Berkeley_e9b8.html" title="George Berkeley">George Berkeley</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schopenhauer.html" title="Schopenhauer">Schopenhauer</a>.</dd>

<dd>It is also translated as "Representation" in French, though no German-French dictionary gives "représentation" as the primary meaning of the word. Mostly, as you said, it is given the meaning "idea" but it largely depends on the context. For example, a "Vorstellung" in theatrical parlance is what we call a "représentation" (a "performance" in English) of a play. And indeed the meaning given by Schopenhauer to "Vorstellung" is far more akin to a theatrical performance of a play (the play of one's life, so to speak) than to an "Idea", which almost everyone sees as unmovable and unchanging (from Plato). In this latter case, Schopenhauer talks about "Idee" and this term refers exclusively to the Platonic sense (although modified by Schopenhauer to fit his system). Also, the meaning "idea" applied to "Vorstellung" is given in my German-French dictionary as a "gedankliches Bild", which loosely means "intellectual image". It thus means something (an image) you have built (indeed, "Bild" and "to build" quite evidently share the same roots) in your mind, not something already conceived <i>a priori</i> or otherwise received (namely, an "Idea"). In French we would then sometimes translate this meaning of "Vorstellung" as a "gedankliches Bild" as "expectation" or "understanding (the faculty of creating concepts)" depending on the context. Also, "Vorstellen" is translated as both "to present oneself" and "to imagine something (i.e. to represent something to oneself)". "Imagination" would be more correctly given by "Vorstellungkraft", loosely "the faculty of representation".</dd>
<dd>We thus see that indeed "Idea" is a simplistic and erroneous translation as it does not give the full meaning of the word (it leaves out the process that is inherent in forming a representation) and because it interferes with the platonic "Idee" of Schopenhauer (which is surely not synonymous with "Vorstellung") and that "Imagination" would be incorrect as it both overreaches the scope of the original term and add the unnecessary, derogatory alternative meaning of "fictional" (i.e. not linked to any sensory input).</dd>

<dd>Your above speculations show: You have never ever read a single line of the Schopenhauer works. And this fact makes the discussion about the article "Schopenhauer" so difficult. You are talking about something which you have no clear idea of. By the way: the translation "The World as Will and Representation" is still the closest one you can find in the English language.

<p>The post above by Hans Rosenthal is certainly an <i>ad hominem</i> argument. The question of an adequate philosophical translation into English of <i>Vorstellung</i> deserves much attention, especially when considered in relation to Schopenhauer's use of <i>Idee,</i> even if the writer of the post has "never ever [sic] read a single line of the Schopenhauer works."

<p>...not that there's anything wrong with that!</p>
<p>There really isn't very much (in English) about Schopenhauer on the web --so I hope this essay detailing what his relationship to earlier thinkers was (and wasn't) will lend a bit of clarity to any ensuing discussions.</p>
<p>The question about the translation of "Vorstellung" is fair enough; the choice of "Representation" was made by E.F.J. Payne, and has become conventional in discussing Schopenhauer's work. It is an improvement on "Idea"/"Ideal", used in earlier translations. In normal German usage (e.g., in a newspaper), one would not translate the term with such a "technical" equivalent; but then, this is philosophy, isn't it? Philosophy consists in accuracy, and a highly technical vocabulary seems to arise wherever we discuss it.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree. But why do you contribute your above lines in the way of "Unkwown"&#160;?

<dl>
<dd><i>"Daselbst also, in der Abtheilung &gt;&gt;Physik&lt;&lt; , § 293 (zweite Auflage, von 1827), handelt er vom specifischen Gewichte..." What Hegel asserts in this paragraph is: If some iron bar is magnetized at the one end of its sides, then it sinks down on this side, hence the mass on this side of the iron bar must have become "specifically more massive". Schopenhauers comment on this claim was: "Alles was auf einer Seite schwerer wird, senkt sich nach der Seite: dieser magnetisierte Stab senkt sich nach einer Seite: also ist er daselbst schwerer geworden." ("Every thing that becomes heavier on one of its sides, sinks down to this side: this magnetized bar sinks down to one side: hence it has become more massive on this very side.") And Schopenhauer continues: "Ein würdiges Analogon zu dem Schluß: &gt;&gt;Alle Gänse haben zwei Beine, Du hast zwei Beine, also bist Du eine Ganz.&lt;&lt;" (A worthy analogon would conclude: &gt;&gt;All geese have two feet, you have two feet, hence you are a goose&lt;&lt;").</i></dd>

<dd>The best solution to this problem is to make a new, separate Wikipedia article about Hegel's "questionable" fragment. If this is not advisable, then the Hegelian fragment might be included in a new article that reviews many other of Hegel's false assertions, instead of being an article solely devoted to the increasing mass of Hegel's magnet.

<dd>Sadly, no, Schopenhauer was not well-read in Theravada Buddhism. The complete list of sources on Buddhism that S. had access to was relatively small, and if you look over his collected comments on the subject, you'll see that he picked up the assumption that "Buddhism of the Burmese school", viz, Theravada, was somehow unimportant to the history of the religion. Instead, Schopenhauer makes repeated references to the Prajnaparamita Lit. (early Mahayana &amp; Madhyamaka works) --but, honestly, he had only a very vague notion of what the distinctions were between these groups. Schopenhauer's work on Hinduism has a similarly "distant" relationship to the source texts; and this is "fair enough", as Schopenhauer doesn't make any false claims to competency or knowledge of Sanskrit &amp; Pali sources. His statement about "Metemphyschosis" and ethics have actually become influential among many Hindus and Buddhists in Asia --although they had little to do with any school of either religion to begin with.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At any rate, I have never seen any indication that Schopenhauer was especially familiar with Theravada sources; he did, however, pretend to be familiar with Prajnaparamita-Madhyamaka sources.
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Pretend</i> to be familiar? If you read the last paragraph of his main work, you will see that he had a very good understanding of the Prajna-Paramita.

<dd>I would like to add that though Schopenhauer didn't read alot about Buddhism, he did have alot of knowledge on this subject compared to others at his time. The same goes for Nietzsche.

<dd>In the "Sinology" chapter of his <i>On the Will in Nature</i>, Schopenhauer listed all of the many books and articles that he had read regarding Buddhism. They include many academic works by recognized scholars. The list can be seen at <a href="http://www.payer.de/neobuddhismus/neobud0301.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.payer.de/neobuddhismus/neobud0301.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.payer.de/neobuddhismus/neobud0301.htm</a> in Section 2.4 entitled "Was konnte Schopenhauer vom Buddhismus wissen?". 66.82.9.73 18:16, 7 August 2006 (UTC)Lestrade</dd>

<p>Schopenhauer was responding to the objection that "...after our observations have finally brought us to the point where we have before our eyes, in perfect saintliness, the denial and surrender of all willing, and thus a deliverance from a world whose whole existence presented itself to us as suffering, this now appears to us as a transition into empty <i>nothingness</i>." He then explained that "...the concept of <i>nothing</i> is essentially relative, and always refers to a definite something that it negates." Most of his final paragraph is as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>But we now turn our glance from our own needy and perplexed nature to those who have overcome the world, in whom the will, having reached complete self-knowledge, has found itself again in everything, and then freely denied itself, and who then merely wait to see the last trace of the will vanish with the body that is animated by that trace. Then, instead of the restless pressure and effort; instead of the constant transition from desire to apprehension and from joy to sorrow; instead of the never-satisfied and never-dying hope that constitutes the life-dream of the man who wills, we see that peace that is higher than all reason, that ocean-like calmness of the spirit, that deep tranquility, that unshakable confidence and serenity , whose mere reflection in the countenance, as depicted by Raphael and Correggio, is a complete and certain gospel. Only knowledge remains; the will has vanished. We then look with deep and painful yearning at that state, beside which the miserable and desperate nature of our own appears in the clearest light by contrast. Yet this consideration is the only one that can permanently console us, when, on the one hand, we have recognized incurable suffering and endless misery as essential to the phenomenon of the will, to the world, and on the other see the world melt away with the abolished will, and retain before us only empty nothingness. In this way, therefore, by contemplating the life and conduct of saints, to meet with whom is of course rarely granted to us in our own experience, but who are brought to our notice by their recorded history, and, vouched for with the stamp of truth by art, we have to banish the dark impression of that nothingness which as the final goal hovers behind all virtue and holiness, and which we fear as children fear darkness. We must not even evade it, as the Indians do, by myths and meaningless words, such as reabsorption in <i>Brahman</i>, or the <i>Nirvana</i> of the Buddhists. On the contrary, we freely acknowledge that what remains after the complete abolition of the will is, for all who are still full of the will, assuredly nothing. But also conversely, to those in whom the will has turned and denied itself, this very real world of ours with all its suns and galaxies, is – nothing.</p>

<p>Lestrade: your own comment simply makes it abundantly clear that you have absolutely no level of primary-source familiarity with the Prajnaparamita and Madhyamaka traditions. Fortunately for you, <i>neither did Schopenhauer.</i> Either you read Sanskrit, or you don't. Not only are you and Schopenhauer alike in your reliance on third-hand reports of badly translated rumours about ancient Indian philosophies, you're also alike in your absurd self-confidence in your own (supposed) ability to make wild comparative judgements about them. Comparing something known to something unknown will always yield degrees of likeness. Good luck with that Sanskrit primer --and please, try to exercise a degree of restraint in drawing wild conclusions about alien fields of philosophic study that you have not dedicated the years of philological discipline required to judge.</p>

<dd>Mr. or Ms. Anonymous, perhaps you would care to enlighten us as to the correct and proper interpretation of Buddhism. This is a serious and important topic. If my characterization is incorrect, I would very much like to know <i>why it is incorrect</i> and also <i>what is the correct interpretation</i>. To imply that only Sanskrit readers can possibly know the truth is to trivialize the abilities of people who translate that language into English. Schopenhauer read the most recognized and accepted translations of Buddhism that were published during the mid-1800s. <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Deussen_a654.html" title="Paul Deussen">Paul Deussen</a>, the noted <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> scholar, was in total agreement with Schopenhauer's interpretation of Buddhism. Many objections come from people who want to interpret Buddhism as a religion that is similar to the three monotheistic religions of Judaism and its subsidiaries Christianity and Islam. This, however, was not in accordance with the Buddhism that Schopenhauer described.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELestrade_9460.html" title="User:Lestrade">Lestrade</a> 15:48, 18 March 2007 (UTC)Lestrade</dd>

<p>I am new to this, so rather than edit the article, I am posting my suggestion here. I do hope the change will be made, though. Here is the sentence that jumps out at me:</p>
<p>"Buddhist Nirvana is equivalent to the condition that Schopenhauer described as denial of the will."</p>
<p>I see the parallel, and I understand that Schopenhauer's philosophy has traditionally been described as sharing ground with Buddhism, so I agree that some comparisson is appropriate, but having just read that "denial of the will" could come about as a result of profound suffering and the loss of the will to live, I must assert that this is <i>not</i> the same thing as Buddhist Nirvana. That sounds more like major depression with sever suicide risk, something not at all conducive to reaching Nirvana.</p>
<p>Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism both describe Nirvana as <i>liberation</i>, specifically from <i>Samsara</i>, the cycle of death and re-birth. I don't think Schopenhauer was talking about liberation from Samsara. He was talking about Liberation from <i>something</i>, clearly, but not Samsara.</p>
<p>In Mahayana Buddhism, one who is liberated from Samsara continues to exist, but does not suffer and generates no karma. One in such a rare state can choose to help all sentient beings, and can eventually become a Buddha. In the Tibetan tradition which I studied, this is what happened in the case of the Śākyamuni, (the historical Buddha) and will happen 995 more times before the end of this universe, with the next Buddha, Maitreya, due to appear in about 180,000 years, or maybe it was generations.</p>
<p>So, I obviously haven't kept up my studies, but my point is that we are a <i>long</i> way from Schopenhaur's "denail of the will" now, yet all these concepts are essential to "Buddhist Nirvana."</p>
<p>Perhaps the solution is as simple as adding "Schopenhauer believed that Buddhist Nirvana is..." or "(such and such Schopenhauer writer) believed that Buddhist Nirvana is..."</p>

<dd>Greetings Lestrade, please allow me to grant that you know a great deal more about Schopenhauer than I, but in describing the relationship between denial of will and Buddhist Nirvana, equivalence is too strong a word. To put a finer point on my argumet, any independent study of <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gautama_Siddhartha_f7ab.html" title="Gautama Siddhartha">Gautama Siddhartha</a>'s teachings, no matter how duitiful, is not, in itself, Buddhism. Buddhism is a vast tradition - a religion, as practiced - even if its underlying teachings make for a satisfying non-religious philosophy. Physical reincarnation of the spirit in a new form, and Nirvana as the end of reincarnation, are fundamental beliefs of the religion. Any conception of Nirvana that lacks this element is not Buddhist Nirvana.</dd>

<dd>In my own Buddhist study and practice, I found scant acceptance within the religion of the de-mystified, scientifically inoffensive Buddhist derivates so common in the west. The view of Nirvana that permeats western thinking is just that - a western view. Schopenhauer could have understood the etymology of the word Nirvana better than <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gautama_Siddhartha_f7ab.html" title="Gautama Siddhartha">Gautama Siddhartha</a> for all I know, but that doesn't make his view align with the Buddhist religion.

<p>My discussion of the sameness of Buddhist <i>Nirvana</i> and Schopenhauerian Denial of the Will is merely based on an attempt at the elucidation of the concept of <i>Nirvana</i>, as well as of Schopenhauer's ethics. This concept of <i>Nirvana</i> has been widely contaminated by its association with the concepts of <i><a href="../../../e/n/l/Enlightenment.html" title="Enlightenment">enlightenment</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../r/e/i/Reincarnation.html" title="Reincarnation">reincarnation</a></i>. In its original purity, <i>Nirvana</i> is simply a negative concept which is the opposite of the positive concept <i><a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffering.html" title="Suffering">suffering</a></i>. In other words, it means <i>no craving</i>, and therefore <i>no suffering</i>. Buddhism, which was founded by Prince <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gautama_Siddhartha_f7ab.html" title="Gautama Siddhartha">Gautama Siddhartha</a> <a href="../../../s/a/k/Sakyamuni.html" title="Sakyamuni">Sakyamuni</a> in India around 600 B.C., resulted from his hyper-sensitive awareness of the human condition. This condition entailed old age, sickness, and death, being therefore a condition of suffering. He realized, in his <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Noble_Truths_6562.html" title="Four Noble Truths">Four Noble Truths</a>, that suffering was extinguished when attachment and desire were extinguished. This extinction or non-existence was poetically called <i>Nirvana</i>, as the blown-out flame of a candle. In the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineteenth_century.html" title="Nineteenth century">nineteenth century</a>, Schopenhauer independently came to the same realization. A comparison of the thoughts of these two men leads to a clearer understanding of each. Why is that objectionable? If you look at the Talk section of the Wikipedia article on <i><a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana.html" title="Nirvana">Nirvana</a></i>, you will see that I am struggling there also to separate <i>Nirvana</i> from <i>enlightenment</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodhi.html" title="Bodhi">bodhi</a>) and <i>reincarnation</i> (<a href="../../../k/a/r/Karma.html" title="Karma">karma</a>), which are distinctly different concepts. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELestrade_9460.html" title="User:Lestrade">Lestrade</a> 20:54, 8 September 2006 (UTC)Lestrade</p>

<dd>This is splitting hairs somewhat: take a glance at the last paragraph of the last page of the last volume of <i>World as Will and Representation</i> --and the footnote. Schopenhauer's "mature and final" works make copious use of allusions to Buddhism, and comparisons of his own conclusions to Buddhism (NB: he went back and revised <b>all</b> of his earlier works in old age --a few would say to the detriment of the text in some cases). So, in the text as we have it today, Buddhism is most definitely a palpable and obvious influence; but if you read the "unrevised" text of <i>The Fourfold Root...</i>, then, yes, there is no Buddhist influence --and if you take it on faith that early work of this kind really does represent and unchanging philosophy vs. Schopenhauer 40 years later, then, yes, you could argue, in some obtuse or abstruse sense, that the earliest stratum of Schopenhauer's work is uninfluenced by Buddhism. It would be <b>simpler and truer</b> to just point out that his use of Buddhism is fairly simplified to begin with, based on bad translations of a limited range of sources, etc. etc. --but he made as much use of Buddhism as he could (and as soon as he could). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_202.62.100.122_7bf7.html" title="Special:Contributions/202.62.100.122">202.62.100.122</a> (talk) 15:13, 18 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>"Schopenhauer's starting point was Kant's division of the universe into phenomenon and noumenon, claiming that the noumenon was the same as that in us which we call Will."</p>
<p>The latter part of this sentence is simply false. There is that in us about which we have immediate knowledge, which we call "will" (lowercase); and this will, as the sole object of self-consciousness, is wholly phenomenal and representational (Cf. The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, Ch. VII, § 41). This will we can and do know.</p>
<p>The thing-in-itself, the noumenon, however, can never be known. Therefore, if the noumenon can never be known, and the noumenon is <i><b>the same as</b></i> what we call will, about which we do have knowledge, then we both have and do not have knowledge about the will, which is abusrd.</p>
<p>The sentence corrected might read as follows: "[...] claiming that the noumenon be named Will, after the phenomenon known most immediately and distinctly, after the sole object for self-consciousness, which is the human will."</p>
<p>The following propositions seem to need further clarification, explanation, and textual justification:</p>
<p>“Will is said to be prior to being.”</p>
<p>“When Schopenhauer identifies the noumenon with the desires, needs, and impulses in us that we name "Will," what he is saying is that we participate in the reality of an otherwise unachievable world outside the mind through will.”</p>
<p>“Schopenhauer posited that humans living in the realm of objects are living in the realm of desire, and thus are eternally tormented by that desire.”</p>
<p>(How does it follow logically—as in “thus”—that living in the world of phenomena leads to eternal torment? Schopenhauer clearly states that the individual shall at some point cease to be, and this will be the end of his desire and of his suffering.)Riteofapollo 05:26, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have a book here called The Art of Literature: A Series of Essays, by Arthur Schopenhauer. I don't have all the information required to add the book to the list of works (I don't know the original-language title, it doesn't have an ISBN, and the only publication-date information I can find is in the Translator's Preface, dated February 1891) so I was wondering if someone else who knows of the book could add the relevant information. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_202.61.165.20_4549.html" title="Special:Contributions/202.61.165.20">202.61.165.20</a> (talk) 07:37, 25 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>This passage from <i>The World as Will and Representation</i> ([E.F.J. Payne trans., Volume I, Dover, 1966, p.429], see <a href="http://www.friesian.com/hegel.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.friesian.com/hegel.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) might be considered even more trenchant:</p>
<table align="center" style="border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; background-color:transparent;" class="cquote">

<td width="20" valign="top" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:35px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;padding:10px 10px;">“</td>
<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">The public had been forced to see [in Kant] that what is obscure is not always without meaning; what was senseless and without meaning at once took refuge in obscure exposition and language. Fichte was the first to grasp and make vigorous use of this privilege; Schelling at least equalled him in this, and a host of hungry scribblers without intellect or honesty soon surpassed them both. But the greatest effrontery in serving up sheer nonsense, in scrabbling together senseless and maddening webs of words, such as had previously been heard only in madhouses, finally appeared in Hegel. It became the instrument of the most ponderous and general mystification that has ever existed, with a result that will seem incredible to posterity, and be a lasting monument of German stupidity.</td>
