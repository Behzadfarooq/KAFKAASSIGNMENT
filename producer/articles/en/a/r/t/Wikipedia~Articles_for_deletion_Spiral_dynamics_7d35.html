Dear Pedant,

I've been browsing Wikipedia for some information and 
decided to take a look to see if Spiral   Dynamics was
being discussed. I was surprised to see that it was included
in your online mentions; thus, I did a little tweaking to
improve the accuracy (FYI this is a model my partner
Chris Cowan, coauthor of Spiral Dynamics, and I work
with - please see our web references below.) Thus, I
believe we are qualified to make adjustments to the definition.

The reason I am writing to you is the factual accuracy
of our competitor's bio (Don Beck) and the content of the current Spiral Dynamics definition on Wikipedia. I've copied the bio below and inserted notes
as to the questionable entries. Your site suggests that
if 5 or more items are incorrect to insert a dispute.
I have done that and the warning has been eliminated.
You will find the disputed items below under "Issues"
where I have itemized statements requiring fact checking.
In essence, yes, we have a professional interest in this,
thus disclosure applies (we are rather fierce competitors).
At the same time, I feel that the reputation of this work
can stand only on fact and accuracy, which is what I am
seeking by contacting you.

The current definition of Spiral Dynamics suffers from
some inaccuracies which I attempted to fix; it was reverted
to an earlier version. For example, there is no credible
evidence of "the Mean Green meme" under the Pathologies
section. I have reason to believe that the person making
adjustments to the current entries has some interest in
skewing this due to his/her affiliations. To make matters
more complex, and more sensitive, we are involved in a
legal dispute with our former partner, Don Beck. This
matter could get quite antagonistic if it isn't handled well,
which is why I am contacting you. Your description suggested
I could count on your discretion in a sensitive matter. 

Could you please advise as to how to proceed? 

Kind Regards,
Natasha

PS. See below ...



<b>Don Beck</b> is an American management consultant
involved in the theory known as <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiral_Dynamics_1fc9.html" title="Spiral Dynamics">Spiral Dynamics</a>.

Issues:
1) The term "integral theory" is a marketing term
designed for promotion which a number of people 
are attempting to legitimize and using Wikipedia to do so
2) Greater accuracy would be "coauthor of the book, Spiral Dynamics"
3) Spiral Dynamics is a trademark and refers to training, 
a book, and a popularization of a model of adult development (not a theory)

==Overview==

Beck has elaborated upon the work of his mentor, 
<a href="../../../c/l/a/Clare_W._Graves_c4c8.html" title="Clare W. Graves">Clare Graves</a>, to develop a
<a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimension.html" title="Dimension">multidimensional</a> <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model.html" title="Model">model</a> for
understanding the transformation of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morality.html" title="Morality">human values</a>
and <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">cultures</a>. As cofounder of the
National Values Center in <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denton%2C_Texas_f669.html" title="Denton, Texas">Denton, Texas</a>, and
<a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_executive_officer.html" title="Chief executive officer">CEO</a> of the Spiral
Dynamics Group, Inc., Beck is employing the
<a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiral_Dynamics_1fc9.html" title="Spiral Dynamics">Spiral Dynamics</a> model to effect large-scale
systems change in and among various sectors and
<a href="../../../s/o/c/Society.html" title="Society">societies</a> of the world.


Issues:
1) 95% of Spiral Dynamics is derived directly from
the work of Clare W. Graves; there is no elaboration
to it other than some conjecture and the link to
memetics - in fact, Spiral Dynamics is a popularization
and simplification of the work or Graves designed to
appeal to a broader market - it's a contraction rather
than an expansion.
2) The non-marketing definition of this model is as a
'psycho-social developmental model' -  
3) The final line has no supporting evidence other
than marketing claims, a fact check is required.

==Career ==

Beck's <a href="../../../m/a/n/Management_consulting.html" title="Management consulting">consulting career</a>
has taken him to such diverse settings as <a href="../../../1/0/_/10_Downing_Street_fec5.html" title="10 Downing Street">10 Downing Street</a>
to consult with <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair's</a> Policy Unit;
the south side of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago</a> to address
the problems faced by inner-city schools; the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Bank_2c67.html" title="World Bank">World Bank</a>
to consider the future of <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>; and
the boardrooms of major banks, energy companies, airlines,
and government agencies. Following 63 consulting trips to
<a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> between <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>,
he wrote <i>The Crucible: Forging South Africa's Future</i> (1991) with Graham Linscott.

Beck taught for twenty years at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_North_Texas_430f.html" title="University of North Texas">University of North Texas</a>.
He served as team psychologist for The South African <a href="../../../s/p/r/Springboks.html" title="Springboks">Springboks</a>,
winners of the 1995 Rugby World Cup, and associated with the
<a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Cowboys_c876.html" title="Dallas Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans_Saints_b2f5.html" title="New Orleans Saints">New Orleans  Saints</a>, the
<a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Rangers_26c0.html" title="Texas Rangers">Texas Rangers</a> (baseball), and the U.S. Olympic
Committee for Men's Track and Field. He writes a
“sports values” column for the <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Morning_News_212f.html" title="Dallas Morning News">Dallas Morning News</a>. He lives in <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denton%2C_Texas_f669.html" title="Denton, Texas">Denton, Texas</a>.

Issues:
1) The first line claims that this person has consulted
to the Blair government, this requires a fact check
2) The item with the south side of Chicago has not been verified
3) The World Bank item is being put across as consulting
to the WB - does a single 1.5 hour presentation where
he was not invited back consist of consulting?
4) Consulting to various boardrooms - there is no evidence
to support this other than claims on his website - a fact check is required
5) How can a person without a degree in psychology serve
as team psychologist?
</pre>
<pre>
(the part about consulting to the Springboks also requires a fact check)
6) Have the claims for the Dallas Cowboys, New Orleans Saints,
Texas Rangers, and US Olympic committee for Men's Track
and Field been verified - we've checked and have been unable
to confirm any of these claims.
7) The "sports values" column would be accurate with the
start and finish dates, which were some years ago and not very long lived.

<p>I think this is advertising as well, self-promotion.

<li><b>Keep</b>. That you don't like a book or a theory doesn't mean that it is non-notable. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22spiral+dynamics%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22spiral+dynamics%22" rel="nofollow">google</a> lists 30,300 hits for the exact phrase "spiral dynamics", at least the first several pages of which refer to the subject at hand.

<li><b>Keep</b>, pseudoscience is completely legit encyclopedia material, theres a wikiproject called pseudoscience. Also it is obviously a real theory, 480,000 yahoo hits is enough to prove that. The writer of this article is an expert on the subject, but it is not the writer's theory, he just writes about it. Clare Graves seemed to have came up with the theory, but she's not writing the article. Does need NPOV editing though. <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUber_nemo_c380.html" title="User:Uber nemo">Uber nemo</a> 20:06, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It would appear that the entire world of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Template%7EIntegral_theory_bab6.html" title="Template:Integral theory">Template:Integral theory</a> could use some POV policing and contextualization in order to avoid commercial promotion. Some effort should be put into finding views from outside the "Integral theory" universe to cite and then keeping vigilant over the inevitable revert wars.

<li><b>Keep</b> – no valid reasons given for deletion. Contrary PoV to an article isn't cause for removal. They should contribute to improving it, such as providing the needed references. The subject is notable and a candidate for encyclopedic coverage, even if in the current state it needs improvement. Clearly a topic with published works is not original research to Wikipedia as was charged. Nominations that <b>bold</b> the words so liberally should be encouraged to delay a bit to enable more cogent reasoning. (It's not the <i>nature</i> of a topic that renders it non-notable, it is the unpublished work of a single person or few people not widely known— not the case here) --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 11:48, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
