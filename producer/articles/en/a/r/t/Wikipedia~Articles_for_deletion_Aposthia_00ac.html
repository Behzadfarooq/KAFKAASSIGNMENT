<p>Dictionary definition, and an inaccurate one at that. Aposthia one end of a spectrum of foreskin length, and hardly a "defect".

<li><s>Keep. This could easily become an article. Mohammad was said to be born with it? Is this why muslims are circumcised? Let's try to find out. How common is it? Is it ever treated?

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: If a user thinks an article inaccurate a user is welcome to enhance it. Inaccuracy is not a basis for deletion. I certainly do not think it makes sense to redirect this page to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreskin.html" title="Foreskin">foreskin</a>. It is quite clear that <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">user:jayjg</a> is intent on using wikipedia as soapbox by censoring all information on it that contravenes his ideas about circumcision, the foreskin, or even antisemitism. He is not open to even including information that others do not share his views. Take a look at his edits for proof. He chronically complains of other users not co-operating with him, yet shows little interest in co-operating with others. For example he did not bother to explain his reasons for redirecting the page on the discussion page when he did so. His edit summaries read as arrogant, demeaning and even threatening. This is the basis of the <a href="../../../r/f/c/Rfc.html" title="Rfc">rfc</a> that has been filed against him at Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Jayjg. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirkumsize_0f89.html" title="User:Sirkumsize">Sirkumsize</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESirkumsize_bddf.html" title="User talk:Sirkumsize">talk</a> <small>â€¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sirkumsize_41f5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sirkumsize">contribs</a>).

<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>redirect</b>. "Very rare" is likely notable when extrapolated from the general population, howerver, this article is dictionary definition in scope. I would support recreation if more <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> were offered as the basis for expansion. I encourage this, since, at present, the reader needs to extract that dicdef. from the article its redirected into (or worse, mistake the word as a synonym for the article's title). Still, there's always wikitictionary, dictionary.com, etc., to draw out that sentence as pertaining to Aposthia. It stands to reason that there is more in the print literature on this condition, specifically. But if there isn't and the writings on it are limited mainly as asides, or until it is provided, it makes little sense to leave it as is, <i>in the hopes of</i>.

<dd>Thank you for that beautiful illustrate of an expanded stub, but given this, I don't understand why you want to delete an article that obviously has the ability to become encyclopedic.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Looks like a reasonable article to me. Agree with the unsigned comment two above that redirecting a condition meaning "no foreskin" to "foreskin" could quite easiy cause confusion unless it it mentioned right up in the first paragraph. I also think there is plenty of scope for expansion: Are other mammals born with this condition? Is it ever treated - perhaps with reconstructive surgery? Who are the "key people in Jewish history"? Which other notable people have had this condition? It seems from some comments above that I do not fully understand that this is used in discussions related to the relative merits of circumcision - in what way? <a href="../../../m/r/w/User%7EMrWeeble_4f64.html" title="User:MrWeeble">MrWeeble</a> 21:57, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
