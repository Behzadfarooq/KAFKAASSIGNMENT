<li><b>Keep</b> Mrs Eadie is a very prestigous Wellingtonian and well known for her work on the use of technology in schools, especially in New Zealand. She deserves to have article on Wikipedia. The school she is currently head of is also one of the most renown private schools in New Zealand. It is also one of the oldest in the country.

<li><b>Keep</b> I was the one who started this article and I am most certainly not a family member or friend!

<li><b>Comment</b> She does pass Wikipedia's notability standards as she does have published works and is a recognised professional who has conducted groundbreaking research that is widely recognised by a multitude of educational professionals in New Zealand. She has also won awards for her work. She is also academic.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> And isn't <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> quite clearly a non-exclusionary list of criteria? --<a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDomster_cf17.html" title="User:Domster">Dom</a> 19:49, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Notable enough, I'd say, within her field. The copyvios and tone can be worked on, as I've done; although, after removing all the unnecessary cruft about the things that aren't what make her notable, there doesn't seem to be all that much left. Still, better than stubs I've seen, and I think it's a fine addition. --<a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDomster_cf17.html" title="User:Domster">Dom</a> 19:49, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please explain my bad faith? You were the one who showed me towards the article in the first place, and as I've previously stated, I believe the previous AFD wasn't done correctly.

<ul>
<li>All the reasons it meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> were explained on the talk page and cited with reliable sources in the article. You feel they aren't notable sources, but others disagreed. No consensus could be reached, so that's why the article was kept. You are assuming bad faith in the admin who closed the AfD by saying his/her decision was unsound, and you are re-opening an AfD a mere <b>TWO HOURS</b> after one has closed! <i>Has gone on a national concert tour in one large country. Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media. Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style and the local scene of a city.

<li>For a start - I didn't mention bad faith, and I don't like the fact you said I did, I said that the AFD result of <i>No Concensus</i> was debatable, which it is and I'm trying to establish a firm consensus by renominating, seeing if it does establish it this time.

<li>Pars, accusing someone of bad faith means that you're saying that you think they're doing something for a reason other than wanting to improve the encyclopedia. It's a pretty serious accusation, and a tad baffling when there's no other apparent motivation.

<li>No decision was made. No decision exists that needs to be respected.

<li>There's also the issue of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. A bad-faith nomination is like nominating Bill Cosby as a non-notable performer, or George W.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> the AfD just failed...why is this being nominated again? The article was deemed worthy earlier, so why would it be deleted now when improvement work has been done to it?

<p>The whole concept for this article is flawed and violates NPOV. The title is misleading; it does not examine Iran's foreign policy (<a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_relations_of_Iran_906f.html" title="Foreign relations of Iran">Foreign relations of Iran</a> already does that). Instead, it alleges that Iran has created a religious police force in Iraq. There are no corroborating references, and all references listed are quotes from the Quran and speeches by Iranian leaders. No alternative viewpoints are presented, and there is no better content possible under this title or its previous title, "Basij" in Iraq. It also violates the no original research policy. <small><a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittleDan_7151.html" title="User:LittleDan">LittleDan</a></small><sup><a href="../../../l/i/t/User_talk%7ELittleDan_c646.html" title="User talk:LittleDan">talk</a></sup> 00:58, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It seems to be a long standing club of the left and I have found some sources. This from a review of "Free Radicals: On the Left in Postwar Melbourne" from a review in the Australian in 2003. "Turner and Gott were well-established leaders of the Left when I began my course in pure history and all of us were keen supporters of the lively student Labour Club. In this heyday of the Left, the club probably commanded some 800 members out of a total student enrolment of 8000. Ostensibly, the club was broad church -- hospitable to anyone left of centre. Many belonged also to the Student Christian Movement."

<dd><b>Delete</b> If this club is such a notable body in postwar Australian politics, the page should reflect this and not simply be a promotional page for the body. Hence controversies, and somewhat more of the wider history of the club should be on the page. This page just promotes the club today and provides no historical background. I also don't feel that a single mention in an article about a famous activist makes something noteworthy; a current google news serach finds nothing. A google web search <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22melbourne+university+labor+club%22&amp;btnmeta%3Dsearch%3Dsearch=Search+the+Web" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22melbourne+university+labor+club%22&amp;btnmeta%3Dsearch%3Dsearch=Search+the+Web" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> lists the wiki article as number two. Other hits involve other user contributed pages such as answers.com, with some having their neutrality disputed. At best it this is a dubious inclusion that probably should be brought into the Melbourne University Student Union page, at worst a conceited attempt by a group at self promotion through wiki abuse. --Petrol pyro 09:56, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The original article was about the implications of Biblical cosmology, not "actual scientific advancements". Bruno was a "natural philosopher" and not a scientist; the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a> was not developed until centuries after Bruno's gruesome execution. The <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbeiter_70b4.html" title="User:Arbeiter">original contributor</a> stated these points, but they were segregated when these paragraphs were removed to this article. The <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbeiter_70b4.html" title="User:Arbeiter">original contributor</a> also stated that Bruno championed "free speech", but never stated specifically why Bruno was executed. If you have a reference stating that Bruno was instead burned alive as an advocate of free speech, you should have added the reference instead of sweeping multiple sections under the rug. --<a href="../../../d/i/x/User%7EDixiePixie_f75b.html" title="User:DixiePixie">DixiePixie</a> 09:25, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Galileo and Copernicus were the true "natural philosophers" of the time, not Bruno. But you are right in pointing that, as I also mentioned, the text was originally related with the "Biblical cosmology" article. Your reply was important because I forgot to consider this when I wrote one phrase above (now stroked). But it doesn't change the problematic bias of the text, a bias that becomes clearer when those sections are inserted on more proper articles for them. Notice that one subsection of the text from "Biblical cosmology" was inserted in the article "<a href="../../../r/e/l/Relationship_between_religion_and_science.html" title="Relationship between religion and science">Relationship between religion and science</a>" (instead of moved here), <i>and the text immediately brought POV concerns on that page too</i> - see <a href="../../../r/e/l/Talk%7ERelationship_between_religion_and_science_e8c5.html#Case_study:_Charles_Darwin.3F" title="Talk:Relationship between religion and science">*here*</a>. Even after changes from the editors of that page to reduce the bias, the POV tag is still above that section of the article. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeinad-Z_ad6e.html" title="User:Leinad-Z">Leinad</a> ¬ <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Brazil.svg_f3e9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/0/05/Flag_of_Brazil.svg/18px-Flag_of_Brazil.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Brazil.svg_f3e9.html" /></a> <a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeinad-Z_2153.html" title="User talk:Leinad-Z">»saudações!</a> 17:52, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Who appointed you to designate the <b>true</b> "natural philosophers" of history? Who appointed you to designate "bad scholarship" as you claimed in your revert war at <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_cosmology.html" title="Biblical cosmology">Biblical cosmology</a>? These are simply your biased POV's. We would all probably agree that Bruno left little, if any, evidence of adhering to the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a> that was developed centuries after his death, but that only precludes him from being considered a "scientist" by the more modern definition. We would all probably agree that Bruno's published work was not nearly as significant as that provided by the long careers of Galileo and Copernicus, but that does not preclude him from being considered a "natural philosopher". It is worth repeating that I "never stated specifically why Bruno was executed". The more in depth references I read stated that no conclusion could be certain about the charges upon which Bruno was convicted due to a lack of primary source material from the convicting (religious) court. Regardless of the specific reason, I believe that, just like the scientific method, Bruno's pleas for freedom of speech are actually more relevant to scientific advancement than Bruno's brilliant extension of Copernican concepts. There was no need to strike through your "problems with the church" comment. His fiery demise is exactly what earned Bruno's inclusion in <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_cosmology.html" title="Biblical cosmology">Biblical cosmology</a>.

I don't need to distract readers from anything, since your conspiracy theory is completely bogus. My engagement in what you like to say was "my" "revert war", for example, was limited to a single edit. And I don’t know how you can assume that ScienceApologist decided to move your text as some kind of evil scheme to protect religion, the bible, whatever... As a <a href="../../../m/a/t/Materialist.html" title="Materialist">materialist</a>, (read his user page), I really don’t think he would be inclined to defend any sort of <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_cosmology.html" title="Biblical cosmology">biblical cosmology</a>. Also, as his name implies, he does <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apologetic.html" title="Apologetic">apologetics</a> <i>in favor of science</i>; if anything, it can be said that he devotes his time in Wikipedia to defend science against religion, precisely the opposite of what you seems to be thinking.</dd>

So, I stepped forward to supplement his post by noting that you were being more astute than GoodSamaritan seemed to assume.

Leinad-Z and <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> teamed-up to weaken <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_literalism.html" title="Biblical literalism">Biblical_literalism</a>, and then GoodSamaritan delivered the blow that completely reversed the article's meaning. A similar one-two punch tactic was also used by Leinad-Z &amp; co. to completely reverse the meaning of <a href="../../../d/e/d/Dedication_to_Pope_Paul_III_d432.html" title="Dedication to Pope Paul III">Dedication to Pope Paul III</a>. This is especially telling since a link to "Dedication to Pope Paul III" sat very uncomfortably next to Leinad-Z's nearly opposite statement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicolaus_Copernicus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72655496" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicolaus_Copernicus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72655496" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

"Both" are participating in this discussion. (Other accounts also appear to be good examples of Sock puppetry by Leinad-Z, but they have not yet surfaced in this specific discussion.) Leinad-Z &amp; co. block voted twice in this discussion page alone (early support for deletion + sockpuppet allegations). It seems that Leinad-Z wants us to believe that a "new user" came out of nowhere to agree with him in polemic issues including the account's first two edits. Following that line, after a few edits together, Leinad-Z allegedly became so impressed with yet another sockpuppet account as an "editor and a WP administrator" that Leinad-Z went <a href="../../../f/a/s/User_talk%7EFastfission_e166.html#A_problem_with_probable_sock_puppets" title="User talk:Fastfission">straight to him</a> for "advice, and maybe more direct assistance" instead of going through an established process. Leinad-Z &amp; co. also vigorously defend yet another sockpuppet account, <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a>.

<dd>Look familiar? I almost admire the subtle, rhetorical tactics Leinad-Z employed, but we should see through them and understand that such speculation can be employed without merit. Obviously, all these accounts couldn't be one person, but it made a suspicious-looking case for it anyway. That said, while preparing the mock argument above, I noticed a couple amazingly coincidental edits that were hard to swallow. Now, I'm not sure whether Leinad-Z was offering his accusations as a smoke screen or actually shifting the spotlight to hide questionable behavior. With the mock argument in mind, anybody with the time should compare GoodSamaritan's first two edits with Leinad-Z's edits of the same articles to see how one article relates to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicolaus_Copernicus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72655496" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicolaus_Copernicus&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72655496" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> by Leinad-Z. I was involved with all three places at some point. My low tolerance for questionable behavior was surpassed long ago at Wikipedia. As some of you now know from my past edits, it is my desire to wash my hands of Wikipedia, and so this will be a parting shot. For everyone, I hope something worthwhile arises from the wreckage. --<a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbeiter_70b4.html" title="User:Arbeiter">Arbeiter</a> 15:27, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Arbeiter, there are several paradoxes that arise if one wants to consider GoodSamaritan as my sockpuppet. For example: the first edit by GoodSamaritan, the one used as "evidence" that he may be my sock, seems to be very odd behavior from "Leinad-Z &amp; co". Why? Because the link you provided above makes clear that <i>I had a sourced quotation by two historians of science that would very easily allow the modification of your biased text</i>. It makes no sense to think that, instead of taking the easy and policy-approved route for changing that article, I would go through the trouble of creating a sockpuppet account and its elaborated userpage to edit it. BTW, as you very well know, much before GoodSamarintan's first edit I had already clearly <i><a href="../../../d/e/d/Talk%7EDedication_to_Pope_Paul_III_990d.html" title="Talk:Dedication to Pope Paul III">told you</a></i> that I would need to change the article's POV problems eventually. However, the most noticeable problem with your new theory may be that bringing the very issue of sockpuppetry (as I did at the start of this discussion) would be the most stupid thing to do if I were trying to hide a sockpuppet myself. Gosh, I was even <a href="../../../f/a/s/User_talk%7EFastfission_e166.html#A_problem_with_probable_sock_puppets" title="User talk:Fastfission">trying to bring the current discussion to the attention of administrators</a>, (again an incredibly stupid thing to do if what you say was in fact true). --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeinad-Z_ad6e.html" title="User:Leinad-Z">Leinad</a> ¬ <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Brazil.svg_f3e9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/0/05/Flag_of_Brazil.svg/18px-Flag_of_Brazil.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Brazil.svg_f3e9.html" /></a> <a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeinad-Z_2153.html" title="User talk:Leinad-Z">»saudações!</a> 00:16, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, you allegedly did come back "to change the article's POV problems" in the guise of a sock puppet. Also, your own arguments here (including the one you use as the "most noticeable problem with [the sock puppet] theory") apply equally for your accusations of GoodSamaritan being Arbeiter's sock puppet. Going to a WP administrator with which you share an edit history (and therefore possible association) is also suspicious behavior. --<a href="../../../d/i/x/User%7EDixiePixie_f75b.html" title="User:DixiePixie">DixiePixie</a> 16:11, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, it doesn't apply "equally" at all. Arbeirter was trying to defend himself from suspicion of sockpuppetry and needed something to try even out the discussion on the topic. On the other hand, I had no reason to put my alleged sock under the spotlight. All the time, I was perfectly aware that the argumentation you "both" were making toward me and ScienceApologist was completely flawed. Read again the deletion discussion and you’ll see that, as soon as Arbeirter tried to imply that I was denouncing sockpuppetry as a "rhetorical strategy" to hide my "shameful behavior", I wrote a key reply showing the allegations were unfounded. Until now, no one was able to rebut. Also, any attempt of <i>deleting</i> this article and <i>merging</i> its content back from were it was removed would necessarily be much harder than a simple NPOV edit. Especially because the move would be against the commonsense notion that articles should stay their respective topics. The fact is that I needed no socks, while Arbeirter did need them if he wanted to see his text back where he edited. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeinad-Z_ad6e.html" title="User:Leinad-Z">Leinad</a> ∴ <a href="../../../b/r/a/Image%7EBRAlogo1.png_acf7.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/bd/BRAlogo1.png/18px-BRAlogo1.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../b/r/a/Image%7EBRAlogo1.png_acf7.html" /></a> <a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeinad-Z_2153.html" title="User talk:Leinad-Z">-diz aí, chapa.</a> 19:55, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes. It does apply equally since your were trying to defend yourself against suspicion of misbehavior in the form of a "divide and conquer" tactic. "Until now" meaning that I recently provided its rebuttal? Sorry. I would have offered the rebuttal earlier if you had invited me to defend myself against your accusations, but instead you simply started accusing the new users who ever sided with Arbeiter without even leaving them notice of your accusations. You were here arguing with yourself. HomeComputer stopped by to ask you to take it elsewhere, but you kept arguing with yourself anyway. I guess you have a hard time feeling lonely. Again, your alleged motivation is pure speculation and even contradictory. Arbeiter needed no socks for this purpose, because Arbeiter never even asked for a merger; he voted to "delete". In fact, nobody has voted for a "merge", and this accusation taints the discussion so that fewer will have the courage to vote that way. (They might just get themselves added to your ever-widening sock puppet allegations.)

<dd>Are you seriously claiming that the note you "recently provided" is a rebuttal? Your comment there is only saying that I shouldn’t complain about the baseless accusations you were making toward me and ScienceApologist. It makes nothing to change the fact that you were completely wrong. Again, the <i>suspicion of misbehavior</i> was bogus, I knew exactly how to respond to that, and I did so effectively in the discussion above. It was soon after that key comment (when I mention that ScienceApologist is a materialist) that Arbeiter made the desperate accusation that I was the one using a sockpuppet; it seems that he <i>really</i> didn't know how to reply to that, (and so does you). Also, Dixiepixie, the edit summary of your own first edit in this page reads: <b>“Merge back to its orginal location”</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FHistorical_development_of_physical_cosmology&amp;diff=82176767&amp;oldid=82157486" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FHistorical_development_of_physical_cosmology&amp;diff=82176767&amp;oldid=82157486" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> So, <i>please stop pretending that there was no intention to move the text back to the original article</i>. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeinad-Z_ad6e.html" title="User:Leinad-Z">Leinad</a> ∴ <a href="../../../b/r/a/Image%7EBRAlogo1.png_acf7.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/bd/BRAlogo1.png/18px-BRAlogo1.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../b/r/a/Image%7EBRAlogo1.png_acf7.html" /></a> <a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeinad-Z_2153.html" title="User talk:Leinad-Z">-diz aí, chapa.</a> 00:16, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I only repeated it. You were the one who said, "<b>Until now</b>, no one was able to rebut." <i>Until now</i> here means <i>the opposite recently happened</i>. With the phrase, <i>until now</i>, you led me to believe that I had already provided the rebuttal, and so I did not even look for this reply. Looking for it now, I think you're either asking me to defend a quote made by Arbeiter or defend the text written by Arbeiter. In case you didn't catch it, Arbeiter left Wikipedia at <i>15:31, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</i>. You have already missed the chance to discuss anything with Arbeiter. As for me, I am only in this discussion to defend myself against your sock puppet accusations. It was you who originally resorted to "desperate accusations" of sock puppetry so that you could "feel little need to reply to" Arbeiter's accusations. Well, it's embarrassing that I didn't think to look back at my edit summary, but great that you found it. This is further proof that I am not Arbeiter's sock puppet: we voted differently! In <a href="../../../a/r/b/User_talk%7EArbeiter_d707.html#Come_back.21" title="User talk:Arbeiter">Arbeiter's discussion page</a>, I asked Arbeiter to "come back", and "defend your edits". I thought my encouragement and a merger would get Arbeiter contributing again. Now that Arbeiter voted to "delete", and especially now that Arbeiter left Wikipedia, I feel ambivalent about the merger. In fact, I will change my vote. It's very frustrating that my efforts to retain a Wikipedian not only failed, but got me stuck with Leinad-Z's sock puppet accusations. --<a href="../../../d/i/x/User%7EDixiePixie_f75b.html" title="User:DixiePixie">DixiePixie</a> 10:23, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Home Computer, thanks for the kind reply. But I still want to make one (last?) comment/question that is related with your first post. I did some research to find which specific discussion you were mentioning when you said that "Arbeiter was involved and there was no evidence of sock puppetry". My best guess is that you were talking about this <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Biblical_literalism_8dd3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Biblical literalism">AFD discussion</a> for Biblical literalism. Am I right?

<dd>Yeah, I got it. Actually, I have presented my suspicions but have been (from the beginning) restraining myself from advancing the evidence in regard to that.

<p><b>Leinad-Z</b>: Since you have openly questioned my gender, I feel it is no longer off topic to ask you a personal question. Does somebody pay you to provide censorship at Wikipedia? Your editing efforts obviously exceed an unpaid interest in history. By <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biblical_cosmology&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=76399506" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biblical_cosmology&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=76399506" rel="nofollow">shielding those traditionally associated with the church</a> while leaving <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a> to appear as the lone holdout against scientific advancement, you have led me to believe that you are a paid censor of the Catholic church. After all, this exception is completely inconsistent with your stated POV of dispelling the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict_thesis.html" title="Conflict thesis">conflict thesis</a>". Beside this point, let me see if I understand (the up-to-date version of) your accusations. You want people to believe that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arbeiter voted to "delete" this content, but secretly maneuvers to "merge" this content back to the original page.</li>
<li>Although Arbeiter lacked the patience to join a revert war to defend his own edits or even stay with Wikipedia, Arbeiter actually cultivated an account to look like your sock puppet, because Arbeiter somehow knew that one day, you would start a round of sock puppet allegations, and wanted to be ready to turn the tables on you. Following that line, Arbeiter<sup>*</sup> then nominated this article for deletion with the foreknowledge that it would lure you into the discussion to make sock puppet accusations just in time to beat Arbeiter's pre-declared retirement date.</li>
<li>Arbeiter created the account named <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillstone_da96.html" title="User:Millstone">Millstone</a> simply to join the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Biblical_literalism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Biblical_literalism" rel="nofollow">Biblical literalism AfD</a>, but then objected to the vote Millstone provided because the account was too new. (Wow... OMG... is it possible that even Freddulany is also Arbeiter's sock puppet? After all, just like Millstone, Freddulany agreed with Arbeiter's understanding that <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_literalism.html" title="Biblical literalism">Biblical literalism</a> exists. Arbeiter offered friendly encouragement to the new user just like Witch-King, and even declared that he valued Freddulany's opinion. After all, by using competing sock puppets, Arbeiter<sup>*</sup> brought the vote tally closer to his own position -- to abstain. Don't you see it? Or am I being as paranoid as you?)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Leinad-Z</b>: Do you really think this is the simplest explanation possible? There are simpler explanations: Perhaps your overbearing approach to editing and disregard for the discussion process is spawning troll accounts by unknown persons?</p>
<p><b>Arbeiter</b>: Perhaps your sharply pointed mannerisms in the discussion pages are doing the same.</p>
<p><b>Leinad-Z &amp; Arbeiter</b>: Are you discussing your edits with your personal friends and co-workers? If so, might one of them be attempting to support you? ...antagonize you? I guess the simplest &amp; most obvious explanation of all might be that people actually exist with POV's aligning with your apparent opponent. Of course, I feel confident that I exist, but if the rest of Leinad-Z's accusations are true, I would like to tell both Arbeiter and Leinad-Z to look in the mirror, and say hello to each other. You both missed the opportunity to discuss your differences, and pull each other towards reality. If you had spent half this effort in a discussion page for the articles in question rather than hatching sock puppet accusations for each other, you two probably would have created something worth reading. For my part, I still maintain that dumping this content here was completely inappropriate. Leinad-Z should have taken his concerns to the discussion page once Witch-King reverted it back (even if you always suspected he was a sock puppet), and there was no attempt made to make this material appropriate for this article's subject; it was just dropped off here as if this page were the city dump. If <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> really wants this page to happen, he should have taken an active hand in it; throwing out the suggestion is not a sufficient effort. As for my apparent coordination with Arbeiter, it was the wikify tag that lured me into <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_literalism.html" title="Biblical literalism">Biblical literalism</a>'s discussion page. The rest was documented on our discussion pages. As for always agreeing with Arbeiter, this is a fallacy. If I had followed his editing early on, I would have agreed with HomeComputer that his definition at <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_literalism.html" title="Biblical literalism">Biblical literalism</a> was off base and this threw the entire article into confusion. I also would have objected to some POV statements in the Darwin section of <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_cosmology.html" title="Biblical cosmology">Biblical cosmology</a>. However, because I only investigated this debacle after Arbeiter announced his retirement, these had become mute points since they had been deleted by the time I became involved. --<a href="../../../d/i/x/User%7EDixiePixie_f75b.html" title="User:DixiePixie">DixiePixie</a> 17:18, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I intend to leave further discussion about the sockpuppets for a more appropriate place. Just defending myself from the yet-another <a href="../../../a/d/-/Ad-hominem.html" title="Ad-hominem">ad-hominem</a> attack: in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biblical_cosmology&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=76399506" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biblical_cosmology&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=76399506" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, I am reverting Witch-King’s previous reversion of the move. To leave the section about Martin Luther in the article was actually ScienceApologist’s decision. It seems to me that the section about Luther was somewhat more connected to the original topic of <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_cosmology.html" title="Biblical cosmology">Biblical cosmology</a>, since it simply mentioned Luther's interpretation of the bible without being a report of yet-another "instance of conflict".

<dd>I guess arguing with yourself was more fun. Don't pretend you were above the ad-hominem attacks. Your ad-hominem attacks against me lured me back here. Luther used a scriptural reference from the Biblical book of Joshua as evidence that Copernicus was a fool and actually a <i>astrologer</i> instead of <i>astronomer</i>. How could this not be an instance of conflict between science and religion? Once the rest was gone, it was guaranteed to face opposition by the first Lutheran to see it. I wouldn't doubt if the person who deleted it was a Lutheran who saw Luther being isolated as the lone holdout against scientific advancement. --<a href="../../../d/i/x/User%7EDixiePixie_f75b.html" title="User:DixiePixie">DixiePixie</a> 23:45, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I originally proposed this article for deletion for being fancruft and not establishing notability. It was contested by User:Tailkinker1972 who left this note on the talk page:</p>
<p>"This page has been nominated for deletion, due to it being considered 'Fancruft'. I have looked it over, and am prepared to rebuff.</p>
<p>Wikipedia defines fancruft as, among other things, "material which is typically lacking in quality, selectively biased, of a poor nature and of interest only to a small audience in the respective field."</p>
<p>I feel that this article is free of bias. It most likely is of interest only to a small audience, but so do many other articles on the subject of Macross, including the other articles on Macross/Robotech technology. As for its quality or nature, I invite others to improve on the quality of the article, rather than merely slapping it with a deletion tag.</p>
<p>I invite discussion.</p>

<p>Prod was removed without explanation. A minor indy artist with one independently released album. No major hits, no major media coverage, no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable third party sources</a> leading me to believe that the article doesn't meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">largely unverifiable</a>. His claim to fame is his supposedly high PureVolume rating, which is a dubious mark of notability at best. A Google search of <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22Les+Eason%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22Les+Eason%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">his name</a> brings up a forum about him with roughly 10 posts, and a pure volume page.

<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Counterargument</b></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd><b>1)</b> In defense of the artist, the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> rule states: "Has had a charted hit on <b>any</b> national music chart, in at least one large or medium-sized country." <a href="../../../p/u/r/PureVolume_a994.html" title="PureVolume">PureVolume</a> qualifies under this rule, period. If this is not the desired definition of the rule, the rule should be rewritten or elaborated upon. Furthermore, being that I edited the article with the <a href="../../../p/u/r/PureVolume_a994.html" title="PureVolume">PureVolume</a> statistics, the statement "His claim to fame" is a subjective and therefore an irrelevant remark. The word "dubious" (above) also suggests subjectivity and should therefore not be considered valuable to the evaluation the argument. If so desired, and if this case were being conducted properly and fairly, the protestor should verify <a href="../../../p/u/r/PureVolume_a994.html" title="PureVolume">PureVolume</a> statistics by contacting <a href="../../../p/u/r/PureVolume_a994.html" title="PureVolume">PureVolume</a>, especially before making accusations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>2)</b> It is not a standard practice for Independent artists such as Mr. Eason to submit publications to organizations such as AMG, therefore, AMG (Allmusic.com) is not a reliable tool for scrutinizing credibility. In addition, there is no rule under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> that credits AMG with being the means by which to validate an artist. If this is so desired, a rule should be put in place.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>3)</b> The above argument about the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">google</a> search is misleading. As we all know, <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">google</a> results vary daily depending on hits. The fact that the search "Les Eason" brings back 10 pages (635) of results, and the fact that profile views on the artist's <a href="../../../m/y/s/MySpace_7190.html" title="MySpace">MySpace</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/r/PureVolume_a994.html" title="PureVolume">PureVolume</a> on October 17 are exceedingly high, it can be assumed that while his forum doesn't necessarily reflect high traffic, it is still a fairly popular page, at least on October 17. It is fairly common for music fans to prefer the artists MySpace over their homepage. Since the artists <a href="../../../m/y/s/MySpace_7190.html" title="MySpace">MySpace</a> was recently updated, it has been cycled to last of the results when searching from <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">google</a> while it would normally be the top search result (as I have personally seen). Such is the case when any <a href="../../../m/y/s/MySpace_7190.html" title="MySpace">MySpace</a> profile is edited. The artist's <a href="../../../m/y/s/MySpace_7190.html" title="MySpace">MySpace</a> suggests a large fan base and boasts a number of posts, contradicting the above beliefs which are simply a result of premature evaluation based on the lack of participation, not traffic, on the Les Eason Forum page. An unfair and incomplete interpretaion. And again, forum activity is not one of the required criteria under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Conclusion:</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I understand that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> does not tolerate promotional or marketing pages, but just the fact that I got on here today and searched "Les Eason" is evidence enough that people are interested in the article. At first I was surprised to see that he had a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> page, but then I was even more surprised to see the discrepancy since this artist is so well known as an independent musician in <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>. It would be a shame to delete the article and definitely not based on substantial reasoning (contradictory to the given criteria even). If you left the page alone, you would undoubtedly find that numerous people search this artist. I also feel that further arguments should be strictly objective and supported by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> criteria, not personal opinion.</dd>

<li><b>Les Eason</b> Hey lindsaypooh10, I appreciate your support and yes, I do you remember you from the Amarillo show. Anyway, I was just board during one of my grad classes yesterday afternoon and thought I would make a wiki page. I read the rules for deletion and knew beforehand that it would be deleted. I was surprised to log on this morning though and see all the debate about it. <b>Just delete the page.</b> It's not a big deal and I agree that PureVolume shouldn't qualify. And if these guys have nothing better to do than to troll inferior pages like mine than and make rediculous comments (with the exception of Dhartung and Aaron) then that is pathetic and it says alot about the wiki community. I had never edited on here because I've never had time, but I did expect to find a more scholarly bunch than this. I do appreciate in some sense the attention the page has received and I would urge all of you to check out my MySpace for some samples. By the way, the Purevolume Stats she posted were wrong anyway. Happy trolling! <b>LES</b> Sometime during the day, 18 October 2006<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.188.116.189 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.188.116.189_ed1a.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.188.116.189">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>So you created a page knowing it would be deleted, and proceed to tell us that discussing its deletion is stupid and trolling? And now you want us to visit your page? What? --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 20:14, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I very highly doubt that calling dedicated wikipedians "trolls" and their comments "rediculous [sic]" is going to encourage anyone to get onto your myspace page and listen to your samples. You said yourself that you knew this page is going to be deleted, you don't have to make such a big fuss about it. Since you've apparently acquainted yourself with the deletion guidelines, might I reccommend that you acquaint yourself with <a href="../../../e/t/i/Wikipedia%7EEtiquette_76f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Etiquette">Wikipedia:Etiquette</a> as well? <b><a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltra-Loser_fa06.html" title="User:Ultra-Loser"><span style="color:#112B84">Ultra-Loser</span></a></b> <small><a href="../../../u/l/t/User_talk%7EUltra-Loser_53db.html" title="User talk:Ultra-Loser">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ultra-Loser_4117.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ultra-Loser">Contributions</a></small> 01:18, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Nom withdrawn</b></s> Something happened to this discussion. It once was much longer. Not sure what. I was the original nominator; I tripped over it while doing some catagorization work.

<li><b>Comment</b> I doubt a currently operating psychiatric hospital would still be called an "Asylum for the Criminally and Mentally Insane", so I think a title change to the facility's most recent name is in order (Callan Park Mental Hospital, I believe). Yes, the article seems to imply that it's still operating, and according to <a href="http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/archives/asylum_records_2339.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/archives/asylum_records_2339.asp" rel="nofollow">NSW State Records</a>, Callan Park ceased operating in 1976 when it merged with Rozelle Hospital. <a href="http://www.callanpark.com/history.html" class="external text" title="http://www.callanpark.com/history.html" rel="nofollow">Friends of Callan Park</a> says that there were still patients in the facility until 1994 when they were moved to other buildings and it was taken over by Sydney College for the Arts. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 01:12, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Merge</b> - to Callan Park as per other views. There's no need for two articles on the same thing.</s><b>Weak keep</b> - the information covered has now changed so there's less overlap, but I'm still sceptical over whether we need two separate articles. This article could well be merged to provide a good article of FA status in the future about the suburb itself and its history, both as a mental hospital and about the redevelopment plans. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 04:46, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I have thoroughly updated and modernised the article. Again, I draw your attention to the obvious fact that this article deals with the Asylum itself in great detail, whereas the other article merely contains general information on the site that is Callan Park. The Asylum is an important part of the history of the state of New South Wales and of the treatment and care of the insane, and therefore this article is important. I suggest that the other article <a href="../../../c/a/l/Callan_Park%2C_New_South_Wales_6970.html" title="Callan Park, New South Wales">Callan Park, New South Wales</a> be deleted or linked to this article and re-named Callan Park Grounds, New South Wales.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Don't know what happened to the original nom, but I re-nominated it this time round. Even though some additional information has been added to the article, there are parts of the <i>History: Bedlam in Balmain</i> section which are basically copyvios from <a href="http://sydneyarchitecture.com/INW/INW19.htm" class="external text" title="http://sydneyarchitecture.com/INW/INW19.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> or <a href="http://www.cs.nsw.gov.au/rozdev/history.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.cs.nsw.gov.au/rozdev/history.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> and will need to be removed or quickly rewritten.

<li><b>Reply</b> Indeed, I <i>could have</i> been mistaken on that point. Still, the discussion appears truncated. I was watching this specific Afd. I have hundreds of things on my watch list, and I only watch AfDs I am involved in. <s>I must have mad prior comments to this AfD if I was watching it. My comments are no longer here. I cannot find them in the history. I remember distinctly catagorizing this article, and thought I had nominated.</s> Wait, I PRODed it, not AFD. Now I understand. OK. I guess I wasn't the original source of the AfD. Still, my PROD means I must have at one time thought it was deleteable. I no longer think so. The building described seems notable on face value. The article still needs clean-up but no longer seems to lack notability. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 16:45, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>speedy keep</b>, though this was a close call. Nominating an article hoping that it gets kept to set a precedent contradicts general expectations that those who nominate articles for deletion want them deleted. This comes close to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and may qualify under <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_keep_5dff.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy keep">Wikipedia:Speedy keep</a> as such and may also fit the description of a situation in which "No-one other than the nominator recommends that the page be deleted, and the nominator either withdraws the nomination, or wishes the page to be moved, merged, or have something else done to it other than deletion. Also, there are some cases where the nominator specifies they are nominating for the sake of process, for someone else, or some other reason but are not stating an opinion themselves. These are also to be kept." This seems to be a <i>nomination for the sake of process</i>, and the <i>nominator has stated he wishes for an outcome besides deletion</i> (in this case, a keep). <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 01:03, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please do not treat this as a personal attack on Wookieepedia. Lostpedia, a wiki for the ABC series Lost, has had its page deleted based on this policy. I hope that Wookiepedia survives this review and a precedent is set for other articles on Wikipedia. A quick look at the stats of both sites shows that Lostpedia, with an Alexa rating of 11,175, has over 19 million page views. Wookieepedia reports 8.9 million page views. The Alexa rating for this site includes all of Wikia, so those stats don't compare. The Wookieepedia article does not list any notable external references to the site, whereas Lostpedia was listed in <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_30/b3994072.htm?chan=tc&amp;chan=technology_technology+index+page_more+of+today's+top+stories" class="external text" title="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_30/b3994072.htm?chan=tc&amp;chan=technology_technology+index+page_more+of+today's+top+stories" rel="nofollow">businessweek.com</a> and was a <a href="http://www.scifi.com/sfw/sites/sfw13095.html" class="external text" title="http://www.scifi.com/sfw/sites/sfw13095.html" rel="nofollow">Scifi.com site of the week</a>. --<a href="../../../j/a/b/User%7EJabrwocky7_f09c.html" title="User:Jabrwocky7">Jabrwocky7</a> 23:58, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Your last sentence is mildly derogatory, and is not necessary. In response, I will reiterate that you are proving my point that you are focusing only on the external link / spam issue, which is obviously an issue near and dear to you, but only peripheral to the current article, to which you've nonetheless recommended a complete deletion rather than suggestions for changing its content. It also seems you've brought along other like-minded editors (I might be wrong, but you posted the afd <i>twelve hours</i> after article creation, then the next two delete votes by familiar editors follwed, the first (pjacobi) within 3 minutes, and the next (ptkfgs) within 21 minutes) from the previous debates. Also continued to be ignored by the current discussion are the contents of the article's talk page which were available before you made the afd. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESantaduck_f61f.html" title="User:Santaduck">Santaduck</a> 11:25, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Despite the comments of the above, this article is trying to avoid that counterproductive almost-flamewar to which the above two editors are frequent contributors. As a case in point, see their delimitation of the discussion to the presence of external links, which is not the primary motivation for this article.

Any justification for deletion should take these articles, as well as others in to account. Thank you.

In other words, your own past comments subjectively suggest to me that the issue of Lostpedia has strongly affected the severity of your comments on this article. Also, based on your past comments, I further suggest that your posting of the obvious ( <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> ) was possibly intended as derogatory toward me as well. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESantaduck_f61f.html" title="User:Santaduck">Santaduck</a> 01:36, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hundreds, if not thousands, of samples of Ultraconductors have been produced since 1981 when a piece of polymer was found to conduct electricity when it should have been an insulator. This work was discovered in the former Soviet Union by Dr. L. Grigorov and could one day be the subject of a Nobel Prize. Three floors of laboratories and a staff of Ph.D. basic research scientists performed the early work at the Institute of Polymer Materials, of what is now the Russian Academy of Science. In 1991 a paper entitled: On Genuine Room Temperature Superconductivity in Oxidized Polypropylene was published in Russian. The title appeared in HiTC Update, a publication supported by the U.S. Government. It stated the paper was only available in Russian. Magnetic Power Inc. had it privately translated six months prior to a published translation by the American Institute of Physics. The experimental work was impressive enough that our team visited the Moscow laboratories in late 1992 and evaluated the excellent science. We also arranged for applications to be developed by our subsidiary, Room Temperature Superconductors Inc., that was incorporated in 1993. This private firm has completed four Small Business Innovation Research Contracts for the USAF and what is now called the Missile Defense Agency. The Air Force did its own tests before awarding a Phase II Contract. It then had the work independently reproduced by Fractal Technologies. Dr. Matt Aldissi, the CEO of that firm, was the monitor of the Russian work for the USA while a staff scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He also convenes the annual International Conference for Conducting Polymers. Papers have been published in refereed publications including the Journal of Superconductivity, reflecting extensive laboratory experimnents. These materials offer an alternative to copper and the next goal is developing them into wire, which will take three years of laboratory work that may begin in the near future. In my opinion deletion will be a sad reflection on the inability of Wikipedia to intelligently deal with new and controversial science.</p>

<li><s><b>Weak Delete</b></s> change to <b>Delete</b>---not just "one company's theory". It's one of several theories from a well-known crackpot entrepreneur. On the other hand, the parent company <b>is</b> well-known in pseudoscience circles, and the Ultraconductors company has actually gotten DOD grants---much to the embarrassment of the DOD, according to the linked Wired article. Content-wise/science-wise, yes, it's non-notable crackpottery. However, the existence of this company might be noteworthy---I can imagine a would-be investor hearing about Ultraconductors, buying the CEO's spiel, and Googling around for more info. For such a user, the connection between RTS and Magnetic Power, Inc. is noteworthy, as is a link to the Wired article and a few comments from mainstream scientists. (NB: a Google search for "ultraconductor" brings up nothing but free-energy websites and Wikipedia.) On the other hand, a) Wikipedia is not, at the moment, a database of all possible scams, and perhaps it shouldn't be b) with the CEO editing actively, NPOV would require constant attention; scientific-point-of-view even more. On the other hand, that view of noteworthiness is inherently a NNPOV one---I sort of want the article kept in order to insert a few scientific sentences there documenting that Ultraconductors are bunk. The CEO will presumably have another NNPOV idea of noteworthiness---he wants to make his company's thing look good by having it listed under "Physics" on Wikipedia. Combine those two dueling edits into an NPOV article, and you're left with something non-noteworthy, hence <b>delete</b>.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - There has been at least one peer reviewed paper on this and if valid it would have enormous implications for physics.

<li>Products in 2007? <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball</a>. The free-energy branch of the company has been promising "products next year" since time immemorial; if someday they release something and it works, someone will create an article about it then, and no-one will fault Wikipedia for not previewing it. Anyway, convincing people that "enormous implications" are just around the corner is <b>how the scam works</b>---that's the hook, just like the <em>huge</em> Nigerian trust fund which will be wired over after <em>just one more fee</em>. As for science, there's one peer-reviewed *theory* paper from 2003 entitled "Possible high-current superconductivity ... " and one from 1994 entitled "Speculative model for ...". These papers do not pass any sort of notability requirement on their own: certainly WP can't devote an article to every untested solid-state-physics theory. There are (quite literally) thousands of them. An article on any similar paper would be so deeply un-notable as to barely attract an AFD nomination. Ultraconductors combines science non-notability with WP:ADV and WP:OR. <a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBm_gub_59c9.html" title="User:Bm gub">Bm gub</a> 17:09, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Yungun is one of, if not the most famous hip hop artist in Britain, excluding the London grime craze. He regularly tours nationally and internationally. He has numerous releases that are clearly available for purchase on major online stores such as Amazon.com, Play.com etc. He has performed live on numerous national radio stations. He is regularly featured in the national music press and extensively in hip-hop magazines. He has been placed in rotation by many stations including BBC Radio One, Britain's most popular station. A most definite strong keep! And no, I am not a sock puppet. <a href="../../../y/e/a/User%7EYeanold_Viskersenn_c023.html" title="User:Yeanold Viskersenn">Yeanold Viskersenn</a> 14:44, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No it doesn't. "Rotation" is very different to being played once. Rotation means you can expect to hear it several times per day across various different shows, for a reasonable length of time, usually because it has reached the charts or is a new release by a recognized artist. Keep trying. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 09:06, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Rotation is a unit of measurement for how often a song is played, not a specific frequency of plays. If a song is played only once then it is still "in rotation" (and I can assure you that Yungun's singles have been played far more than once - here's another BBC playlist with his single "Dancing Shoes" <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/stevelamacq/tracklistingarchive.shtml?20040209" class="external free" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/stevelamacq/tracklistingarchive.shtml?20040209" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/stevelamacq/tracklistingarchive.shtml?20040209</a>, and here's two more from Zane Lowe's show <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/zanelowe/tracklistingarchive.shtml?20040128" class="external free" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/zanelowe/tracklistingarchive.shtml?20040128" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/zanelowe/tracklistingarchive.shtml?20040128</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/zanelowe/tracklistingarchive.shtml?20040316" class="external free" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/zanelowe/tracklistingarchive.shtml?20040316" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/zanelowe/tracklistingarchive.shtml?20040316</a>, and yet more from Bethan and Huw <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/bethanandhuw/tracklistingarchive.shtml?20040422" class="external free" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/bethanandhuw/tracklistingarchive.shtml?20040422" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/bethanandhuw/tracklistingarchive.shtml?20040422</a>, he has even performed ENTIRE LIVE SETS IN THE STUDIO at Radio One - <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/raskwame/tracklistingarchive.shtml?tracklist_20060809" class="external free" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/raskwame/tracklistingarchive.shtml?tracklist_20060809" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/raskwame/tracklistingarchive.shtml?tracklist_20060809</a>). I don't see how you can justify regular airplay (amongst other things) from some of Radio One's most well known DJs as non-notable. Aside from this, Yungun has also presented a feature length show for Radio 1xtra.

<li>You're clearly a big fan. "Rotation" means a song is played regularly (for the reasons I outlined above), that's both the definition as it pertains to mainstream radio and the spirit of the word as used in the WP guideline. In general, if something is (used) in rotation (e.g. crops, footballers, clothes etc.) they appear on a recurring basis or, as Wiktionary puts it, "<i>a regular variation in a sequence</i>". I also note you've done nothing to improve the article (which you have edited once, on June 26), you might want to invest your time in that rather than this afd discussion where you have clearly voiced your opinion as "keep". <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 14:37, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As a music scholar I can tell you that in terms of radio airplay, rotation is actually derived from the term "spin", literally meaning the vinyl rotating on the deck. You don't seem to have cited the source of your definition "as it pertains to mainstream radio and the spirit of the word as used in the WP guideline" but anyway this isn't relevant. I've shown than Yungun is indeed notable on multiple counts, and whether I'm a fan or not is irrelevant. Nor do I have to be an active contributor to the article itself in order to discuss its deletion. <a href="../../../y/e/a/User%7EYeanold_Viskersenn_c023.html" title="User:Yeanold Viskersenn">Yeanold Viskersenn</a> 15:29, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've added numerous citations now. I don't think you can beat official playlists with regards to citing radio airplay apart from hearing the show itself. And for the record, I never claimed he was a superstar, but he certainly is one of UK hip-hop's most prominent figureheads. I don't know why you're taking this condescending attitude towards me when all I'm doing is trying to defend the deletion of an article that I know shouldn't be deleted. I find comments like "you're clearly a big fan", "you've done nothing to improve the article", "keep trying" and "if he's the superstar you tell us he is" to be unnecessary and somewhat impolite.

<li><b>Keep or smerge</b>. First of all, what does this have to do with Wikiquote? It doesn't have any quotes. Second, precedent is generally to keep lists of definitions when helpful to understanding the other articles in the topic, or at least to merge them. As a general comment, if you (Zgo!!) want my delete vote on anything, you're going to need to use your main account and not an account with no contribs other than AfDs, and moreover, you're going to need to give a valid reason for deletion. — <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari"><span style="background-color:#DDDDFF; font-weight:bold"><font color="#0000FF">Da</font><font color="#0000CC">rk</font> <font color="#000099">Sh</font><font color="#000066">ik</font><font color="#000033">ar</font><font color="#000000">i</font></span></a> <font color="#000088"><sup><a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDark_Shikari_d292.html" title="User talk:Dark Shikari"><i>talk</i></a></sup><b>/</b><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dark_Shikari_f6a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dark Shikari"><i>contribs</i></a></sub></font> 10:47, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

While some definition lists are useful, <i>this</i> definition list is basically referenced only from one or two articles, and the vast majorities of terms defined here seem to appear only once or twice in an article, so in this particular case it would actually be <i>less</i> cumbersome to define the terms at the point where they are used, rather than forcing people to follow cross-references to a separate article. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 14:21, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep or Merge</b> - I was the creater of this page. I prefer Keep, but I wouldn't mind a merge. The reason I created this page was to allow the readers of the understand some of the terminology in the Twelve Kingdoms and to facilitate the editors so they do not have to explain the terms everytime they write them down, which is often especially in the Characters section. It also shows the author portaits the books and anime as a diverse and cultural the world. This are not quotes. They are obtained from other sources and primeraly from the anime and books. If need to be merge, then most of the words will be removed, and only the most important words will remain. BTW, the only reason there is only two pages linking to this one is because there are only three pages of TTK (this one included), If more pages arrise, they would link here, because you need to explain the terminology. -- <a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuille2015_b624.html" title="User:Guille2015">Guille2015</a> 17:46, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(Since people still vote everywhere and ignore my suggestion of pooling the discussion in one place, I'm gonna do the same)
<ul>
<li><b>Usefulness:</b> It goes without saying that an overview of all images are extremely useful to editors. And it is not just for the editors. When sectioned and captioned properly, interested readers can have a nice view of various things, e.g. evolution, similarities, subtle differences, etc. And ironically, while I support keeping the galleries, I must say that the gallery is useful for spotting duplicates, and further, for deletion of duplicate images. Categories simply sort the images by name and that is not very useful.</li>
<li><b>Policy:</b> See <a href="../../../g/a/l/Wikipedia%7EGalleries_5230.html" title="Wikipedia:Galleries">Wikipedia:Galleries</a>. Just because it is a gallery does not guarantee a deletion. There are <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallery_of_the_Kings_and_Queens_of_Great_Britain_35b2.html" title="Gallery of the Kings and Queens of Great Britain">Gallery of the Kings and Queens of Great Britain</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallery_of_sovereign-state_flags.html" title="Gallery of sovereign-state flags">Gallery of sovereign-state flags</a> and from the gallery of flag, there are links to even more galleries.</li>
<li><b>Format:</b> The policy states that the gallery must be captioned and provide links. See <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallery_of_banknotes.html" title="Gallery of banknotes">Gallery of banknotes</a>, there are links to the individual currency articles. And links <b>to</b> the gallery? If you look closely at <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template_talk%7EInfobox_Currency_5f33.html" title="Template talk:Infobox Currency">Template talk:Infobox Currency</a>, you'll find that the infobox is perfectly capable of linking to the galleries. The only reason why linking to gallery is not deployed is because I don't feel the gallery pages are not organized enough yet. I am perfectly willing and able to work on those. All in all, deletion is not the solution to these short comings.</li>
<li><b>Cost:</b> <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallery_of_banknotes.html" title="Gallery of banknotes">Gallery of banknotes</a> is too large and it should be broken down. That I agree. However, there are a number of ways to break these down. I am still debating on this. But one thing is for sure. I don't think there should be "gallery of <b>circulating</b> ...", as the status of circulation can be hard to determine sometimes and it changes over time. See <a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESearchme_Archive_2_a31a.html#Gallery_of_.2A.2A.2A_coins" title="User talk:Searchme/Archive 2">User talk:Searchme/Archive 2#Gallery of *** coins</a>.

<dl>
<dd>(Since people still vote everywhere and ignore my suggestion of pooling the discussion in one place, I'm gonna do the same)
<ul>
<li><b>Usefulness:</b> It goes without saying that an overview of all images are extremely useful to editors. And it is not just for the editors. When sectioned and captioned properly, interested readers can have a nice view of various things, e.g. evolution, similarities, subtle differences, etc. And ironically, while I support keeping the galleries, I must say that the gallery is useful for spotting duplicates, and further, for deletion of duplicate images. Categories simply sort the images by name and that is not very useful.</li>
<li><b>Policy:</b> See <a href="../../../g/a/l/Wikipedia%7EGalleries_5230.html" title="Wikipedia:Galleries">Wikipedia:Galleries</a>. Just because it is a gallery does not guarantee a deletion. There are <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallery_of_the_Kings_and_Queens_of_Great_Britain_35b2.html" title="Gallery of the Kings and Queens of Great Britain">Gallery of the Kings and Queens of Great Britain</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallery_of_sovereign-state_flags.html" title="Gallery of sovereign-state flags">Gallery of sovereign-state flags</a> and from the gallery of flag, there are links to even more galleries.</li>
<li><b>Format:</b> The policy states that the gallery must be captioned and provide links. See <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallery_of_banknotes.html" title="Gallery of banknotes">Gallery of banknotes</a>, there are links to the individual currency articles. And links <b>to</b> the gallery? If you look closely at <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template_talk%7EInfobox_Currency_5f33.html" title="Template talk:Infobox Currency">Template talk:Infobox Currency</a>, you'll find that the infobox is perfectly capable of linking to the galleries. The only reason why linking to gallery is not deployed is because I don't feel the gallery pages are not organized enough yet. I am perfectly willing and able to work on those. All in all, deletion is not the solution to these short comings.</li>
<li><b>Cost:</b> <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallery_of_banknotes.html" title="Gallery of banknotes">Gallery of banknotes</a> is too large and it should be broken down. That I agree. However, there are a number of ways to break these down. I am still debating on this. But one thing is for sure. I don't think there should be "gallery of <b>circulating</b> ...", as the status of circulation can be hard to determine sometimes and it changes over time. See <a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESearchme_Archive_2_a31a.html#Gallery_of_.2A.2A.2A_coins" title="User talk:Searchme/Archive 2">User talk:Searchme/Archive 2#Gallery of *** coins</a>. The opening question for me is where to draw the borders.</li>

<p>At the moment, the article contradicts itself, unless one can distinguish between (a) work for which a photographer is most famous, and (b) the most famous work of that photographer (conceivable, but farfetched). Let's not quibble and accept that he's claimed to be famous for both his fashion work and <i>"The American Dream," a nine year project documenting the life and face of homelessness in America</i>. He's from the US. I'd expect that somebody who's so famous that he'd do (unspecified) <i>international exhibitions and world renown</i> [sic] <i>keynote speeches</i> (as claimed in the article) would have a book out: a search at amazon.com, abebooks.com and bookfinder.com shows nothing. I accept that it can be hard to break into publishing when you're doing something that's as resolutely uncommercial as "The American Dream" (if it exists). Surely this is mentioned somewhere? Not by Google: a search for <span style="color:#000; background-color:#cfc">"seth sabal" "american dream"</span> shows only this WP article and some commercial scrapes thereof.

As for books, their are plenty of famous photographers without published books. From my recollection the "Amercian Dream Project" was not about the photographer nor did the contributors want to profit from its showings, I am almost certain that the project help raise awareness to a group of individuals that were starting a homeless shelter. I do honestly cannot remember the name. I can tell you that I did see the show.</p>
<p>Furthmore; Hoary, I would remove the part in your grounds for deleation about "Mr Sabal claiming to be famous", It's libelous. I do not know that Mr. Sabal or his attoneys have seen your enties or for that matter the Wiki article; however, I have forwarded your Libelous claim through to the legal dept. at Seth Sabal Studio in NYC. I agree with Robertissimo calling the artical Apparent <a href="../../../a/d/s/WP%7EADS_2ee6.html" title="WP:ADS">advertisement</a> , but this can be fixed.

<li><b>Comment</b> The Sept. issue of Vogue Mexico and the current issue of Vogue Brazil (Oct. 2006) both have covers shot by the photographer. If you visit the websites of these publishing houses or subscribe to the magazines you can clearly see the presence of Mr. Sabal work. Coincidentally, the people that are fighting the issues of the articles are more than likely frustrated photographers, with professional jealousy. I am sure that Mr. Sabal does not care wither the artical stands or not; however, it would be childish and unfair to not have every photographer site every single sentence of all the work on all the articles on WIkipedia. I can understand that some people have nothing better to do. SO far the only person that has even been reasonable is isotope23, his points were valid unbias and very reasonable, plus you can tell he can see the trees in the forest. Hoary on the otherhand must really want to bother people, or is just hurting inside so much that he chooses to fight with his computer. I think its sad, get a job.

But perhaps "International Photography Convention" is a translation of a name in Spanish. No matter, as anything so grand and so recent in which Sabal made the keynote speech must surely be written up on the web -- but when I google for either <span style="color:#000; background-color:#dfd; padding:0 5px">"seth sabal" mexico</span> or <span style="color:#000; background-color:#dfd; padding:0 5px">"seth sabal" méxico</span>, I see nothing about this event.

<li><b>Delete.</b> I have considered and researched this AfD over the past several days and cannot reach any conclusion other than Delete. None of my extensive searches has turned up any positive information about this photographer that was not generated by himself or as a result of the Wiki article. I have found some extremely negative material suggesting unethical business practices, but this information has not factored into my decision. Each thread suggested by the article or the editors above has not produced any verifiable information. I have also watched the article shrink as other editors have questioned the accuracy of the information. As a side note, this discussion has been very acrimonious with so many personal accusations. While I resent the barbs thrown my way for my actions in trying to preserve AfD notice on the article, these did not factor into my decision. I would suggest that administrators follow-up on the questions of Sockpuppetry as the article and this discussion would seem to exhibit evidence of this strategy. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveHopson_68d6.html" title="User:SteveHopson">SteveHopson</a> 20:20, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm sorry that you disagree with Wikipedia having rules, but it's necessary in order for it to be an <i>encyclopedia</i> instead of a marketing platform.

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> While commonly being found in numerous rock and metal pieces of music, it is not recognised by a specific musical theory or as a bombtrack as the article puts it.

<li><b>Delete</b> as original research. Clever idea and a term which may well catch on, but there's no indication that it has yet done so.

The result was <b>speedy delete</b>. The page is a redirect that resulted from a page move, nominated by the editor that moved it. I've speedily deleted this on two grounds: The author and sole editor of the page has nominated it for deletion, so if the redirect <i>is</i> a bad name it qualifies for speedy deletion. If the redirect <i>isn't</i> a mistake, but rather the page move was, the subsequent edits by the editor who did the move prevent other editors from reverting the mistake, and deleting the edited redirect lets ordinary editors sort this out at their leisure without need for administrator intervention.
<p>This is <i>articles</i> for deletion, by the way. Don't bring redirects here. Redirects are discussed at <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_discussion_6c7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion">Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:23, 18 October 2006 (UTC) <a name="Metrified_English_unit" id="Metrified_English_unit"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Metrified_English_unit_e306.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Metrified English unit">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Metrified English unit</span></h3>
<p>Until 12 Oct 06 <i>Metrified English unit</i> consisted of three parts. <s>The first part appeared to be original research. It was removed. The last part was merged to <i><a href="../../../a/p/p/Approximate_conversion_between_English_and_metric_units_4a09.html" title="Approximate conversion between English and metric units">Approximate conversion between English and metric units</a></i>. This left only the second part. What remained was moved to <i><a href="../../../p/l/a/Plan_for_Establishing_Uniformity_in_the_Coinage%2C_Weights%2C_and_Measures_of_the_United_States_9ad0.html" title="Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States">Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States</a></i>. The reasons for this are outlined on that article's <a href="../../../p/l/a/Talk%7EPlan_for_Establishing_Uniformity_in_the_Coinage%2C_Weights%2C_and_Measures_of_the_United_States_d5b0.html#Totally_wrong_title_and_total_lack_of_sources_and_references" title="Talk:Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States">Talk</a> page. Also discussed there is the fact that the old title <i>Metrified English unit</i> was inadequate. <i>Metrification</i> refers to the adoption of the metric system not to the creation of a new system. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> 06:34, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</s></p>
<p>Part one concerned a so-called "Royal System". It was claimed that this system had been proposed in the 1820s. This system supposedly retained traditional English names for units but gave them values in simple ratios to metric units. Part one appeared to be original research and was removed for lack of references.</p>
<p>Part two concerned proposals by Thomas Jefferson. This part was kept.</p>
<p>Part three was merged to <i><a href="../../../a/p/p/Approximate_conversion_between_English_and_metric_units_4a09.html" title="Approximate conversion between English and metric units">Approximate conversion between English and metric units</a></i>.</p>
<p>What remained therefore was the proposals by Jefferson. This was moved to <i><a href="../../../p/l/a/Plan_for_Establishing_Uniformity_in_the_Coinage%2C_Weights%2C_and_Measures_of_the_United_States_9ad0.html" title="Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States">Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States</a></i>.</p>
<p>The reasons for this are outlined on that article's <a href="../../../p/l/a/Talk%7EPlan_for_Establishing_Uniformity_in_the_Coinage%2C_Weights%2C_and_Measures_of_the_United_States_d5b0.html#Totally_wrong_title_and_total_lack_of_sources_and_references" title="Talk:Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States">Talk</a> page.</p>
<p>Thus <i>Metrified English unit</i> became a redirect here. However, Jefferson's plan has nothing to do with the metrification. Therefore it makes little sense to keep <i>Metrified English unit</i> as a redirect to this article.</p>
<p>Indeed, <i>to metrify</i> is to convert to the metric system. An English unit cannot be metrified. The title <i>Metrified English unit</i> never made sense. So there really is no point in keeping this as a redirect anywhere.</p>
<p>The same arguement applies to <s><i>Metrified Imperial unit</i></s> <i>Metrified Imperial system</i> and I'll be listing that for deletion too. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> 07:37, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have listed <i>Metrified Imperial system</i>. This is an even worse redirect because not only does the Jefferson plan have nothing to do with metrification but it has nothing to do with the imperial system either. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> 07:56, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Jimp. This is terminology created by Wikipedia, not taken from the real world. It is both unnecessary and misleading as a redirect; it never had any links from any wikipedia articles not dealing with units of weights and measures as the subject; it isn't something anybody would link to from a history article or a geography article or a science article, and the redirect doesn't fit the article to which it redirects. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 11:58, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm Stephen Whitworth, the editor of prairie dog magazine and we do indeed still publish, biweekly, as of Oct. 2006. We're an alternative (bi-) weekly and similar to, though obviously smaller than, publications such as Halifax's the Coast, Toronto's NOW, Seattle's The Stranger, etc. Copies of current issues can be mailed to anyone requiring verification of our existence. We may not be a daily newspaper but we definitely have a strong profile in this community (we launched in 1993) and likely do deserve a Wikipedia entry. Someone else ought to write it, obviously. We hope to launch a Web site within the next year. Thanks.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>You say your newspaper is smaller then several other newspapers that have small entrys and in themselves somewhat none notable. Age is not a factor when deciding who or what deserves a article. Also even if you have a strong profile in your community doesn't mean the newspaper is of national or global importance. If that was the case every towns small newspapers would get their article. One last thing. By adding your comment you also prove the articles is of Vanity.--<a href="../../../m/8/v/User%7EM8v2_b3d5.html" title="User:M8v2">M8v2</a> 21:34, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> The Prairie Dog is NOT obscure. It is in fact <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regina%2C_Saskatchewan_e128.html" title="Regina, Saskatchewan">Regina</a>'s main "culture" newspaper, absolutely ubiquitous among the large university/youth/lefty/artsy crowd in the city, and well-known among pretty much everyone else, particularly for its restaurant reviews. It certainly has a strong presence in the city. Distribution/subscription figures are kind of hard to come by given the fact that it's a free newspaper. And "national/global importance" is NOT a criteria for a newspaper having an article. Regina's other major newspaper, the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regina_Leader-Post_22ba.html" title="Regina Leader-Post">Leader-Post</a> certainly doesn't fit that criteria and I don't see an AfD for it. <a href="../../../h/i/d/User%7EHiddekel_083e.html" title="User:Hiddekel">Hiddekel</a> 15:44, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Well I came across this article while looking for info on some musical stuff. The article guided me to search for some other music classified as hauntology. OK I realize the term is not widely used, but to me it makes sense, it is referential and I can relate to it (knowing some of the musical stuff that's being denoted as hauntological). I will definitely go look for that The Wire issue describing this genre of music in more depth. Meaning - I got the info I wanted and even managed to widen my knowledge in the field -- isn't that the purpose of encyclopaedic sources? 84.255.250.52 05:41, 19 October 2006 (UTC) Kat.</li>

On the page he is talked about as if he was spritual medium. He was arreted a last year for drunk driving(what a suprise). He said he was not driving the unregistered Toyota he vandalized but a 'Waka'. When he reported for community service he could not work becuase he was required to wear shoes, which he says he has not done in seven years.</p>

<p>Notability of this school not asserted. High schools I can understand as being inherently notable, but middle schools? Unless notability is established with verifiable references, I don't see the need to keep this article. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a directory of minor schools.

<li>The criteria for schools are <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, and the criterion to focus upon is the first. The best way to tell whether a school satisfies this criterion is to look for sources and attempt to rewrite/improve the article. I looked. I couldn't find a single source. The only things that I could find were things like <a href="http://www.getmyhomesvalue.com/house-values/louisiana/tensas/balmoral/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.getmyhomesvalue.com/house-values/louisiana/tensas/balmoral/index.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which is about Louisiana, not Ontario, and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Mobile/posdep/GMLIntroduction.html" class="external text" title="http://www.w3.org/Mobile/posdep/GMLIntroduction.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which is a set of figures used in an example of an XML-based language, which could be made up for the sake of example for all that we know. I couldn't find any press coverage, any independent inspection reports, or indeed anything at all. Even the web site alluded to in the article didn't exist.
<p>Coming, finally, to <a href="http://sbinfo.edu.gov.on.ca/schlist.asp?BoardNo=B66125" class="external text" title="http://sbinfo.edu.gov.on.ca/schlist.asp?BoardNo=B66125" rel="nofollow">the web site of the Peel District School Board</a>, this turned out to be unsurprising. There is <i>no such school</i> in the Peel district. There's Balmoral Drive Senior Public School. But this content is of no use to starting that article. Indeed, there's more information about that school in <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peel_District_School_Board_76f0.html" title="Peel District School Board">Peel District School Board</a> than could be salvaged from <i>this</i> article. A worthwhile stub on that school would have to demonstrate with sources that there is more to say on the subject than what is already said in <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peel_District_School_Board_76f0.html" title="Peel District School Board">Peel District School Board</a>.</p>
<p>There's no point in trying to salvage anything from this.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I do not think that <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> is a reliable metric to use in the evaluation of school articles, as it excludes FAR too many schools from having independent articles about them. As such, I think that until such a time as a reliable measure for schools can be found, all nominations of them to AFD should be withdrawn. I don't think the nominators should be forced to apologize or any malice held against them, but it's mostly just a confusion on their part of their understanding of the importance of consensus at Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> 18:08, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> is an excellent metric, because it focuses discussion on sources. Looking for, reading, citing, evaluating, and using sources is the proper study of encyclopaedists. As demonstrated above, employing <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> leads one in short order to the fact that this school does not exist, and has never existed, because it requires one to actually research the subject of the article, rather than to recite dogma. When parroting dogma about inherent notability places one in the very embarrassing position of wanting to keep unverifiable articles with zero useful content, it is time to stop and consider how far astray from being an encyclopaedist simple recitation of dogma has taken one. (Patronizing nominators from such a position only makes it even more of an enbarrassing one to be in, by the way.) I suggest that you discard the dogma, and actually make the effort to research the subjects being nominated for deletion, on a case by case basis, as determining whether the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> criteria are not are not satisfied requires one to do. You are clearly replacing doing research with reciting dogma. As you can see from where that has got you, that's wrong. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:32, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am not reciting dogma on this subject. What I am saying is that I think that any school, regardless of its nature or population, is notable. I agree that it should be verifiable, but I am not good at finding sources- this is why I mentioned, in my original comment, that the article should be kept until interested and more talented editors than I can find verifiable sources on the subject. I think your accusations of me parroting dogma are entirely unfounded: I feel very strongly on this subject and am unwilling to sit idly by and watch as articles on schools, one of Wikipedia's most precious resources, are deleted outright just because no one has found the proper sources yet. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> 18:50, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You claim in your first sentence not to be reciting dogma, and then your second sentence is exactly such a recitation of dogma. If you think that this article is a "precious resource", then I suggest actually reading it. It's rubbish. Even had this school existed, this article would have required a complete rewrite from sources. If you think that this is a case of "no-one finding the proper sources" then you clearly have made no attempt to read the rationales given in this discussion. The proper sources <i>have</i> been found. They show that <i>there is no such school</i>. Your "strong feelings" are preventing you from being an encyclopaedist. Discard them, and start doing the research. Parroting dogma instead of doing research doesn't help to build an encyclopaedia. It isn't a valuable contribution. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:21, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What I said isn't dogma. It is my opinion, however, that what I said is true, and it's an opinion shared by many Wikipedia users. I have done research and tried to find information on Google and other general searches, but that certainly doesn't mean there isn't an official report by local government on the subject that I don't know how to get to, but some other user does. I think that wanting to keep an article like this is an act of good faith toward the other editors in the name of improving the encyclopedic project. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> 19:33, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You clearly have <i>not</i> done research, or even read the discussion up until this point, otherwise you would have seen the official source that shows that <i>there is no such school</i>. Wanting to keep an article on a subject that isn't verifiable, and that has no useful content, isn't an act of good faith. It's preserving rubbish for the sake of dogma. It's worsening the encyclopaedia, not improving it. When dogma, which you <i>are</i> parroting, takes one to the point of making one speak in defense of rubbish and outright ignore verifiability and cited sources, then one has completely ceased to be an encylopaedist. Actively working towards including bad content in the project harms Wikipedia. It does not help it. Doing it "in the name of improving the encyclopedic project" does not change that one iota. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:55, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, well, the primary problem is that regardless of there are interested editors or not, this school absolutely fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> isn't a non-accepted guideline; it is policy and this article doesn't meet said policy. Furthermore, suggesting all AfD's of schools be withdrawn is not realistic. Even without <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> (which is non-accepted guideline and has about as much bearing as an essay in my opinion), the level of inclusion of school articles in Wikipedia is a contentious topic and based on the fact that there are people who want to keep every <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> school and people who want to have school inclusion standards, there will never be consensus on this topic. School AfD's are a fact of life at Wikipedia. Regardless of that, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is the basic cutoff that even the most ardent school inclusionists can agree must be fulfilled and this article does not meet that very basic criteria.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:36, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>My response to Uncle G covers your objections about verifiability. Just because I cannot find one does not mean that the article should be deleted out of hand when another editor may very well come along and find a good reliable source for the article. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> 18:50, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, yes it does... it's not just you that can't find a source here, nobody can. If someone finds a source then the article can be recreated, but we don't leave unverified articles laying around hoping someday, someone will come along and verify it. If something fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and I don't mean that the article isn't sourced; I mean no sources exist for the article, then it needs to be deleted. If and when someone finds a source the article can always be recreated. That goes for every article on every subject on Wikipedia, not just schools. --<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:08, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's not necessarily the case- the {{verify}} tag exists for that very purpose, to encourage editors to go out and find sources for articles. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> 19:33, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, {{verify}} is fine if <i>some of the information</i> is not verified, but if the basic existence of the subject of the article cannot be verified after a good faith investigation, which <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> has done above, there is no reason to leave an article on Wikipedia indefinitely with the hope that this somehow gets verified. Interested parties have the run of the AfD to find a basic source for the existance of this school; if this can't be done it should be deleted as unverified and unverifiable.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:02, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have made some effort to find verifiable information on this school, but as I have said above, I am not good at finding sources. The reason I want the article kept is for other editors to be given the chance to expand and add to this article, giving it verifiable sources.

And for good reason; titles like that will lead to POV disputes, as the history of this list illustrates. To solve the problem a methodology of inclusion has been constructed, and now the article describes its bias at the top of the page. Stating POV is nice, but not good enough. Wikipedia articles and lists should be NPOV, which I think this one will never be. N.B.

<dd>Nonetheless most of the content of the previous nomination appears to discuss the "major philosopher" point; so arguably it's already been treated. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_136.142.21.111_ff3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/136.142.21.111">136.142.21.111</a> (talk) .</small>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps, but the new title certainly highlights the POV problems. Anyway, there is no rule against re-nominating an article for deletion. On the contrary. That's why there is an AfD template for a second (or third, or fourth) nomination. <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkarioffszky_c8b8.html" title="User:Skarioffszky">Skarioffszky</a> 18:12, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>Discussion this month at Talk:List of major philosophers#More "fours" seemed to come down to two viable options for the list article: 1) delete the list or 4) keep the list and expand the criteria to eliminate biases. Most of the non-archived talk is about criteria expansion. This is a portion of a longer conversation that has been going on at least since the last AFD. Nobody is operating on the talk page with a great sense of urgency (folks interested in philosophy generally like discussion, gee...). I'd rejected the idea of doing a nomination myself earlier today because I wanted to give it more time. But now that we have a nomination, I want to see what the wider community thinks. A lot of the trouble, as discussed in the first AFD, has originated with those that want Rand included as a major philosopher. But that the issues come from those pushing a particular and unusual POV doesn't mean we should have the list. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 18:51, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>And yet, because of my actions, the school (through the work of another editor) has been expanded to a good level. The work of stopping articles from being prematurely deleted is not trivial as you would have me think. I am trying to accurately reflect community consensus, and try to allow school articles be improved rather than deleted, and all that I have to show for it is other editors picking apart my rationale. The above just shows that letting articles exist, rather than deleting them, is valuable. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> 16:57, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>First, it is exceedingly presumptious of you to claim any credit for anything here. You have <i>zero</i> credit here. You did, and continue to have done, <i>nothing</i>. You cited <i>no</i> sources. You provided <i>no</i> content. The article as currently written could have been as equally created from a redlink as from the 9 words that it contained at the time of nomination. You aren't improving the encyclopaedia in the slightest, and have contributed nothing at all towards its improvement by your actions here. You aren't doing any work at all here, trivial or otherwise. <i>You did zero work here.</i> In fact, <i>your actions are the direct causes of extra, unnecessary, work</i>. Had you done any work at all at the time of prodding, the article may not even have been brought to AFD in the first place (per the nomination). But you didn't do a single iota of work, and hence all of this extra time and effort expent on the parts of other editors, as a consequence of your just doing nothing, has resulted. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:34, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article is more than a sentence now, and cites five sources: a government report, a database of the school's demographics and test scores, and three separate magazine/news feature articles about this particular school's educational/development programmes and use of computers — all of which are from sources independent of the school itself. It even links to more source material not used by the article. Per the references and further reading sections of the article (q.v.), it satisfies the primary criterion of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:16, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as notability has not been demonstrated. I don't think that any of the sources provided by <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> show notability. First, as to the government report: Generally, the existence of non-trivial third-party coverage of a subject shows notability of that subject because it shows that the outside world (represented by the publishers of the source) deems the subject notable. However, a government report about a school is not published because anyone deems the school <i>notable</i>, it's published because government schools are accountable to the public. So a government report does not show notability. (Yes, this conclusion is contrary to <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, which explicitly blesses "schools inspection agencies," but <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> does not enjoy consensus approval.) Second, as to the database of the school's demographics and test scores: this is a trivial source, like similar reports on local restaurants. Third, as to the source titled "Teaching Technology To Kids": that report is not, primarily, about this school, which merely serves as an example (along with at least one other) of a school using technology in the classroom. The existence of that report doesn't show notability of the school, it shows notability of the topic of <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instructional_technology.html" title="Instructional technology">Instructional technology</a>, which as you can see we have an article on already. Fourth, the other two sources (that I can access--the link to the third is down) are local and as such are not sufficient to show notability (otherwise we'd be keeping lots of articles about local businesses, which are featured in local papers all the time). <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 16:00, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page is not about opposition to the Iran-Iraq war but rather about why it was bad. It violates NPOV and contains original research about that. The only statement about opposition to the war (this is cited with a source) is a quote that "large numbers of Iraqis" opposed the war. Unless someone has any real information for this article, so it can be completely rewritten, it should be deleted. <small><a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittleDan_7151.html" title="User:LittleDan">LittleDan</a></small><sup><a href="../../../l/i/t/User_talk%7ELittleDan_c646.html" title="User talk:LittleDan">talk</a></sup> 17:34, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> OR, POV, and, the main problem, there's really nothing here about opposition to the war, just a bunch of mainly anecdotal reports on draft-dodgers and deserters. Trying to stay alive is not the same thing as opposition to the war. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 17:39, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No one has claimed that there was no opposition, but your article has not cited any. Check out every other article in the anti-war category. There are descriptions of demonstrations, speeches, press articles. That's opposition. None of that here. Let's face it, both Iran and Iraq used their draftees as disposable cannon fodder. Deserting or evading was not "opposition"; it was survival. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 19:57, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi 7seconds, welcome to Wikipedia. Articles are not eligible to be kept just because similar articles exist on Wikipedia. Articles about individuals should comply with <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> (in this case <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_f7cd.html" title="WP:PORN">WP:PORN</a> can also be considered), keep votes may be discounted by the closing admin if they fail to address those guidelines. Alternatively, if you see an article about a non-notable individual anywhere on Wikipedia, feel free to nominate it for deletion.

<p><s><b>Delete.</b> There are multiple concerns regarding this article:</s></p>
<ol>
<li><s>If you remove the lists of rankings (which are duplicated from the <a href="http://rankings.ft.com/rankings/mba/rankings.html" class="external text" title="http://rankings.ft.com/rankings/mba/rankings.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Financial Times</i> web site</a>), you're left with a nearly verbatim copy of the Rankings section in the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_of_Business_Administration_6aaa.html" title="Master of Business Administration">Master of Business Administration</a> article. This seems like needless duplication.</s></li>
<li><s>The prose contradicts need for ranked lists of schools within the article.</s></li>
<li><s>Wikipedia isn't a place to promote the opinions (i.e. rankings) of one source. The original <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_9d6c.html" title="MBA">MBA</a> article already provides external links to online MBA rankings from multiple sources, including from <i>Financial Times</i>.</s></li>
<li><s>The prose already fits well in the <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_9d6c.html" title="MBA">MBA</a> article and doesn't really need expanding. It hardly seems worth creating a whole new article around this section, if the only purpose is to regurgitate (and maintain) annual rankings already available online. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 22:15, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</s></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> <s><b>Keep</b></s> as acceptable content fork (i.e. not a POV fork). The topic itself is certainly notable, pages and pages have been filled about the MBA rankings controversy, and it isn't really central to the <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_9d6c.html" title="MBA">MBA</a> article, which should be about the degree itself. So I propose to remove most of the text on rankings from the <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_9d6c.html" title="MBA">MBA</a> article and post it here.

<li>I thought of that too before I proposed this AfD, but after much thought I felt that the MBA Ranking section's short length wasn't worth its own separate article. It fits better with the <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_9d6c.html" title="MBA">MBA</a> article because anyone looking for MBA ranking information would first look for it there. You're correct that much has been written about this topic, but it's sufficient and proper for such a volume of information to be referenced as citations (which has already been done) rather than expand the article to duplicate what's already written elsewhere. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 23:04, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'm the author of the original text about rankings in the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_of_Business_Administration_6aaa.html" title="Master of Business Administration">Master of Business Administration</a> article. I admit it bothered me to see my work copied and pasted to a new <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_Rankings_8284.html" title="MBA Rankings">MBA Rankings</a> article and then slanted to favor <i>Financial Times</i>. I had considered creating a different article myself, but in the end I decided the <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_9d6c.html" title="MBA">MBA</a> article was a better fit, for reasons described by others above. On the other hand, I don't object to the existence of the <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_Rankings_8284.html" title="MBA Rankings">MBA Rankings</a> article. I <i>do</i> object to having near-verbatim paragraphs in two places; one of them must go.

<li>I agree it should be in one spot. I think there are reasons to farm it out, since users searching for "MBA rankings" are probably familiar with the general info on the degree and are looking for specific information. As long as the article provides an encyclopedic rundown of the topic we should be home free. I also suggest withdrawing this nomination and leave the decision up to the editors of the article. I don't see an actual rationale for deletion. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 05:45, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Points #1 and #4 in the nomination can be interpreted to support redirection. And there's no reason why a redirect link can't redirect to a specific section in another article, e.g. <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_of_Business_Administration_6aaa.html#MBA_program_rankings" title="Master of Business Administration">Master of Business Administration#MBA program rankings</a>. =<a href="../../../a/x/l/User%7EAxlq_af18.html" title="User:Axlq">Axlq</a> 14:31, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Redirect</b>. It should be on the MBA page, especially since the rankings are so central to the topic. The rankings themselves are in the public domain seem to be <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a>, however there's a real duty to explain both views of the pros and cons of rankings in themselves, as well as setting schools on a ladder. --<a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncanBCS_800c.html" title="User:DuncanBCS">Duncan</a> 08:45, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Rankings are usually copyrighted (there is no need for fair use of they're in the public domain). I think partial explanatory listings of multiple rankings are acceptable, especially if the purpose is educational, e.g. comparison of methods and outcomes. Why is Stanford #1 in ranking A and #37 in ranking B. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 09:48, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hmm, I thought I addressed that question in the article; those issues are dealt with pretty well in the referenced sources. The primary reasons for differences is that different publications use different populations of schools, and some rankings are based on subjective opinions given in interviews with alumni and hiring managers. I'll re-check and edit as appropriate. =<a href="../../../a/x/l/User%7EAxlq_af18.html" title="User:Axlq">Axlq</a> 14:31, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Okay everyone, I'm new at this deletion process, so help me out. This was my first-ever nomination. If the consensus is "redirect" back to <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_9d6c.html" title="MBA">MBA</a> (which to me sounds the same as "delete the <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_Rankings_8284.html" title="MBA Rankings">MBA Rankings</a> article and redirect the title to <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_of_Business_Administration_6aaa.html" title="Master of Business Administration">Master of Business Administration</a>", then that's simple enough.

<dl>
<dd>Just strike out the nomination (Using &lt;s&gt; and &lt;/s&gt;) and write "withdrawn" below it. You can technically also close it yourself but I can take care of it if you're not comfortable with it. There's also a technical difference between "redirect" and "delete and redirect" as in the second case the edit history gets deleted. I don't see a reason for that here though. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 18:22, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I mean- here's the timeline for him joining the Army: He travelled to NYC right after 9/11 from CA and then worked at 9/11 site for 2 weeks. Now let's say he <i>immediately</i> enlists in the US Army without seeing friends and family for possibly the last time and goes and jumps on the bus to go through basic training. There must be less than 13 weeks left in the year. <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_training.html" title="Basic training">Basic training</a> takes 9 weeks plus 4 weeks for infantry training. So we're asked to assume that he's so great that they immediately promote him <i>at the time of enlistment</i> (before any training!) to Specialist rank (a rank which usually requires at least 2 years services and specific technical skills/training<a href="http://www.gruntsmilitary.com/rank3.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gruntsmilitary.com/rank3.shtml" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>) and ship him off to Afghanistan before the usual basic training period is over! <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 00:41, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> Complete bollocks. I will go and put the hoax template on the article. Here are the reasons:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1. Timeline is unrealistic and self-contradictory. Claimed to have become a <a href="../../../n/o/c/NOC_8d64.html" title="NOC">NOC</a> during 2001 at top of article, but below is "recruited by the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Intelligence_Agency_295c.html" title="Central Intelligence Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> ... in early 2002." More problems as noted by Bwithh.</dd>
<dd>2. Asserted capture by Taliban is highly unlikely. In 2003 the Taliban were at their lowest point and would have had trouble capturing anyone. Also, terrorist organizations kill their captives.</dd>
<dd>3. The Exceptional Service Medallion is awarded "for injury or death resulting from service in an area of hazard" (<a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/facttell/cia_medals.html" class="external autonumber" title="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/facttell/cia_medals.html" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>) but there is no mention of any injury.</dd>
<dd>4. I know people who have this kind of fantasy -- I wouldn't be at all surprised if this is another one.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Some more reasons:

<p>According to the article, "best known as investigator of the Roswell UFO incident and other UFO cases." I find some internet chatter on him but all of three Newsbank news articles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily Times, The (Farmington, NM) - April 3, 2005 (passing mention as a speaker)</li>
<li>Albuquerque Journal (NM) - November 23, 2002 (passing mention halway through the article: "A UFO researcher, David Rudiak, claims a computer enhancement of the photo allowed him to read about "victims" and a crashed disk in the old memo.")</li>
<li>THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE, August 16, 1990 (not sure if that's him, but clearly not on UFO research; passing mention)</li>

<p>This was listed way back when on VfD; apparently it was kept but with a rather strong argument to delete. But anyway. I feel this should be deleted because it's an incredibly broad subject, prone to picking up oodles and oodles of unsourced or spurious information while running the risk of growing massively unwieldy. Nothing on this list cannot be sufficiently covered in the items' respective articles. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> an indiscriminate collection of information.

<li><b>Delete</b> The idea is OK-ish, but it's far too subjective to ever be a good article. You either allow everyone to add their pet "popular misconception", in which case it becomes an unverfiable mess (it's leaning that way already), or you only allow things that are uncontroversially known to be popularly thought and known to be wrong, which almost by definiton is impossible. --<a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDtcdthingy_8e94.html" title="User:Dtcdthingy">Dtcdthingy</a> 23:28, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Such lists have been created by physics education groups and are used in science teaching classrooms. If the list is too general, perhaps it should be split into more specific articles such as "science misconceptions" etc. Also, I haven't seen most of this information elsewhere on WP, since WP articles are nearly always oriented towards communicating information rather than predicting the existing misinformation and then trying to remove it from users' heads. And about unlimited growth and unweildyness: the article grew quickly at one point, then it stopped. If it expands at the current rate, it will be a very long time before size becomes a problem. --<a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWjbeaty_8fc7.html" title="User:Wjbeaty">Wjbeaty</a> 08:42, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>So what is the problem if you come across a really good book and want to help the author get the word out? I don't think that should be penalized. A know many other people that have read the book, met a few dozen of them at a book signing, and we are all very eager to read the second one. We are also eager to spread the word about a book we really liked. Wikipedia is a great resource to do that. Why is this being fought so hard? --Stewart08 23:31, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

I read the guidelines and see nothing that excludes Jerome Wetzel from having an entry. In fact, search Columbus and Madison County newspapers, and you will find reviews of his work, which I believe qualifies him for an entry, per the 'guidelines' referring to multiple reviews of an author's work. --JMSWDLY 23:41, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you are going to continue to fight this, I will give up. This is my last ditch effort to change your minds. --JMSWDLY 23:42, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It might be helpful to provide links to those reviews, then we could read them ourselves. I'm not convinced that reviews in local newspapers meet the guidelines. BTW, this really isn't a fight merely a discussion. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 23:46, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reviews were in The Madison Press and the Madison messenger, neither of which are online. I cannot find the article from The Columbus Dispatch. Perhaps it is too old, or maybe I just didn't know how to search for it. Other newspapers may have carried it. I don't know. The guidelines, as I read them, are not binding or conclusive, just guidelines. It is my opinion that a book series that has readers and has been reviewed would qualify, but like I said, I won't keep discussing this if its clear that the editors don't agree. I will let Mr. Wetzel or some other fan take up the battle. I did this for fun, not to make a whole night out of debating just to get it posted.--JMSWDLY 23:52, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Hello. This is Jerome Wetzel, the author in question. I was informed a short time ago by one of my fans, who goes by the name Stewart08 on wikipedia, that there was a debate going on. I did just create an account to speak, because I didn't have one. I would like to personally apologize for any disruption this has caused to your web site. Although I did not have an account until today, I use Wikipedia often. While I am flattered that fans of mine want to take up my cause, I have to admit that there aren't that many of them anyway, and the multiple names was probably an attempt by them to help me out. I have been promoting my book for the past year, and have had a hard time of it, though comments from readers have been extremely positive. I am sure that these people only wished to help me in this task. I agree that I am not noteworthy enough to have my own Wikipedia entry, although it would be an honor if someday that did happen. Anyone who is discussing an entry for me on my behalf, please desist and let these fine people go about their jobs. If you are trying to get the post deleted, I apologize again. I hope that this comment stops the fan postings and that you may go about your nights. Thanks you. --JeromeWetzel 23:59, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
