<p><s>This is a rather strange case. It's an article about a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Shiny_Diamonds_3d21.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Shiny Diamonds">prior AfD</a> and a <a href="http://www.southflorida.com/news/chi-0612130399dec14,0,4534186.story?coll=sfe-news-headlines" class="external text" title="http://www.southflorida.com/news/chi-0612130399dec14,0,4534186.story?coll=sfe-news-headlines" rel="nofollow">Washington Post</a> article on AfD generally that leads with the aforementioned AfD specifically. One source doesn't quite cut it for most notability considerations, and I don't think a write-up in the Post makes it a "controversy" per se. The article is quite well written and flawlessly formatted, but it, like the band, is not notable enough to be included in wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 03:39, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</s> <b>Nomination withdrawn</b> I am now in agreement with Antepenultimate's point below that the news links, at the very least, ought to be <b>merged</b> into the Criticism article. There's not really a section of the Criticism article that covers the criticism the Foundation Office is getting phone calls about all the time: that Wikipedia's notability guidelines disallow a compendium of all human knowledge. Though we usually hear about this criticism here in deletion discussions on Wikipedia, the media has started covering it enough that a general mention at the article is appropriate. I don't agree with this criticism, but <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">that doesn't matter</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - <b>for now</b> - This article is approximately one day old and has a single editor with a brief edit history. If this is an actual controversy, we should wait and see if the article develops. I suspect that, since the original band article was deleted, nobody will come looking for an article about the deletion of another article. But, we should give it 2 weeks and see what happens.

<li><b>Delete</b>, <i>a non-notable "controversy" about a non-notable band</i> and <i>back-door attempt to get mention... into WP</i> pretty much sums it up.

In the end, it is <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">self-referential</a> and unencyclopedic. And the solution for a deleted article is <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>, not to create another article that is indirectly about it.

<li><b>Delete</b> as attempt to "bootstrap" an article on the band onto Wikipedia on the grounds that they were mentioned in a newspaper article about Wikipedia's deletion process. (I believe that the article was syndicated to various newspapers, but that does not justify this article.) The "controversy" does not seem to exist outside the band itself. Article violates the guideline of <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">avoiding self-reference</a>. Note that if the band manages to satisfy one or more <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria, they can have an article, but I would support blocking anyone who tries to take this self-reference any further by creating The Shiny Diamonds controversy controversy or anything like that. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 07:49, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Not a "controversy," just one article in the Post. Apparently this was also mentioned in a blog. This and $1.25 gets you a cup of coffee. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 01:45, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Help</b>. Hi everyone, thank you for helping me improve the article by providing information here on this delete page. Thank you in particular to Amarkov, Justin (Authalic), Metropolitan90, Robertissimo, PMAnderson, and Just H. I just got out of an interview with CBC Radio One. They did a segment on "The Shiny Diamonds Controversy" after they read the Washington Post article. Just so you know, I have never met anyone in the Shiny Diamonds band before... in fact I just heard their music for the first time today (on myspace). I live in Paris, they live in Vancouver. You can google me if you don't believe me. I'm just very passionate about keeping this type of information in wikipedia. It makes me sad to think of wikipedia as the sum of SOME human knowledge. Can someone help me out with improving the page so that it is less likely to be deleted. I don't even know how to reference a radio broadcast. I could really use some help. Thank you in advance. <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeigh8959_ce32.html" title="User:Leigh8959">Leigh8959</a> 03:12, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>But if I thought that a rewrite could possibly make this good enough to keep, I wouldn't have said to delete, and I probably would have rewritten it enough to establish notability. But there is no controversy, therefore there aren't sources, therefore no rewrite could make it better. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 05:19, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I actually think if there's a radio interview on this issue (raising the number of sources to three) that would probably be enough to keep it. Even if it gets deleted this round, there's always <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> after the show airs. We'll see what happens; I'm waiting to hear more.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 05:34, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I heard about this whole thing on the radio this afternoon and thought it was interesting enough to start up a Wiki page for. It's not even really an issue or news but if these guys were talked about on CBC Radio 1, which is as relevant as it gets for Canadian broadcast, it warrants a mention either in their own page or a 'Shiny Diamonds Controversy' page. I looked on Google and there are dozens of articles quoting or elaborating on the whole thing. I liked what the guy in Paris said about the sum of all knowledge. If the internet has fairly limitless potential, why should Wikipedia users be waging some sort of battle against this very Wikipedia-related issue being mentioned on the site? It's all very strange and I expect to see more news articles popping up daily about this, as they seem to have been doing for weeks now.--Mercury0T 07:21, 19 December 2006 (UTC) <small>â€” Mercury0 (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mercury0_72a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mercury0">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li>Changing vote to <b>Merge news article links</b> with <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a>, under "dated links." Let's not lose our sense of perspective here: To call this a true controversy, or to even say that Shiny Diamonds is the main focus of these articles, is misleading. They are being used as a current example (one of many, it should be noted) for an opinion article, and they are then mentioned (very briefly) in another editorial (about the original opinion article). -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntepenultimate_a059.html" title="User:Antepenultimate">Antepenultimate</a> 10:41, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
