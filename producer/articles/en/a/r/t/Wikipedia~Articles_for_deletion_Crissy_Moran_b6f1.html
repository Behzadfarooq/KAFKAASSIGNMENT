<li><b>Keep</b>, she's been in at least 32 videos and was nominated "Most Recognisable Adult Actress" by a French magazine.

<dd>She'd have to have been in around or over 100 movies to qualify the videos, and how notable is the French magazine, especially to English audiences? <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_Treason_ae0c.html" title="User:Voice of Treason">Voice of Treason</a> 21:04, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You've basically argued for why she is not notable. 32 videos and nomination (didn't even win?) by some unknown French magazine is what I would call NOT notable, even by porn standards. As far as number of videos and awards go, the proposed <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN_BIO</a> requires at least 100 videos or <i>winning</i> (not just being nominated) an award given by a major porn organisation. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 21:08, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The keyword about WP:PORN BIO is <i>proposed</i>.&#160;:-) As I mentioned in another AfD, it is far more strict than the treatment that regular actors get on AfD. If you're a regular actor and have an IMDb entry with two or three minor parts with brief screentime listed, you have a very good shot at being kept on AfD. If your only role is an occasionally reoccuring character on any TV show, no matter how low rated, you have an excellent chance at being kept. As far as the magazine being "unknown", I don't know. It could be well known in France. Also, if she was even nominated for the most recognizable adult actress award, it seems like she would have had to have been considered very well known. Other awards, like best performer and such could have relatively unknown people, but it wouldn't make sense to have anyone non-notable nominated for that award. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 03:52, 10 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know why you'd think regular actors have less strict criteria for keeping. The difference is in the movies themselves. Regular movies, especially ones with national or international distribution, are more notable than any one of the porn movies that most of these porn stars have been in. By extension, of course regular actors are usually more notable than porn stars. Having a minor role in, for example, <i>Da Vinci Code</i>, is going to be more notable than being the star of, for example, <i>Teen Pussy #1</i> through <i>Teen Pussy #15</i>. Now if this particular porn star or any other porn star had minor roles in regular movies, that would make them notable. It's not how many movies they've been in or how many magazine spreads they've done. It's the <i>kind of</i> movies they've been in and the <i>kind of</i> magazines they've been in. These movies and magazines are not notable. That's the problem. It's the same thing with any other kinds of professions. You can take, for example, a computer programmer that has written several hundreds of programs, he wouldn't be as notable as the guy that wrote, for example, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winamp.html" title="Winamp">Winamp</a>, if the programs he wrote are not themselves notable. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 04:20, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- notable more as an Internet pinup than a porn actress, methinks. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 02:31, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>, not only is she apparently a notable porno chick, but <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darren_Hayman_8d15.html" title="Darren Hayman">Darren Hayman</a> (who was a favorite of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Peel_dd69.html" title="John Peel">John Peel</a>) wrote a song about her. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 11:50, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> She seems notable even though I haven't heard of her. Cheers --<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarionwolf_ad89.html" title="User:Starionwolf">Starionwolf</a> 23:06, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Crissy Moran is quite prevalent in online porn. You see her everywhere, even in MySpace adds for dating websites. Her career is a testament to the power of the web where she might not have movie exposure like other porn stars (by her own choice I might add) but she is still as well known. Sablestorm 08:30, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> There are adult actresses on here that are far less notable, yet their pages are still up. The reason Crissy doesn't have tons of videos is because she has moved away from doing hardcore scenes, she said so on her forums. She has done photoshoots with popular models, she has shot with highly-regarded photographers, and her site receives tons of hits every day. She may not get the type of exposure that others get because of her lack of boy/girl scenes, but she is clearly one of the most beautiful women in the adult industry. She is completely underrated by so many people. When I see some of the other pages for pornstars that remain un-deleted, I can't believe this one is even being considered. One more point, the major adult website Twisty's named her "Twisty's Treat of the Month" this year. That sounds pretty special. She also recently did a shoot hor Hustler, and she is being considered for the front cover. The article for on here is also horrible. It hasn't been updated in forever with some of her recent accomplishments. The article does not do justice to her at all and needs to be rewritten by someone with a deep knowledge of her career.--71.246.103.73 13:38, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> seems notable enough to me. --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister_Wiggles_a251.html" title="User:Mister Wiggles">Mister Wiggles</a> 03:07, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Satisfies WP:PORN per "Performer has been notable or prolific within a specific genre niche." The niche is internet pin-up. Similar to <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cindy_Margolis_3eb7.html" title="Cindy Margolis">Cindy Margolis</a> (though substantially less notable), Crissy is notable not for her presence in videos, but for her photo shoots. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKershner_cf22.html" title="User:Kershner">Kershner</a> 21:41, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
