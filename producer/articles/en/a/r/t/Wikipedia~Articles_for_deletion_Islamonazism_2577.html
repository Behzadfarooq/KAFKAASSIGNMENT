<li>I've seen the term used by right wing cranks before, maybe it should have a page, just one that it is encyclopedic ("Right wing cranks use the term Islamonazism to indicate that they consider various extreme forms of Islam to be morally or functionally equivalent to Nazism under Adolf Hitler" etc). The biggest problem with this article (and theory) is that it confuses two completely different aspects of Middle Eastern politics (as I understand it): <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-Arabism_9177.html" title="Pan-Arabism">Pan-Arabism</a> (which is functionally similar to <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a>, i.e. the <a href="../../../b/a/a/Baath_party.html" title="Baath party">Baath party</a> in Iraq and Syria) and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamism.html" title="Islamism">Islamism</a> (radical Islamic rule, i.e. the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Taliban.html" title="Taliban">Taliban</a>, or Iran). The problem is... the ideologies are generally mutually incompatible (hence the divisions between Egypt, Iraq, Syria and Iran, Al Quaida, etc.). <s>Which is really here nor there on the VfD page, but I guess maybe this could be turned into a real article, but you'd have to start by blanking the current version.</s> Actually, nevermind: <b>redirect</b> to List_of_pejorative_political_slogans#Islamofascism. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 04:52, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>So long as there are criteria for how votes count, it's not a problem. The reason new accounts count less is that it's too easy for someone either to make new accounts for the purpose of multiple-voting, or for someone to go find a bunch of their friends to vote their way. Suggesting that people hang around for awhile and make some contributions before their votes count is a good guard against these problems. --<a href="../../../p/g/u/User%7EPgunn_d038.html" title="User:Pgunn">Improv</a> 16:54, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>(I've already voted) On the question of delete vs redirect (obviously keep is a ridiculous option for anybody who isn't a sock puppet or an extreme right-wing crackpot), I think redirect is probably best. I've seen people use the term Islamonazi and leaving it open will just encourage someone else to think it doesn't have an entry. I don't see the purpose in killing the page history -- who cares? Anybody who is seriously looking up the term here will find similarly nonsensical and hate-filled things if they have typed it into Google first, I could care less, personally, if they read that at one time a crackpot had once again filled up Wikipedia with hate-filled nonsense... --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 23:41, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree...Old Right's user page is kinda cool. Speaking as a lifelong Republican-voting, Drudge Report-reading, Sean Hannity-watching, LA Times-hating conservative who would greatly enjoy the opportunity to give Dan Rather an atomic wedgie, I have to give this horrific rant as emphatic a delete vote as I have ever given. There are conservatives and there are crackpot, extreme, hate-filled individuals who wrap themselves in the flag while spouting their vitriol all over this site. This is almost worse than the damned kiddie porn apology articles! Lacrimosis hit it on the head. Just get rid of this thing and the sockpuppets that go with it. - Lucky 6.9 04:56, 21 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Redirect to [[List of Perjorative etc.. and delete. There is obviously a history of association between the Nazis and Moslems but that belongs on the appropriate pages, not as a aseperate article. You could probably find a similar connection between the nazis and any other historical opposition to British rule. Presumably we don't have an article on IRA-Nazism, and yet there was definitely some contact between them. Similarly, in more recent times, there may have been contact between the IRA and Libya, are we to expect an article on Irish-Islamism?</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore; articles like this are by their nature contentious and involve Wikipedia in unnecessary acrimony. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPing_4215.html" title="User:Ping">ping</a> 09:12, 21 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Comment: Why are we even letting this go on and on? Anon votes count zero. As for the people being reasonable and trying to find content to merge, let's remember one of those really basic truths: <i>Islamic and Arab are not the same thing.</i> If someone wants to talk about Arab tribes that supported the Nazis, well, whatever. That's not Islam. Secondly, if we <b>do</b> decide to trace that out, then, as Ping says, the IRA supported Hitler, and <i>so did Prebscott Bush</i> (current president's grandfather) and so did Charles Lindbergh. So? There is a big difference between a realpolitik supporter of the enemy of one's enemy and ideological agreement, and therefore there is a big difference between, say, a sheik and <a href="../../../e/z/r/Ezra_Pound_79cc.html" title="Ezra Pound">Ezra Pound</a> (or, pre-war, Prebscott Bush). Delete the article, no redirect.

<li>Change vote to neutral. If it is a verifiable historical and current phenomenon, crop article to those provable NPOV facts. Remove baseless insinuations e.g. Islam==Nazi or Arab==Nazi, etc. Priority cleanup. If, say, Arab nazism is the more accurate explanation, then do the same cleanup, and move article to Arab Nazism.
