<dd>The people have made significant news coverage in their own countries. I have listed many links to newspapers and media sources which are independent of YouTube - and I didn't even use them all because I thought it was overkill.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - hang on please!!!! It's not fair to just delete this article - I wrote this article to stop the squabbles about notability, because after all these people derive their notability solely from YouTube, not from anywhere else. All the people on this article have had significant media coverage as I have established by the references from news sources and other newspapers. I spent several hours sourcing articles that made these people notable. I don't think there is anyone else worthy of inclusion here - and I'm willing to keep deleting stuff unless it is notable so the spam argument has no relevance. YouTube has given people significant media coverage, and I was trying to establish this in an article. What's wrong with that? This was meant as a <b>replacement</b> for the standalone articles, not an article in addition and for the most part I merged those articles into this one. It's not fair to just delete all my work.

<li><b>Merge</b> to YouTube with a little pruning. The viral internet video phenoms are a critical part of YouTube's success (and billion-dollar price tag). Tracking the ones that have received substantial news coverage is helpful to readers, and I think more helpful than a boquet of small articles. I know editors here passionately hate the infiltration of internet cruft, and rightly so, but if the <i>New York Times</i> and the <i>Washington Post</i> deign to mention something, I think we should humor them. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 07:04, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This is not a compromise I believe is beneficial - merging unencyclopaedic content to one article isn't always best in that it ignores the premise that it probably shouldn't be represented in the first place. This is less offensive than individual articles on these subjects, but I have to agree with Isotope that it's a matter of either they pass the guidelines and get an article or they don't pass them and get mentioned nowhere.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The big problem here is that people object to individual articles on YouTube users (I had to fight uphill to get Lonelygirl15 kept—the most notable YouTuber ever!), so a compromise solution is to merge all but the most notable of them to a list; however, this compromise solution is sabotaged if this article too is deleted.

If we enforce the need for multiple third party sources then it won't just be a dumping ground for crap.
