A "component force" is simply what you would expect from the words "component" and "force". It has no special meaning in mechanics.

<li>Delete. "Component force" appears to be used infrequently to mean a component of a force vector, but that wouldn't merit a separate article, and the existing article is about something else. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E.

<li><b>Keep</b> if I'm reading this right, a company with almost <b>five MILLION Google hits</b> is up for VfD!? Now I obviously didn't check that each one was relevant to the phone, but just about all on the first few pages seem to be. Even besides that, we have not only an article on, say, Nokia, but many of Nokia's individual phones as well. I see no reason why Nokia upmarket subbrand Vertu shouldn't get one too.

<li>Uh, look at what most of those hits are. It's honestly quite difficult to do a Google test on this one, unless your international language skills are better than mine. Vertu is just "Virtue" in French and maybe other languages, and it's also the name of at least one rock band, etc. etc. Furthermore, there's something very weird. If you do a search on the exact phrase "Vertu Signature", which is the name of one of their products and likely to return only relevant hits (admittedly only in those countries where that IS the name of the product), I get 36,000 hits, but "In order to show you the most relevant results, we have omitted some entries very similar to the 220 already displayed." I frankly don't know what to make of this. If I do a search in Google GROUPS, which website managers don't bother to try to manipulate, for most topics one gets something like 1/4 to 1/10 the number of hits on the Web. Here, "Vertu Signature" gets ONLY 9 hits, "Vertu Ascent" gets ONLY 8 hits. In contrast, if we search on exact phrase "Nokia 6620" in Groups, we get 86 hits. I respect the Google test, but it is sometimes very difficult to apply and this is one of those times. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 21:20, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>List of people widely considered eccentric has survived at least two VfDs on the grounds that it's "inherently non-NPOV." The big difference between List of popular misconceptions and List of people widely considered to be eccentric is that the latter list has a clear purpose and subject: it's a list of people who, for whatever reason, have been labeled "eccentric." Something like, say, List of interesting people would be as unencyclopedic and pointless as this article. <a href="../../../s/z/y/User%7ESzyslak_7117.html" title="User:Szyslak">Szyslak</a> 06:52, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well I was using it to illustrate my point. I have in the past tended to vote against lists because I really see no justification for them (I am a supporter of categories rather than lists). But all things considered the role of the encyclopaedia is to be informative and as accurate as possible.

<li>How does it _hurt_ Wikipedia to have information on Kate and her record? It is a world record in that several professional eaters have failed to consume this hamburger whereas Kate has succeeded. This is the "4-minute-mile" of competitive eating. Although I agree that Wiki needs a larger article on competitive eating and its events, for now featuring this young woman adds to the knowledge-base available to our readers. Google returns 12,000 results for her name, which is hardly a common moniker. Isn't that a tad too many results for Wikipedia to be silent? <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoodmarket_f110.html" title="User:Foodmarket">Foodmarket</a> 15:23, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's the wrong question. The question to answer is "How does it <i>help</i> Wikipedia?". And the answer is that it doesn't. And, as both I and <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a> have pointed out, this <b>is not a record</b>.

<li>Regarding UncleG's questions, I am new to Wikipedia but have read that when creating a new article, one should take steps to avoid it becoming an un-linked orphan. Was it inappropriate to link back to the article in related articles? About Kate's editing of the page, trace the IP -- it goes right to her dormitory in the College of New Jersey. So I guess you can say it could be _any_ TCNJ student living on campus but you can take my word for it, it's her. <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoodmarket_f110.html" title="User:Foodmarket">Foodmarket</a> 15:29, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't understand your comment. Why would any editor create, out of the blue, a link to "Lilith (comics)", when going to <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lilith.html" title="Lilith">Lilith</a> shows that the disambiguation is <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lilith_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Lilith (disambiguation)">Lilith (disambiguation)</a>? If you're worried about this "Lilith (comics)" being created again at some point (I still don't see why not), a redirect can solve this problem.

<dd>It's entirely possible that someone editing a comics article will use the disambiguator of (comics) here, not knowing that what they're looking for is at a more specific title.

Also, they tend to change quite a lot, which is why there's a new GB each year. In addition, the vast majority of them arent really notable outside their GB entries. A few have become somewhat iconic, like the fat twins on the little bikes, and a few are more than notable enough outside their GB accomplishments (like Thomas Edison's GB mention for most patents). Those are the exceptions, though, and there are tens of thousands more for whom nothing else can be said than they helped roast the world's biggest weenie in 1962. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 15:28, Jan 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep somehow</b> Yes it is a joke but maybe a significant historial joke. I heard Prof. Woodward, the organic chemist, make it 40 years ago. He was refering, ironically, to a chemical synthesis involving a multiplicity of aromatic rings.

<ul>
<li>It turns out that this kind of compound made it in a chemistry <a href="http://chemmovies.unl.edu/chem_source_pdf/organic_chem.pdf" class="external text" title="http://chemmovies.unl.edu/chem_source_pdf/organic_chem.pdf" rel="nofollow">textbook</a>, p.28 (ethylmethyl chicken wire; together with <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercedes_Benz_58af.html" title="Mercedes Benz">Mercedes Benzene</a>). Hence the votes based on "nonnotability" are moot. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 07:40, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Er, what votes would they be, then? The only vote that mentions notability at all is GRider's Keep vote. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:50, 2005 Feb 1 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also, my search revealed the mainstream usage of the "chickenwire" term in chemistry and <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanotechnology.html" title="Nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a>. Hence the joke has serious connotations, confirming its notability. I guess most voters should have taken a refresher course in organic chemistry. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 07:40, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Many of the voters appear to know more about organic chemistry than you think. They know enough to immediately recognize a long-standing organic chemistry joke (one of several) when they see it. Here's a refresher course: Repeat "Chemists have senses of humour, too." to yourself several hundred times. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:50, 2005 Feb 1 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That I've already learned while surfing the web. Therefore I am baffled by the vote. A long-stading joke deserves some respect. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 15:23, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We aren't discussing whether it deserves respect. We are discussing <i>whether it deserves an encyclopaedia entry</i>. And, as always, that involves answering the two questions whether the encyclopaedia needs an article by this name and whether the encyclopaedia needs this actual article itself. The joke clearly doesn't deserve the encyclopaedia article that it has here. Even if one doesn't read the deletion policy, one just has to look at BJAODN to deduce that Wikipedia has a pretty evident <i>long</i>-standing policy of not including hoax articles. That answers the second question. It's also inappropriate for the encyclopaedia to have an article (other than perhaps a redirect) by this name, which should be clear from the fact that three different people <i>here alone</i> know the joke by three different names (and there is a potentially infinite number of variations on the joke ‚Äî such as 1,1,1729-trimethyl-chickenwire for example). That answers the first. What people have proposed now is, essentially, creating a <i>wholly new article</i> under a <i>wholly new name</i>. And as long as <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a>'s concerns about not simply re-creating <i>this</i> joke article again are addressed, that seems like a reasonable course of action. But that doesn't change the fact that <i>this article</i> by <i>this name</i> should be deleted. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:45, 2005 Feb 2 (UTC)

<li>In fact, this page points at a deficiency of the <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joke.html" title="Joke">Joke</a> article, It is full of silly jokes, but lacks professional jokes (I am speaking not about profession-targeting jokes). This chickenwire may be a seed of it.

<li>Yes, I have already collected all Google-indexed webpages that mention chickenwire in a chemical context and will make an Chicken_wire_(chemistry) article that will be about the joke as well as of the use of the term in at least two other chemical contexts. <a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECacycle_6f2f.html" title="User:Cacycle">Cacycle</a> 09:51, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>This response amuses me to no end. The truth of the matter is that all information is recorded for the sake of human vanity. Why else are logs like this kept? To gague the validity of information based on how many people have made reference to it is ludicrous. If the information is not recorded somewhere, how else are people going to hear about it? This article was written in as much of a unbiased fashion as the author was capable of. The fact that there aren't a million Google hits for this artist does not make the information contained herein any less truthful or real. If this is to be an information resource, isn't it a bit contradictory to remove information from it, based on the fact that not everyone has heard of it? How is an article on this artist any less notable than an article on <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Denver_1bf9.html" title="John Denver">John Denver</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Manson_e590.html" title="Marilyn Manson">Marilyn Manson</a>, or <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberace.html" title="Liberace">Liberace</a> (all of whom have articles here)? Is it because he has not inspired hundreds or thousands? He has inspired one or two... is that not enough? Is it becuase he has not made millions of dollars at what he does? If so, is money a measure of truth? You call yourselves an information resource, yet you are turning away information based on some ephemeral "validity." How is this artist any less valid than, say, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Simpson_3f53.html" title="Jessica Simpson">Jessica Simpson</a>?

<li>I don't think I can summarize my opinion any better than the verbose poster just before me. An artist's popularity (or in this case, lack of it) doesn't make the information any less valuable or valid to those who may have an interest in learning more about him/her. If this is supposed to be an information resource, I don't see a reason to remove information from the page as long as it's verifiable.

<li>Consider my coffee mug. I can verify the existence of the mug, and if so pushed I could verify its size, colour, and structure. Should I therefore write an article about this particular coffee mug? Well, I can if I want to on a server that I own, but I can't just go foisting it off on other people and then act uppity when they complain that my article is boring drivel (which an article about my particular coffee mug would be). This is a ridiculous example, of course, but merely to illustrate that there should be a line drawn somewhere. Wikipedia is here to reflect note, not to create it. In other words, no, inspiring one or two is not enough. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 10:04, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>You're always welcome to write an article about your coffee mug, and then we can go through this whole VfD process again. Fortunately, you understand that your coffee mug probably isn't destined for mass appeal, or really a subject matter that has the potential for mass appeal. While the artist may not -have- said mass appeal, s/he is a subject that possibly could become a more widespread point of curiosity given time. Additionally, after reading back through the policy on deleting articles, and the types of things that are permissible, I'm even more convinced this should be a <b>Keep</b>er. I don't think it's too over-the-top or promotional in nature to justify the entry on Wikipedia.

<li>Fame has nothing to do with relevance. Policy of Wikipedia even dictates that this not be argued in discussions about deletion. A page should not be cast away as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous. There is presently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required for a page to be included in Wikipedia, and therefore, lack of fame should be completely ignored in deletion debates. Furthermore, it should be noted that an article is not a "vanity" page simply because it was written by its subject. Articles about existing books, movies, games, and businesses are not "vanity" so long as the content is kept to salient material and not overtly promotional. This page doesn't fall under "overtly promotional", it is informational. It therefore doesn't fall under any criteria for deletion. A relevant argument in favor of deletion has yet to be made.

<li>There is no Wikipedia policy that says fame can't be used in a discussion like this one. The fact that there is no consensus regarding the degree of recognition does mean that fame is irrelevant or that it can't be used as a criterion for deletion. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 04:33, Jan 30, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Influence, not fame. You can be obscure, but very important (I've argued in favour of articles for full professors who aren't exactly famous outside of their fields). But someone with next to no influence whatsoever isn't deserving of an article anymore than my coffee mug is. Furthermore, extreme obscurity will tend to result in a very reduced number contributing to the article, making verification reliant on the point of view of the author. As for your vanity argument - if a game, book or movie ever writes its own article, I'll be surprised. Besides, you are specifically instructed not to write about yourself on the editing page when you create a new article. 12:34, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, This seems like a pretty clear case of something that doesn't belong. As for the argument that "if the information isn't recorded somewhere, how else will people hear about it", the information IS recorded somewhere. The author/band has other places where this information is available. Of course there are lines drawn about what is valid for inclusion. This is an online encyclopedia.

<li>The question begs to be asked: What, exactly, is <i>influential</i>? This artist is part of a small group that has, nigh single-handedly, inspired a resurgance in the central california industrial music scene. Before Entropy Five's emergence there was next to no attention paid to this genre of music in the area between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Now, there are monthly (if not more) live industrial shows in this region, as well as several new clubs opening their doors. The influence may not be on a world-wide level. But, to quote Wikipedia policy: "A page should not be cast away as 'vanity' simply because the subject is not famous." Likewise, Wikipedia policy states that "it's preferable that the initial author not be someone affiliated with the project," but does not expressly forbid it. At this point, I see no logical, moral, or semantic reason that this article should be deleted.

<li>Going strictly by the rules of Wikipedia, the article should not be deleted. To whit: 1) music or business-related pages are not considered 'vanity' pages simply because the musician or business is not well-known, 2) authorship of an article by the subject of said article is not grounds for a ruling of 'vanity', 3) obscurity of subject is not grounds for judgement on the 'worth' of the article. That being said, the initial 'delete' request was made due to the assumption the article was a vanity piece - which, under the rules of Wikipedia, is provably false. With regards to the 'usefulness' of the article, it's true it's not going to appeal to a large number of people. But as counterpoint to that, how is that different than an article on the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Realians.html" title="Realians">Realians</a> of <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenosaga.html" title="Xenosaga">Xenosaga</a>, or an article on the home planet of the <a href="../../../x/e/l/Xel%27Naga_09ee.html" title="Xel'Naga">Xel'Naga</a>, <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zerus.html" title="Zerus">Zerus</a>?

<li>This article goes well beyond being a specialized interest. No evidence is given that anyone aside from Dominick Balsamo give a whit about Entropy 5. There is no evidence given that anyone ever purchased a single recording by Entropy 5, or that anyone ever chose to see Entropy 5 perform. There is no reason to suspect that anyone cares at all. The links you provided are to games released by major companies; Entropy 5 is or was recorded by some record label of no apparent note (the author of this article didn't even feel the label was important enough for an article, for example). <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 05:07, Jan 30, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I find it absurd that smply because someone hasn't caved into the mainstream conformity of MTV or the Lillith Fair it is being argued that they shouldn't be recorded for history. Entropy 5 is a cultural phenomenon riding the left coast between Santa Barbara and San Francisco. If you speak with any involved industrial musician from the this region, they can site Entropy 5 as a band with gritty raw talent and the promise of gut wrenching struggle towards the difficult success of the industrial "scene". History is what we make of it and Entropy 5 makes it every show, every release, and every moment it creates. Why wouldn't history be listed in a forum such as this?

<li><b>Comment</b>: I like the guy's music, too. Doesn't mean he's worthy of being included in an encyclopedia. "It's information" is not a valid argument. What I had for breakfast this morning is also information. It's not encyclopedic. "All information is recorded for the sake of human vanity?" Sophistry. Not all information is equal in value. Encyclopedias exist to document those people, things, and events which have had an impact on history, the arts, or the sciences. Many musicians have done so. Not all musicians have done so. Entropy Five has not done so, to the best of my knowledge and the limits of my research (and yes, I have lived in the area in question). If they are, in fact, influential, then point us to something that shows that influence. Newspaper or magazine articles? Records of extensive live performances, along the lines of a tour schedule? Other bands citing him as an influence? Anything? If he's truly influential, then it shouldn't be too difficult to find such secondary sources. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 22:43, Jan 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>

However, users who vote on VfD whos only other edits are to the page being VfD'd (if there are any other edits at all) tend to be received with the same credibility as sockpuppets. As for the "fan base", there are 13 people reading the E5 blog. Last month there was a "new religion" that got VfD'd, and they had over 300 members.

<li>1)The article was posted in the blog after it was posted here. 2)The initial distributor was taken over by a larger company and shut down. All artists were let go. These things happen in the independant music world. 3) The material is scheduled to be re-released this year (see the article). 4) The follow up record is due out in mid-2005 and is currently in post-production. 5)What's wrong with a band playing an intimate set for fans only, on a holiday?

<li>Nothing is 'wrong' with playing for small groups or a local community. On the other hand, the fact that his distributor was unsuccessful enough that it was taken over and its artists dropped doesn't help support a claim to notability. That this happens a lot in the independent music world is moot‚Äìa lot of independent artists aren't sufficiently notable for Wikipedia. From their own website, they seem to perform quite infrequently. If this year's scheduled album release(s) generate some buzz, then the question can be revisted.

<li><b>Delete</b>. One guy has a "band"- and by this I mean he makes music himself, submits himself to Wiki, and tries to say that he's amazingly influential in the scene. Come back when more than just your friends have heard of you.

<li><i>Unsigned vote by User:209.179.141.34. Only edit is to this page.</i></li>
<li>You guys are the one who has been calling this artist a "band." No claims of band membership were made in the article. Likewise, there are no rules barring self-submission. The artist never claimed to be amazingly influential, either. Those claims were made by other users in this thread. z0mb1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. While I've used Wikipedia for a while, this made me take a closer look at how the site runs, and it's sad to see such an asinine elitist popularity game. The point has been made that band popularity is not a criteria for delisting. Keep the posting. It's something real. A real band, with legitimate effort in it, from someone's ideas of music. Entropy 5 may not be big, but it has plainly been enjoyed and listened to outside of someone's garage. I'd like to think even smaller things are worthy of remembering for posterity, and Wikipedia has always seemed a good place for that.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am a fairly new user to Wiki and this is my first comment on a VfD post. I read the rules for deletion, and it seems to me that this page doesn't hit on any of the "Delete" options. Keeping with other articles I have seen here on bands or singers, and removing the "fame" factor from the equation, the page isn't really a Vanity post at all. The music is good, I have heard a few of the bands songs in the past, and I don't see this article as innappropriate. My own opinion may be ignored over those of more experienced users, but I believe my opinion is valid. <a href="../../../s/a/c/User%7ESacrosanct_af87.html" title="User:Sacrosanct">sacrosanct</a>

<li><b>Keep</b> By the rules cited for deletions, it is unnecessary to even be having this poll. Aside from that, however, this is an artist of note in the Santa Barbara music/club scene. He's brought a resurgence of the popularity of the industrial music genre, and has sparked both interest and attendance in clubs he's played in. The artist does have a significant fan base in the SB area, and has been influential (in a city-wide sense) for over a year; over the course of which, I might add, his musical presence has transcended city borders and popped up in conversations I've had with other gearheads along the coast of California. Just because his music hasn't hit the big time yet doesn't mean that it's not of note. I vote strongly to leave the article as is.Spooktress 19:34, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Supporters have a right to be informed and given a chance to act. No threats were made, nor rewards offered for inclusion in this thread. Supporters were informed of the situation and came here to vote on their own volition. The argument here is in regard to the validity of the artist, and the fact that others show interest verifies validity. z0mb1
<ul>
<li>A band with 6 or 7 supporters? Yeah, that's notable. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:25, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One supporter proves interest. Fame, media presence, and profitability do not prove validity. The perpetuation of the idea that they do just supports shallow, capitalistic ideals (not that capitalism is all bad... but when it is your only motivation, there is a problem) that degrade and negate the idea of simple concepts like <i>artistic integrity</i>. is the artist doing something at least <i>slightly</i> original? are they doing it for the love of the craft? is <i>anyone</i> paying attention? are those people being encouraged to <i>think</i> and possibly even <i>take action</i> because of this artist and his/her product? if so, then you have an artist of note who has done their job. z0mb1
<ul>
<li>That's all great, but this is about whether or not the band is notable enough to deserve an encyclopedia article. All evidence so far indicates it is not. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:42, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>An encyclopedia, by definiton, is "a work that contains information on <i>all</i> branches of knowledge or treats comprehensively a <i>particular branch</i> of knowledge usually in articles arranged alphabetically often by subject" (Merriam-Webster). This is a repository for unbiased, factual information. It is not the position for a fact record to make moral decision on a subject save that the information is fact and not opinion. Therefore the overall validity of a subject is not to be judged and the information should be allowed to exist on its own merit. There were no opinions expressed in this article, nor falsehood perpetrated... Therefore it qualifies as encyclopedic text. That's the beauty of the information age: that facts, no matter how big or small, can be recorded for posterity and future review. This is not a popularity contest or a celebrity review. It is a place for facts to be recorded and stored.z0mb1
<ul>
<li>There's plenty of information on music and bands on Wikipedia, so I think we're covered on that particular "branch of knowledge". Wikipedia is not intended as a repository of all known facts, but rather, as an encyclopedia, containing articles on all <b>significant</b> topics. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:16, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As long as there are subjects to keep people informed about, there will never be a case of a branch of knowledge being "covered." By that rationale, it would be fair to say that information and news on natural disasters, wars, diseases, and human suffering have been "covered." In <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>'s article on itself, it says nothing about it being a judge of information's significance. All that matters is that the information is unbiased, factual, and not just a dictionary definition. z0mb1
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia doesn't cover what I ate for lunch today either. This band is equally notable. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 04:42, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Quote "Certain individuals are claiming that this article falls under the category of "band vanity" and is not a valid cultural phenomena simply because E5 is not a world-renowned act that has made millions of dollars." from the bands website is an outrageous slur against wikipedia. You don't have to have done be world-renowned or have made millions of dollars to be noteworthy enough for an article. Rather than throwing accusations, why not demonstrate WHY Entropy Five deserves it's own page. How many copies of the first album did you sell? How many people do you attract to your performances? What record company interest do you have? How widely are you known? If I went up to an average person in your city/town and said 'Have you heard of Entropy Five?', what sort of answer would I get? Make a good faith effort to show you aren't just using wikipedia to advertise, and you actually are of sufficient interest to people GENERALLY to warrant inclusion, and you might just be surprised.

<li>Read over this text string again and tell me that's not what this argument is about. Just because one shares an unpleaseant truth, it does not mean that they are "bashing" anyone.<i>comment by anon user:68.6.69.192</i></li>
<li>Agreed. I find this incredibly insulting. I have written articles on such MTV fodder as the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_Niger_f7da.html" title="Music of Niger">music of Niger</a>, while many other wonderful Wikipedians have written about huge pop stars like <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supply_Belcher_9984.html" title="Supply Belcher">Supply Belcher</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attila_the_Hun_%28calypsonian%29_d0b4.html" title="Attila the Hun (calypsonian)">Attila the Hun (calypsonian)</a>. If Entropy 5 has any notability whatsoever, or is of interest to anyone besides the individual in question, show some actual evidence. We're talking about California, here, not an Internet-poor third-world-country, so there must be some evidence that somebody cares on the web. Or hell, cite a book, if you can. Cite a movie or a TV show or radio program, or pretty much anything, but don't just make vague claims about importance and expect everyone to buy it. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 05:07, Jan 30, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The proof of truth within the "slur," as you put it, is in your comment and the previous one: The artist is upset by the fact that validity is being judged by media acceptance over quality of content. Through your comments you have proven his observation to be true. The fact that the artist exists and that his work is prolific can be found at his site. What more do you need? Is mass acceptance really the only source for notability. In my opinion, if you answer "yes" to that, this situation is truly sad indeed. And as far as referring to this article as "troll bait" goes, I ask you this: Do supporters not have a right to be informed and be heard? I've read nothing on this site to indicate that it was designed to be an exclusive club. Free and open resource means free and open resource. If you don't like it, maybe you should be lobbying for the people who run this site to change some rules. <i>comment by anon user:68.6.69.192</i>

<li>No, "supporters" do not have a right "to be informed and be heard" on Wikipedia. You appear to have mistaken Wikipedia for some sort of vanity site or blog; it is, in fact, an Encyclopedia.
