<li>My reasons would be slightly different. The article as written is a nonsensical bunch of largely rumored statements, but that's an argument for improvement not deletion. However this doesn't merit the effort to improve it for several reasons. For starters virtually all persecution by Jews, and here's where I part company with many here as I think there probably was some, occurred in ancient times that are hard to verify. We don't deal with ancient religious persecutions because of that and because no one had an idea of religious freedom then. I know some prefer to believe that in pre-Christian times everyone was tolerance and sweetness, but in reality most empires or kingdoms punished those who rejected the official or civic religion. I don't see any reason to think the Jewish kingdoms of ancient times were any worse, or also enough better, to merit any special attention on this. Also I don't entirely approve of any of these "persecution by" articles as there a recipe to say "Aren't XYZ terrible!" and heap on. Lastly it really is non-notable and an opener to a hate-fest as mentioned.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 14:22, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Ancient Persia was tolerant and allowed people to worship whatever they wanted. They were too tolerant, if you ask me. Rome was, for the most part, also tolerant, but they also required that you sacrifised to the Emperor. It doesn't matter if sources from ancient times cannot be verified as well as other sources. They are sources and Wiki allows those sources to be used. If those sources would not qualify, then we would have very few articles about the ancient world. But, as usual, when it comes to criticizing Jews, it is not allowed; what is allowed is to say how Jews were persecuted. Yeah, okay, I got it. It's quite obvious that you guys are organizing yourself on Wiki. I've noticed this on RfCs and I've noticed this here. You message fellow Jews to support your side. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Candide, or Optimism</a> 06:12, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'll give you Persia, mostly. However <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shapur_II_of_Persia_3e1c.html" title="Shapur II of Persia">Shapur II of Persia</a> and a few other Sassanids persecuted religious minorities. I won't give you Romans because this is one of those "polytheists are wonderful" mythos. By their own admission Romans desecrated other faiths on conquest, drove people to genocide, and punished religions that could not reconcile or syncretize with the Roman pantheon.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li>What about treatment of non-Jews and Jewish heretics under traditional Jewish law, for instance? What about treatment today of those brought up as Orthodox Jews who then cease their observation of Jewish law? Has there been any systematic analysis of this? The <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shulchan_Aruch_cbbe.html" title="Shulchan Aruch">Shulchan Aruch</a> states that if a close relative dies who was a heretic, then rather than observing the normal week of mourning, one should wear white clothes and celebrate the end of an enemy of God. Doesn't this deserve mention somewhere (along with the fact that this prescription is rarely observed, and the question of what exactly a "heretic" is)? This is a perfectly reasonable topic to write about, an interesting subset of Jewish history. The current content is probably lousy, but the topic is fine. Work it out, don't just delete it. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 18:53, 20 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't oppose any and all articles concerning periods or movements within Judaism that are more militant/persecuting. However what you're talking about is largely fights within Jewish culture.(Who is Jewish, how do you treat "heretics", etc) What concerns other things I think can be dealt with in other ways. Perhaps something on the Jewish kingdoms or on debates among Jewish people. This is too open to abuse I feel. Added to that ancient persecutions are too difficult to prove or even understand in our day.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<li>I think the "Persecution by" articles are probably the more contentious ones. "Persecution of" doesn't necessarily lead to blaming any religion, but the "persecution by" leads far more easily to agenda-driving. I know of some people who dislike all the Abrahamic faiths and would be happy to read about all of them persecuting people to "prove" they are so awful. Related to that there isn't any "Persecution by..." Hindus, Buddhists, etc articles.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<li>The problem is determining where to draw the line between persecution by religious people (which is what the name of the article suggests), which is singularly unencyclopedic, and persecution by governments which is done in concert with or as a result of religious authorities urging them to do so in an official capacity. Even in Biblical times, there were no such persecutions by Jews or Jewish-run governments, nor are there even today. The only point in keeping such an article, in fact, would be to say "This phenomenon doesn't exist" or something similar thereto... <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 17:03, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Things it could note: Biblical commands to wipe out Amalekites, Canaanites, etc.; any findings on how those of other religions were treated under the Maccabean Kingdom and later; how apostates and non-Jews have historically been treated and are treated today (e.g., see if we can find news stories about tolerance toward and/or ostracism of those who "went off the path", and instructions from halachic authorities such as the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> on how to deal with such heretics); non-Jews' status in Israel; and non-Jews' status under traditional, Conservative, Reform, and other variants of Jewish law. There's a great deal to discuss here, every bit encyclopedic, and it shouldn't be thrown away just because the current content is incomplete.
<p>For those who've noticed the remarkable prevalence of Jews here, I would like to note that <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">User:IZAK</a> e-mailed me to point out this page, which of course doesn't show up on his edit history. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 18:41, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Simetrical needs to apologize very quickly here and now for his highly offensive comment that "...For those who've noticed the remarkable prevalence of Jews here..." which is totally disgusting and out of line. What is he saying, that Jews should "shut up"&#160;? This just reinforces the need to delete articles of this nature that are poisonous magnets that attract the wrong kind of misinformed and twisted debate and responses. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 08:35, 22 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To copy my response from the other vote: I'm certainly not apologizing for commenting on there being a remarkable prevalence of Jews here, because there <i>is</i>. How on Earth is that offensive? Stop trying to suggest that anyone who disagrees with you is an anti-Semite—you've lost an RFAr on that already for good reason.
<p>I was pointing out that you were electioneering, nothing more. You deliberately attempted to skew the proportion of Jews to non-Jews here to well over normal levels, thereby making the vote unrepresentative, and you know it. Don't get upset where you're called out. Not that such electioneering is necessarily prohibited on Wikipedia, but it could be taken into account by the closing admin if the vote were closer than it is. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 06:17, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I didn't find it offensive exactly, although it did make me uncomfortable. I don't like the implication that it's mostly or largely Jewish people voting delete. It seems a bit patronizing or something. Many of us who voted delete are Gentiles. In my case I've known very few Jewish people in life. However a few things make delete sensible. For starters we don't do "Persecution by" articles for other religions that generally lacked a political apparatus to persecute and represent less than 1% of the world's people. There is no Persecution by Sikhs article and there's almost certainly not going to be either. We also don't do ancient persecution by articles either. We could do an article on "Religious persecution in ancient times" and include the Jewish kingdoms, but that's a different issue. As it stands it seems like unfairly singling Jewish people out as any persecution they did is just not as noteworthy as that of Muslims or Christians.(Or Buddhists or Confucians for that matter)--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 14:24, 24 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't mean to imply that this was a reason for calling off the vote or anything. I just find it appropriate, whenever someone contacts me to vote on something, to note that that person contacted me. Clearly non-Jews as well as Jews seem to feel that this article should be deleted. (I'm an Orthodox Jew myself, in case you don't know.) —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 00:29, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Simetrical: There is process and method and then there is meaning and intent. While there may be disagreement about what is the best process and method on Wikipedia, there is no disagreement about the meaning and intent of the phrase you used "...For those who've noticed the remarkable prevalence of Jews here..." which you now compound (for the worse) by saying "...You deliberately attempted to skew the proportion of Jews to non-Jews here to well over normal levels..." (implying that Wikipedia works with some sort of racial or religious "quota system", which it does not). Most impartial and knowledgeable people would say your comments are truly unfortunate and VERY nasty, to say the least. I have not and did not use the words "anti-Semite" here and I have not accused you of being one (so quit playing "victim" please). I merely brought your attention to the fact that you continue to make tasteless and disgusting slurs, considered insulting by many people -- not just Jews -- that would be deemed beneath contempt and not to be uttered in polite company, which you should apologize for, and not, as you continue to do, reinforce and self-righteously "justify". Furthermore, you make it sound that I am running for some sort of office by using the word "electioneering" which is all rather strange. Oh, and I am not getting upset, do you think I should be? <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 07:27, 24 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia does not have any kind of "quota system". However, AFDs are theoretically supposed to derive their authority from community consensus, and therefore they should as much as possible represent a cross-section of the community. Jews are, I would expect (although I could be wrong), a lot more likely to vote delete here than other groups, and therefore you skewed the demographics of the vote considerably by mass-informing Jews of the debate. This may not have made a difference, of course, but I still find it distasteful, particularly when you did it untraceably.
<p>You never used the word "anti-Semite". You just called my statement "disgusting", "out of line", "highly offensive", "misinformed", and "twisted", and suggested that I was implying that all Jews should "shut up". Now, might you have reacted the same way if I had remarked on a preponderance of Shinto in an AFD for a hypothetical Persecution of non-Shinto by Shinto article? Perhaps. Based on your past actions, I'm inclined to think the contrary.</p>
<p>The term <i>electioneering</i> is generally used in actual elections, but can be used to refer to other votes as well. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 00:29, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

There is always some POV when discussing religious matters (or arguing, as my Conservative Jewish Father does with his Othodox Jewish brother-in-law).

<li>What <b>encyclopedic</b> content do you foresee this article including? More to the point, what encyclopedic content parallelling the content of the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_by_Muslims_14bb.html" title="Persecution by Muslims">Persecution by Muslims</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_by_Christians_2b03.html" title="Persecution by Christians">Persecution by Christians</a> articles do you foresee this article including? Some badly-behaved charedim in the Old City who spit on Christians don't really qualify. The destruction of `Amaleq is hardly "Persecution by Jews" as it was a war against an enemy bent on destroying the Jews. And therein lies the critical problem with arguing that Persecution by Jews is a parallel to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_by_Muslims_14bb.html" title="Persecution by Muslims">Persecution by Muslims</a> or <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_by_Christians_2b03.html" title="Persecution by Christians">Persecution by Christians</a>: as I've said before, to qualify for comparison, Jews would have to (a) be in power somewhere and (b) have that power directed by religious authorities. Except during a brief period with the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Maccabees.html" title="Maccabees">Maccabees</a>, that has <i>never</i> happened, anywhere. While mention of the Maccabees incident is encyclopedic, it belongs in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_0aaa.html" title="History of the Jews">History of the Jews</a> (where it is, btw.) ... The idea that this article (to say nothing of <i>two</i> articles!) needs to stay as some sort of "balance" is just silly. Would you support a Persecution by Mormons article? Persecution by Jehovah's Witnesses? Persecution by Quakers? Persecution by Druzes? <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_by_Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%ADs_5ee8.html" title="Persecution by Bahá'ís">Persecution by Bahá'ís</a>? (don't be fooled by the blue link...that's actually a redirect to "Persecution <i>of</i> Bahá'ís!) Persecution by Jains? Persecution by Sikhs?

If there is a strongly held conviction that every religious group should have an article titled "Persecution of non-&lt;religious group&gt; by &lt;religious group&gt;", then we should prioritize it by the size of the religious group, in which Buddhists, Hindus, Taoists, Confusian adherents, etc., are covered before we get around to the Jews. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 19:09, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>First off, I didn't realize people had to take a number before submitting an article. In response to TShilo12, if there is valid information on any topic, shouldn't there at least be a stub about it. There are plenty of news articles supporting claims of Jewish intolerance be it from non-secular news sources, non-Jewish religious news sources or even Heeb Magazine and groups such as Jewish Voice for Peace. Obviously both of the "persecution by Jews" articles are filled with non-sourced, sometimes outright, bigoted statements, but that shouldn't condemn a topic as valueless, just it's current content. And just so you know, I wouldn't support any article simply because someone might have this or that viewpoint and is using Wikipedia as a soapbox, but if the topic has merit by virtue of undeniable observables then it deserves mention. And as to its encyclopedic credibility, would it not be true that if a topic can conceivably be the source of a respectable college thesis, then it deserves to be in an encyclopedia? <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrika_fdff.html" title="User:Grika">Grika</a> 21:47, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
