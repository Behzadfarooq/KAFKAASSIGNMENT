<li><b>Keep</b>. This list would be a very useful adjunct to an article on disabilities and public perception of disabilities. Furthermore, the criteria for films being included in the list is well-defined-- the film must be about a disabled person. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 05:53, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it fit the definition <i>the film must be about a disabled person</i> that would be something worth hanging on to, but look at the list of movies - most of them have nothing at all to do with disabilities or disabled people, they merely feature a disabled character. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 18:19, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then you should remove those films from the list. The list is titled "films with disabled protagonists" not "films with a disabled character in them somewhere." <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_Day_at_Black_Rock_ddbd.html" title="Bad Day at Black Rock">Bad Day at Black Rock's</a> main character is missing an arm. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Best_Years_of_Our_Lives_9a16.html" title="The Best Years of Our Lives">The Best Years of Our Lives</a> is about three disabled military veterans. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Elephant_Man_df01.html" title="The Elephant Man">The Elephant Man</a> is about a person with neurofibromatosis.

<li><b>Keep</b> If the protagonist is disabled, the disability is inherently a plot point.

<li><b>Comment</b> actually, there are several lists of this type that might be much better as a merged larger article with information about the disabilities portrayed in each film: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_about_disability.html" title="List of films about disability">List of films about disability</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_with_disabled_protagonists.html" title="List of films with disabled protagonists">List of films with disabled protagonists</a>, List of films involving amputees, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_featuring_mental_illness.html" title="List of films featuring mental illness">List of films featuring mental illness</a> and List of films featuring blind characters, many of which have been nominated for deletion by <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> and are thus also currently undergoing their own AfD debates at this time. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 05:10, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - That the protagonist is disabled is an important thematic element for the films in this list. It's not "trivial" information. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 21:41, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I maintain that the arguments above stating a film with a disabled protagonist implies a common, important thematic element are inherently flawed. <i>IFF</i> the assertion could be made that a disabled protagonist meant that the film would make use of the disability as a major plot element, then I would be willing to concede the point and vote for a keep. However, that kind of assumption cannot be made - just because the protagonist suffers a disability does NOT universally imply that the disability will play an important, or even passing, role in the film. As a case in point, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Matrix_Revolutions_ff92.html" title="The Matrix Revolutions">The Matrix Revolutions</a> is included in this list because the protagonist, Neo, is blinded during the film. Thus this film fits the criteria in that the protagonist is disabled. However the movie does not focus on his blindness, nor does it take a central role in the plot. At best, it only serves to introduce his pseudo-magic powers, and is henceforth a discarded element in the plot. I am not familiar with all the movies in that list, but it is not unreasonable to imagine a movie in which a protagonist suffers some sort of disability that does not however figure prominently, or perhaps at all, in the film's plot. Therefore this list becomes about as useful as a List of films with male protagonists - it is simply an arbitrary list of films with an arbitrary inclusion criterion. I am not at all opposed to a merge with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_about_disability.html" title="List of films about disability">List of films about disability</a>, however, I have to strongly argue against the case for keeping this list as it stants. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 15:46, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> - How people with disabilities are portrayed in literature is certainly a legitimate matter of interest. The Matrix trilogy poses problems for any study since it questions the very meaning of reality. That said, the notion that a blind or deaf person is endowed with compensating superior powers in other realms is a common disability stereotype and The Matrix is arguable a good example. Why, we might ask, did the writer choose that particular injury for a character in a savior role? Anyway, a few difficult cases should not invalidate the validity of a list.--<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 16:53, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> - Thank you for elaborating on your position. I'm sure your comparison of this list to List of films with male protagonists must be intended as an exaggeration, but I understand your concern about the inclusion of outliers. Nevertheless, I would argue that while it is <i>possible</i> that a film with a disabled protagonist would not address disability in any way, one would expect that such films would be less usual. Repectfully, I must still disagree. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 01:33, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>&#160;: Regardless of the result of this AfD, our aim should be to turn this and many other film lists into informative articles, with an explanation (or "summary") for each entry, with merges wherever this would help us organize the matterial better and with a cleanup or expansion to justify the title. A mere "Keep" shouldn't indicate that we should have lists that are just substitutes to categories. During this massive AfD, the US Marines list was transformed into a good example of what we could do here too. <a href="../../../h/o/v/User%7EHoverfish_6f42.html" title="User:Hoverfish">Hoverfish</a> <small><a href="../../../h/o/v/User_talk%7EHoverfish_2aee.html" title="User talk:Hoverfish">Talk</a></small> 09:15, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
