<li><b><s>Delete</s></b>: Show some references, some mentions of the importance, some usage other than the catalog. Otherwise, voting to keep is voting against the deletion guidelines. Further "notable" isn't a justification for an article. This is one model in the IKEA catalog. While the Billy might make it (as one of their oldest units and the first to be popular, and therefore the one that made the company successful), this isn't a Billy. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:23, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Some usage other than the catalogue was in fact already in the article. It wasn't immediately obvious, I grant you. But it should be now. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:18, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>N.b. Uncle G and others have been rewriting and improving the article. I still can't quite change my vote, as I think 1980 doesn't really make this one of the Sofas that Made IKEA, but the article as it is now is vastly superior to the one that I and the above voted on. My vote now is a much weakened delete. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:19, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> after the rewrites. I'm <i>still</i> not convinced that anything new when I went to college is a "classic," but this is a well done article now. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:45, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> as a notable product.

<dd><b>Keep</b> - I didn't consider one article (discounting the passing references in the other sources) to be 'multiple non-trival published works', so as far as I was concerned it was failing <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. However a little digging brings up a few articles specifically about the Klippan, and since the original research has been removed I have to change to a 'Keep'. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> 09:43, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Oh no ya don't</b> No sofa models from Ikea, please. I think there's probably something like 25,000 Ikea products, and none of them are notable...even if I'm sittin on one now. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 14:05, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>As per <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, the primary criterion for products and services is that they be the subjects of multiple non-trivial published works that are independent of their companies. The vast number of IKEA products will not satisfy that criterion, their only mentions being in product catalogues. <i>However, this one does.</i> There was a whole study published about how this <i>specific</i> sofa burns, for one thing. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:08, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> the fire safety report isn't about this sofa in particular - in the report they use three custom built sofas based on the Klippan (probably because it is a common make) <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> 17:38, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, it is. It's about this very sofa with various different flame retardants applied to it. From page 12 of the source cited by the article: <i>The IKEA sofa “Klippan” was used as the model for all three sofas.</i> <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:08, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The study is about fire safety regulations, not about fire safety in the Klippen model, and the sofas are based on the Klippen model rather than being the Klippen: <i>Three different sofas were used for this study, all based on a standard, commercially available European model sold by IKEA (the “Klippan” model). This model is currently marketed with a mainly polystyrene rigid frame, but for this study a wooden frame was used because this is more representative of typical furniture on the market.</i> I'd say this amounted to trival coverage (even if it wasn't a fire safety report). - <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> 23:39, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - if this sofa really did make it as an iconic piece of design like the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barcelona_chair.html" title="Barcelona chair">Barcelona chair</a>, then it would be a keep, but there's one newpaper article about it. A fire safety test report doesn't count, nor does a mere mention of the product in the Kuwaiti Times. At best, merge into <a href="../../../i/k/e/Ikea.html" title="Ikea">Ikea</a>. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 19:49, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reference to the Kuwaiti Times is to source the previously contested point that the sofa is named after the place in Sweden. Not everything has the purpose of establishing notability. Sometimes a source is being cited for the simple reason of providing a reference for something in the article that needs to be sourced. ☺ <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:39, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Note</b> Verifiability/references for this topic are not a problem. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_46/b3959008.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_46/b3959008.htm" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a BusinessWeek story on the history of the Klippan. And <a href="http://www.sundayherald.com/56470" class="external text" title="http://www.sundayherald.com/56470" rel="nofollow">here</a> is one from the Scotland Sunday Herald. I'm sure it would be possible to find quite a lot more, especially if we count interior/industrial design magazines and such. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 01:43, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: I think the Sunday Herald article is sufficient to establish that the sofa is considered a significant piece of design. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 02:38, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The sofa looks notabler and notabler with each of the references added, and if Lars Engman is the main designer of this sofa (and probably many other mass-produced and recognized pieces of furniture) and the current chief designer of IKEA, he should probably have an article too. I found some references to Klippan (commonly called a "classic") in a Swedish newspaper article database. I haven't looked through all of the hits, but the current head of IKEA Sweden, Jeanette Söderberg, declared Klippan to be her favorite IKEA product in an interview in <a href="../../../s/v/e/Svenska_Dagbladet_4adf.html" title="Svenska Dagbladet">Svenska Dagbladet</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_22.html" title="January 22">01-22</a>). According to an article in <a href="../../../a/f/t/Aftonbladet.html" title="Aftonbladet">Aftonbladet</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>-<a href="../../../s/e/p/September_13.html" title="September 13">09-13</a>) on "why men like leather sofas", <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Pierre_Barda_a5f7.html" title="Jean-Pierre Barda">Jean-Pierre Barda</a>, Swedish celebrity hairdresser and former member of <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_of_Lovers_a383.html" title="Army of Lovers">Army of Lovers</a>, had a Klippan in brown cowhide at home. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 09:57, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral</b> as the conflicted nominator. Some of the sources seem to be about the Klippan qua paradigmatic IKEA product, rather than qua itself. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireplace_0f6a.html" title="User:Fireplace">Fireplace</a> 22:17, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
