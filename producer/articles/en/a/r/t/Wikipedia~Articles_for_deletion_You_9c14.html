<li><b>Neutral</b>. The article is written fairly encyclopedicly (if that's a word), and since you is (pretty much the only time you can say you is correctly in a sentence) such a common word, it might be worthy of an article. On the other hand, single words usually aren't included in wikipedia, rather they are put in wiktionary.

<li><b>Keep</b> An article is eligible for deletion if it "can never be other then a dictionary definition".

<ul>
<li>Wrong. An article is eligible for deletion if it is a dictionary article, <i>of whatever length</i>, or if it is a stub encyclopaedia article that cannot be expanded, renamed, refactored, or merged into a full encyclopaedia article. The two are quite separate reasons for deletion, and should not be conflated.

<li><b>comment</b>. I'm on the fence with this one. Although it is a definition, which would belong in Wiktionary, it has a lot of encyclopedic content that would not find its way into Wiktionary.

<li><b>Keep</b> on the grounds that this is not "purely dictionary content"; it reads more like an encyclopedia article than a dictionary entry, which would contain a lot less information than this article. Were the article an unexpandable <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICTDEF_5799.html" title="WP:DICTDEF">dictionary definition</a>, then yes, it should go; however, that is not the case with this article. <a href="../../../k/y/r/User%7EKyraVixen_2190.html" title="User:KyraVixen">Kyra</a><sub><a href="../../../k/y/r/User_talk%7EKyraVixen_ac0e.html" title="User talk:KyraVixen">~(talk)</a></sub> 09:34, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>You are conflating unexpandable stub encyclopaedia articles and dictionary articles. Please read the policy that you linked to. It explains how the two are not the same. Dictionary articles don't belong here, <i>whatever length they are (and they can be quite long)</i>. Conversely, stub encyclopaedia articles are not dictionary articles, and we delete/refactor/rename/merge unexpandable stub encyclopaedia articles because they are unexpandable stubs, <i>not</i> because they are dictionary articles (which they are not). <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:52, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It looks like a long dictionary entry with some not really pertinent material to me. In other words, if it was an 'encyclopedic' article, what would it be about? The second person singular and plural pronoun in English, historical aspects of the usage of singular and plural in English, Plural forms in different European languages, the Time person (not pronoun!) of the year 2006? So <b>transwiki</b>, <b>split</b>, <b>merge</b>, but do not keep as it is. <a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikiwont_2b2d.html" title="User:Tikiwont">Tikiwont</a> 14:02, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The bulk of this entry is a padded out dictionary entry (i.e. definitions, pronunciation, etymology). The part about 'thou' is another word entirely (i.e. another <i>dicdef</i>) and the example using <i>thy</i> (=yours) is not about <i>you</i>. Finally, the whole section 'Plural forms in other European languages' in not even about 'you'. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 14:35, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Word has a history beyond what goes into a dictionary, especially in other languages, a factor which is covered in the later sections of the article. For example the social and cultural differences between the French "vous" and "tu" is information which belongs in an encyclopedia rather than a dictionary. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 15:41, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Take a look at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_6567.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The</a>. Basically I think the criteria boils down to whether the discussion of <s>etymology and</s> parallel in other languages justifies an encyclopdiea article. <s>Some of the keep requests here seem persuasive in favor of it, but</s> the "The" article's redirect provides some arguments against. <s>I personally am now hovering around "Neutral."</s> What would be great is if somebody could cite precedent from another "published" encyclopedia. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutocracy_4fe0.html" title="User:Autocracy">Autocracy</a> 19:05, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This is an interesting and encyclopedically-written article, but it's still fundamentally and entirely an expanded dictionary entry. It discusses the etymology and history of the word, but unless you want to see similar articles on literally thousands of other words, this should go. As for the Time thing, let's use the following measure: if Time had instead awarded "Person of the Year" to "Time Readers" (which is basically what "You" means in that context), would they get an article of their own?<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarcasticidealist_b731.html" title="User:Sarcasticidealist">Sarcasticidealist</a> 22:49, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can't prophesize and say that they would, but they should. A single article called Time readers would do no harm, if it worked from the sources- the article itself and the resulting media coverage. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 22:57, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Up to now I have assumed some of the people mentioning the Time person of the year thing were joking. Since it appears they weren't, I just want to emphasize that the Time thing cannot justify keeping an article named "You" on Wikipedia. The Time piece's usage of the word "you" in its title is just that--usage--and it's a dictionary's job, not an encyclopedia's, to document usage of words. If the Time Person-of-the-year-2006 had to be strictly identified, it would be <i>the public</i> or <i>the online public</i>. That <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1569514,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1569514,00.html" rel="nofollow">the piece</a> is a commentary on the public's use of the Internet is evident from reading it and the commentary it engendered such as <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6187113.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6187113.stm" rel="nofollow">this</a>. It has nothing to do with "you," or you, or me, or Time readers as has been suggested (though the piece was <i>addressed</i> to Time readers). We can write material on Time's person of the year 2006 on Wikipedia, but it wouldn't be at <a href="../../../y/o/u/You.html" title="You">You</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:09, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree. It's not a typical usage. Moreover, coming up with our own title for Time's selection would border on OR- Time used "You." BTW, this is not to say that Time's choice was a good one. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 21:12, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Assume for the sake of argument that the article <a href="../../../y/o/u/You.html" title="You">You</a> did contain information about the Time 2006 Person of the Year write-up and reaction to it. Then <i>that</i> would be appropriate Wikipedia content, and the right course of action per <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> would be to transwiki and remove the <i>rest</i> of the content--about the meaning, usage, and etymology of "you"--and to insert a {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWiktionarypar_6f6e.html" title="Template:Wiktionarypar">wiktionarypar</a>}} tag. The important point I should have focused on in my previous comment is that the Time 2006 Person of the Year content has nothing to do with the Wiktionary material about "you," just as Time's 2000 Person of the Year (Bush) has nothing to do with the etymology of the name Bush. (BTW, on OR, I wasn't suggesting that we report in Wikipedia article space that "the online public" is Time's 2006 Person of the Year. I agree, that would be OR unless sources outside of Wikipedia have said it.) <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 22:05, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'd say an appropriate title for the person of the year would be something like You (Time's 2006 Person of the Year), analogous to <a href="../../../y/o/u/You_%28Radiohead_song%29_f414.html" title="You (Radiohead song)">You (Radiohead song)</a> etc. This is disambiguation and not OR. Actually <a href="../../../y/o/u/You_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="You (disambiguation)">You (disambiguation)</a> has an entry for the person which does not lead to <a href="../../../y/o/u/You.html" title="You">You</a> at all. --<a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikiwont_2b2d.html" title="User:Tikiwont">Tikiwont</a> 08:51, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I found this article through grammatical articles like <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammatical_person.html" title="Grammatical person">Grammatical person</a>, looking for information I finally found under <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generic_you.html" title="Generic you">Generic you</a>, through this article's links. Could <a href="../../../y/o/u/You.html" title="You">You</a> be beefed up by conflating <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generic_you.html" title="Generic you">Generic you</a> and any other similar grammatical articles? Wikipedia's grammar articles are very helpful, and losing this one would likely make chains of inquiry like mine (searched for "Second person" --&gt; "Grammatical Person" --&gt; "You" --&gt; "Generic You") more difficult. <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELaPrecieuse_0ad5.html" title="User:LaPrecieuse">LaPrecieuse</a> 20:07, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
