<li><b>KEEP and Stop the Madness</b> This page MUST stay here this time. Spare me your "vanity listing" horsesh*t. I am not related to Warren Kinsella at all. I am just a journalist, radio show host and punk rock enthusiast since many years ago and The Hot Nasties SURE ARE one of Canada's great punk rock act. They do have a 7" and it's called "The Invasion of the Tribbles" and it sells for about 200 $ on eBay most of the times since it's very rare. It's been put on Frank Manley's "Smash The State" Canadian Punk Anthology LP and 7". There were NOT an "unknown high school band" like Arthur Ellis, whoever he might be, says. Like the Fits, Genetic Control, the Dishrags, they were one of those who defined Canada's punk rock sound. So, Mark Bourrie, please STOP asking for deletion just because of a little conflict you have with Mr Kinsella. I know punk rock way more than you do and my record collection is bigger than yours. You destroyed my work once, I sure won't let you do it twice. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.226.160.237 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.226.160.237.html" title="User talk:24.226.160.237">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.226.160.237_e08f.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.226.160.237">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li>Not bad faith nomination. Is every ex-political aide going to have a Wikipedia page for a high school band? The "punk rock scene" in Calgary, Canada, isn't notable. This band put out one self-issued EP twenty five years ago and none of the band members went on in music. The band is mentioned in a book: an autobiography of one member, who is notable for being an aide to a Canadian politician 15 years ago, before the guy became Prime Minister.<br />
Summary: no air play; no major performaces; one self-published album; fringe band of high school kids. "Canadian Punk Band" says it all. CRzRussian may say this is personal, but all I'm asking people to do ius look at the entry, see if it's wiki material, and put their opinion here. Leave personality out of it. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Ellis_81bb.html" title="User:Arthur Ellis">Arthur Ellis</a> 13:58, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Will somebody ever shut-up that jerk Arthur Ellis/Mark Bourrie&#160;? The Hot Nasties WERE influential. When author Frank Manley, who wrote “Smash The State&#160;: A Discography of Canadian Punk, 1977-92”, decided to release a 7” with influential punk songs, the Hot Nasties is one of the bands he picked among HUNDREDS, along with the Fits, Arson and the Rock and Roll Bitches. The Calgary punk rock scene wasn’t notable? Well, the Golden Calgarians, the Sturgeons, Riot 303, Color Me Psycho, Eye on You, Enemy Mind Feel, Beyond Possession, Forbidden Dimension, Silicone Injection and Verdix ALL hailed from Calgary. And the fact that the band has one self-released EP and was a “fringe band of high school kids” is a reason for deletion? Well, then 75% of all punk rock bands must be deleted cause that’s what punk rock was about: young folks playing loud and obnoxious music so no label wanted to sign them, so they had to do it themselves and self release their albums. That’s what D.I.Y. (Do It Yourself) is all about and it’s an important part of punk rock. None of the band members went on in music? UNTRUE. Alan McDonald played in the Sturgeons. No Air Play? Do you know ANY early punk bands who got Airplay? That IS the reason why punk bands SELF RELEASED their albums. Mentionned in ONE BOOK? NO, it is AT LEAST mentionned in two books, i.e. the Frank Manley book I stated before. Again, this guy Arthur Ellis doesn’t know a thing about punk rock so his opinion on that subject shouldn’t matter. He just wants to cause trouble about everything linked with Warren Kinsella. See the Warren Kinsella listing and how it was locked only because of user Arthur Ellis’ manoeuvers. This IS wiki material and PLEASE stop giving some importance to that guy Arthur Ellis on all topics related to Mr Kinsella. 205.237.53.91 18:15, 10 July 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 205.237.53.91 (<a href="../../../2/0/5/User_talk%7E205.237.53.91.html" title="User talk:205.237.53.91">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_205.237.53.91_3345.html" title="Special:Contributions/205.237.53.91">contribs</a>).</small></li>

Additionally, many of the delete voices on this page come form anon IPs whose main "contributions" have been vandalism of Kinsella-related pages.

<li><b>Delete</b> Please check the contributions of the IPs before deciding. You will find Ian King misrepresents them. This is a band that existed 25 years ago in a small market in rural Canada. It never left te market to tour. It self-produced one EP. None of its supporters have been able to show it had any shows in any venue at all. None of the band members made a significant contribution to any aspect of the music industry afterwards. One song has been re-recorded by another Canadian "punk" band, which issued the recording on its own label and has not been shown to have any following outside the very, very narrow niche of Canadian retro-punk rock. When this page was offered up for speedy deletion earlier this month, there was not one single comment, and it was actually deleted. Now Warren Kinsella has managed to muster up a few friends, along with the page-writer and his socks.<br />
