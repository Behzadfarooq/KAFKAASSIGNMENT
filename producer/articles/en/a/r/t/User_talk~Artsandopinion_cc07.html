<p>I thought maybe a better response to your post to my talk page would be to roll up my sleeves and do some editing. I've had a go at re-working the article a little so that the relationship of the writers to the ezine is clear, but we also provide internal wikilinks for the well known authors and links to their articles on Arts and Opinion as citations. It did mean cutting the list down some (more names made it way too cluttered without really adding to the readers' understanding). I'm not sure about all the links to Arts and Opinion, it does make the piece seem more promotional, but we'll see what other editors think. I also tried to elaborate on your mention as you're currently the most notable thing we have about the ezine.</p>
<p>My version isn't set in stone (nothing ever is on Wikipedia), so if you have a problem with anything I changed feel free to say so.</p>
<p>If you can point me to other independent sources about yourself or the ezine that would be great. It really does need more independent evidence of notability, which is generally demonstrated through multiple, nontrivial mentions in respected publications of some type. -- <a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 14:45, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Greetings Siobhan Hansa: I want to first of all thank you for your keen editing and interventions, all of which are very acceptable. At some future point, I'll try to locate more independent sources, leaving you with this internal one from the wiki page on The Piss Christ. I hope the page now passes muster with the other editors, and if yes, an internal citation is owed to you.</p>

Apologies. I didn't realize that inserting what I felt was a legitimate link (not to be cofused with spam) constituted a wiki violation. Question #1: for example, if I feel that one of our articles would be appropriate, as link or reference, to whom should it be sent for vetting. Question #2: When can we we expect a decision regarding the alert box that precedes our wiki entry? Thanking you, Artsandopinion 21:38, 12 February 2007 (UTC)Robert Lewis</p>
<dl>
<dd>For links to your own site that you think will add encyclopedic information to an article, put a request (saying who you are, what the link is and why you think it is appropriate) on the talk page of each article you think the link is appropriate for. Editors of the article who aren't associated with your site will add it to the article if they agree it is appropriate. Most often editors do NOT add such links. You can find an article's talk page by clicking on the <i>discussion</i> tab t the top of the article page right next to the <i>edit this page</i> tab.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When you say alert box on the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arts_and_Opinion_68a8.html" title="Arts and Opinion">Arts and Opinion</a> article I assume you're talking about the notice at the top that talks about notability. That comes off when a suitable assertion about importance (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a> by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>) gets added to the article. That's why I've been asking for mentions of the e-zine by independent, reliable sources (Wikipedia mentions don't count - we don't consider ourselves "reliable"). If the notice stays up much longer without anything substantial being done to address the concern, the article is likely to be <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EProd_cc68.html" title="WP:Prod">prodded</a> or <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">nominated</a> for deletion. -- <a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 23:31, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Arts &amp; Opinion has received personal article reprint permission from the likes of Leon Weiseltier (New Republic) and Mark Kingwell. Would their e-mails constitute credible assertions of importance? If not, what would? Artsandopinion 16:26, 13 February 2007 (UTC)Robert Lewis</p>
<dl>
<dd>No. Verification has to have been published by someone. We don't accept or support authors' <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> (which checking up on these emails would be). We write articles based on already published information. Most of the time the notability issue boils down to whether or not you've been noticed by mainstream media - for instance articles in well respected newspapers; or are the subject of independent study by a respected academic; or there are significant non-trivial mentions of you in authoritative niche media.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Each case is considered on its merits, so there are no hard and fast rules. In general press releases, statements by the Arts and Opinion e-zine (or people connected with it) and the like are only acceptable if they have been subject to appropriately rigorous fact checking by a respected, independent 3rd party and do not appear to be the result of public relations or marketing efforts by the subject. If other people haven't noticed the publication enough to have published some form of independent analysis of it, it probably doesn't meet the notability criteria. -- <a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 17:32, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Citing your 'so there are no hard and fast rules.' and appealing to your sense of fair play and flexibility as it applies to merit, Noam Chomsky, Mark Kingwell, Robert Fisk, Michael Moore, Jean Baudrillard, Barbara Ehrenreich, Arundhati Roy etc would have never consented to having their articles and essays republished in Arts &amp; Opinion if it weren't a worthy, that is noteworthy publication. Given our high profile and considerable traffic, the stats of which I can make available upon request, I fail to see how the inclusion of Arts &amp; Opinion will diminish the credibility of Wikipedia? 01:02, 15 February 2007 (UTC)Robert Lewis</p>
<dl>
<dd>What high profile? If you have a high profile you're probably very appropriate - but we don't have any evidence of that high profile, and that's what I'm asking for. You seemed to be approaching this as though you can convince us of your prominence like we were journalists looking to publish a piece on you. But we repeat already published information. If someone else hasn't found it noteworthy enough to publish - we don't. -- <a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 13:29, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
"If someone hasn't found it noteworthy enough to publish - we don't." By this do you mean other journals haven't requested reprint permission of our 'original' material? If that's what you mean, I can provide you names of journals that have republished our material. Absinthe Review, for example. 14:12, 15 February 2007 (UTC)Robert Lewis</p>
<dl>
<dd>I had meant that claims about your journal being important need to be published somewhere else. But if other <i>well respected</i> publications frequently reprint original material from Arts and Opinion, that could well show notability too. Do you have more details? -- <a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 16:48, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
We haven't kept track of reprints. I know there's one in Absinthe Review, there's another in On Line Opinion (from Australia) <a href="http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=2757" class="external free" title="http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=2757" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=2757</a>.
