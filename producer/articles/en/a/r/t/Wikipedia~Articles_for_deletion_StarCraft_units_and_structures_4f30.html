<p><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a game strategy guide</a>. This article consists of nothing but game guide information, such as "<i>a Protoss Zealot has higher hit points than a Zergling but the Zergling can attack faster to balance this out</i>" (and that's in the introduction). There's also a great deal of individual units, each with their own article and useful game guide information such, but this is not the AFD for those. Does nothing that the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Category%7EStarCraft_a979.html" title="Category:StarCraft">StarCraft category</a> doesn't do.

<li><b>Delete</b>. There seems to be a craze of AfD debates about computer game-related stuff recently; and I have voted delete to almost all of them.

<dd><b>Comment</b>I looked throuh <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and didnt see any reference to a game guide at first, I finally found it under instruction manual. So really this page just needs to be modified to fit what it was meant to be, it is currently horribly organized and needs alot of coordinated help from the VG group to Wikify it, but its premise is needed. It consolidates all the units from Starcraft and Starcraft:Broodwar into one place, yes the category can do that as well but it also contains people, places, etc. One thing for sure that needs to be done is to remove the "this unit is better because" references and just have a reproduction of the sheet that came with the games listing units of similar tier with cost and possibly stats. That is all verifiable fact, people can draw their own conclusions from it.<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESir_hugo_adef.html" title="User:Sir hugo">Sir hugo</a> 19:51, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While the data from "the sheet that came with the games" is verifiable, it's also copyrighted.

<dd><b>Reply</b> - The sampling bias of WP's editors is fascinating in its own right, but each topic should be evaluated by objective evidence on a case-by-case basis. And anyway, judging solely by the vastness of the chess content on WP, its systemic bias would appear to be toward canonized pillars of culture over the new and shiny. As evidence in this case: over 9.5 million copies of Starcraft have been sold so far; <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1127055/000095012306007628/y22210exv99w1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1127055/000095012306007628/y22210exv99w1.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> at over eight years old now, it typically has around 70,000 Starcraft games currently being played on Battlenet at any moment, which is about three times higher than during its first year; 46% of over 10,000 voters in a <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Cyber_Games_ff08.html" title="World Cyber Games">World Cyber Games</a> poll this year named Starcraft, out of eight WCG competition games, as the one they'd most like to participate in, <a href="http://www.worldcybergames.com/5th/fun/GamerPoll/gamerpoll_result.asp?poll_idx=34&amp;page=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldcybergames.com/5th/fun/GamerPoll/gamerpoll_result.asp?poll_idx=34&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> a gain over the prevous year; at eight years old, more professional competitions keep forming, and professional earnings and endorsements are in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and have continued rising, while it is one of only two computer games with leagues of full-time professional players; <a href="http://www.geartest.com/sections/games/professional_gamer_2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geartest.com/sections/games/professional_gamer_2.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> the government of Singapore let a pro Starcraft player postpone his obligatory military service to play Starcraft at the World Cyber Games, out of its support for those "who are selected to represent Singapore at prestigious international sports and cultural events"; <a href="http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7000047607" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7000047607" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> in South Korea, <a href="../../../o/n/g/Ongamenet.html" title="Ongamenet">two cable</a> <a href="../../../m/b/c/MBCGame_212a.html" title="MBCGame">channels</a> have programs devoted to Starcraft competition, and schools post students' Starcraft rankings along with their academic rankings. <a href="http://www.geartest.com/sections/games/professional_gamer_2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geartest.com/sections/games/professional_gamer_2.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> While identifiable ancestors of chess have been around for 1000 years, modern chess would be at least "Chess 7" if they had kept track of different versions, and chess in its modern form has been around less than 200 years, only 25 times as long as Starcraft, while evidence indicates Starcraft has only continued to grow more popular over the past eight years, so it shows no sign of dropping into a void anytime soon. A fairer comparison with the greater body of ancestral games under the "chess" aegis should be to the whole Starcraft/Warcraft family, which has sold over 35 million copies over the past twelve years, and with the newest version, World of Warcraft, accumulating about <i>one million new paying monthly subscribers every three months</i>, since its release around a year and a half ago (the most paying subscribers of any computer game ever, by a vast margin). In sum, there is substantial evidence that Starcraft and/or its descendants will still be of comparable popularity and encyclopedic notability to chess in ten years.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The debate is not whether this level of detail is needed it is whether this type of information constitutes "Strategy" guide. If I were to say "When playing as the Zerg you need to build alot of Zerglings really fast and try to overwhelm your closest opponent." that would be a strategy guide, where as saying "Zerglings cost 50 minerals for a set of two and produce in the same time as a Zealot which costs 100 minerals making each Zergling more economical" that is no longer a strategy guide. If I had more time to actually edit this article instead of just skimming and fixing small things then I would try and rewrite it. When I first came looking for Starcraft on Wikipedia it was for this particular page, I wanted a page with a link to each units page as well as a place for basic information about each unit compared to other similar units.<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESir_hugo_adef.html" title="User:Sir hugo">Sir hugo</a> 12:18, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How is that strategy guide information? It is straight out comparison, a strategy guide explains step by step how to accomplish something. Saying this unit attacks faster, or costs less is just stating verifiable fact. Stating that one unit is more economical then another may be straying too close to original research though. I see this as no different then an article listing military aircraft comparing the F-22 to the F-16 and stating that the F-16 costs less and is faster to produce but less capable then the F-22.<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESir_hugo_adef.html" title="User:Sir hugo">Sir hugo</a> 14:50, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>The queen can be moved in a straight line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, any number of unoccupied squares as shown on the diagram at the left, thus combining the moves of the rook and bishop. The distance it can move is known as the Chebyshev distance. As with other captures except en passant, the queen captures by occupying the square on which an enemy piece sits. Ordinarily the queen is slightly more powerful than a rook and a bishop together, while slightly less powerful than two rooks. Because the queen is more valuable than any other piece, it is almost always disadvantageous to exchange the queen for a piece other than the enemy's queen, unless doing so leads to a position where the king can be checkmated.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Saying that "Users wanting this level of detail should buy the manual" seems a personal opinion having nothing to do with wikipedia policies. One could say that if you want to learn the chess rules you should buy a chess manual. The argumet about the number of people playing chess or playing starcraft or about the age of the games has no relevance with the WP policies. The real difference (not explicitily expressed so far) between chess and starctaft here is that starcraft is a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trademark.html" title="Trademark">trademark</a>. This could make you think that if we go in the details of the aspect of starcraft we are behaving unfairly with respect to the owners of the trademark. This would not happen with chess.

<li>I've read the above objections. You're harping on the chess and go articles, but I'm unmoved; I don't think they're particularly encyclopedic either. I really think they should be merged into a more-encyclopedic article, which I think is quite possible given the centuries-long history of chess. Not so with Starcraft, which, while exceedingly popular, doesn't have the history or breadth to justify more than a single article about the gameplay itself. Additionally, this article is so poorly-written that it is unlikely to form a useful basis for that single article, nor will it be a useful merge into that single gameplay article. On top of all this, this article is wholly unsourced and unlikely to become sourced.<br />

Describing them in such detail, however, is without question a game guide. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 00:48, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>Dragoons are created from Zealots who have been crippled or mortally injured in combat and are thus unable to continue fighting in their preferred manner - with a pair of psionic blades. They continue to volunteer their services, however; their crippled or mortally injured bodies are placed within large exoskeletons which contain any life-support equipment required by the individual Protoss. Living within a cold and dark environment, Dragoons are very somber compared to their Zealot counterparts. Seeing themselves as fallen warriors they show many signs of lost pride. Based on their quotes within the game; "I have returned", "For vengence", "I am needed", and "Make use of me" it becomes clear that Dragoons feel a sense of worthlessness among the protoss. For this reason Dragoons make a large effort to contribute to Protoss society. Although considered second class citizens compared to Zealots, Dragoons are undeniably valuable. Having both a ground/air attack and a ranged attack they are the all purpose Protoss unit(similar to the Zerg Hydralisk or the Terran Marine). When combined with Zealots they create a simple yet deadly force of long and close range attacks.</i></dd>

<li>If I were to write a single article on Draw Poker (actual example is kind of moot, since it's been sub-divided into so many articles on all the variants), pertinent information would include that you use a deck of 52 cards with numerical values of 2-10 and 4 face cards. Then I would have to describe the hierarchy of hands, as well as the betting system. I wouldn't describe the proper ways to bluff or other subjective tactics, as that would be a strategy guide. With Starcraft, the units and structures are equally worth mentioning and pertinent to the game's design, as they are base elements of this very complex game with its rules. The fact that it is a computer game and the subject requires a lot of material to adequately cover doesn't mean it should be dismissed as unimportant, and I believe that it can and should be covered without veering into how-to/guide territory. --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 05:15, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Regarding the nom: First of all, the quote at the top is misleading, because while it sounds crufty, it actually immediately follows the sentence: <i>Unlike Blizzard Entertainment’s first two forays into RTS with WarCraft, StarCraft went against the typical symmetrical match ups. Instead, each race is given its own unique properties, their own advantages and disadvantages. As such, each unit does not quite match up easily with another race’s.</i> which is then followed by several examples. This seems like a valid encyclopedic description of StarCraft's unit system. Which leads to me to another point: This page, <b><a href="../../../s/t/a/StarCraft_units_and_structures_1332.html" title="StarCraft units and structures">StarCraft units and structures</a></b> is the one up for deletion, <b>not</b> the sub-pages, which should each get their own AfD and be measured by their own merits, if people feel it's necessary. Remember, we are talking about this single page.
<p>This article is not cruft and it is not a game guide or instruction manual. It is an overview of the races, units and structure in a notable video game, a key part of the explanation of a complex gameplay system. It does not instruct the players - in that regard is it is pretty useless. It is also not original research, since this straight-ahead comparison of units can be cited from a secondary source such as an <i>actual</i> strategy guide, or just using the game itself as a primary source. I am further swayed by Reaverdrop's arguments. --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 04:18, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I already explained this. Guide is a broad term. Any sort of information could be called a guide. However, the game guide rule is a corollary of wikipedia is not a how-to-guide, which this isn't. Saying you can't cover game design in video game articles, only the publisher, release date, etc is like sayign you can't discuss literary technique in an article a book or cinematic technique in an article about a movie. In most cases, it's whatmakes a game notable. Stating the publisger and story of a game doesn't really you anything about it. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 08:01, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>How is it original research? The statistics of each units are facts - the units of different races do not have the same stats and abilities. (This is also a deliberate change in the from earlier Warcraft games, where for the most part, the units on both sides were equal in strength, movement, etc. That is probably why it is noted in the first place.) Those are factual observations, not interpretations - speed, attack, other things are hard numerical values in the game that can compared directly. It is not some kind of subjective value judgment, as you seem to imply.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. I vote delete, but with several major reservations that I feel have to be taken into account.

<li><i>Reminder 2</i>: Starcraft is not just a game, it is a <b>cultural phenomenon.</b> See the compilation of information provided by <b>reaverdrop.</b></li>
<li><i>Reminder 3</i>: <b>Not knowing something doesn't make it original research.</b> Aka, your ignorance on Starcraft is not an opinion. Sorry, no offense to those who actually know StarCraft material, but anyone who mentioned original research either doesn't know StarCraft or doesn't know original research. A quick google search verifies most of the information. Note that <i>Blizzard, the company that produced StarCraft, has endorsed much of the strategy on this page.</i> Is that official enough for you?

<dd><b>Second reply</b>. The amount of space/number of articles a given game deserves should be proportionate to its historical and cultural importance, and its intellectual depth. This is why Chess is like Shakespeare, and Starcraft is like Spongebob.

<dl>
<dd><b>Reply</b> You're right that the articles a game deserves should be proportionate, which is precisely why StarCraft deserves more pages. As already demonstrated by <b>reaverdrop</b>, Starcraft <i>is</i> historically and culturally notable. It's undeniably the most popular RTS and like several other major games, it has transcended its medium and become notable outside of gaming circles. Prove that StarCraft isn't notable culturally or historically or that it lacks intellectual depth. I'm a tournament chess player so don't try to fool me with poorly stamped comparisons. If you have any concrete comparisons to make with chess, make them now. If you have any evidence that contradicts <b>reaverdrop's</b>, show it now. Otherwise don't bother with the notability argument, it's worthless without any evidence backing it up. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolberg_69b8.html" title="User:Solberg">Solberg</a> 21:54, 18 July 2006 (UTC)Solberg</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Deleting units and structures is the equivalent of deleting any mention of cards from poker or chess pieces from chess. Articles like <a href="../../../r/o/o/Rook_%28chess%29.html" title="Rook (chess)">Rook (chess)</a> are less encyclopedic then this collection of information about each individual unit. I would argue the chess articles are even worse since they actually dedicate an entire article to each piece describing how it moves etc. which is equivalent to this condensed article describing the facts of the "game pieces" which happen to be bits and bytes. I think people are just failing to grasp how large Starcraft is and how much of cultural phenom it is. Terms have arose from this game, not fully directly, but popularized because of it, such as "to zerg". While there is a word, the term gained its popularity through the pieces in this game, much like people using the term "checkmate" when they out do an opponent. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_ecbe.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 12:18, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I've no interest in this computer game, and find some of the comments about it laughable. Having said that, the comparison between it and chess are appropriate, &amp; it is clearly a notable game. On the other hand, chess is not 'owned' by anyone, unlike star craft, and it requires simple equipment to play without buying a license from a 3rd party. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkb_3e6f.html" title="User:Markb">Markb</a> 12:38, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The fact that we have another bad/crufty/minutely detailed article on a different topic has NEVER been a good reason to keep in AfD.

This article has no instruction manual material whatsoever, I think this claim is totally false. It is a table of units in StarCraft, nothing even hints at strategy.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>.<br />
Answering Varco: this is not knowledge, so we lose nothing if we delete it. Let me explain. The <i>basic details</i> -- such as the fact that different races have different units with different attributes, and require different strategies -- are knowledge, encyclopedic, and belong in Wikipedia, and can usefully be illustrated with representative examples. But <i>full lists</i> of every single unit are facts, not knowledge; they are to <a href="../../../s/t/a/StarCraft_11be.html" title="StarCraft">StarCraft</a> what a phone directory is to <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telephone.html" title="Telephone">Telephone</a>. One does not need such information to understand the nature of the game, nor its cultural importance; one only needs such information if one is actually engaged in playing the game, in which case there are plenty of better places to get it. So it should not be here. We are in the business of producing a first-rate encyclopedia, not second-rate game guides. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 19:11, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Um, no one has suggested covering <b>every</b> book in existence. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Thalir_9758.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Thalir">AfD Thalir</a>. Sometimes they make the cut, sometimes they don't. But, based on the AfD discussions and, as an example, the contents of [[<a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Category</a>:Real-time_strategy_computer_games]], one can say that <b>many</b> computer game articles with <b>extreme</b> amounts of detail have been added. I'm not going to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikilawyering_a5b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikilawyering">wikilawyer</a> and pull quotes from <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo.html" title="Jimbo">Jimbo</a> or previous discussions. As to the <i><a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">chess</a> argument</i> listed above, any game invented more than a century ago, which can be played by two people who don't even speak the same language, using very simple objects (think rocks and sand), which has <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Chess_Championship_2131.html" title="World Chess Championship">world championship</a> going back to c.1520, definitely falls into the notable category. Is there a grey area between chess and SC? Definitely. Can I understand that editors are excited about things that are top of mind in pop culture and use WP as an outlet, knowing there are others that share an interest? You bet. Another sanity check; would your grandma know about chess, or SC, or both, or neither? This level of treatment of fictional objects in a video game, albeit a currently popular one, is not appropriate for an encyclopedic resource, printed or otherwise. -- <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDolomite_0b0c.html" title="User:MrDolomite">MrDolomite</a> | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDolomite_8f87.html" title="User talk:MrDolomite">Talk</a> 01:05, 19 July 2006 (UTC)
