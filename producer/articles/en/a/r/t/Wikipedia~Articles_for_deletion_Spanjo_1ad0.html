<p>Non-notable sandwich served (and discontinued years ago) by a single university cafeteria. Normally I would prod this, but the speedy was already contested (meaning, I feel prod would be a waste of time). <strike><b>Delete</b></strike> I am now changing my vote -- to <b>Extremely strong delete</b>, due to users that are now stalking me on IM due to my stance on this issue. <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">Andy Saunders</a> 19:27, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>As there is no other place on the internet where the recipe or process for this sandwich is available, I feel that wikipedia is fufilling its mission of keeping information not otherwise available accessible to anyone who needs it. I also contest OntarioQuizzer's use of the phrase "non-notable".--<a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndiebass_53ac.html" title="User:Indiebass">Indiebass</a> 19:34, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>"Wikipedia is a neutral and unbiased compilation of notable, verifiable facts." "A view is generally considered notable if it is potentially information of value or interest in some way to a significant number of people, or to some perspective, or its omission would leave a significant gap in historical human knowledge of a subject." (from <a href="../../../8/w/_/WP%7E8W_03c1.html" title="WP:8W">WP:8W</a>). I am of the opinion that the Spanjo is not of interest to a significant number of people; therefore, I refer to it as "non-notable". -- <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">Andy Saunders</a> 19:37, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Indibass, thank you very much for your contribution. I made myself a spango for lunch today and it was amazing! I believe that it would be a slap in the face to vegitarians everywhere if this sandwhich was deleted from record and forever lost to civilization. Andy Saunders seems to be a typical Canadian anti-vegitarianite. Just because it does not have gravy does not mean it is not good. Besides Andy, who made you the sandwich police?!!

<li>"the Spanjo is not of interest to a significant number of people" -OntarioQuizzer. Again: not true. The University of Michigan has the world's largest number of living alumni, more than a few of whom have eaten spanjos. I fail to see why anyone would want to make legitimate information unavailable.

<strike><b>keep</b></strike> Thesquire wrote: "As Andy Saunders has demonstrated..." Has he really? Because you say it does that make it so? There are several comments in support of this article, and I wouldn't have created it just so it could be deleted. I would like someone to tell me 1) what is the best thing that could happen by deleting this article and 2) what is the worst thing that could happen by keeping this article. I think you'll find that more information is preferable to deleting something because you don't know what it is. Maybe it makes you afraid. I don't know. What I do know is deleting this article is a blow against the guiding principles that wikipedia was founded on.</p>

<p><b>KEEP!!!</b>The Spanjo is how I met my husband. You see, I was at the Halfass, trying to decide which sandwich to order, when the guy in front of me ordered a Spanjo. I was thinking about trying the Spanjo myself, but as a poor college student, I was reluctant to spend my money on a sandwich I might not like. I asked the guy in front of me how the Spanjo was, and with his encouragement, I took the plunge. We ended up eating our Spanjos together that afternoon, and 5 years later we got married (and for the record, we had mini Spanjos during the cocktail hour). Every year, we return to Michigan for a football game, and on these trips we are sure to visit the Halfass for a Spanjo at least one time (they still make the sandwich, even though it is not on the official menu).

<li><b>KEEP!!!</b> Please tell me how the Spanjo falls into the "indiscriminate collection of information" category - it is NOT a list of frequently asked questions, it is NOT a list of repositories or loosely associated topics, it is NOT a travel guide, it is NOT a memorial, it is NOT news report, it is NOT a genealogical or phonebook entry, it is NOT a directory or resource for conducting business, and it is NOT an instruction manual.

<li><b>Keep!</b> UMich graduate here. happened to stumble across the spanjo article just now. I really hope it is *not* deleted. I can tell you the Spanjo did in fact exist, and also was nutritious as well as delicious. It was still being served when i was there, and the "word" eataspanjo was painted on the ceiling. So, for what it's worth the information is legitimate.

<li><b>Keep!</b> I'm new to this site (and thus I'm sure that big red box above refers to me) I can't say I'm an expert in all things wiki-related, but I can vouch for the fact that the sandwich in questions does exist. Not only is it surprisingly tasty, it does hold a bit of cultural significance in south central michigan. Point is, while this "information" may only be interesting to a very small sliver of the population, isn't that enough? It's not made up. It's true. And the information itself takes up a whole lot less space that the protests against it. As I said, from someone who is new to wikipedia, I thought this was precisely the place to put information like this, information you couldn't find anywhere else. sixofrock 10:48, 9 March 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.189.252.158 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.189.252.158_7233.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.189.252.158">contribs</a>) 09:48, 9 March 2006.</small></li>

<dd>"information that you can't find anywhere else" easily violates WP's "verifiability" tenet. If you can't find it anywhere else, how can you verify it to ensure that it's actually true? Nobody's done any sort of scholarly work on the Spanjo; Letterman hasn't eaten a Spanjo on his show; it's simply not notable, and if we were to include everything along the same notability level as the Spanjo, Wikipedia would be much too unwieldy and would lose a lot of its credibility. -- <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">Andy Saunders</a> 16:20, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><strike><b>Keep!</b></strike> OntarioQuizzer, the minimum standard for a newspaper in terms of verification is three independent sources. Including myself, there is at least that on this article, and my guess would be more to come.

<dd>1) Users saying that it is true doesn't cut it; we need PUBLISHED sources, and it still does nothing for the fact that the Spanjo is <b>not notable</b> for 99.99% of the population.

<p><b>Keep</b> Since the Whopper is listed in Wikipedia I think the Spanjo should be included. A delicious sandwich should not be discriminated against simply because it is not served by a national chain. Andy's reply is going to be: "But the Whopper can be verified by published sources and many more people care about the Whopper." Good points Andy, but having eaten a Spanjo myself I must say keep. --Velcroshoe 18:13, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep</b> Andy - it's not inconceivable that more than 600,000 people have enjoyed a Spanjo (Michigan is a huge school), meaning that more than .01% of the population has intimate knowledge of it. Furthermore, let's say that each of those people told one other person about the sandwich in their lifetime. That's 1.2 million people. Are you so stuck up as to deny that 1.2 million people constitutes enough valid sources? --TsarSteve 18:32, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>This whole discussion amuses me. The reason I say to Keep it are because I love this sandwich and I know that I am not alone in my enjoyment. The "eataspanjo" is an Ann Arbor equivalent to the restaurant chain Steak and Shake's "Takhomasak". It's a local legend of a sandwich. --Velcroshoe 18:51, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
