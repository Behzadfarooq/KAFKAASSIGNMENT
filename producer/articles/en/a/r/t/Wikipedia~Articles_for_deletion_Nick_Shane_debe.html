<li><b>Comment</b>: Of course! Both "Nick" and "Shane" are extremely common names. So is "Nick Shane". None of the results on at least the first few pages refer to the Nick Shane in question, except for this wikipedia article. In fact, I couldn't find this particular Nick Shane referenced in the google hits I looked at period. --<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecondSight_02d5.html" title="User:SecondSight">SecondSight</a> 07:43, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Nick belongs to the <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_community.html" title="Seduction community">seduction community</a> and appeared at cliffslist.com the worlds greatest seduction PUA in montreal. If you search for the term "Playboyskool" you will get over 31,000 hits. If you go <a href="http://www.cliffslist.com/page2sif.pl" class="external text" title="http://www.cliffslist.com/page2sif.pl" rel="nofollow">here</a>, you can see all the PUAs that attended the cliffs convention and he is only mentioned as "Nick" under "Playboyskool". So let's sum this up real quick: He has media coverage, both in europe (TV, magazine articles) and in the states (cliffslist DVDs). He is a notable member of the seduction community. There are over 30k results for "Playboyskool" (that's why I redirected the page). Playboyskool is even listed on amazon.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you delete this page, you would also have to delete <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_deangelo.html" title="David deangelo">david deangelo</a>, Badboy Lifestyle, <a href="../../../p/i/c/Pickup_101.html" title="Pickup 101">pickup 101</a> since they have even less media coverage. The argument that "just because some articles are in german", he should be deleted from the english wikipedia and put into the german wikipedia is nonsense anyway. Therefore I will remove the template from this page within 3 days. 86.140.57.90 23:08, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The existence of other non-notable pages on wikipedia (which should also be deleted) doesn't justify sparing this page from deletion. Yet <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_DeAngelo_10f5.html" title="David DeAngelo">David DeAngelo</a>, Badboy Lifestyle, and <a href="../../../p/i/c/PickUp_101_4264.html" title="PickUp 101">PickUp 101</a> actually <i>are</i> notable. <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_DeAngelo_10f5.html" title="David DeAngelo">David DeAngelo</a> is notable because he and his techniques are mentioned in <a href="../../../p/e/n/The_Game%7E_Penetrating_the_Secret_Society_of_Pickup_Artists_35d6.html" title="The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists">The Game</a>, and so is <a href="../../../p/i/c/PickUp_101_4264.html" title="PickUp 101">PickUp 101</a>. If you look at the Badboy Lifestyle and <a href="../../../p/i/c/PickUp_101_4264.html" title="PickUp 101">PickUp 101</a> articles, you will notice that they both cite a couple English-language news sources. You say that the argument that "just because some articles are in german" is nonsense. Yet it's not just "some" articles that are in German or another non-English language, it is <i>all</i> of them. If you can add to the page <i>one</i> English news article on Nick Shane, I will change my opinion. As for the 31k google hits, the vast majority of these are not in English. I strongly suggest that you do not remove the template from the page, because that is a violation of wikipedia policy. Once an article is put on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">articles for deletion</a>, the process must run its course, and the fate of the page is decided by a vote. If you remove the template, you will be shooting yourself in the foot, because someone will put it back up, and an admin might block you (and the page will probably be more likely to get deleted).--<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecondSight_02d5.html" title="User:SecondSight">SecondSight</a> 00:47, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I know of one english reference: The british daily record (October 19, 2005). Since it isn't available online, and only offline, you will have to go check out the archives by yourself. What I do know though is that he IS featured in the motion picture The Last Blast (2007) and he is on cliffslist DVDs 2006. If we delete the page now, the page will simply reappear in a couple of months time when the new cliffslist DVDs are out, and when we know more about official press releases from the motion picture. Given the media coverage he already has from europe (which can be reviewed online) and the fact he is american and will be featured on the worlds greatest PUAs by cliffslist, he deserves a page on wikipedia.86.140.57.90 02:25, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: To prove a point I finally found the article again from the british magazine daily record, to be seen here *<a href="http://www.playboyskool.com/images/dailyrecord.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.playboyskool.com/images/dailyrecord.jpg" rel="nofollow">"How To Pull!", RowZ Daily Record (UK), October 15, 2005</a>.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Seems NN, and it's written like a vanity page. Maybe after extensive rewrite, and better justification, keep it. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETHE_KING_2419.html" title="User:THE KING">THE KING</a> 00:44, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. As per THE KING. A German Wikipedia article may be justified, but his notability within the English-speaking seduction community is questionable. Furthermore, with the current media frenzy on seduction, anyone claiming to be a 'Dating Guru' is given coverage. As stated above by SecondSight, what makes David DeAngelo and Lance Mason (of Pick-Up 101) notable is their mention within the community. Even a search of Thundercat's blog reveals three hits for 'Playboyskool'; two mentioning his presence at Cliff's List '06, another being a passing slate of the material on the site. Searching Fastseduction.com with Google turned up nothing for either Playboyskool or Nick Shane. -- <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasuke_Sarutobi_1266.html" title="User:Sasuke Sarutobi">Sasuke Sarutobi</a> 11:44, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: There seem to be two different arguments floating about. 1. If Nick should have an english page at all, and 2. if he is a notable member of the seduction community. So far we have come to a conclusion that he has media coverage in the english speaking world, which justifies him to an article on wikipedia. Now according to wikipedia rules, if coverage exists in the media and you can prove the references, you can add the page. So in my humble opinion and as I understand wikipedia rules, the page about Nick Shane on the english wikipedia can stay and should not be deleted. The next debate would be his connection to the seduction community but that's another debate and shouldn't coincide with whether this article should be deleted anyway or not. Therefore we should add to the article page: "His connection to the seduction community itself has not been as established as other members may have". <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnny_Rocketfingers_e378.html" title="User:Johnny Rocketfingers">Johnny Rocketfingers</a> 19:15, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I have been a user of so suave, fast seduction, thundercats lair, and mysterys forums for years now and have no idea who Nick Shane is. I was stunned to see his name alongside the likes of Ross, Neil, Mystery, Badboy and Tyler. This article appears to be an adervtisement for a little known dating coach, not a notable member of the seduction community itself. Donny Whiteman 05:36, 3 october 2006(UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Allright, here's what I would suggest we do: Apparently, he hasn't made his full mark inside the "seduction community" yet so we should add that either to criticism or under the part seduction community in the article. However, since he does have media coverage in europe and the united states, he should have a page on wikipedia but it needs some cleanup. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnny_Rocketfingers_e378.html" title="User:Johnny Rocketfingers">Johnny Rocketfingers</a> 23:35, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><s>Keep:</s> He has a movie credit on the official movie website of "The Last Blast" (www.thelastblast.com) on the front page. I will therefore remove the template by myself in 24hrs and consider this topic closed. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnny_Rocketfingers_e378.html" title="User:Johnny Rocketfingers">Johnny Rocketfingers</a> 19:53, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
