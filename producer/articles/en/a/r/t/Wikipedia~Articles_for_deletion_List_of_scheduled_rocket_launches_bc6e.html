<li><b>Strong keep</b> It's not out of date as it goes up to December 2006.

<li><b>Keep</b>, the list is ordered and clean. Although the list will continuously grow, so is the List of anime characters, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_South_Park_episodes_a2c4.html" title="List of South Park episodes">List of South_Park episodes</a>, etc, etc. Although I agree that there needs to be more people working on the article. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 02:52, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Those lists are not analogous. The analogous lists would be List of planned anime characters and List of scheduled South Park episodes.

<li><s><b>Keep</b> per ReyBrujo</s>.

<ul>
<li>However, it's supposed to be pruned, so I don't htink it should exist in its current form.

<li><b>Keep</b>, although I must admit that Night Gyr raises a good argument. The table in the article is very succinct and provides useful information, but really needs to be updated with launches occurring moving to some article on launched rockets. -- <font color="black" face="Arial"><a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)">Samir</a></font> <a href="../../../c/a/n/Image%7ECanadian_maple_leaf_2.jpg_8df3.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/5/57/Canadian_maple_leaf_2.jpg/20px-Canadian_maple_leaf_2.jpg" alt="" width="20" height="19" longdesc="../../../c/a/n/Image%7ECanadian_maple_leaf_2.jpg_8df3.html" /></a> <font face="Arial Narrow" color="#000000"><small><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_5ee9.html" title="User talk:Samir (The Scope)">(the scope)</a> <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dharma.html" title="Dharma">धर्म</a></small></font> 04:52, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, the list is an encyclopaedic list which is useful and summarises events.

Look, this is great and valuable information, sure. But it's <i>not encyclopedia material</i>. Encyclopedias are for writing <i>about</i> events, not for listing events that may (if they ever happen) be worth writing about. Wikipedia is not a year planner. What next? List of future Rolling Stones comeback tours? List of films expected to be nominated for Academy Awards? Tomorrow's weather? — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 09:05, 2 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the article <a href="../../../a/_/b/A_Bigger_Bang_Tour_fcbd.html" title="A Bigger Bang Tour">A Bigger Bang Tour</a> had been started in early 2005, with reliable sources, it would have been kept, or at least merged into the Rolling Stones article (This is still future events anyway, as the tour will not conclude for another four months. "Predicted Academy Awards nominations" would be (form where I see it) deleted as original research. I'm not even going to try and defend "Tomorrow's weather" as an article, as that would be a maintenance nightmare. Also, from the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> policy section on crystal ballism <i>"Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place."</i>. We have organisations that know what they are doing (at least in the case of NASA and the ESA, I truly hope so), saying that "We will launch this vehicle into Earth orbit, to perform this role, on this date". It is never going to be the case of *insert national leader here* waking up and ringing *insert national space agency here* one morning and saying "By tomorrow night, I want a rocket in space". These missions take time to plan and establish, and they leave a paper trail that can be used to reliably sourced this list. That's "certain". As for "notable", I don't know about you, but I personally think trying to put things such as environmental observation equipment, scientific projects, global communication transfer stations, and <i>people</i> into a location removed from the Earth's atmosphere is, if not notable, <i>pretty damned significant</i>. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 09:27, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. To be honest, I'm not sure of the policies in regards to this matter. I feel that this list is encyclopaedic, and I myself find it extremely useful. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthVader_1e48.html" title="User:DarthVader">DarthVad</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthVader_1e48.html" title="User:DarthVader">r</a> 09:35, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The list is useful as a resource and as information to those who may wish to observe it. The dates may change, that is why the {{<a href="../../../f/u/t/Template%7EFuture_e5c6.html" title="Template:Future">future</a>}} tag is at the top of the page.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I created the article, I cross referenced all information with the space agencies websites, and the SpaceFlightNow website. These only go up to the end of the year, and thus, so does this article. Seeing as rocket launches are not as common as, for example, aircraft taking off, your prospective rocket-spotter is more likley to need such a resource, as it is no good turning up at a launch site on the offchance there may be a launch today, as odds are there won't be. --<a href="../../../g/w/_/User%7EGW_Simulations_0716.html" title="User:GW Simulations">GW_Simulations</a> 18:12, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- I wouldn't have as much objection to it if we set some criteria like "list of orbital spaceflights" and then made yearly lists for those from 1957-2006, or possibly by decade if there aren't enough to justify individual years. The problem with it as it is now is that it makes explicit reference to the fact that its events must be in the future, so it <i>will</i> become out of date without regular updating. A list by years can simply state the date and at the end of the year we can move on to the next one. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> 01:12, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I like that a lot, and a list of all orbital flights would be useful. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:18, 3 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Is that the same as a list of all rocket launches? (for the non-astronomically inclined) <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 02:02, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Unless something goes horribly, horribly wrong, all 'serious' rocket launchers exit the atmosphere (i'd avoid making the criteria "orbital flights", as if something goes further than Earth Orbit, ie probes to other planets, future moon landings, they won;t be covered) If someone is willing to convert this to a List of extra-atmospheric vehicle launches (2006-2010) or somehting, I will support it. But, I would rather see this information <b>kept and conveted</b>. Under no circumstances is this to be interpreted as a <i>deletion</i>, if the conversion does not go ahead. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 07:21, 3 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree in principal to a limiting factor, and I would say that leaving the atmosphere would be a good condition. This will pick up all major orbital, sub-orbital, and planetry missions. --<a href="../../../g/w/_/User%7EGW_Simulations_0716.html" title="User:GW Simulations">GW_Simulations</a> 18:19, 3 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why not just "List of spaceflights" then, since spaceflight is basically synonymous with leaving the atmosphere. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> 21:05, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Fine by me. I would prefer to leave scheduled ones seperate from past ones though. --<a href="../../../g/w/_/User%7EGW_Simulations_0716.html" title="User:GW Simulations">GW_Simulations</a> 21:12, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
