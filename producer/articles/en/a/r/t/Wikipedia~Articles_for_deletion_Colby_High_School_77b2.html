<li><b>Keep</b> Alright, yes, I'm going to be completely biased because this is my high school, and I am the author of the original article. It has survived since October, and I've kept an eye on it for maintenance. I will admit that I wrote the article tongue in cheek, and it certainly needed some citations. NOW, though, user <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> (<a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENoroton_4514.html" title="User talk:Noroton">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Noroton_a85f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Noroton">contribs</a>) has done an amazing job of assembling (factual) information on Colby High School. And, though some of you may argue that it's not an article worth having on Wikipedia, I wholly disagree. As <a href="../../../s/e/f/User%7ESefringle_0106.html" title="User:Sefringle">Sefringle</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/f/User_talk%7ESefringle_fa16.html" title="User talk:Sefringle">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sefringle_f5e6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sefringle">contribs</a>) commented, Wikipedia has many articles over schools many people wouldn't hear of otherwise. The notable alumni definitely helps my cause... it's not every opera singer that pops out of a conservative NW Kansas school. If you haven't been here, let me tell you, not succumbing to the pressure to be a farmer or housewife is an accomplishment (we live in 1950). By the way, Colby High School <i>is</i> on Google. --<a href="../../../b/u/g/User%7EBuglindseybee_9b00.html" title="User:Buglindseybee">Buglindseybee</a> 01:22, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

The building makes up for its lack of windows and originality with a large technology lab and a fully-stocked art room."

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. I'm not sure where the concept of "inherently notable" comes from, but this Afd does not meet the <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP notability guideline for organizations</a> (which includes schools). The argument that it should be kept because WP has articles for hundreds of other non-notable high schools is specious -- we should be deleting those articles for the same reason. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../v/b/d/User%7EVbd_89b7.html" title="User:Vbd">Vbd</a> (<a href="../../../v/b/d/User_talk%7EVbd_4bf4.html" title="User talk:Vbd">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vbd_8c0e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vbd">contribs</a>) 22:02, 24 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Agree that high schools are important to those who attended them but this one, and many others, fail to meet the core notability requirement for any organization which includes schools. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarfieldian_373f.html" title="User:Warfieldian">Warfieldian</a> 23:05, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Schools are NOT inherently notable, and WP has thankfully been cracking down on these (I remember last summer it was almost impossible to delete an article on a high school if the school was real).

<li>With all due respect, I haven't been able to find a guideline that says that having "multiple" (in this case, two) notable alumni makes a high school notable. Can someone please point me to a source that says so? I know <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> isn't a policy or guideline, but <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> is and it doesn't mention notable alumni in its criteria for notability (neither does WP:SCHOOLS).--<a href="../../../v/b/d/User%7EVbd_89b7.html" title="User:Vbd">Vbd</a> | (<a href="../../../v/b/d/User_talk%7EVbd_4bf4.html" title="User talk:Vbd">talk</a>) 00:07, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's not a policy as much as it is implied and relies on common sense. If a school has produced multiple personalities which are notable for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, the school is notable. You see something similar to this in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> when a newly formed band has multiple notable members.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article does not have adequate independent references; since this is a bedrock requirement in our community the article fails. I don't feel that the claim of notability on alumni grounds is adequate, as everyone has to be educated somewhere. If notability transfers from a student to a school, why does it not transfer from a customer to a shop&#160;? I do note that both cited alumni are musicians; if it can be shown that the school specifically develops musical talent in its pupils I'd be inclined to change my view, but otherwise I feel this should go. The assertion that all schools are notable I have addressed in many previous AfD debates; I am opposed to the idea that we should relax standards of notability for the special case of schools. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 15:20, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

The claims to notability are borderline, but given a bit of time and guidance, additional rationale for keep may be found. If not, it can be renominated after a month if its not improving. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 14:33, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
