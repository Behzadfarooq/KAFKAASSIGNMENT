<li><b>Comment.</b> There is also a "Horace Mann Elementary School" in Broome County, New York. (I think it's the Binghamton or Johnson City or Union-Endicott school district.) I don't see a disambiguation page so one should be added if the NY school gets added. I'm not a "keep" voter on elementary schools without evidence of other significance, so I won't be bold and do it. There are likely many other elementary schools by that name, probably all of them not notable within their category but wonderful to a segment of their local community. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 01:59, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: if we're going to have articles on every single school in the world (which it seems some people are determined to make happen) can we <i>please</i> limit to info to that which will remain consistent for years? No one is going to update a quarter of a million school articles regularly (hell, many of these are AfDed as substubs, are voted to be kept and expanded, and remain sustubs for eternity). Principals come and go (my high school had 3 in the 4 years I was there), exact student enrollments change daily. Information like that should be supplied by external links to the high school's sites (which <i>will</i> be updated). Give an approximate size ("about 200", "over 1000" etc.) and keep the rest to relatively consistent stuff, otherwise, as the articles become dated, we'll have incorrect information, which I think we can all agree is not good for the project. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 19:16, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is a reasonable request. Whenever possible we should be dating when the principal was in office, that way when they do change we can build a historical list of principals who have served at the school, including the years they served. The same goes with enrollment counts, we should either round the numbers off slightly and state that the figures are approximate, or provide a dated source for the information so the reader is aware that these figures may have changed, as they tend to do. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 19:35, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, I don't really see this happening. Most school pages are stubs that will never be significantly expanded. Trying to make the scope of the school inundations greater by adding more pretty insignificant details is just going to increase the half-assed manner in which most of these articles are put together. Trying to have not only the current, but all past principals is going to fail. Utterly. The "best" that is likely to happen is someone will find their old high school and add who the principal was the years they were there, giving us a few names with some approximate dates and many gaps (with much still largely unverified). We have to face up to the fact that school articles by and large <i>aren't</i> going to get the attention they need to keep them up to date. There is plenty about the schools that won't change much over the years, and that is what people should be concentrating on when writing such articles. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:06, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are quite correct. I reviewed all the school articles for the states of Texas and California, and found twelve that were more than a year old. Of those twelve, only two had undergone extensive revision since their create date. Another five showed adequate growth, and were no longer just substubs. The remaining five were pretty much in the same state as they were when first written, with little or no new information added. I expect this trend will continue when the huge number of school articles created in the last six months reaches a year of age. It seems people are keen to create a mass of stubs, but when it comes to adding meat to the bones, their enthusiasm is elsewhere. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 01:46, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
