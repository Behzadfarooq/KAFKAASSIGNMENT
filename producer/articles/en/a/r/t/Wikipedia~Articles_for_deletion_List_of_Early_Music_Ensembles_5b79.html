<p>"Early" relative to what? What qualifies as an "ensemble"? Current list seems awfully honky-centric. I'm not anti-list, but this topic seems better served by the Music in [year/decade] series. Also title is improperly capitalized. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 17:04, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I withdraw deletion nomination, but at a minimum it needs serious {cleanup} (and a proper title and de-orphaning and linking to <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_music.html" title="Early music">Early music</a>). A list with no context/definition other than a term that's probably unknown to 90% of the global population isn't very helpful. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 19:09, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why nominate a page for deletion only to remove it two hours later! This is another example of the misuse of VfD - obviously good/useful articles (as reflected by every vote being a keep). <b>Obvious keep</b> --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldakQuill_3b15.html" title="User:OldakQuill">Oldak</a> <a href="../../../o/l/d/User_talk%7EOldakQuill_6507.html" title="User talk:OldakQuill">Quill</a> 09:16, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_music.html" title="Early music">Early music</a> is what it's generally called. These ensembles are contemporary ensembles playing music that is in the genre. How can you detect the honkitude of the names of the ensembles on this list, anyway? And what difference does it make? (Note: there are a fair number of people of Asian ancestry playing early music; do they count as non-honkies?) Research a bit more before vfding, please. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 18:17, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. An "early music ensemble" is one that specializes in music of the European classical tradition from the Baroque era and before; the term is in common usage. It's a pretty good start on the list, though some of the most famous ones are missing. Also some of the groups on this list cross over into folk music, and perhaps a few other styles (for example, the Baltimore Consort). Some day this subject will be covered by a category as well. Please google "early music ensemble" (26,400 hits). <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> 18:31, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>It would have been nice if the article mentioned <i>any</i> of that, and wasn't an orphan. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 18:46, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Great--helps a lot--thanks. My dad was a public school music teacher for ~30 years, so I guess I assumed (incorrectly, obviously) that any common music jargon would at least 'ring a bell' for me. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But it's not uncommon for lists not to provide any context other than their title.

<li>None of the first three mention "<a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_music.html" title="Early music">early music</a>", and the fourth needs to be dabbed, as it doesn't even refer to an ensemble. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 19:25, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think I've made it quite clear above that it was an honest mistake, that I've withdrawn. It happened to be my 15,000th edit--I would think that would allow people to cut me some slack for making a mistake. I will never understand why some VfD voters routinely violate official Wikipedia policy (<a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a>), as well as semi-policy (<a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a>). <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 22:56, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's a bit rich to claim that listing something on VFD using perjorative terms like "honky" without first bothering to spend 30 seconds checking on Google for actual notability is an "honest mistake", but I'm prepared to give you the benefit of the doubt this time round. Concerning editors who regularly violate policy, perhaps you should discuss the matter with them in the first instance.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 00:39, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>No problem from me; it was clearly a good-faith addition to VfD. I'll try to make the article better later (can't now, at work) Best regards, <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> 23:17, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I must note that is disheartening to see rude and thoughtless comments directed to an editor who made an honest mistake. No harm is done in listing an article on vfd, but much harm is done to civility and a sense of community when we attack someone for such a minor mistake. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 03:29, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It isn't a minor mistake to nominate an article which isn't patent nonsense without doing any research. A google search is all that is required. Spurious listings on vfd are harmful on two counts: timewasting, and more importantly that they are a slap in the face to honest contributors and a threat to the ability of Wikipedia to retain editors. There are several cautions against hasty nominations on the guidance pages. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Philip</a> 04:55, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There are many other things which waste far much more time than the occassional mistaken listing, like vanity pages which unfortunately can't be speedied. I don't see why some people stubbornly refuse to cut our fellow contributors some slack in cases like this, especially when they acknowledge it was an honest mistake. Rude responses to minor mistakes and refusal to assume good faith are far more of a "slap in the face to honest contributors" and much more of a "threat to the ability of Wikipedia to retain editors" than a harmless and quickly forgotten vfd listing. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 05:59, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. While I am generally an inclusionist, I don't believe in attacking people who nominate articles for deletion. It gives us the opportunity to sort the wheat from the chaff.
