<p>Whomever first wrote the description of "the roots of coincidence" either didn't read it or didn't understand it. He doesn't defend Kammerer's or Jung's view but is rather critical with it saying that it is almost non-sense. Their example (a small part of the book) is only presented to show the difficulties involved in finding a formal structure for the experimental findings of parapsychology. I have therefore edited the entry. Also as a trained physicist I can tell that he was very aware of the latest advances in Quantum physics which he presents superficially but quite rigorously and accurately. boirac Oct 2006</p>

<p>No list of Koestler's books is complete without mention of his wonderful autobiography, Volume I of which is called "Arrow in the Blue". It's a must read for anyone interested in Koestler.</p>
<p>I have added a write-up of how this first autobiography gives an early insight into his later decision to end his life. sc00b 02:19, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>...Leon Wieseltier can only be commended for debunking Arthur Koestler's attempt to rehabilitate the long discredited theory of the non-Semitic origins of East European Jewry [NYR, October 28].</p>
<p>A glance at Koestler's intellectual meanderings and fluctuations across the past three decades can only lead one to conclude that his intentions this time around in The Thirteenth Tribe were not the advancement of knowledge but cruel mischief, unforgiveable attention seeking (considering the predictable Arab response already noted by Wieseltier). Koestler, therefore, deserves to be openly chastised for misusing his considerable intellectual talents and devoting them to such a peripheral theory bordering on fantastic speculation, a tangential issue in Jewish history even in its heyday a generation or so ago.</p>

<dd>Many elements of Arthur Koestler's thesis were proven false, while a few others were proven true. Some of his false claims are:
<ul>
<li>His concept that German Jews did not migrate to eastern Europe in large numbers.</li>
<li>His claim that French and German Jews mostly died out in the Middle Ages.</li>
<li>His exaggerated population figures for Khazaria.</li>
<li>His claim that Crimean Karaites descend from Khazars.</li>
<li>His supposition, based on Gumplowitz and other Polish Jewish scholars, that certain Polish placenames were named after Khazars. Only in Hungary and Transylvania do we find placenames that actually come from Khazars.</li>
<li>His claim, based on Mieses, that an Austrian legend about Jewish princes was based on the Khazar rule of Hungary.</li>
<li>His claim, based on Poliak, that Ashkenazic shtetls were derived from Khazar village life.</li>
<li>His claim that Ashkenazic Jews have hardly any genetic or anthropological connections to the ancient Judeans.</li>
</ul>

<dd>I think the article texts states that he "claimed" to be the first. Which is highly possible, if we are talking in the narrower modern sense. The reference is either from Cesarani or Koestler's own description of his time in Palestine. Crosswords are less than 200 years old in English (I think) and neo-Hebrew is an even younger language. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 11:36, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>--Koestler writes about being "the father" of the Hebrew crossword puzzle in "Arrow in the Blue". He was pround of it. He said it brought some lightness to an otherwise oppressively serious journalism. I recall that the word he invented for it in Hebrew would translate into English as "word acrobatics"Meb53 22:06, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Once again, the inclusion of references to popular culture, such as rock music, in an article about a thinker, drags Wikipedia down to the mental level of a twelve year-old.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELestrade_9460.html" title="User:Lestrade">Lestrade</a> 18:21, 7 April 2006 (UTC)Lestrade</p>

<dd>Not at all, the fact he is noticed in popular culture does not reflect badly on him. Not to mention the fact it is idiotic to pretend that only twelve year olds like rock music.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Not everyone considers Koestler a thinker. Did you ever hear the quote that "Koestler loved science, but science didn't love Koestler"? I think his thoughts on science are fascinating, but he has little or no real substantial direct influence on mainstream science, and the fact he even touched Parapsychology makes him a "kook" in some people's books. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 19:02, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sounds like a philosopher, author and journalist. Why is he a polymath? The 'science' sounds like philosophy of science or <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>. 146.115.120.205 12:38, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well being the things you just said would make him a polymath, if only in the subjects he wrote about; he was also involved in many political campaigns at the front line, scientific research to a degree (such as in the case of the effects of LSD, or more controversially fringe science (what is and isn't "pseudoscience" is highly subjective anyway)). I think the fact that he wrote about such varied subjects, ranging from history, to science, to language to politics justifies this description. He also wrote (with varying success) in a number of creative genres - fiction, drama, and journalism. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 19:07, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The term's usually used to refer to people who excelled in both the arts and sciences.

<p>There isn't very much about Koestler being a rapist in this article beyond the mention of Cesarani's "claim"; in the linked article to Jill Craigie, though, the wording states that in Cesarani's biography "it was revealed he had been a serial rapist." Was he a rapist or not? is this disputed anywhere? does anyone care? <a href="../../../h/j/i/User%7EHjijch_3337.html" title="User:Hjijch">Hjijch</a> 01:54, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, some people definitely care. There was a big ruckus about this at the University of Edinburgh regarding the Jill Craigie claim. Coupled with Koestler's double suicide, his relationship with women is controversial. Is it disputed? Well, I don't know whether he did rape her or not, but it certainly is believed by some people. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 16:31, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The comment about the Balfour Declaration, that in it "one nation solemnly PROMISED to a second nation the country of a third," is included in Chapter 1, Romantics and Routine, of "Promise and Fulfillment, Palestine 1917-1949," first published by MacMillan and Co. Ltd., London and New York, in 1949. In the paperback, PAPERMAC (a division of MacMillan), shortened version of the original edition, published in 1983, the comment appears on page 4. The paragraph in which it appears reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Now an improbable event <i>[the rise of Zionism]</i> is bound to lead to further improbable events, until the area of the the disturbance <i>[a comparison has been made with a golf ball which has suddenly started moving towards a hole without being hit]</i> gradually returns to normality. The ball which started rolling towards the hole on its own upsets the routine of the whole tournament. The appearance of the freak movement of Zionism on the political scene was bound to produce a series of freak-reactions. It culminated in the famous Balfour Declaration, one of the most improbable political documents of all time. In this document one nation solemnly promised to a second nation the country of a third."</dd>

<p>I note that someone has referred to Koestler as post-modernist. I think some of his stuff is <i>proto-</i>post-modernist (if there is such a thing!
