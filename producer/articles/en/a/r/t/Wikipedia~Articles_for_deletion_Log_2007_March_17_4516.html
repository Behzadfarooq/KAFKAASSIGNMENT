<li><b>Keep</b>: Obviously the school has not had MUCH history yet - but if you read through the links provided in the article and in the parent <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Prairie_School_District_204_d867.html" title="Indian Prairie School District 204">Indian Prairie School District 204‎</a> article, you'll see that the planning and acquisition of land has already been highly contentious. It took two ballot attempts on the part of the district to be allowed by its taxpayers to float the construction bonds for buying the land and starting construction. The district is still in an ongoing dispute with the lawyers representing the trusts of what's called the Brach-Brodie property; the former refers to the late <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Brach_de68.html" title="Helen Brach">Helen Brach</a> (as in Brach's candies), who owned quite a bit of land just north of 75th street in Naperville and Aurora. Her estate has also tried to get the private Naper Aero airport closed down on multiple occasions, on the argument that its close proximity reduces the value of her lands (Lowe's, Staples and a Costco are on her former lands on the Naperville side of IL Route 59 now). These disputes are notable in the Naperville/Aurora area, DuPage County, and even the State of Illinois as the district petitions the Illinois General Assembly for "Quick Take" powers to seize the land required to start construction and open the building by its planned 2009 opening date. Sorry, but I see NO grounds for a delete here. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 01:04, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> so let me get this right, I can't claim it's inherently notable (as I argue <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_opinions_6a18.html" title="User:Noroton/opinions">here</a>), but you can claim it's just not notable? Nice little argument you've got there TJ. I think it can be assumed that the building of a high school will be covered by the independent press, and it strains believability that there aren't multiple articles somewhere about this school being built, given what it costs for a local government to build a high school (in my community, a high school was torn down and completely rebuilt for $78 million).

<li><b>Keep</b> - already notable, with multiple non-trivial sources, because of the political controversies. With election candidates citing the School, people are likely to look the School up and we should have an article (as we do with other major or controversial building projects). As a 3,000 student high school it will be inherently notable (and if its not we might as well fold our tent as a serious encyclopaedia of record). The concept of deleting it now, while its construction is getting media attention, and then recreating later, is simply not sensible. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 01:58, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I actually wondered myself whether this might not be a better title. However, the practice in, for example, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Category%7EPlanned_or_proposed_arenas_8a94.html" title="Category:Planned or proposed arenas">Category:Planned or proposed arenas</a> is for projects that are expected to be notable (and even the most die-hard deletionist would be hard pressed to argue that a community of well over 3,000 people is not notable), have articles under their own names. One can look at <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Birmingham_Stadium_a1a0.html" title="City of Birmingham Stadium">City of Birmingham Stadium</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenwich_Arena_340d.html" title="Greenwich Arena">Greenwich Arena</a> for example. As construction progresses there will, doubtless, be a constant stream of media articles focussing increasingly on the School. I would not resist strongly if a compromise was suggested for the article to be moved to Metea Valley High School project (a better, more all embracing title than 'Controversy') with a fresh article being created (and no doubt debated) when the School is opened. It just seems a rather technical approach. The content, however, plainly satisfies <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and while I can see a logical case for a move I see no basis in policy for a delete. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 05:12, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comments</b> Regarding notability: The Indian Prairie School District is one of the largest in Illinois - the two primary communities it serves are the second largest (Aurora, population approx 157,000) and fourth largest (Naperville, population approx 140,000). While these are NOT the only districts for these communities (Naperville has one other, and Aurora has two), Indian Prairie has been the one experiencing the most growth over the last 15-20 years. Any arguments made that the school itself is not notable I really take issue with, because the entire controversy is being fought over the school's existence. If for some reason the project should never get started, or indeed, FAIL, yes I could easily see making a "Controversy" or "project" page, but I have never known any Chicago area school district to NOT complete a project (just leave them vacant, for a time). I realize that even having this article at all, more than two years before the planned opening (a date which will very likely slip), is seen as a bit premature, but as has been pointed out, building projects yet to begin or which may never begin still have their own articles, and under the name of the building as it has or would have been planned - three area examples are <a href="../../../3/0/0/300_North_LaSalle_603f.html" title="300 North LaSalle">300 North LaSalle</a>, under construction, and <a href="../../../2/9/_/29_South_LaSalle_b46e.html" title="29 South LaSalle">29 South LaSalle</a> and the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Spire_6e82.html" title="Chicago Spire">Chicago Spire</a>, both of which may never see the light of day. It's also not unheard of to have school articles created before the actual school opens, as in the case of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plainfield_North_High_School_e22a.html" title="Plainfield North High School">Plainfield North High School</a> (although that was a case of a few months rather than 2+ years), yet that article has not been challenged while the school still has not been filled to full enrollment, and has yet to be fully accredited for sports or have a history of achievement exams. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 15:20, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

But if this person really exists, and certainly if he was on BET, then he's notable. Unfortunately, the name of his supposed record label gets no relevant ghits.

<li><b>Comment</b> that should tell you that there is something there, you just need to dig deeper and do more hard work. His obituary was in the New York Times archive and he was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. He is also listed in a paper biographical dictionary, and Google book search has 10 of his books scanned and indexed. Google news archive also lists him in several papers. It makes me happy to see a niche writer get the web presence he deserves. I will add more from his biography when I get more time, and see if I can contact his grandchildren for an image. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 21:34, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Searching on "Harold Augustin Calahan" in fact gives you 65 unique ghits, all for him (and he is not always referred to by all 3 names). He seems to have written a number of books on yachting, some of which have had recent Dover reprints, showing continued interest in his work. See <a href="http://www.bbyra.org/fleet/O_shorebird_fall_2004.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.bbyra.org/fleet/O_shorebird_fall_2004.pdf" rel="nofollow">this recent review</a>, for instance. He used to write a prominent magazine column on yachting. I don't think he is exactly a household name, but he seems to have had some importance in the little world of mid-20th century American yachting. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 07:40, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I own the book <i>Back to Treasure Island</i>. He has written a long introduction in which he defend the writing and says it is actually Stevenson's honour and not his own. I think Calahan should not be an unknown name for those who are interested in novels and discussions around them. It is probable that he is a somewhat obscure person, but it should clearly be noted who he is. I hope for some to come who knows more about him. I am myself astonished that it is that little to find on the <i>internet</i>, but probably there are some facts outside the internet. <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESummer_Song_7ecf.html" title="User:Summer Song">Summer Song</a> 13:42, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A "Chocolate yorkie" is a Yorkshire Terrier carrying a double recessive gene for a red or brown coat. <a href="http://www.shooterdog.com/alexfaq3.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.shooterdog.com/alexfaq3.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> The result is a Yorkie whose color and coat do not conform to the breed standard. The gene will also often result in brown or liver pigmentation of the eye rims, nose and paw pads, another flaw in a Yorkie. AKC has many colors on the list as acceptable for a Yorkie, which means that some off-color Yorkies may be registered. However, the Yorkshire Terrier Club of America opposes the breeding of these dogs:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Blue born puppies and red/chocolate born puppies are not acceptable colors of the Yorkshire Terrier. The Yorkshire Terrier should only be born Black/Tan and later turn to a dark steel blue. The blue born puppies &amp; red/chocolate born puppies are recessive colors being passed to the progeny and a repeat breeding should never occur. Puppies of these colors should not be sold as “rare colors”. Yes hopefully it is very rare to get them, but these are totally unacceptable colors and it’s not so much that they are rare, as that they are not true representatives of the breed. . . A breeder should not knowingly breed a dog that is producing such a known defect. The breed could shortly become other than what it is. . . The standard laid down by the YTCA is very specific about the Yorkshire Terrier. It states the puppy should be born Black/Tan and change color to a Blue/Tan dog later in life." (From an article printed in TYT Magazine © 1998 by Cher Hildebrand.)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Breeders of Yorkshire Terriers generally agree that breeding of such off-color dogs should not be repeated. <a href="http://members.aol.com/CYorkie/GeneticsBlueRedChocolate.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://members.aol.com/CYorkie/GeneticsBlueRedChocolate.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Breeding of such faulty Yorkshire Terriers is usually done only by backyard breeders and puppy mills.</p>
<p>"Chocolate yorkie" is not a breed recognized by any kennel club. Internet searches come up with no breed club for Chocolate Yorkshire Terriers (or Chocolate yorkies as indicated in the title of this article) or Brown or Gold Yorkshire Terriers. The off-color is definitely a mutation to the Yorkshire Terrier breed and NOT in line with the breed standard. In any case, it is NOT a new breed - and the faulty color variation does not warrant a Wikipedia article. If anything, the occurrence of the faulty brown and red colors should be addressed in the Yorkshire Terrier article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../e/p/o/User%7EEpopp_cce4.html" title="User:Epopp">Epopp</a> (<a href="../../../e/p/o/User_talk%7EEpopp_1155.html" title="User talk:Epopp">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Epopp_99ac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Epopp">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. It's a lousy little stub that fails <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, but the reason for deletion -- when you take out the long-winded wind-up -- seems to be "not a recognized AKC breed", which has nothing to do with Wikipedia policies or standards. We're not the AKC catalog. If the breed is unofficial but <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> there's no reason not to include it. But the article needs references. -- <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 05:41, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b>. The fact that the Yorkshire Terrier Club of America doesn't like it would certainly be irrelevant if it were, for whatever reason, widely written about anyway. However, the sources given simply talk about "chocolate" Yorkshire Terriers as one of several possible nonstandard color variants. It seems this could be discussed adequately in the "Coat and color" section of the main <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire_Terrier_6dff.html" title="Yorkshire Terrier">Yorkshire Terrier</a> article. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><i><b><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelithemis_11c2.html" title="User:Celithemis"><font color="red">—Cel</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelithemis_923e.html" title="User talk:Celithemis"><font color="black">ithemis</font></a></b></i></font> 05:56, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I see nothing here that couldn't be added to the Yorkshire Terrier page. Every breed has colours that are non-standard, some for good reasons (some colours are tied to birth defects), some for reasons that have more to do with the dog's original job (white fur can be difficult to camouflage in the forest), some simply for aesthetic purposes. Do we need a separate article on every undesirable colour in all 430 or so known dog breeds? --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 06:43, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> with SWATJester's rewrite idea--it will really be a better article with that information merged into it. <b>Oppose Merge</b>. Once rewritten, it would unbalance the "coat &amp; color" section of the main <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire_Terrier_6dff.html" title="Yorkshire Terrier">Yorkshire Terrier</a> article. ≈≈<b><a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolfrog_505f.html" title="User:Carolfrog">Carolfrog</a></b>≈≈<a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarolfrog_b5b5.html" title="User talk:Carolfrog">♦тос♦</a> 05:07, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b>. Just to be clear, the problem with this article was not that Chocolate yorkie is not a recognized breed. The point is that the article is misleading by saying that Chocolate yorkie is a breed. There is no support for this idea - virtually nobody (other than the author of this stub article) contends the "Chocolate yorkie" is a breed separate from the Yorkshire Terrier. Chocolate merely refers to the off-color. It is like a white Doberman or a Bernese Mountain Dog that lacks the signature white markings. Having a separate article for something that is merely a non-standard-color-Yorkie seems misleading in that it implies the off-color dog is a different breed or in some way significant. The only significance I can find to the Chocolate yorkie is mentioned in the reason for deletion.<i><b><a href="../../../e/p/o/User%7EEpopp_cce4.html" title="User:Epopp">—</a><a href="../../../e/p/o/User_talk%7EEpopp_1155.html" title="User talk:Epopp">Epopp</a></b></i> 05:29, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Gwenboy's a brand new user who needs some tutoring in our guidelines (particularly image policies, going by his talk page). Without evidence that this was a notable single (or even an officially released single), I don't know that this needs its own article. — <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatherineMunro_0200.html" title="User:CatherineMunro">Catherine</a>\<sup><a href="../../../c/a/t/User_talk%7ECatherineMunro_06c5.html" title="User talk:CatherineMunro">talk</a></sup> 03:53, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Based on recent events, it seems very likely that this is a hoax. <span id="Gwenboy" class="plainlinks">Gwenboy&#160;(<a href="../../../g/w/e/User_talk%7EGwenboy_0202.html" title="User talk:Gwenboy">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gwenboy_0cea.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gwenboy">contribs</a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#002bb8">logs</span></a></span>) was indefinitely blocked for what I can only describe as bizarre, often disruptive edits. He started a page for another Gwen Stefani single, "Naughty In The Bed", which was never listed on an album, nobody has heard of, and was apparently certified as a gold single with a music video based on <i>The Simpsons</i>. It included the text "before she took out the single 'Naughty In the Bed' she already had release the singles global so all the music store chucked out the CD's and gave them back to Gwen, which he kept them just incase she wants to release it again." Considering a <a href="http://youtube.com/results?search_query=Serious+Stefani" class="external text" title="http://youtube.com/results?search_query=Serious+Stefani" rel="nofollow">Youtube search</a> turns up the same one-minute previews of the video but not the video itself, it's probably safe to say that this is a hoax. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 04:01, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete/Redirect</b> - this was never relased as a single anywhere, Gwen filmed the video for it as a possible future single but her pregnancy prevented her from releasing it. No single was sent out, no promo was sent out. Tracklisting fake and details of video fake. The story of how the song was written alos fake, Gwen has never been hospitilized for a broken arm. The whole concept of video is also wrong, no body knows the details behind it, only rumors, Gwen has never even talked about the video, their has only been a one minute preview from teh choreographer.</li>

<p>I can find no mention of "apathetic agnosticism" aside from the church which the article references, so to say it is a genuine variant of agnosticism is to advance <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> and perhaps create a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a>. Alternatively, the article could be moved to Universal Church Triumphant of the Apathetic Agnostic, but I doubt that would satisfy our notability guidelines for organizations (see <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>). — <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElembis_b8b1.html" title="User:Elembis">Elembis</a> <small>(<a href="../../../e/l/e/User_talk%7EElembis_9398.html" title="User talk:Elembis">talk</a>)</small> 02:32, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Improve</b> As co-author of the page, I expressed my own concern at the time (see talk) that it was, perhaps, too much of an 'advert' for the UCTAA (We're not the Moonies, by the way...keep a sense of humour), and invited others to re-write it differently. It would be better if somebody did this, rather than just taking the lazy option of deleting anything that does not correspond with your own internal dogma. Although it's hardly a citation; I know for certain that at least one person (me) genuinely believes in this religious viewpoint, but I am not in the business of telling anybody else what to believe, no more than the UCTAA is.<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisRed_a0c1.html" title="User:ChrisRed">ChrisRed</a> 13:31, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</s></li>

<li><b>Redirect Sounds Good</b> On second thoughts, and having read the Apatheism page, I think a redirect would be fine, as there is very little difference between 'Apathetic Agnosticism' and 'Apatheism'. The only difference being that the UCTAA is perhaps a little less prone to pour scorn on other's beliefs. Many UCTAA people admit that they still struggle with the third article of belief, in that we do sometimes 'wonder'; but accept that the existence or otherwise of God is not conditional upon our belief in it/him/her/they. Man cannot 'believe' God into existence, no more than he can 'deny' him into oblivion. Therefore our struggle with the question is futile, rather than irrelevant. What is true is true, and what is false is false. It doesn't actually matter whether there is a Wikipage to describe it or not. We are therefore apathetic&#160;:-) I do, however, believe that 'Apathetic Agnosticism' is a more accurate description of the state of mind than 'Apatheism', even at the cost of deleting all mention of the UCTAA from a unified 'Apathetic Agnosticism' page. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisRed_a0c1.html" title="User:ChrisRed">ChrisRed</a> 22:30, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>There are only about 80 hits on Google for the name of this sketch show, and almost all of them are either this Wikipedia article or copies of it on other sites, or are links to information about other people who use "five minute funnies" as the title for their own unrelated activities. The program On the Lot had tens of thousands of films submitted to it, so that doesn't make this notable. There are no references or claims to notability in the article, and I can't find <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">reliable sources</a> for information about this unsold program. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELastChanceToBe_b802.html" title="User:LastChanceToBe">LastChanceToBe</a> 02:47, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again, the series wasn't created for the express purpose of the On The Lot contest. Because the show is an attempt to bring mainstream industry jobs to the Pacific Northwest, it is the first of it's kind and garners mention. The creators of the show submitted one sketch out of 12 final products in an attempt to gather more attention about the show. That is all the competition has in regards to the importance of the show, so it is immaterial to the discussion here. This article was a working and edited part of Wikipedia for eight months preceeeding this nomination, and deserves mention simply because of the unique endeavor being attempted by the creators. --<a href="../../../c/m/d/User%7ECmdrClow_aa26.html" title="User:CmdrClow">CmdrClow</a> 02:59, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The comment that On the Lot doesn't make this sketch show notable isn't the thrust of the argument. The comment is intended to point out that I looked into this, and that being on the On the Lot website isn't an indication of notability. Therefore, this is materially important to point out. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELastChanceToBe_b802.html" title="User:LastChanceToBe">LastChanceToBe</a> 06:59, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Nominated for <b>Delete</b> as reason to quote this <i>She's famous in her own right now and on TV and in magazines a lot. So I created a page for the little slapper.</i> - My reply is, have I seen her on TV yet, NO; have I seen her on magazines, only on naff gossip mags that also features Z-Listers, therefore not notable at all, unless you are one of these people who are fascinated with famous for nothing celebs who didn't have to lift a finger to be famous like what Michelle has done. Also, this page does not provide the evidence for her to deserve a place in this site, all nothing but PR talk. Dr Tobias Funke 03:00, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment on all</b>, does having a small role or having a celebrity game show sport due to the fact she just came off a reality show make her notable, I say <b>no</b>, even being notable on BB5 now does not make her notable at all nowadays, well I can't see any of the rest have their own pages as well.

<li><b>Keep</b> I dont see any reason for this article to be deleted. It is actually a quite good article.Their is no evidence that proves that she is not notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> Whether or not anyone likes Big Brother or Michelle Bass is <b>irrelevant</b>. She is a notable "celebrity" in the United Kingdom.

<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b> here. I note that <a href="../../../n/o/w/Now_That%27s_What_I_Call_Music%21_2ca6.html" title="Now That's What I Call Music!">Now That's What I Call Music!</a>, which several people here have referred to, has an article for every album, and a better template to organize all of them. Now, perhaps that series is more notable than this one (it certainly is) and therefore should have individual album articles while this one doesn't, or maybe that series needs a deletion discussion here as well; I'm not sure, and not one to make that judgement based on what I've seen here. However, if the resulting article isn't too massive, it would be prudent to consider merging most or all of these entries, and perhaps after that, a new deletion discussion may proceed on any leftovers with a smaller focus. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="green">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="blue">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="purple">ka</font></a> 11:40, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>These are all compilation albums, <s>and every article is unsourced. They are likely to remain unsourced,</s> because reliable third party sources don't usually write pieces about compilation albums. The musicians featured are notable people and the albums they create <i>themselves</i> are critically interesting as unique artistic creations; those original albums receive plenty of third party coverage to write an article from. But compilation albums, cobbled together from intellectual property already owned and previously released by the record labels, are not interesting or unique creations, so no one writes about them. Thus the lack of reliable sources. For the same reason that secondary sources don't bother to write about these albums, Wikipedia shouldn't cover them as a tertiary source, lest our coverage devolve into indiscriminate lists.</p>
<p>There are at least nine more of these that are still redlinked, and of course more will be released every year. None of the articles can be sourced for content expansion. Let's nip this in the bud before well meaning editors waste any more time editing these time-sinks.</p>

<li>These are not notable albums on their own. The artists, who are notable, did not work on these albums. They had nothing to do with their creation. These albums are not their creative endeavors. They are compiled by the companies who already own their previously released works. There's absolutely no limit to how many compilation albums these companies can produce, and it would not surprise me to learn that the artists received no compensation for these. Indeed some of them have probably forgotten that their songs are on these things, if their agents ever forwarded the memo anyway. Can you explain what is notable about a compilation album? Originals are notable for being unique artistic creations, something new that a person brings into the world. What is notable about the fact that record companies combine and rerelease to create the false appearance of something new and grab more money? That's just everyday greed; nothing notable or interesting about it. Nothing about these albums passes <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. The articles about the <i>original</i> songs and albums and the artists themselves pass notability. But a shuffled tracklisting is not further notable on its own.

I gave WOW Worship Orange as one example; perhaps I should have made that clearer. The status of that particular album obviously doesn't impinge upon the others. But the others have the same problem as that one does. Each of them needs <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">Attribution</a>, and that is policy, non-negotiable. In addition, I believe that all of the separate albums fail the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notability</a> guideline: "<i>A topic is notable if it has been the subject of at least one substantial or multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject.</i>" Finally, as a separate matter, I believe the main article, <a href="../../../w/o/w/WOW_Hits_b335.html" title="WOW Hits">WOW Hits</a>, is non-notable in general because the series is not the creation of the artists that are republished in it, and without new creative material, <b>having articles about compilations is functionally no different than Wikipedia articles about what WDOD 96.5 FM played last Thursday between 9:00 and 10:00 AM.</b> Indulge me for a moment. Here we have a compilation series: <a href="http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=1194599&amp;BAB=A" class="external text" title="http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=1194599&amp;BAB=A" rel="nofollow">25 Symphony Favorites</a>, <a href="http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=1194581&amp;BAB=A" class="external text" title="http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=1194581&amp;BAB=A" rel="nofollow">25 Romantic Favorites</a>, <a href="http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=1194582&amp;BAB=A" class="external text" title="http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=1194582&amp;BAB=A" rel="nofollow">25 Mozart Favorites</a>, <a href="http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=1194583&amp;BAB=A" class="external text" title="http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=1194583&amp;BAB=A" rel="nofollow">25 Beethoven Favorites</a>. The company that makes these, Vox Cameo Classics, makes many more. By your reasoning, because all the artists and most of the songs on these albums are notable, <i>the compilations themselves are notable and we should have articles about them.</i> And, indeed, since this is a series, <i>we should have a "25 Favorites by Vox Cameo Classics" article for the series.</i> But this is absurd.

The artists didn't "work" on them, but yet artists don't work on soundtracks or other compilations albums that are listed on wikipedia, it would be stupid to delete one series and not delete all the other series. As for the WOW Christmas and Aqua, most of the songs on these albums are not repackaged, they are exclusive to the series and available nowhere else. WOW Hits, sure, those are available on the artists albums, but Worship and and Christmas are not. How can an album not be "notable" even though it's clearly widely available in stores and is a popular series? Keep them all, even the album pages because only WOW Hits has only reused tracks, wikipedia is an information site correct? You can't list the albums but not give information.

<li><b>Merge all to main WOW article</b>, as there's actually a remote possibility that something substantial and/or worthwhile can be said about the series as a whole. a rule of thumb I'd personally have for compilation albums is: "Did any artist 'break it big', or experience a significant change in his or her career, as a direct result of his or her song being included in this compilation/soundtrack/retrospective/whatever". In this case, the answer is "no". Series is notable, series deserves an article.

But the songs were originally on other albums. Those original creations are the ones that are notable because notable artists worked on them. Charting suggests that people are notable because we they are already people; the charting just lets us know that they are sufficiently in the public eye to make an article worthwhile.

We can work around it and completely outside of it, with no adverse consequences. <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> also reminds us: "<i>meeting any of these criteria does not mean that an article must be kept.</i>" The pertinent section, on albums, notes it "is somewhat controversial" (which is to say that it's more controversial than notability in general, which is always controversial). The albums section then says, "<i>if the musician or ensemble <b>that made them</b> is considered notable, then their albums have sufficient notability</i>" (emphasis mine). That's a particular distinction. The artists here <b>did not make these</b> albums. They weren't involved in the production. Their creative process was already over when these albums were compiled by the marketing divisions of the record company. So all we get out of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is this: a guideline, which we don't have to follow, which says it doesn't mean the articles must be kept, and says the relevant section is especially controversial, doesn't even apply because the notable artists didn't make these albums.

<li>2) If we use your album option, then I disagree with your interpretation of several words. Let's revisit the key sentence <i>if the musician or ensemble that made them is considered notable, then their albums have sufficient notability</i>. The term "ensemble": If you look <a href="http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/ensemble|here" class="external autonumber" title="http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/ensemble|here" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> at yahoo's definition, I believe that either definition 1c: "A group of musicians, singers, dancers, or actors who perform together" or 2: "A work for two or more vocalists or instrumentalists." would apply. Either definition state the musicians, not the compilers of the CDs are the ensemble. I disagree with your usage of the word "maker." The maker of an album is the artists that made the each of the individual tracks. The album could not be <i>made</i> without using their tracks. So what if the artists <i>made</i> the tracks earlier and not specifically for this CD? Some of these tracks were actually specifically made for the CD. The guideline doesn't talk about the compilers of the album. <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalbroil_3602.html" title="User:Royalbroil"><font color="#000000"><b>Royal</b></font><font color="#FFCC00"><b>broil</b></font></a><sup>&#160;<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalbroil_9d82.html" title="User talk:Royalbroil"><font color="#FF0000">T</font></a>&#160;:&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Royalbroil_8587.html" title="Special:Contributions/Royalbroil"><font color="#000000">C</font></a></sup> 05:16, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If we admit that <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> has nothing to say here, it's true that we are left with everyone's feelings and various arguments. You act like this is a problem. How do you think guidelines get made in the first place? People bring their opinions to the table and discussion works toward a consensus or at least something resembling a consensus. This is normal and desirable. What people <i>haven't</i> done here is simply state "I don't like it". The arguments for deletion have been argued extensively from several points of view. The argument that only original works matter seems a strong one that Wikipedia carries throughout many other areas, and the fact that you don't agree with this argument does not reduce it to simply <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a>. Your characterization of this argument as <a href="../../../a/a/d/WP%7EAADD_43fd.html" title="WP:AADD">WP:AADD</a> is unfounded. Such an argument would play very well on any notability talk page, and there's no reason why it shouldn't be aired here. You're flat wrong about what an ensemble is. An ensemble plays <i>together</i>, in the same room. An ensemble is a band. It is not a bunch of bands playing unrelated tracks in different studios. If this is the first time you've encountered the word, you might be legitimately confused, but it is really not open to the interpretation you are trying to ascribe it. You say "<i>The maker of an album is the artists that made the each of the individual tracks</i>", but no, that's the makers of the songs. <a href="../../../t/u/p/Tupac_Shakur_8f89.html" title="Tupac Shakur">Tupac Shakur</a> did not make <i><a href="../../../r/_/u/R_U_Still_Down__%28Remember_Me%29_78c0.html" title="R U Still Down? (Remember Me)">R U Still Down? (Remember Me)</a></i>, his first (of six so far) posthumous album. The page for the album recognizes this, that the album was created without Tupac's creative input. That's the important distinction. Of course, that album contained new tracks, unlike these. But these albums were created without the involvement of the artists' creative input. You may be unfamiliar with how the recordning industry works. But these albums can be created without the artists even being informed of them, depending on their contracts. In many cases, they do not have to sign off on their work being included here. Those transactions take place entirely over the artists' heads. That's not creative input. I've seen it being said that some tracks were made exclusively for certain particular CDs here, like the green Christmas album. However, this has still not been cited, and absent a reliable citation, that's still lacking <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> and no actual indication of notability. <span style="white-space: nowrap">— <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan">acan</a></span> — 11:31, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

You are correct that <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> does not always have to be followed but normally if the decision is going to be made to remove something that meets the criteria there should be several good reasons why, the same would go for including something that doesn't meet any of the criteria.

I'll play your game and we will just totally forget <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>(which these albums clearly meet the criteria of) for a second.

The fact that they did chart so well proves that they would be of interest to many music enthusiats and they would want to read about them. Also these albums show what songs were considered to be the most popular CCM songs for the year of each individual release and are notable in that aspect as well. Do you have anything on these compilations at all that merits deletion except for the fact that you don't feel they are notable because they are compilations.

<li><b>Comment</b>: considering that the "delete all"&#160;!voters, including myself, are in favor of deleting all the articles including the main article, and many other&#160;!voters are in favor of deleting (or in some cases merging) all the articles except the main article, it appears there is at least a consensus for the pruning of those articles. A look at the history of <a href="../../../w/o/w/WOW_Hits_b335.html" title="WOW Hits">WOW Hits</a> shows that <a href="../../../s/u/c/User%7ESucrine_6897.html" title="User:Sucrine">Sucrine</a> has managed to make that article summarize these others, but without anything that appears to be copied from those articles. There would be no licensing-based need for redirecting instead of deletion. I may continue to argue for the deletion of <a href="../../../w/o/w/WOW_Hits_b335.html" title="WOW Hits">WOW Hits</a> as well, but if that is not possible I hope the "middle" option will be considered as well. <span style="white-space: nowrap">— <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan">acan</a></span> — 11:08, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Had put up a speedy tag before I noticed it had been a contested prod. In any case, still looks like a speedy deletion candidate. No claim of notability made. Google finds 158 unique hits, (many related to some guy named D.J. Gutter!) and all I can find are unreliable sources. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 03:41, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy delete</b>. No assertion of notability. So tagged. Prod removal by creator does not prevent tagging for speedy deletion (this logically follows from the fact that articles tagged {{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}} can still be speedily deleted). <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 03:54, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I tidied this up a few days ago, but as it is it doesn't say very much. The Ministry web-site has an undated note saying that the Record of Sites and Places has been removed from the web-site because of "errors in the locational information" - which sounds as though they are not sure where the monuments are. Perhaps someone has been moving them? They estimate that it will be back in six months from the undated note, which is not helpful. It might be possible to do a better article then.

<dd><b>Comment/update:</b> Looking at the sources provided now I don't doubt that the article is encyclopediac and valid (i.e. these people <i>were</i> killed), but the sources themselves are extremely... extremist on one side. I am not taking sides, I don't know Armenian history from Turk history. But when one page is quoting <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Begins_16f4.html" title="Batman Begins">Batman Begins</a> to make its point about <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a>... I can't take it totally seriously. That said, changing to <b>Keep</b> for the article, not particularly the title. This will need huge clean up and way, way better sourcing than just pro-one side sources. That is, the material is fine (in that the attacks happened), but using just anti-Armenian or anti-Turkish sites would be horribly bad. maybe UN pages, and actual media sources? I think this will be more of a content rather than Afd Issue. - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 06:49, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Fadix, this AFD discussion is way too early, we should give time to everyone who wants to expand this list. There are more than 80, possibly more than 200 attacks, we should not put them on the ASALA page, otherwise the ASALA page will become 'lists of attacks by ASALA' page that you guys want to delete. Again, you all know this better than me, Wikipedia is not on paper, there is no reason not to have a relevant page. I don't want to do this right now because of this AFD discussion (not to affect people), but I am planning to use this list as the main article for the <i>some other attacks</i> part on <a href="../../../a/s/a/ASALA_768c.html" title="ASALA">ASALA</a>, people who are interested can just take a look at this list. By the way, by details I did not mean the whole details, just 1-2, maybe 3 lines (the current list is fine). Also Turkish government can be used a source for Armenian related matters, we might not want not choose it as the main source for a general Armenian related thing, but this matter is not just an Armenian matter, it is a Turkish matter as well, the embassies attacked were Turkish embassies, most of the people who died were Turkish diplomats, their family members or coworkers. We are not going to put opinions of the governments here, but the events. It's like using US government's documents for incidents of Iraqi insurgency or Al Qaeda, etc <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenizz_0c80.html" title="User:Denizz">deniz</a> 23:20, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Fine, but don't you think that the expension should have been done before creating the article, when it was obvious that the article will creat a controversy? You are right about we should not exclude the Turkish government. The problem with a list is that it exploit one weakness with Wikipedia, perhaps I should work on a guideline about that. The problem is that a list will usually make a statment of fact, not position. With a list it is difficult to say:"According to X, but Y does not..." since it will defy the purpouses of it being a list. This is why I always had a problem with lists, we have the same problem with categories, we should be careful with categories, because we will not start footnoting them and justifying their uses. Having said that, for those reasons, it is best to not use the Turkish government as a source, because we are presenting "facts" rather than "positions." But Coolcat has presented another source which is more complete and neutral, which rander the use of the Turkish government source as useless. Had he presented that source a priori, and excluded the biased sources, the result of the votes could have been different. But another problem remains, is that all acts were not perpetrated by the ASALA, and filtering them will creat more controversies, as many other lists will be created. This was also one of the reasons I requested merging, since I found that it would fit better if each acts were discribed in their relevent mainspaces. I guess we have to see what the community decides. Or else, you could start working with the article and improve it, by addressing the issues raised by the critics and see what the reaction will be. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 23:41, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It appears to me that the reason of controversies (and most delete votes, possibly some keep votes as well) was the usage of the 'bad sites' as references, now it is fixed (maybe we should inform the voters(delete'rs or keep'ers), they might reconsider, it has a new title as well) Also if you are talking about general articles, they don't start as featured article candidates, they usually start as stubs and get expanded. If you are talking about lists, it would be better if they had a good head start, but I don't think this is necessary for lists either. The problem with lists you mentioned is a general thing, and I don't think it applies here. To have a person in this list, a) that person must be killed/injured in an attack, b) that attack must be claimed by ASALA (it might be co-claimed by other organizations, that is fine). If we are going to use governments as references, we will only take the 'statements' not say opinions of some politicians. Statements of governments are reliable sources, and here we need only statements, a) and b) above. I agree that the usage of Turkish government as reference is so far rather useless, but having multiple references is not a bad thing. Back to 'bad sites' aka Tallarmeniantale (don't know much about others, is ATAA the American Turkish society?), I believe Tallarmeniantale might be worthy of having an article about (similar articles can probably be found on the Armenian side). <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenizz_0c80.html" title="User:Denizz">deniz</a> 06:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The point is the one Angus McLellan made: how come it was possible to create the main ASALA article using reasonably reliable sources but not this one? As Angus said: "I suppose the idea of finding books to use as references, rather than polemical self-published websites, is rather too alien to be considered". The first source used is a chronology presenting an incredibly one-sided account of Turkish-Armenian relations. It doesn't even mention the initial Turkish invasion of Armenia. So is this a reliable source? No. I thought the idea of Wikipedia was to "make the Net not suck", not to bring all the suckier parts of the Net together in one place. It should be perfectly possible to create a list like this, but if people really want it so desperately how about making the effort to go and find some neutral, third-party sources? Until that happens, this page should be deleted without prejudice to recreation. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 09:28, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Folantin, any source for a list can be used as a source for the article was well, so there will be more possible sources for the main page than the list. Also all the references are reliable now, tallarmeniantale and likes are not used, Angus' comments are not that relevant now. And, what do you mean by Turkish invasion of Armenia, what do you mean by 'not even mentioning Turkish invasion of Armenia'? Please don't make me ignore you. Also, a website of a list of attacks don't need to have a thorough analysis of the attackers' motives, and it can be used as a source, it can be very good source indeed. Thorough analyses are usually commercial. Anyway, its almost morning, back to my coffin. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenizz_0c80.html" title="User:Denizz">deniz</a> 11:09, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>They aren't reliable. Have you actually looked at the chronology I mentioned which claims to give a complete account of Turkish-Armenian relations since the 11th century, yet doesn't even mention the Seljuk invasion? I'm not even going to go into the many other omissions. Would any reputable historian think this source was trustworthy? It's simply a polemical advocacy site. Getting a bunch of these things off the Web and collating them doesn't add up to reliable sourcing - as I point out below, they even contradict one another. The ASALA did carry out attacks in the 1970s and 1980s. The job of editors here should be to find out factually accurate information about them, ideally using academically respectable books. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 11:38, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>General comment</b> I've just noticed this list doesn't even use its own sources accurately, regardless of how reliable they are. Take the first incident listed. Source 1 says that Mehmet Baydar and Bahadir Demir were assassinated by "Gourgen Yanikian"; yet Source 2 says they were killed by "Migirdic Yanikyan". So which is it? More importantly, what is this incident even doing here? It took place in 1973 but according to Source 2, the ASALA wasn't even founded until 1975. Come on, please, this is supposed to be an encyclopaedia. Factual accuracy is paramount, especially on controversial subjects like this. It's also worth noting that for many of these attacks, several groups apart from the ASALA also claimed responsibility. It's not very encyclopaedic to put them on a "List of attacks by the ASALA" unless a neutral source has determined who was behind them accurately. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 10:57, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Let's not itemize these comments, it would be like voting multiple times. Yanikian, Georgeu (or Gourgen) was born around 1895 in Ottoman Empire, did you stop a while to think that these Georgeu or Gourgen might be his adopted names after he migrated to USA, and Migirdic Yanikian might be his name in Ottoman documents most of which are in the possession of Turkish government now (hence Turkish government might feel obliged to use this name)? We certainly need to look into this, it will be a way to improve the list. All sources say that ASALA was established in 1975. I think we should move the first attack to the introduction, ASALA and JCAG founders were inspired by this attack and founded ASALA, this attack may be the reason why mostly diplomats are targeted, but it is not necessarily part of ASALA attacks. I am going to do that now. Lets improve the list, not delete. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenizz_0c80.html" title="User:Denizz">deniz</a> 17:57, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is not necessary or desirable to list every single attack. Does an article on a war list every engagement in which a few soldiers died? Does an article on the streets of a city list every street - or just the notable ones? If there were only 10 attacks, we would want to list every one. Since there are dozens or hundreds, we should list those that were more significant or notable and summarize the rest. Just because this whole affair is part of a blood feud between Armenians and Turks, in which they want to obsess over every real or imagined injury, is no reason that we should write bad articles on this subject. Too much niggly detail means that an article is less effective and interesting - no one is going to want to read through a list of 200 attacks. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 18:13, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree, attacks on embassies are certainly notable. If a terrorist organization attacked 200 <i>World Trade centers</i>, we would list all 200 of them and make an article for all 200 of them (in which case a category would be enough). Attacks on embassies are notable, maybe not as notable as something of caliber of attack on World Trade center, so that each would require an article. This is not a bad article on this subject. When we have more than 50 attacks listed, we can reorganize things to make it more easily readable.

Second, the list format is appropriate as in a general article about ASALA there would be no breadth for a list this large. Third, in response to article's citation quality: This should not seriously be considered a valid reason for AfD. The article was created a few days prior to AfD, which really begs the question why the concerned authors are not helping out providing better sources. The article can provide better sources and a little amount of effort should be able to find them - here is one from the Turkish government: <a href="http://goturkey.kulturturizm.gov.tr/BelgeGoster.aspx?17A16AE30572D313A781CAA92714FCE0A3216081A23BEF0D" class="external text" title="http://goturkey.kulturturizm.gov.tr/BelgeGoster.aspx?17A16AE30572D313A781CAA92714FCE0A3216081A23BEF0D" rel="nofollow">Armenian Issue, Allegations-Facts, Chronology</a>.

<li><b>Tally by nationality</b> (Updated through Penwhale's vote below) For the closing administrator, for general amusement, for anyone who might have thought that people vote based on the merits of the article and not whether they like its political implications: I did a tally by nationality, based mostly on voter's userpages, although in a few cases I classified them based on comments on their talk pages (Armenian Barn Stars, for instance) or by what articles they principally edited. Here is the tally.
<ul>
<li>Turks (Cool Cat, A. Garnet, free smyrnan, Parishan, Doktor Gonzo, Atabek, Denizz, Mustafa Akalp, Baristarim) - all voted to keep (9 Keep votes)</li>
<li>Azeris (Ulvi I. Grandmaster, adil) - all voted to keep (3 Keep votes) (for those who don't follow the region, Armenia and Azerbaijan fought a war recently)</li>
<li>Armenians (Eupator, ROOB323, Augustgrahl, Aivazovsky, Artaxiad, Vartmm, Fadix) - all voted to delete or merge (6 Delete votes, 1 Merge )</li>
<li>Greeks (Domitius, Yannismarou) - 2 Delete votes</li>
<li>All others - 8 Keep, 5 Delete</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the whole, a sad day for Wikipedia.

<li>I am really offended by this, I am a mergist and deletionist by nature. I voted merge and justified my argument. I also answered to Deniz that there was still time for him to convince the community to keep it, by improving the article. I did not only vote, but also provided a descriptive reason for my decision and settled on the middle by voting merge. It isn't bad at all, as you claim 6 keeps and 6 deletes, which place me on the center. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 21:41, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I of course am not accusing any particular editor of voting solely on politics. As the "neutral" votes show, opinion is split on this. However, it is certainly against the odds that <i>all</i> Armenians would vote to merge or delete, and <i>all</i> Turks would vote to keep. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 23:01, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I agree with you and it is really sad, the whole idea of the afd should be reviewed, on the Armenia Azerbaijan RfAr, one of my proposal was to restrict involved sides to vote for a period of 3 months. I have few ideas to prevent abuses of this system, if you are interested we could talk about it in your talkpage. We are at a point that the closing administrator has to view who voted what and what uninvolved parties have voted.

<dd>I'm not sure exactly what you mean. I tend to be a "deletionist", but that means that I tend to bring a lot of articles up to AFD; I don't necessarily vote "delete" on other editors' AFDs.

<dd>If being the "Armenian", "Turk", or "Azeri" affects the votes, why not being deletionist? Also, it might have had an effect on your decision to create a 'tally of votes by nationality' here. Do you usually do that when the plurality of votes are 'delete'? No need to kinda 'accuse' Armenians, Turks and Azeris to be the Armenian, the Turk, the Azeri. A better tally of votes would be based on date, in my opinion. This AFD was started and many votes were based on the fact that 'some' websites were used as a reference back then; I hope a lot of people had to a chance to take a look at these again. I am not going to make that tally of votes based on date, as I might be biased. If we want to tally the votes, another option would be a tally of votes based on the nationality and the date. This might be better.<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenizz_0c80.html" title="User:Denizz">deniz</a><sup><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenizz_ee75.html" title="User talk:Denizz">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Denizz_917f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Denizz">C</a></sub> 00:50, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>All I was pointing out was how ethnically political this discussion was, how nationality was in fact a 100% accurate predictor of how someone voted. I don't normally tally votes that way, because I am rarely involved in such discussions. I'm sure there are other ways you could split up the voters, but you aren't going to find any more valid than this. I was kind of saddened, frankly. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 03:32, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, people did not say anything about whether they would object adding the gazillion attacks to the ASALA page (which was represented as an alternative of having this list, and yes they are needed), I object that. Also, many thanks to Coolcat (Catchi), the 'Azeri', who has been improving the article a lot lately.<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenizz_0c80.html" title="User:Denizz">deniz</a><sup><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenizz_ee75.html" title="User talk:Denizz">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Denizz_917f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Denizz">C</a></sub> 00:50, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Several of the "Azeris" also had Turkish language userboxes and might actually identify as Turks. I don't think this changes my analysis any. I don't personally mind adding some of the info to the ASALA page, if it is missing from the list of attacks there, and if the attack is significant enough to be mentioned. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 03:32, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm sure you did. I'm not accusing any particular editor of anything. I'm just pointing out that all the Turks and Azeris came to the same decision, and all the Armenians and Greeks came to the opposite conclusion. Many of them gave perfectly good arguments for their positions. If you feel that your vote was based on a rational consideration of what is the best way for Wikipedia to present this information (for clearly at least some of it needs to be in Wikipedia <i>somewhere</i> - and much of it <i>is</i> in Wikipedia, in other articles - then you have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. However, let's be reasonable - it is obvious that politics is influencing people's decisions here, and I am just pointing that out. I don't really have a personal axe to grind; breaking the votes out by ethnicity doesn't really help argue for deletion, which is what I recommended. I just thought it was sufficiently remarkable to be interesting to point out, and that it might help people re-examine their decision processes. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 19:55, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. It could be kept really, if it has potential for expansion. Clean up should be done, but all articles start as a mess, so no surprise there&#160;:) I see the logic of Fadix that it could be merged to the main ASALA article, so the question is: Does this article have potential for more expansion as a list that can be mained out from the ASALA article? If not it could be <b>merge</b>d. But there are shorter articles so I don't know. If it were kept as a strict list, it shouldn't become a FORK. If analytical stuff is added, then it can become so. So how much potential for expansion does this article have? I<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 04:04, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> (at least as it is now) and <b>merge</b> any usefl information to ASALA article. Since I see in the ASALA article two sections named "major attacks", and "some other attacks" I fail to understand what this article adds to the subject. It does not fulfill <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a> (attackes are already listed in the ASALA article, and the prose is longer there), and the list doesn't add anything new. So, why couldn't it be just a template included in the ASALA article? If this article is to be saved, its editors must concentrate their efforts on making it useful and informative enough to stand on its own. As it is now, it doesn't.

<li><b>Do not backmerge</b> no matter of result, please!!! These leaf articles are created to remove pop-culture references from main articles, to keep them more on topic and better maintainable. For most of the time this works rather well (compared to never ending struggle to maintain these references inside them main body of the text). If you put some references back then the inevitable cycle of their accumulation, offloading into a leaf page and VfD will be only sped up.</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete and do not merge</b> - An indiscriminate collection and directory seeking to capture every time the turtles or a specific turtle is mentioned somewhere else ever. I would also strongly dispute the notion that this "solution" to the problem of garbage in main articles works well most of the time. Most of the time these trash can articles simply collect more and more garbage until they get deleted (or worse, kept on some combination of <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> and <a href="../../../b/h/t/WP%7EBHTT_103f.html" title="WP:BHTT">WP:BHTT</a> argument), wasting everyone's time and effort a lot more than simply policing the main article would. This accumulate-split-delete-accumulate-split-delete cycle also does nothing to address the problem that this kind of trivial crap represents. If the presence of this sort of information lowers the quality of the main article in particular and Wikipedia in general, then article after article full of awful "cultural references to..." and "...in popular culture" itms also lowers the general quality of Wikipedia. Well-written articles on cultural representations can be done but keeping this sort of crap around as the dominant example of how such articles exist does not encourage editors to write actual good articles on the topic and contribute to the endless cycle of crap. No one seems to much like these sorts of articles but time after time instead of taking a stand against them people vote to keep them because actually addressing the problem they represent they deem too difficult. The "better solution" that already exists is to delete the articles as they come up and remove the crap from the articles before it accumulates to the point of inspiring a split. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 17:43, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> (I am creator of this article). <b>First</b>, this is <b>obviously</b> not OR, which is claimed as the reason for deletion. Everything is taken from the sources. Article is based on <s>a single reliable source</s> <i>at least four reliable sources now (see my reply below - "Thank you")</i>, which is perfectly consitent with Wikipedia policies. <b>Second</b>, English translation of main source has been provided in the article. See: <a href="http://lrtranslations.blogspot.com/2007/02/commissars-of-internet.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://lrtranslations.blogspot.com/2007/02/commissars-of-internet.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. So, could you please read this translation, and then decide if the subject is a "hoax" and notable. As explained on talk page, this is a reliable source. <b>Third</b>, this article say nothing personal about Putin except that FSB workers admire him (which is probably true). So, this is not attack against Putin. <b>Finally</b>, this article has not been created to accuse Wikipedia editors. I planned to create it long time ago, as anyone can see looking at my personal page <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html#Links_and_notes" title="User:Biophys">User:Biophys#Links_and_notes</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Talk%7EPersecution_of_political_bloggers_1c41.html#English_translation_of_Russian_article_about_.22Internet_troll_squads.22" title="Talk:Persecution of political bloggers">Talk:Persecution_of_political_bloggers#English_translation_of_Russian_article_about_.22Internet_troll_squads.22</a> where the same source has been used. Further, I have never made any personal accusations of that kind. If someone else did, this is not my problem. The subject about "FSB trolls in Wikipedia" was opened by an anonymous user in talk page <a href="../../../f/s/b/FSB_%28Russia%29_f093.html" title="FSB (Russia)">FSB</a>, so I have mostly reacted on that.

I have made the corresponding changes in the text, but I do not want to move the article during AfD discussion. If you disagree with such title, let's mark this article as <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> and discuss a better title (wrong title can not be a reason for deletion). Finally, the AfD nominator believed that the article is "an attack page against Putin". Obviously, it is not, since there is only one mention of Putin in this article as a third party.<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 14:27, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>As far as I can tell, if this exists, which is doubtful, it can't be any more that a yearly skit. There are no references to "Newington College Show" anywhere that I can find except on Wikipedia and its mirrors. No references on the Newington College website. Claimed viewer totals supposedly approaching 1 million in Australia, but not ever appearing on any network? The footnotes for the viewership reference Nielsen ratings for the US, and do not mention this supposed "Newington College Show" at all -- they're duplicated footnotes intended to look like they're references for the "data", as long as you don't look at them.

<p>Fails WP:N. Original link to CNN report now dead, and link to Hubble site appears to be about a completely different object. Furthermore, google reveals that the name came from a <i>description</i> of the object as a 'large pathetic galaxy', and no suggestion that this should be used as its name has ever been made anywhere apart from on Wikipedia. It was detected via its effect on the Milky Way's disk; if it's considered important then it could be mentioned in the Milky Way article. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislintott_1b69.html" title="User:Chrislintott">Chrislintott</a> 19:08, 5 March 2007 (UTC) In case it's not obvious, <b>delete</b> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislintott_1b69.html" title="User:Chrislintott">Chrislintott</a> 15:05, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The arguments in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Large_pathetic_galaxy_95bb.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Large pathetic galaxy">previous AFD discussion</a> for this article incorrectly assumed that the object in question was simply "unnamed" and that therefore "Large Pathetic Galaxy" should at least serve as a placeholder name. The object in fact has a number of proposed names in use, and the article that mentions them - <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgo_Stellar_Stream_2b54.html" title="Virgo Stellar Stream">Virgo Stellar Stream</a> - existed at the time of the previous AFD. The object istelf passes <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> with flying colors, however the term "large pathetic galaxy" was <i>never</i> used as a provisional name for the object, but merely a generic descripton of it. A redirect might be cheap but it would be misleading as it would effectively endorse the idea that LPG is an alternative name for this object, when it is not and never has been. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 19:48, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgo_Stellar_Stream_2b54.html" title="Virgo Stellar Stream">Virgo Stellar Stream</a>. Although Arkyan makes a valid concern about endorsement, I think it does not harm because, if nothing else, it might prevent recreation of a similarly named article down the line. Part of me thinks it'd actually be cool to have a galaxy named this, though. Incidentally the fact the only linked source on this article is no longer active underscores the weakenesses in using online sources that fall behind subscription walls or simply expire. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 20:52, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To redirect suggests that Large pathetic galaxy is an alternative name for something called the Virgo stellar stream. This isn't the case. Otherwise we could set up redirects for 'big damp city' to Manchester, 'hot red powder' for chilli and every other description possible for anything in the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislintott_1b69.html" title="User:Chrislintott">Chrislintott</a> 21:33, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think the original statement about a "a rather pathetic galaxy" attributed to Robert Lupton is now called the Virgo Overdensity,<a href="http://www.astronomy.com/asy/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=3841" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.astronomy.com/asy/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=3841" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> or Virgo Stellar Stream. So I believe 23skidoo is correct and a redirect would be suitable. However my preference is for <b>delete</b> because I don't expect to see this name being used for lookups. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 22:45, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've had a quick look through this paper, and see no evidence that it is the same object that is described in Large peculiar galaxy.

<li>Okay, in the Reuters link where Lupton says "large pathetic galaxy", he's not using that as a name, so there shouldn't be a redirecting title. A trivial comparison suggests the actual object Lupton is talking about is surely <a href="http://www.sdss.org/news/releases/20060109.virgooverdensity.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sdss.org/news/releases/20060109.virgooverdensity.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, and that SDSS release directs the reader to <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0510589" class="external text" title="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0510589" rel="nofollow">astro-ph/0510589</a> where the name "<a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgo_Stellar_Stream_2b54.html" title="Virgo Stellar Stream">Virgo Stellar Stream</a>" is proposed. Identity established, but as others have said, a redirect would be misleading so let's not merge. Instead of using any content from this page, I will write from scratch a blurb that includes "large pathetic galaxy" over at <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgo_Stellar_Stream_2b54.html" title="Virgo Stellar Stream">Virgo Stellar Stream</a>. That way the GFDL does not demand the revision history of this page (since I'm not cross-pollinating content), and searchers on google will still be able to find relevant information using a "large pathetic galaxy" search string (which may have entered the public consciousness, if someone used the phrase to start an article here). Anyway, that should resolve everything, and there's no need for a merge, so <b>delete</b>. <span style="white-space: nowrap">— <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan">acan</a></span> — 07:15, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Never mind, I see the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgo_Stellar_Stream_2b54.html" title="Virgo Stellar Stream">Virgo Stellar Stream</a> article already references the "pathetic galaxy" bit.

<li><b>Delete</b>, it's a non-notable phrase made up one day at the observatory. There is absolutely no evidence provided to back up the claim that it's an "informal designation".

<li><b>Comment</b>. Yes, English cities had these department stores and in at least some cases they had a real impact on the history of the place. Perhaps they are notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> Added new information about the store history and one of its idiosyncrasies. This store is unique and deserves its own page. If, however, it is to be deleted then perhaps some of the information could be transfered to the main <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiff.html" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> article? <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESheep21_68f5.html" title="User:Sheep21">Sheep21</a> 18:26, 17 March 2007</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm seeing all these additions, but they need references. Without reliable sources these items could be taken as original research. I don't believe this store deserves anymore of a mention then a regular Food Lion in St. Petersburg, Florida would. Maybe a mention on the article concerning the company that owns it or the city its in. It just doesn't seem to have enough to be its own article. <a href="../../../g/e/l/User%7EGelston_4229.html" title="User:Gelston">Gelston</a> 18:53, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Then by all means, thats what Wikipedia is about. If you can create a good article with reliable sources about a notable topic, then more power to you. The article in its current state, however, doesn't present anything notable about this department store. Think of it from my view, its one of literally thousands of department stores. What makes this one stand out? Why does it deserve its own article? Although it may be notable in Wales, is it notable to someone living in Hawaii? Or Texas? Or New South Wales? I wish you the best of luck, but at this current time, I'm going to have to stick to my vote for delete. <a href="../../../g/e/l/User%7EGelston_4229.html" title="User:Gelston">Gelston</a> 20:01, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Then perhaps this article ( Kicks Hawaii ) about a Hawaiian shoe shop should be deleted too, after all, I don't see why it would be notable to people in London, Moscow or Sydney although I don't deny it must be a notable store in Hawaii, much the same as Howells is a notable department store in Cardiff.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I only commented above. With the new material it is coming along to be notable. This is a store with history that I think has had an important role in the life of Cardiff. That is what makes this one stand out. And no, a store does not have to be notable to someone living in Hawaii. As Sheep21 says, there is virtually nothing in Hawaii that I think is notable, but that does not mean these things and people should not have articles. Keep adding the sources though. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 23:23, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. No, there is currently nothing written into the guidelines for military medal winners. If you think such a policy would be a good idea, might I suggest you bring it up on the the talk page of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and see if there is a consensus among editors which would agree with you? That would be a bit more community-friendly way to go about this, than to just keep churning out these articles in defiance of current Wikipedia policies and guidelines. Please note that if you search the archives of that discussion page, you will see that the issue of military medal winners <i>has</i> been discussed before and the general feeling is that while something like the Medal of Honor would definitely qualify, lesser medals like Bronze Star would not. However, I don't think there has been any extensive debate on the issue. So if you would care to make a case for why something like the Bronze Star should be reconsidered with regard to notability, the talk page of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> would probably be a more effective place to do that than just bringing it up in individual AFD article debates. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 22:09, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have no idea how this has survived since July 2006, but regardless...</p>
<p>This page is a non-notable biography (in my opinion), which verges on an attack page (CSD G10) and <i>nearly</i> meets CSD A7. There is some form of notability in the two end paragraphs, and I was reluctant to speedy it for this and for the length at which it has been around.

<dd>Thanks for volunteering to check the hard copy, unfortunately neither book is at FSU; in Florida copies are at UofF, UofCF, and UofWF even has one, see <a href="http://worldcat.org/" class="external text" title="http://worldcat.org/" rel="nofollow">WordlCat</a>. The problem with his name is that honorifics are stacked at the front, and descriptors are stacked behind. His base name is "Mohammed Badesha Qadri" or "Mohammad Badeshah Quadri" and varients inbetween. He is the same person, Sufi saint, born 1903, active in Karnataka state, Chisti order. --<a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 20:36, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> The nomination for this deletion is on the issue of precedence - if one metropolitan Perth school has a separate article on an internal structure issue - then all would be justified in creating similar list/ articles - and in the case of Perth, W.A. - that would involve the creation of a series of articles that would by the terms of WP:N be highly suspect. This nomination was not made on the merits or otherwise of the school article. If someone did the formatting a more concisely, the list in all likelihood could return to the original article. <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatuSuro_ccea.html" title="User:SatuSuro">Satu</a><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatuSuro_2646.html" title="User talk:SatuSuro">Suro</a> 22:49, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Precisely. <b>Question</b>: What is the predominant colour of the tartan of the Cameron House of Scotch College in Perth? <b>Answer</b>: Who cares? This material shouldn't have been in the Scotch College article in the first place, so there is certainly no need to roll it out into a daughter article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Is it really notable to name the ten house at the school individually? i think that would be more for booklet to new students. Would it seriously detract from the article to omit that the school has ten houses, and their names are:Alexander, Anderson, Brisbane, Cameron, Ferguson, Keys, Ross, St Andrews, Shearer and Stuart? i think the answer is no.

<p>Thoroughly unsourced trivia article, with no pretentions of being an article. We already have <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garuda_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Garuda (disambiguation)">Garuda (disambiguation)</a>. This is a list of very minor trivia, mostly from video games, manga and the like, and most entries having little or nothing to do with <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garuda.html" title="Garuda">Garuda</a> apart from the name... a questionable connection seeing as Garuda is from Indian mythology, being presented in Japanese forms translated into English. No need to merge this back to <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garuda.html" title="Garuda">Garuda</a>, it was forked off from there in the first place, so the items still exist in the history. This article is effectively abandoned, and is a cruft-magnet, and needs to go. Beyond that, I honestly don't think that Garuda is sufficiently important to popular culture that we should have this article: any good version of this article would probably be original research. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 13:19, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete in popular culture</b> The solution to oversized "in popular culture" sections is to prune them, not to fork them into "articles" which are entirely made up of vaguely associated trivia. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 13:27, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>This kind of articles gets created because no one is willing to take up maintenance of pop-culture references in the main articles (it is very time consuming and hopeless struggle). If you have better solution working under current limitations of Wikipedia many, including me, would be very glad to know. (Just deleting the "... in popular culture" leaf page results in people inserting the references to the main article, starting the cycle again). <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 17:03, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The Rolling Stone blog acknowledges and <i>hopes</i> that the title is a rumour. The two results from the BlackEyedPeas website are forum postings... that is not an <i>official</i> cover contest, and every group of musicians who <i>may</i> be releasing another album will have speculation as to the album's contents. There are no afficial news items on the BEP website regarding the release of any album, let alone one by this title. The other two results you provided are online store catalogues (or so I believe from my brief look, I may be wrong). At this point in time, I believe that none of the content in the article can be reliably <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:Attributed</a>. I've got no problems with this article restarting the <i>second</i> there is an official announcement regarding the title and/or release of this album, but until that time, it is unverifiable by use of reliable sources and should be deleted. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">saberwyn</a> 23:27, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It seems excessive to delete an entire list because of a disagreement with the inclusion of individual articles on the list.

It is useful to have read this <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a>.

<li>Inclusion in the list means that things are considered periodic in time. Waves are generally from a point of view of being periodic in space. Of course they will be overlap, and so the two should be linked. The periodic phenomena category is not well formed. It includes disasters that are not at all periodic and that category would be better replaced with another. I was attempting to set up a better category and that led to this attack on cycles material to try and keep me busy so that I could not do that. Also I would argue that a list may be more comprehensive than a category because it is not intrusive to articles. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 05:43, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> wikipedias coverage of cyclic phenomena is woeful. After the last AfD on the topic wikipedia no longer has normal article on the topic, so we are reduced to this list. These things have a long cultural history of study. It is something that man has studied from day one. The entire <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">hindu</a> meta-physics is based around cycles in cycles, see <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yuga.html" title="Yuga">Yuga</a>. In China the <a href="../../../i/_/c/I_Ching_a792.html" title="I Ching">I Ching</a> is strongly linked to cycles. Cycles of sun and moon define our calendar and gave rise to likes of Stonehenge. This tradition has led to cycles being being a key part in early attempts to understand our world such as <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a>, which in turn I suspect being part of the motivation of hard scientist to remove. It is a complete misrepresentation to link study of cycles to just Dewey, many other have studied cyclic phenomena for instance <a href="../../../l/y/a/Lyall_Watson_58db.html" title="Lyall Watson">Lyall Watson</a> devoted a most intriguing chapter of <i>supernature</i> to the diverse natural phenomena which follow the cycles of the sun and moon.

So, tides and moon phases should be in, while <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodynamic_agriculture.html" title="Biodynamic agriculture">Biodynamic agriculture</a> should be out I think, as it is too unrelated. And for example, <a href="../../../w/o/m/Woman.html" title="Woman">woman</a> should be out, even though a woman has a monthly cycle. In short, adding things which have something to do with cycles, but not a lot, hurts the readability and information value of the whole thing I think. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 15:27, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

This is a list of approximately 500-600 bibliographical references to cycles reports. Most of these reports are in the period 1970-1992 and are listed in some ~100 minor categories and 10 major ones, these being: Astrophysics, Atmospheric science, Biology, Botany, Economics, Geoscience, Medicine, Social Science, Zoology, Interdisciplinary. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 05:23, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I was surprised when I took a look to see that the list actually is organized and not a complete disaster. My primary objection would be that topic is too ill-defined and would accumulate everything under the sun (including potentially <a href="../../../w/o/m/Woman.html" title="Woman">woman</a> as Oleg points out). My own answer to this would be to tighten up the introduction to the list to eliminate the kinds of things not currently listed. Further trimming is also highly recommended. As for the OR complaints... Lists have always felt slightly OR-ish to me (e.g. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sexually_active_popes.html" title="List of sexually active popes">List of sexually active popes</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_Presidents_by_height_order_a0e5.html" title="List of United States Presidents by height order">List_of_United_States_Presidents_by_height_order</a>). Is this list more OR-ish than that? In my opinion, no. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 14:06, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - looking at the "what links here", there seems to be no article that <i>requires</i> this list, and its generality seriously compromises keeping it for its own sake. As DGG points out, some of the looser inclusion arguments could lead to any number of items being added to the list. Inclusion criteria which would prevent this would seem to leave little need for this list, although sections might turn out to be useful somewhere. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 08:08, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Proposal</b>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not notable. (I was the original prodder.) This guy is just another struggling model with no claim to fame; he's not offered the industry anything special and isn't prolific.

<li>Can you point to the section of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> that requires that the subject "offer the industry anything special" or "establish a dramatic character"? Because all the WP:BIO that I read said was that they had to have "appeared in well-known ... television productions." Stallings was not just in "a few episodes of a reality television series." He was a featured cast member of two different shows (three, if one counts the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_with_the_Dickinsons_d178.html" title="Christmas with the Dickinsons">Christmas with the Dickinsons</a> special as a separate show but still two regardless) including appearing in almost every episode of two seasons of one show. So he meets the specific notability guideline for entertainers. He has also been "the subject of ... multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject" (two of which are linked in this discussion and also in his article) so he meets the general notability guideline. I'm unclear as to why you would think that an article whose subject passes both <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> should be deleted, but since your prod was specifically addressing WP:BIO and he passes it, there is no valid basis offered for deletion. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 21:02, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Keep a redirect that goes from Eau Rouge to the circuit article.

Not that it's all that scientific, but google gave me 224,000 hits for "Eau Rouge".

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The article defines its own notability by the amount of information on it, including long and detailed quotes from notable drivers. The sources are there in the article. Merging it to <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circuit_de_Spa-Francorchamps_db91.html" title="Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps">Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps</a> would put too much material into that article about one corner and would unbalance the article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The subject is clearly notable, and there's obviously a lot of relevant and important content on it. The fact that it's a corner does not mean it doesn't 'deserve' an article.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Agree that the subject is notable, per my original comment, but only in the context of the circuit, surely? Both articles look to be <i>well</i> under the suggested cap, so I don't think the length of a merged article would be an issue. Note also that one para (the first under 'Trivia') concerns only the circuit anyway, not the corner. I don't think there would be a loss of focus either, but that's a more subjective judgement. <a href="../../../4/u/1/User%7E4u1e.html" title="User:4u1e">4u1e</a> 23 March 2007, 12:40</li>

<p>This article is nominated for deletion due to lack of verifiability. It does not return any google hits. The only source mentioning Chebign'o is found <a href="http://www.iaaf.org/WXC07/news/Kind=2/newsId=37985.html" class="external text" title="http://www.iaaf.org/WXC07/news/Kind=2/newsId=37985.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I would expect at least few discrete sources, but even school or coordinate directories refuse to recognise it. Thereafter, it remains doubtful whether a village called "Chebign'o" exists in reality. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulius_Sahara_5577.html" title="User:Julius Sahara">Julius Sahara</a> 16:12, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>It must be a misspelling in the IAAF article. <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunkmorten_c486.html" title="User:Punkmorten">Punkmorten</a> 19:16, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>A village called Chebunge might match, at least it is located near Kapsimotwo <a href="http://www.tutiempo.net/Tierra/Kenia/Kapsimotwo-Sub-Location-KE009237.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tutiempo.net/Tierra/Kenia/Kapsimotwo-Sub-Location-KE009237.html" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. Kapsimotwo is a sub-location, which is the smallest defined administrative unit in Kenya. According to the abovementioned IAAF article, Sigei was born <i>in</i> Kapsimotwo, and that's already a quite precise notation. I think the article, if not deleted, should be renamed to Kapsimotwo. But bear in mind there is place called Kapsimotwo in Nandi District too... <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulius_Sahara_5577.html" title="User:Julius Sahara">Julius Sahara</a> 16:58, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'm in an e-mail conversation with the editorial manager for the IAAF, who has sent a confirming e-mail to their Kenyan correspondent that wrote this story to verify the spelling. Please don't close this debate just yet (unless this issue doesn't matter), I suspect I will have some information by tomorrow. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanchom_ae62.html" title="User:Sanchom">Sancho</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESanchom_4ab1.html" title="User talk:Sanchom">talk</a>) 13:44, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Spelling correction</b>. The author of the referenced IAAF article confirmed it was a spelling error and has updated the article with the correct spelling: Chebeing'o. However, I can't find any information about the village under the new spelling either haha... so maybe this was irrelevant to the discussion after-all.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> because this was a misspelled article and the correct spelling has no encyclopedic information available other than the district that it exists in. We can leave the correctly spelled village name in the article on <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Sigei_cc5e.html" title="William Sigei">William Sigei</a>, but without the wikilink. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanchom_ae62.html" title="User:Sanchom">Sancho</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESanchom_4ab1.html" title="User talk:Sanchom">talk</a>) 16:02, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

If you have a problem with the current article it merely needs to be listed as a stub and given an unreferenced tag, as the article obviously is genuine and features a notable subject. So rather than quoting policy pages on which I can't find anything that specifically relates to this article, prove that Cellador in no way passes <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> which is the established guidline for musical artists.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> For very simple reason, He is absolutely <b>not notable</b> and <b>unheard in My country</b>.Most of the sources are in fact written by himself and contain false information, such as calling himself a columnist when he has only 4 article for a certain newspaper!!!. Does anyone know how many Sri Lankans write articles or columns to local news papers&#160;?? I guess it could be thousands, and do we need articles for every single person who write something to news papers&#160;? And there are several hundreds of NGO in Sri Lanka and anyone, even I ,can start a new one..So I am not sure how that would make someone notable. And for the google hits, both rajkumar and Kanagasingam are extremely popular names among Tamils and I am rather surprised that there were ONLY 4000+ hits. Please do tell us how many of those hits are actually belong to the author himself..finally, this person has nothing to do with India hence this debate should not be included in the india-related deletions..Thanks<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki"><font color="blue"><b>Iwazaki</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/w/a/User_talk%7EIwazaki_7b86.html" title="User talk:Iwazaki"><font color="red">会話。討論</font></a></sup> 06:58, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Whether the references are non-trivial or not is an editorial decision, but in my opinion (and that of the majority of editors commenting in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rajkumar_Kanagasingam_Archive_b4e1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rajkumar Kanagasingam/Archive">first AfD</a>) it is clear that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam30.JPG" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam30.JPG" rel="nofollow">this article</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam13.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam13.jpg" rel="nofollow">this article</a> both have the subject as the main focus of the article and are non-trivial. This is enough to satisfy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Remember, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="WP:N">notability is not subjective</a>. The article still needs much work, and Mr. Kanagasingam's behaviour has not helped things, but the article should not be deleted on the basis of non-notability. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcscott_e3f9.html" title="User:Ccscott">Ccscott</a> 14:54, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Peace medals&#160;??!!

<dd>He is not notable because he has won a peace medal. He is notable because there are multiple, independent media reports on the subject in reliable sources (see here) and therefore this article satisfies the primary notability criterion of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Aside from the argument of <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> who believes that the many newspaper articles discussing the subject are not non-trivial (I disagree), there have been no policy-based reasons put forth to delete this article by any of the editors commenting. All the pro-deletion agruments I see are based on "I haven't heard of him" or "I don't like him", cite the apparent COI issues that surround this article or are just the lazy "per nom" (please see: <a href="../../../a/r/g/Wikipedia%7EArguments_to_avoid_in_deletion_discussions_1a86.html" title="Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions">Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions</a>).

<dd>Ccscott says: <i>He is notable because there are multiple, independent media reports on the subject in reliable sources (see here).</i> Pardon me for repeating myself, but: I went there and saw a small number of short, competent but unremarkable newspaper articles <i>by</i> him. I don't see him discussed in multiple, non-trivial and independent published references. Which are they? I still haven't seen an answer to that. Ccscott says: <i>All the pro-deletion agruments I see are based on "I haven't heard of him" or "I don't like him", cite the apparent COI issues that surround this article or are just the lazy "per nom".</i> Yes, I cited the apparent COI issues. But that wasn't all I wrote. True, I hadn't heard of him, but I'm very willing to concede that I haven't heard of most noteworthy people. (Example: I haven't heard of a single skateboarder, but I'm reliably informed that <a href="../../../s/k/a/Category%7ESkateboarders_be12.html" title="Category:Skateboarders">they</a> can be noteworthy for skateboarding alone, let alone for their other achievements.) And I don't know why I should have to make such a banal declaration, but I neither like nor dislike Rajkumar Kanagasingam. Reason, I think, for deletion (from the very page Ccscott cites): <i>Subject fails to meet the relevant notability guideline (WP:BIO, WP:MUSIC, WP:CORP and so forth),</i> of which the important member is <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. But perhaps I'm wrong and he does meet WP:BIO. If so, how? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 09:55, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I apologize for not addressing this directly but I have provided the link several time to the off-line articles, written independent of him, that discuss the subject directly. Again, the list can be found on the talk page for this article. Specifically: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam11.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam11.jpg" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam30.JPG" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam30.JPG" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam13.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam13.jpg" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> are published newspaper articles completely independent of the subject which are primarily focused on the subject (and are therefore non-trivial). There are also numerous more marginal published articles (a few are: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam29.JPG" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam29.JPG" rel="nofollow">[51]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Businessaward.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Businessaward.jpg" rel="nofollow">[52]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam9.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam9.jpg" rel="nofollow">[53]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam3.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam3.jpg" rel="nofollow">[54]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam6.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam6.jpg" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> and more here ) which discuss the subject in a more trivial fashion. This amount of news coverage is sufficient to pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> easily in my opinion and that of the editors participating in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rajkumar_Kanagasingam_Archive_b4e1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rajkumar Kanagasingam/Archive">first AfD</a>. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcscott_e3f9.html" title="User:Ccscott">Ccscott</a> 12:04, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Neither the peace medal nor handing out an <i>unknown</i> report make this person notable..I don't see anything but pure propaganda in those pictures..In case you don't know, It is not a big deal to have your photo on a newspaper..Some people when they get married put an add on the papers, some when they passed an exam do the same, some others prefer to notify the whole Sri Lanka when they win a medal or competition(in most cases just to boast) by having their picture on the papers..So, just because one has some photos on a newspaper he/she won't automatically become notable , kinda common sense. And, no one here saying things like <i>i don't like him</i> and bla bla..People have come up with very good points and I would kindly ask you to read them instead of dragging this into a different direction.Oh,,You can always shed some light on this by showing us anything written of him in media BY others..So far i have failed to see a single article or anything reported in local media <b>OF him</b>, quite strange for such a notable person, isn't it? <a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki"><font color="blue"><b>Iwazaki</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/w/a/User_talk%7EIwazaki_7b86.html" title="User talk:Iwazaki"><font color="red">会話。討論</font></a></sup> 01:52, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Second, please tell us what are those, <i>many newspapers</i>, all we know is, he wrote 4 articles(1 or 2 kowtowing of a political leader) for Daily news and 1 article for some other..Mainly to promote his NGO work and him self!! Could you please bring us one or two articles written of him(by others) in the main stream news papers&#160;?

<li><b>Weak delete</b> COI issues aside (I personally don't feel COI should lead to deletion unless the article is in such a poor form it's best to start over), it's not clear if this article establishes notability. I thought the peace medal might be something but <a href="http://www.peakbagger.com/climber/ascent.aspx?aid=1262" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.peakbagger.com/climber/ascent.aspx?aid=1262" rel="nofollow">[60]</a> suggests it's nothing that special. Nothing else clearly established notability to me. Also there appears to be bad behaviour own both side. It is <b>inappropriate</b> to spam people about an AFD, especially if it's an article about you &amp; those people are ones who have previously supported you. However it does appear the nominator is involved in a dispute with the editor with some controversy. Editors involve in disputes <b>should not</b> nominate articles for deletion about the person they're involved in the dispute with. Even if the editor genuinely feel it should be delete, this raises COI issues and just looks bad. Rather, you should bring the matter to the attention of other people, e.g. via the village pump or perhaps COI notice board and mention you are involved in an unrelated dispute and don't want to cloud the issue by nominating it. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 14:34, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>First</b>, the purpose of this list is not clear. Will it be used by record-company executives looking for operas to record? I think not. <b>Second</b>, thousands of operas have been created since 1600, and most of them have been forgotten. A comprehensive list of unrecorded operas is therefore a) difficult to achieve and b) likely to be very long indeed. <b>Third</b>, few editors have added operas to this list, and discussion at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Opera_0edc.html#WikiProject_Opera_Work_in_Progress.2FList_of_unrecorded_operas" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Opera">the WP Opera Project</a> has not revealed much, if any, enthusiasm for perpetuating the list, especially as there is still much to do elsewhere. <a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuillaumeTell_4aa9.html" title="User:GuillaumeTell">GuillaumeTell</a> 18:45, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, naturally. ManinBlack, I see this delete proposal stems from a comment on your talk page citing ++ungood; and <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newbie.html" title="Newbie">newbie</a> as examples of dictionary definition pages, and citing apparent inconsistency in enforcement of dictdef policy. Since you haven't proposed <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newbie.html" title="Newbie">newbie</a> for deletion despite that obviously being a dictdef page, I tend to agree with the sentiment of that comment. Or does the ++ungood; page simply lack a stub footer? Lack of potential for expansion should not be a cause for deletion - otherwise, we should delete the entry on Shakespeare because he's dead and potential for article growth has been limited by his demise. There are a lot of articles that fall under the dictdef definition - <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_%28word%29.html" title="Orange (word)">Orange (word)</a> springs to mind, as does much of the rest of the Words category, which should probably be removed. On T-shirts: I suspect that there are rather more people (including the notable <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guido_van_Rossum_04a7.html" title="Guido van Rossum">Guido van Rossum</a><a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/L.Wood/softwear/ungood-guido-van-rossum-closeup.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/L.Wood/softwear/ungood-guido-van-rossum-closeup.html" rel="nofollow">[61]</a> and the rather less notable <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_O%27Brien_a7e9.html" title="Danny O'Brien">Danny O'Brien</a> and <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Swartz_78ad.html" title="Aaron Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a>) wearing ++ungood; on a T-shirt than there are wearing Wikipedia.

<p>Article is an apparent vanity page created by (possible) relative of subject.

If this article was deleted, would a sourced, informative recreation also be deleted out of process? I'm just wondering. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_atheists.html" title="List of atheists">list of atheists</a> is the example from which to work, in my opinion, for all lists of poeple-by-ideology-or-belief, and that's what I would like to see. I also agree with the point raised on the list of communists AfD that sourcing is much easier in a list than a category. This isn't sourced yet, but it can be. Such souring also lends itself better to people like <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Stirner_aa58.html" title="Max Stirner">Max Stirner</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_Tolstoy_eb79.html" title="Leo Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a>, who refused the label of <i>anarchist</i> for personal reasons, but were major anarchist thinkers.

<dd>That's looking very good. I agree that we don't need references for the obvious, I just want to make sure that people who don't have articles are at least referenced. I think your categorization helps with that. Still, it might be problematic since it's sometimes hard to say just where people belong. For instance, Zinn would just as well fit as an educator. Overall though I think that's a good direction for the article. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Owen</a> 08:10, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I am not an atheist, but I think that if endless harping about historical anti-semitism in Islam is permitted on lots of pages, backed with quotations from Qur'an, then I think some other texts from long, long ago should also be permitted, to present another side of Jewish history. Long before Islam existed, yes, but the point is that the God of the "chosen people" also commanded that a great many horrible things be done in His name. An alternative would be to have a page dedicated to <b>"God-ordained atrocities in the Old Testament/Torah."</b> I'm not particularly fond of the American Atheists, but they did a good job in gathering this material. Why hold Islam strictly to the text of long ago when other foundational texts from ancient days are only presented now as lovely, heartwarming, inspirational stories, when really they are filled with evil, vicious incidents, committed by Jews, that are now celebrated as righteous and heroic actions. --<a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoybucket_0c5f.html" title="User:Joybucket">Joybucket</a> 23:58, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. If the material is currently unsourced, doesn't mean it can't be sourced. A google serach reveals such a concept is notable <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=evil+bible&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=evil+bible&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[66]</a>. <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 00:22, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>That's a textbook example of how not to use google. First of all, you need to use quotes otherwise it pops up any page with the word "evil" and "bible" in them, quite a few I would imagine. And even if you do that, there is no way to know how many sites refer to this thing specifically. "evil" and "bible" are just to generic <a href="../../../o/s/k/User%7EOskar_Sigvardsson_905b.html" title="User:Oskar Sigvardsson">Oskar</a> 15:38, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

Atheism is not the main concern; in fact, atheism is irrelevant. The point is that vicious, genocidal acts were commanded or sanctioned by God in many parts of the Old Testament. It is entirely notable, and to focus only on the lollipops, cotton-candy and merry-go-rounds of the Old Testament, while meticulously documenting the pre-PC bias and cruelties of other sacred texts, is intellectually dishonest. --<a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoybucket_0c5f.html" title="User:Joybucket">Joybucket</a> 18:17, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I don't mean to be rude, but you seem to be misunderstanding what this process is all about. I agree with you that the bible is pretty darn horrible at places. I am also an atheist I have no bias in favour of christianity in any way, shape or form. But the question isn't whether criticism of the bible should be in wikipedia, the question is should this, specifically this, example of bible-critique be included. What sets this critique apart from the thousands of others? Has it been written about in magazine articles? Is it in any other way notable?

<p>Episode title isn't confirmed yet. This thing has been moved already 2 times, and it's likely it'll be moved another 2 times before it airs. I'm taking this to AFD, because this is just pollution of wikipedia history. It's something else to create articles for episodes for which at least the name is known, but to create articles and move them around endlessly is just stupid. If this AFD succeeds, i'll hope it will be a precedent for any new articles on episodes, that at least a NAME should be known, and the fact that the episode will actually air at one time should be verifiable. Episode articles are deemed questionable among a large group of editors already, if we start allowing these kinds of things, it will only get worse and those editors are right in deeming these articles questionable in encyclopedic nature. If people want to write something about such an episode, they can do so on the Talk page of the series. The infobox of the last "officially confirmed" episode can point people there. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDJ_515e.html" title="User:TheDJ">TheDJ</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheDJ_8bc8.html" title="User talk:TheDJ">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TheDJ_82c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/TheDJ">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../t/v/_/WP%7ETV_d668.html" title="WP:TV">WikiProject Television</a>) 22:38, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>NOTE</b> I do not question the contents of the article itself, I question the fact that we don't speedy delete anything that is so far into the future that we cannot name it properly yet and spawns a new article like that every week the thing is on the air. When a name of a television ep is confirmed, creating the article is no problem. Before that time all such episode articles should be deleted.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - It's not anything new, actually, in regards to have articles for unnamed episodes (some shows don't have titles), there is a consensus to improve these articles, not delete (<a href="../../../e/p/i/WP%7EEPISODE_008d.html" title="WP:EPISODE">WP:EPISODE</a>).

<ul>
<li>The fact that this has never been PROMINENT enough for anyone to care is logical. That doesn't mean it's a good practice that we should start advertising. Also, WP:EPISODE says nothing about articles for which a name is not known, that was never the spirit of that debate. That debate was at a point where it was still very questionable to create episode articles at all. The fact that people would start creating them for episodes we know jack about (no pun intended), wasn't even phantomed at that time. To quote WP:EPISODE here is just not relevant. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDJ_515e.html" title="User:TheDJ">TheDJ</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheDJ_8bc8.html" title="User talk:TheDJ">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TheDJ_82c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/TheDJ">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../t/v/_/WP%7ETV_d668.html" title="WP:TV">WikiProject Television</a>) 23:49, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> crystal ball doesn't apply, this article says nothing that can't be confirmed. Except, I'd like to see a ref for the "Juliet Centric" part. I don't see a problem with the article's name being moved, and that process will not be endless. As far as polluting WP's history, I think it's the opposite, we should purposefully be saving the history. Also, talk pages are not a substitute for articles, that sounds like fan site stuff. I do think EPISODE is relevant, if we're ever going to have a page on this (which EPISODE speaks to), we should save this version's history. Maybe you could have redirected it towards the LOE, but now that's kind of out of our hands with this AfD. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine_Fisher_e4db.html" title="User:Peregrine Fisher">Peregrine Fisher</a> 02:51, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per similar situation with Not in Portland AfDs (I'll have to dig up links). We have a Lost guideline about this kind of stuff, and there's no content to the article. I'm very surprised to see many familiar names suddenly supporting keep when they've so passionately have fought off this kind of pre-mature article and topic stuff in the past. How is this different from all those other times? Delete this nothing of a page that only encourages fan speculation and lets create a clean article once it airs, even if it's soon. There's no reason whatsoever to set such a bad example when we bust our asses to prevent these kinds of things. Nothing of value to keep, at all. I also find it wildly ironic that people are citing WP:EPISODE, which discourages individual episode articles unless that specific episode is notable. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 06:23, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I have decided to <i>suggest</i> deletion of this article again. First, this article was deleted <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_SimCity_5_84b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/SimCity 5">before</a>, little has changed since then. Second, most of the information in this article can easily be placed in the "Future Updates" section of the existing <a href="../../../s/i/m/SimCity_4_c130.html" title="SimCity 4">SimCity 4</a> article. Third, very little is still confirmed of the next SimCity including the title of the game, so this article can not go very far at the moment. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamaron1_cdcc.html" title="User:Camaron1">Camaron1</a> 20:51, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Delete and Protect</b>: First of all, although SimCity 5 was confirmed in 2004, little has changed. In fact, the "proof" that SimCity 5 was being developed is all crystalballery, it only said "a new SimCity game". That could mean a number of things. Also, SimCity may or may not be developed by Maxis, it could be done by another of EA's lackeys.

<dd>I would like to point out that the comment made for a SimCity being in development in the 2007 outlook was very ambiguous.

I also <b>oppose merge</b>, as the existence of a SimCity 5 would not constitute an 'update' to SimCity 4. They are games in and of themselves.
