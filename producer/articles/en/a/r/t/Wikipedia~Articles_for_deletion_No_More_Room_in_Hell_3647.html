<li>Again, I only wish to point out that having this article here will help to inform the public community of what, to them, could be a potentially fun mod to try. By having information and links available, they can see for themselves if it sounds like something they would like to try. The article is interesting and useful in this way, and in no way causes any harm by existing. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChef_Brian_25af.html" title="User:Chef Brian">Chef Brian</a> 18:25, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry for being crude, but when the hell did I say that it was anything even remotely related to spam? When did I even say any of that? What I said was that it is a useful article among the PC gamer community. If you don't play PC games, then I understand your reluctance, but believe me when I say it will save many a gamer a migraine trying to find reliable info on the mod. Provided you give us the time to ensure the information is reliable, that is.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChef_Brian_25af.html" title="User:Chef Brian">Chef Brian</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/e/User_talk%7EChef_Brian_bf8e.html" title="User talk:Chef Brian">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chef_Brian_0c4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chef Brian">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, meaning we cover things that have already become notable and gotten coverage from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> per our <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy.

<li>Non-gamers may find that this is a "waste of space", but the fact remains that it is, in fact, a practical way for gamers to read up on one of the most notable zombie mods among the gaming community. It is not notable among the mainstream, but it is among the PC gaming community, and spreading the word on things you DON'T KNOW ABOUT is the entire point of an ENCYCLOPEDIA. Or did you forget that this was, in fact, an encyclopedia and not a big list of things people already know about? You're perpetuating the myth that all wikipedia users care about is mainstream information that everyone knows already, and that none of us care about the littler things that maybe, just maybe, few people outside of its main circle know about. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChef_Brian_25af.html" title="User:Chef Brian">Chef Brian</a> 19:49, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, "spreading the word" is NOT the point of an encyclopedia. Spreading the word is the point of advertising sites, news sites, and community sites. The point of an encyclopedia is to provide reliable information about important subjects. I'm not judging whether this is important or not, but I do question the reliability of the information: per policy, we cannot accept articles that are not backed up by reliable sources. And this one isn't; indeed, there <i>is</i> no reliable information available on this mod yet, because it <i>hasn't been released yet</i>. We <i>cannot</i> simply take the mod's authors' word for it that the mod will even ever exist: Wikipedia is <b>not</b> a crystal ball! Therefore, this article simply cannot be kept at present. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 19:57, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> Chef, I'll refer you to <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> as you are border-line here. Next, I am a very avid PC gamer (I had HL2 the day it came out. I own 9 working computers and get 5-6 hours of PC time in after I get home from work) and have heard about this mod via gaming boards. Please stop making assumtions on other people. Reguardless of all that, this does not meet wiki's policies for the points made here. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> 20:02, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Like Bschott, I'm a hardcore gamer (although I'm a console man), and I find this article... well, not a "waste of space", but an ad for a non-notable mod. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 21:37, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>this [is], in fact, an encyclopedia and not a big list of things people already know about</i> — Actually, per our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy, that is a rough approximation of what we are attempting to create here, and what a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a> encyclopaedia is.
<p><i>You're perpetuating the myth that all wikipedia users care about is mainstream information</i> — No, they aren't. But you are propounding the fallacy that "mainstream" and "already documented outside of Wikipedia" are equivalent.</p>
<p>The assertions here are that this article is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">unverifiable</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. The <i>only</i> way to counter those arguments is to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a>, filling up the References section of this article (which is currently empty) and demonstrating that it is possible to verify the article and that knowledge of the subject has been through a process of publication, fact checking, and peer review, and has already become a part of the corpus of human knowledge. All of the other arguments that you are making are irrelevant. Continue to argue along those lines, instead of citing sources, and you will not save the article. Please cite sources. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:02, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I was the one who helped create the first NMRiH wiki, and defended that one till the end. This one was the product of newbie forum members who had no idea about the first webpage.
