<p>Original research. Somebody's personal interpretation of the meaning of the song. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 22:34, Jan 29, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a controversial song so I tried to address the controversy. If it wanders a bit into original research then parts can be rewritten. The original author didn't address the controversy at all, which made it flawed, so I tried to fix it, while explaining the views of those who see it as anti-semitic and those who don't. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:09, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, cleanup and expand, notable song by the Sex Pistols. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 03:31, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I say <b>delete</b>. Lester Bangs wrote about it in one of his essays, the most common version was recorded live, there was a second version recorded with Ronnie Biggs and some more words, it emerged at a time when the band were severely pissed-off, and the title is a pun. That's about all you can write about 'Belsen was a Gas' in an encyclopaedic context without rambling. As an interesting paragraph in the entry for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Great_Rock_and_Roll_Swindle_8321.html" title="The Great Rock and Roll Swindle">The Great Rock and Roll Swindle</a> a mention would be fine, but this isn't it. Although I was only a kid at the time, the analysis seems badly flawed, unaware of the contemporary context, both social and personal; people were a lot less touchy about swastikas and Nazis at the time, Johnny Rotten enjoyed shocking people, and the song's notoriety came more from the trivial pun in the title than any accusations of anti-semitism, which itself was much less of a sin in the late 1970s. The lyrics seem to be a spew of disgust and self-hate, and the article's assertations are couched in the kind of 'some people argue that' weakness which disgusts me. -<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 22:34, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it was less controversial at the time then that's probably worth mentioning in the article. However the song, having been recorded, still exists today, and remains controversial in present context (with the Sex Pistols still very popular today). I was a little uncomfortable with the "original researchishness" of it, but I attempted to address the song based on what I know of it and whatever information I could get off google as I waded through hundreds of pages, mostly of lyrics and tabs. If the song is seen mocking the holocaust, or as advocating killing Jews, I can't see it being not a big deal, even in the '70s. Anyway, I took out a couple lines and added a bit on the pun, which I thought too obvious to mention before, but it may not be. I wouldn't have written an article on the song myself, but the stub that was written really didn't say anything so I tried to improve it. As you seem to know a bit about it, can you confirm the article's assertion (by the original author), that the song's only studio recording is lost? It seems that the Ronnie Biggs version would have to be a studio recording, as I can't see a guy who was on the lam performing at a live concert. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 00:01, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. Notable song by notable band. Good work, R. fiend! - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 23:10, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep. I don't think this is what was intended to be covered under "original research". Of course, documentation of the controversy would be very helpful. Nevertheless, the article overall was very informative, and the balance was factual. Agree with David Gerard. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 06:58, Jan 31, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Clear keep in current form. More on the controversy would be helpful. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 19:15, Jan 31, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There's lots to be said about this song; it's just as deserving of its own article as the many <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatles.html" title="Beatles">Beatles</a> songs already on Wikipedia. I'm pleased to see that someone has created an article about "Belsen" and I'll probably end up contributing to it. <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 21:17, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
