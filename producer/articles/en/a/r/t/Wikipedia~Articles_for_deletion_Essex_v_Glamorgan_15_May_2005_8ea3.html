<p>And basically every other article in the Category:2005 English cricket season matches, which is hundreds of articles. Wikiepdia is not: any spiel that comes out of the mouth of Bob Costas (or whoever his British equivalent is). I think several hundred thousand cricket games have been played in the world (multiply that times the number of sports out there) and we've got millions of poor articles, written in a completley unencyclopedic manner, that made the Tuesday paper and were lining parrot cages on Wednesday. Important games should have their own artciles, but these aren't them. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 15:37, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Transwiki</b> this and all other articles on recent individual cricket matches to Wikinews; failing that, do a proper merge</s>. <b>Abstain</b>. (I was unaware of the temporary nature of these pages.) These are not encyclopedia articles. They are news reports. I don't know how many cricket matches there are per year, but <a href="../../../m/l/b/MLB_d3e5.html" title="MLB">MLB</a> plays 2,430 regular-season games. Articles on the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Series_10cd.html" title="World Series">World Series</a> and national cricket championships belong in an encyclopedia; articles on individual games do not, unless there's something particularly interesting about them. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 16:01, July 15, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The articles cannot be merged because they are being transluded in multiple articles. Merging them into those articles would result in duplicate content and would be a maintenance nightmare. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 16:06, 15 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see that now. Merging would indeed be messy. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 17:03, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note also that the "national cricket championship matches" - akin to the baseball World Series - that Android79 speaks of, do not exist in England - instead, the regular season tables determine who becomes champion. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 16:09, 15 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then why not summarize the season as a whole? No doubt plenty of dead tree is used in England to describe the progress of the season as a whole and of individual teams during the season. This can be done without describing every match in excessive detail. I'm not very familiar with how Wikinews works, but it looks like there's <i>nothing</i> being added about cricket in England. This sort of content would be perfect there. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 17:03, July 15, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is correct, and it is exactly what we are doing - in a format very similar to what dead tree is used for in <i><a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisden_Cricketers%27_Almanack_6214.html" title="Wisden Cricketers' Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a></i>, a yearly dead tree publication in England (yes, it DOES describe every match in excessive detail). I can't see the harm in describing it - it is verifiable knowledge <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 19:02, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Unfortunately, it seems the other VfD came when I was out of town, and while I try to keep up with older VfDs I do miss some (particularly as VfD is so huge, a reason why I support several new speedy proposals). It seems that the main defense of these "articles" is that they are not to be their own pages but "sub-pages". What exactly is the difference? There's a "/" in the middle of the name? They still come up in Random page searches, they have all the characteristics of "real" pages, but with longer names. As someone pointed out recently <a href="../../../a/c/2F/AC_DC_2284.html" title="AC/DC">AC/DC</a> is not a subpage of <a href="../../../a/c/_/AC_4144.html" title="AC">AC</a>. That excuse is a cop-out. Are we going to see Giants vs. Brewers April 17, 1967? "Anderson hits it toward the rightfield wall, its going...going... it's good! Out of the park! The crowd is on their feet, Higgins and Maloney are brought home and this game is <i>far</i> from over!" (OK, I made all that up; I know very little about baseball, particularly from the 60's). -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:33, 15 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The main defence is that they're part of bigger articles on the entire season - and because each match is relevant to several articles, (in this case: <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_English_cricket_season_%2815-31_May%29_629a.html" title="2005 English cricket season (15-31 May)">2005 English cricket season (15-31 May)</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essex_County_Cricket_Club_in_2005_4f3a.html" title="Essex County Cricket Club in 2005">Essex County Cricket Club in 2005</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glamorgan_County_Cricket_Club_in_2005_fb9d.html" title="Glamorgan County Cricket Club in 2005">Glamorgan County Cricket Club in 2005</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_League_Division_One_in_2005_6027.html" title="National League Division One in 2005">National League Division One in 2005</a>. The reason why they have to be in the article namespace is so that the content can be picked up by mirrors such as answers.com <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 16:37, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> or transwiki to wikinews or a wikicities project. I, too, somehow missed <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Nottinghamshire_v_Yorkshire_26_June_2005_3978.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Nottinghamshire v Yorkshire 26 June 2005">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Nottinghamshire v Yorkshire 26 June 2005</a>, where I certainly would have voted to delete. Given the split result (quite a few merge, transwiki, and delete votes) I don't find it very useful as a precedent. I do find setting a precedent for including detailed results of all of the tens of thousands/year of regular season sports meets quite troubling. Last I checked the other two sports-related WikiPortal projects are wisely avoiding this level of granularity. Wikipedia is a <i>general interest encyclopedia</i>, not a <i>cricket</i> (or even sports) <i>almanac</i>. Several people expressed concern about this <b>major expansion</b> of Wikipedia's scope on the Village Pump a month ago<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=15178979#Unusual_transclusion_issue_not_covered_by_policy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=15178979#Unusual_transclusion_issue_not_covered_by_policy" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 21:13, 15 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And the argument you're using against it, that it's too detailed, flies in the face of wikipedia policy, especially <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper#No_size_limits" class="external autonumber" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper#No_size_limits" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 21:54, 15 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I obviously failed to make my point clear. My primary concerns are A) These are news items, not encyclopedia topics, and B) It is a major expansion of the scope of Wikipedia at a time that newpages and recent changes patrol are already overtaxed, so more vandalism and patent nonsense is making it into Wikipedia unchecked, and this expansion just exacerbates the problem. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 22:26, 15 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To A) I'd say that professional sports events have a significance beyond the event itself, and thus should be kept in an encyclopedia, to describe how the season progressed. We are a very detailed encyclopedia, like it or not. Point B) still comes under the No size limits policy. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 22:43, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This article (although sub-article would be a better word) feeds through to four separate articles (see "What links here").

It's quite proper that we should allow detailed coverage of cricket, just in the same way as we allow detailed coverage of Star Trek, Harry Potter or mathematics.

<li><b>Keep</b> Long-term benefit ... will be merged ... get a life ... blah blah blah. Nothing has changed from last week.

<li>Another question I feel I need to bring up: is anyone going to address the unencyclopedic and generally just plain poor writing style of these articles? My Giants/Brewers parody above was an exaggeration, but not enough of one. And I don't want to hear that that's how "Wisdens" does it. As it stands I think most of this info is terribly trivial. Why not do a season wrap-up with a chart giving the teams, final score, etc? The whole "this is part of a larger article" argument is crap. It's its own article, even if it is made into a "sub-page". -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:18, 17 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Can you grasp the "long term" thing? In the end, these articles will cease to be articles in their own right.

<ul>
<li>Yes, it is. What's the delay? If they're not going to be articles "in their own right" does that mean you will be merging them? Why not now? Why the poor prose? If this is a work in progress and these aren't <i>meant</i> too be articles then why not work on them offline? You seem to be admiting that these are news reports that will somehow become articles (well, not articles, because you just said they won't to be articles in their own right). So what exactly is the deal with them? -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:51, 17 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Can you specify exactly why you think this is poor prose? As far as I can see this is a description of how the match unfolded - yes, it includes vivid adjectives, but as far as I can see wikipedia doesn't ban vivid prose, and the article praises those who did well in the match - by perfectly objective criteria, such as scoring runs and getting people out. Merely quoting statistics and results, now THAT is poor prose (in fact, it's not prose at all...). Yes, it's in a newspapery style, but that's not forbidden either (see <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_writing_better_articles_3c0a.html#News_style" title="Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles">Wikipedia:Guide_to_writing_better_articles#News_style</a>). The only thing it possibly lacks is an introduction to the subject it treats - I can understand that. However, that is because the pages onto which it is transcluded (meaning that the entire content of the page is included) give an introduction to the topic already - it becomes obvious from the context of the page it is on. Reading "This was a game of cricket played in the National League in 2005" in every single section of <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_League_Division_Two_in_2005_39d1.html" title="National League Division Two in 2005">National League Division Two in 2005</a> gets, believe it or not, tedious.

<li>While I am no fan of the articles on individual episodes pf TV shows, there is a major difference in that these shows are often referenced and viewed multiple times. They are re-run. Many are available on DVD. This is not true of these sporting events (truly importnat games, such as finals, world cup, world series, etc. are the exception, and not included in this VfD). Ther is also a <i>huge</i> differenc in sheer numbers. A typical season for a TV series is about 25 shows.

<li>Um, who described that scenario? Smoddy sort of haphazardly mentioned something sort of like that, but has declined to go into the specifics. Everyone else seems to be defending these articles as "part of bigger articles on the entire season", which seems to mean they are detailed breakouts, with no scheduled deletion at the season's end. If I'm wrong here someone please correct me. There's been some talk of moving these to "sub-pages", but such subpages are still separate articles. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:40, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>It's the assumption the editors of these pages, me incldued, have been working on for most of the time - sorry for not making that explicit enough. When the season is over near the end of September, we'll do a rewrite and copyedit of all the articles on the season, and then use "subst" or something to remove the transclusion, which will make this article content fairly redundant, so it can be deleted. But I suppose that isn't good enough either? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 20:53, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Firstly, I am not Sam Vimes (unless I am bilocating in South <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a> and Norway...). Secondly, I didn't see that. The options are
<ol>
<li>Have absolutely nothing in the main article namespace until well after the end of the season. This is possible, but undesirable, because we can have something now.</li>
<li>Do what we're doing: have slightly odd articles until the end of the season, then quickly merge them into good, coherent articles. That will happen in the fullness of time.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Basically, I think this whole ugly affair comes down to a failure of communication of intent. Perhaps this should have been better-documented. But, as it is, it hasn't been.

<li>Sorry about confusing you with Sam; this discussion is getting rather complicated. I think this discussion sort of boils down to a question of "temporary articles". As far as I can tell, no such thing exists in WP policy, and this is the first I have heard of it. That is not to say such things are inherently contrary to policy, but it does bring up some questions that go well beyond this VfD.

<li>I'd suggest putting a boilerplate notice of some kind on each of the subpages' talk pages; there's at least a chance that those would get noticed. Now that I know what these articles are being used for now and that they're only temporary, I have changed my mind. I still think they would be better off on Wikinews, or at least in User space, but I can see that argument is going nowhere. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 23:11, July 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've created a new heading here to make adding comments easier for we who have size limits with our browsers, and to try to open a discussion of temporary articles in general (see my comments above). I had never heard of such a thing before, and I think it warrants some discussion. While I think this is a good place to formulate such a discussion, I think it should soon be brought elsewhere. If I am incorrect and there is a policy or precedent for temporary articles, please point me in the right direction. Thanks. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:25, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Almost all things in WP are done without there being an explicit policy saying you can do it. Really, as long as what is being done is within the aim of improving and/or adding to the encyclopaedia, it should be encouraged. New ideas, methods, approaches will be developed as we progress. Whilst they should accord to the normal WP style, we'd be fools to ourselves to prevent them on the grounds that as nobody has thought of it before, there is no explicit "policy" saying you can do it!

<dd>I think it's a bad idea to have temporary article snippets in the main article namespace. There are ample policies and precedents that describe what a wikipedia article should be--temporary article snippets that do not meet these criteria and that never will themselves be expanded to legitimate artices have no business being in the namespace, even temporarily. Anything else requires a change of policy with a broad consensus--a couple of very obscure VFDs is not enough to justify such big change in what is acceptable as an article. If it's such a wonderful idea, why is there so much resistence to getting a broad consensus for it? (By the way, when these articles are no longer wanted, don't they have to go through the existing, labor-intensive deletion policy, or are snippets exempt from this policy as well?) <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPRiis_d9fa.html" title="User:PRiis">PRiis</a> 19:14, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When you say keep "them" I assume you mean keep redirects, otherwise we're back where we started. As for PRiis's comments, I'm tempted to agree. While I suppose it might not be against policy to have temporary articles, it does seem just sort of, well, strange. It also sort of opens a door that I'm sure can be abused. While I realize wikiepdia itself will always be a work in progress, this creation just to delete seems sort of contrary to wikipedia, in a way. Now, should this discussion be moved to a policy page somewhere, because that's where this is going? I think such a move would also get opinions from a wider perspective outside of this VfD. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 19:51, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think anyone can accuse the Cricket WikiProject of being bad for Wikipedia - indeed, it has done much good work for Wikipedia - and has many featured articles and featured lists to its credit. The WikiProject can hardly be compared to an instance of a rogue editor, or a newbie not used to WP ways - it would be easy to distinguish circumstances where what is happening here is being used as a precedent where it shouldn't be, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 20:16, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't seen anyone accusing Wikiproject Cricket as being bad for Wikipedia. This VfD is about a somewhat small portion of the project, and this section at the bottom is about temporary articles, which should be seen as a separate issue entirely. This is a new thing, as far as I can tell, and if there's no policy on them there should be, whether the policy is "no temporary articles" or simple rules/guidelines for how they are used. There are issues here. Who decides what articles are temporary? I assume the originator, but since no one "owns" WP articles what happens if a contributor objects to their temporary status? How do we prevent the use of them from being abused, and people from using temporariness as an excuse for poor articles, or ones that are early stages of works-in-progress that are a jumble of cut-and-paste messes from other sources? (I am not accusing Wikiproject Cricket of doing this, but I can see it happening somewhere in Wikipedia.) At the very least there should be a template:temporary for each such article, and there should be discussion among general Wikipedians. Again, that should occur elsewhere, as it is not really a VfD issue. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 06:04, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I haven't seen anyone except smoddy suggest these articles are temporary. If that is true then keep them in the User namespace, the Project Cricket (which I am not challenging) namespace, or anywhere but the main article namespace. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 13:46, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why the concerted and continuous attack? They were subpages to begin with. That was attacked as being not in keeping with page-naming, so they were moved to separate pages. Now the subpages are being VfD'd one by one. When there is no consensus to delete the first, they move on to the next. Now you want them userified? Why the systemic attack on one of the top two sports in the world? Any First Class cricket match is at least as noteworthy as a minor character in a Harry Potter book, or a DS9 episode, and they don't even get VfD'd. Or are you saying that first class cricket matches are less important than minor Pokemon characters? <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 14:03, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
