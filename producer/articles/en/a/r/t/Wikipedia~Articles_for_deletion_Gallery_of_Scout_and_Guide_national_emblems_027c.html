<li><b>Comment</b>: (edit conflict) I don't see how it does. The guidelines are very clear that the logos can only be used to <i>illustrate the scouting organization in question</i>. They're not doing that here.

<li>This is an interesting gallery, and has the potential to be a useful annotated gallery/encyclopedia article. However, my non-lawyer legal interpretation is that use as a comparison between the Scouting organisations in question is a definite legal no-no. From the looks of things, all images are already located on the papropriate pages, and if not, they are categorised at <a href="../../../s/c/o/Category%7EScout_logos_8032.html" title="Category:Scout logos">Category:Scout logos</a>, so there will be no potential loss of information. If a verified lawyer can say that use in this fashion is legal under "fair use", <b>keep</b>.

<li>Saberwyn, this gallery represents a year and half of very hard work on the part of many dedicated Wikipedians. The original idea (my own, so of course I want to save it) was based on <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallery_of_sovereign_state_coats_of_arms.html" title="Gallery of sovereign state coats of arms">Gallery of sovereign state coats of arms</a> specifically to show the unity, the uniqueness and the local evolution of a very simple emblem to one that represents so much history and pride. This year is the 100th anniversary of Scouting, and I would be happy to implement any changes to save this article. It is no longer just a gallery, and as you say has the potential to be a useful annotated gallery/encyclopedia article. What can we do to make this something able to be kept? Any improvements and suggestions would be most valuable. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKintetsubuffalo_0363.html" title="User:Kintetsubuffalo">Chris</a> 05:49, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Please explain how, by deleting this photo gallery, it will ruin the work?

<li><b>reply</b> easily. The gallery (now the beginning of an article) <i>is</i> the work, and like the coat of arms gallery is a ready reference where the Wikipedian can see and compare 400 related emblems without having to sift through and open separately those 400 articles. It is useful in its own right. I have no objection to either merging this in its entirety to a related article, or building the existing article into a better one. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKintetsubuffalo_0363.html" title="User:Kintetsubuffalo">Chris</a> 06:25, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm sorry, but <i>I don't know</i> how to save this article in its current form. The fair use rules for organisation logos (as I understand them) are that the logo should only be used to illustrate an article on the organisation the logo belongs to. Under the rules, using "fair use" images in this way is (to my knowledge) not permissable. I'll say that a sourced, externally verifiable text article about the Scouting logo would be one way to go from here, but unfortunately, I cannot see a way for this not to be deleted. It is a shame; being an ex-Rover it is interesting to see all the logos laid out like that (the only other time I'd seen it done was on a poster sold at the last World Jamboree), but my liking it does not trump copyright law. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">saberwyn</a> 06:11, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The question here is simply a legal one. Maybe it could be argued that these are illustrating their Scout organisation on a list of all such organisations in the world. Maybe it can not be so argued. There seems to be a feeling that it would be valuable if it was legal. As Chris has said this has been a lot of work (none of it mine) and this is an important year for Scouting. Can someone ask the Wikimedia Foundation lawyer to rule on this and in the meantime put this AfD on hold? A US based Admin not involved with <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Scouting_b499.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Scouting">Wikipedia:WikiProject Scouting</a> would be best. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 06:08, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: I am withdrawing my delete nomination. I am not proposing merging every emblem into 400 separate articles (as someone indicated above), but perhaps put this in context on another major article, or use some of the images more extensively elsewhere. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 06:42, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - it is <i>such</i> a pity if this article will be deleted, but it currently <i>does</i> violate fair use.

<li><b>Comment</b> - This issue isn't just a legal issue. I think I'm on solid ground when I say that under US copyright law, the doctrine of <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> makes us perfectly free to have this article. If the law were the only issue, that's a non-issue. If this were Gallery of news media photos, forget it, we would be infringing on their right to exclusively market their product. But a gallery of logos of non-profit organizations should not be a problem UNDER THE LAW. It is, however, a problem on WIKIPEDIA. Our <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIR_1f27.html" title="WP:FAIR">fair use policy</a> is intentionally more restrictive than what we could get away with. This is because Wikipedia is a free-content encyclopedia. We only use non-free images under a claim of fair use when it is a necessity - we don't have articles that contain no free content. Sometimes, this is inconvenient. Sometimes it's annoying. I am a Scouter and have been involved with Scouting for 20 years. I like this article. I enjoy looking at it. But, for the ultimate goal of being a free-content encyclopedia, we sometimes have to make compromises and one of them is that we don't have articles containing nothing but non-free images. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 17:59, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
