<li><b>Keep</b>: Per Skudrafan1. S/he's right that there's precedent for keeping and I don't think this is a bad way to go. This particular article could be made more encyclopedic with some actual writing but it's a good and useful reference point even as is. Every individual sports team article gets deluged with news about each individual season anyway so why not split them into individual articles? I'm planning on doing the same when the baseball season starts. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 17:17, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Note</b>: For an example of what these pages look like with "actual writing" and some references, see <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006-07_Buffalo_Sabres_season_bea1.html" title="2006-07 Buffalo Sabres season">2006-07 Buffalo Sabres season</a>. <a href="../../../s/k/u/User%7ESkudrafan1_6e41.html" title="User:Skudrafan1">Skudrafan1</a> 17:23, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, that's a better example. Articles that are 95% reference tables and only 5% prose are sure to be brought to AFD. But, at least for baseball team articles, people love to write details about every transaction and how they affected the team, etc., etc., so why not break it into a separate article instead of continually removing it and saying it's too much detail? After all, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. A sporting almanac is still an encyclopedia, and I would like to see the nom justify "not notable" in this sense. Focussing on an individual season for each team is no different than focussing on individual episodes of any given television series. So long as the articles have enough prose to provide sufficient context, they basically become historical documents on sports teams seasons. As the season completes, the prose for all teams will become much more significant, and this is something I have attempted to focus on in my articles for the Calgary Flames. see: <a href="../../../c/a/l/Category%7ECalgary_Flames_seasons_e091.html" title="Category:Calgary Flames seasons">Category:Calgary Flames seasons</a>. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 19:06, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Skudrafan1. Why should this article be deleted? As Skudrafan1 said, the other professional sports also have this concept. Also, as Skudrafan1 correctly pointed out, all 32 National Football League (NFL) teams have an article for their 2006 season. It isn't very fair to nominate a hockey article for deletion if it's similar in concept to the one used for the NHL, especially if the reason is because hockey isn't as popular a sport in America as NFL Football is. <a href="../../../k/s/y/User%7EKsy92003_bc45.html" title="User:Ksy92003">Ksy92003</a> 22:24, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b>, Absolutely keep, I love this new idea 'NHL team seasons' articles. When &amp; If all 30 NHL team seasons articles are created, then 'NHL seasons' can be moved from NHL team articles &amp; re-directed to these sister articles. Perfect for shortening NHL team articles, plus the NHL team seasons articles, have more room for more elaborate Team season information. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodDay_3ee1.html" title="User:GoodDay">GoodDay</a> 23:39, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>No problem. I had been holding onto this idea for some time, wondering if it would fit on Wikipedia, but the success with which the <a href="../../../n/f/l/WP%7ENFL_68e4.html" title="WP:NFL">WP:NFL</a> and <a href="../../../c/f/b/WP%7ECFB_6e26.html" title="WP:CFB">WP:CFB</a> has had with the concept for their leagues convinced me to go ahead with it for hockey. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 01:19, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Overwhelming precedent suggests that NHL, NFL, and other sports can have individual season articles.
