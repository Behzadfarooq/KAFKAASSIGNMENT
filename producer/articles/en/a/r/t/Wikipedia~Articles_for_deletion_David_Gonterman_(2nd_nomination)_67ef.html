<p>This article has been deleted before at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_David_Gonterman_fd2b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/David Gonterman">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/David Gonterman</a>. I had actually thought this article was vanity when the first sentence said that he was "infamous for the quality of his work". But it's not. Although I didn't know about the previous nomination when I made this one, my reasons are similar, in that "only thing that he appears to be notable for is being a loser on the Internet". We have links to his deviantart account, his fan fiction and his freehost webcomics. I really think that this famed talentless internet hack fails both notability and verifiability criterias at Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 02:05, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I can't say I'd be heartbroken if the article is deleted, but I made it (didn't know there was one before) because Gonterman does appear to be notable on the Internet. He has a large Portal of Evil forum dedicated to him and a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=david+gonterman" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=david+gonterman" rel="nofollow">Google search</a> for Gonterman also returns some 13,700 hits. He is mentioned on numerous forums and newsgroups, as well. I would, however, support <b>merging</b> him into <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">Internet phenomenon</a> since I think he at least qualifies for that. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 22:04, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> I at least tried to establish notability via the third party publication of one of his comics. Another popular story about him is that he influenced the <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> comicbook by launching a number of severe rants and sending hate mail to the comicbook's authors. However, I couldn't find any verification of said tale. If true, it would make him notable. Does anyone know where verification of the story might be found? <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 22:10, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Question</b> - Can I just clear this up. Is the reason he's famed due to the fact that he's perceived to be a perpetual failure? - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 02:36, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't go so far as to say "perpetual failure" - he's just one of the (unfortunately large) number of members of the fandom who have a much higher opinion of their own creative talents than most other people do, and is rather more vocal about it than others. Not in the same league of notoriety as, say, Dennis "Quozl" Falk or Bart "Nekobe" Bervoets, neither of whom (thankfully) have articles here. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 09:53, 14 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>He's also not a "perpetual failure" as his art studio does actually make money and all indications seem to say he's actually grown up considerably since his early days on the web. He's even been known to go on the POE forum and talk with those who don't like him. For whatever reason, he's simply gained more noteriety in several large fandoms (Sailor Moon and Sonic, specifically) than most fanfic and fanart creators ever do. Given the size and longevity of the reaction to him (the POE forum is still active and I've found many forum posts about him that are recent), he doesn't seem to be a simple "flash in the pan" notorious figure, but a person almost being used as a textbook/historical example today. That's the best argument for notability I can think of. Whether that's good enough to keep his own article, I don't know. One reason I made it was to see what the consensus might be. I also found an email about the Gonterman writing to <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Penders_a625.html" title="Ken Penders">Ken Penders</a> <a href="http://www.commuterbarnacle.com/gonterman/repas.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.commuterbarnacle.com/gonterman/repas.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, but it hardly counts as a reliable source, unfortunately.</dd>
<dd>Can we have a consensus on whether he qualifies as an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomena.html" title="Internet phenomena">Internet phenomena</a>? He's been talked about on the web consistently for 5+ years, which is certainly longer than many of the things listed there (such as eon8, Chuck Norris, or the Numa Numa Dance). A mention there may be all he's worth. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 18:35, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
