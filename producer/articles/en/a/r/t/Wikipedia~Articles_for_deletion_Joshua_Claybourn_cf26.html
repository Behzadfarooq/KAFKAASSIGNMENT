<li>I didn't want to reply or give a reason, but apparently an anonymous comment has caused me to speak out. The only evidence of notability, apparently, is in article in Evansville Courier &amp; Press, IN on Dec 28, 2004. Is he notable locally? Yes. Does that warrant his inclusion into the Wikipedia? No. Has he been Slashdotted? No. My answer still remains the same. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 06:40, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>AllyUnion, you really didn't do your homework. How about full feature spreads in the Dall Morning News and the Indianapolis Star? What about regular articles in World magazine and National Review? The Evansville paper is one of the most insignificant of his pieces. And he's been Slahdotted too. --Anon 09:40, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Does my library get every major newspaper? No. Do I live in Midwest? No. Show me a link to a nationally read newspaper that is commonly sent across the United States for people to read. More people pick up a local copy of the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Times_ea99.html" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a> and the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> than the Indianapolis Star... since the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Times_ea99.html" title="Los Angeles Times">LA Times</a> is the second largest metropolian newspaper in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> is the first in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. If I wanted a Midwest paper, I'd pick up the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Tribune_3abd.html" title="Chicago Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>. If you were on TV on your local television station, even if it was Southern <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>, I would not claim notability for you. If you were on the front page of the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Chronicle_5d76.html" title="San Francisco Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>, maybe. And I doubt that Joshua Claybourn's material was front page material on the Indianapolis Star. Now, if you made an ass of yourself on national television, like say... <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Hung_60a2.html" title="William Hung">William Hung</a> then somehow got famous, I'd claim for notability.<br />
I am going to show my google search work in regards to Slashdot: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Joshua+Claybourn+site:slashdot.org" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=Joshua+Claybourn+site:slashdot.org" rel="nofollow">Google Search for "Joshua Claybourn site:slashdot.org"</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=link:www.joshclaybourn.com+slashdot" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=link:www.joshclaybourn.com+slashdot" rel="nofollow">Google Search for "link:www.joshclaybourn.com slashdot"</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=link:www.intheagora.com+slashdot" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=link:www.intheagora.com+slashdot" rel="nofollow">Google Search for "link:www.intheagora.com slashdot"</a>. All these turn no results. The first one is searching for his name on slashdot. Nothing. The second one is finding if the word 'slashdot' occurs in any of the sites linking to www.joshclaybourn.com. Also nothing. The third one is finding if the word 'slashdot' occurs of any pages currently linking to his current blog. Again... nothing. A search on Slashdot itself under "Stories" does not show any definate hits, all of them are "0.1"; I still see no reason why to keep this. I did my homework, stop deluding yourself. The way you write seems like you're a rabid obessed fan who wants nothing more for more publicity for Mr. Claybourn. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 09:35, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>A reasonably well-known blogger although not in the top echelon. Has written for other publications including National Review Online.

<li>Definite <b>keep</b> as it stands now. I recognize his name, and I spend as little time as possible on right-wing blogs. "joshua claybourn" OR "josh claybourn" yields <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22joshua+claybourn%22+OR+%22josh+claybourn%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22joshua+claybourn%22+OR+%22josh+claybourn%22" rel="nofollow">104,000 Google hits</a>, for heaven's sake. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 10:48, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>We all know (or should know) that bloggers and blogging manipulate the Google page ranking mechanism. Moreover, <i>my</i> (real) name has thousands of Google hits and is recognized by people, too. Yet I don't have, nor expect, an encyclopaedia entry solely on that basis. Wikipedia isn't Google by another name, nor is it a repository of currucula vitae. What makes Joshua Claybourn <b>notable</b>? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:37, 2005 Jan 11 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>similarly my real name gets lots of hits on google - a sizeable number because of me (although I do share a name with an Australian rugby league player and a Canadian academic), as I have had an internet presence since about 1998, and my site gets top spot on two or three different google searches, and on the first page in a couple more. I've also had a few poems published in different anthologies. That doesn't make me notable, and so there isn't a Wikipedia article about me (or my namesakes for that matter - both of whom (imho) are more deserving of one than me (at this moment in time certainly). What makes one of the top 200 bloggers notable? Do we have articles on any of the others?. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 16:54, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are 51 articles so far in <a href="../../../b/l/o/Category%7EBloggers_c891.html" title="Category:Bloggers">Category:Bloggers</a>. Claybourn fits comfortably into this category. I've wikified the article, by the way. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 19:17, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That there are 51 articles in that category doesn't say anything about whether Joshua Claybourn should be added to it. Indeed, picking six articles from that category at random, I discover in each case there is something significant about the person that can be pointed to <i>aside</i> from a mundane curriculum vitae of going to school, writing for newspapers, running a web-log, being in the "top 200", and having a home page. There's nothing, despite your edits, that makes Joshua Claybourne stand out in similar fashion. I'll ask again the question that you have failed to answer: What makes Joshua Claybourn <b>notable</b>? I'm in the top 200 of some things. May I have my curriculum vitae published on Wikipedia, too? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:29, 2005 Jan 11 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>His opinions on politics, religion and society are widely discussed across a wide swath of the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogosphere.html" title="Blogosphere">blogosphere</a>. He also meets the <i>print</i> published author test from <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>. It is not formatted as or nearly as extensive as a CV would be. It has room for expansion discussing these opinions and how he presents them, and putting this into context. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 00:07, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>widely discussed across a wide swath of the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogosphere.html" title="Blogosphere">blogosphere</a></i> — But not anywhere else, such as on Google Groups. He gets a mere 10 hits, yielding only 4 distinct references. As I pointed out above, bloggers and blogging manipulate the Google page ranking mechanism. However, as has been recently pointed out elsewhere on VfD, they don't manipulate Google Groups, and the Google Groups Test seems to be, currently, an effective tool for blowing away the blogger-created fog. I get nearly 1000 times as many Google Groups hits as Joshua Claybourn does. May I have my curriculum vitae published on Wikipedia, too? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:20, 2005 Jan 14 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>It is not formatted as or nearly as extensive as a CV would be.</i> — but reads exactly like one, nonetheless.

<li><b>Keep</b> as it stands now. Blogger Joshua Claybourn is certainly in the top echelon of well-known bloggers for his hand in numerous blogs. He's not "one of the top 200 bloggers" but "one of the 200 most influential authors on the web", which is significantly more different. "joshua claybourn" isn't a common name and the Google hits are his alone. The entry should stay.

<li><b>Keep</b>. One of the top 50 bloggers in the world and one of the top 200 writer on the Net. Besides, as others noted here, it's in keeping with other blogger profiles. <s>Sammy 21:34, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</s>
<ul>
<li>"most influential authors on the web", when written in a blogging magazine with a target readership of bloggers, translates into English as "bloggers". Moreover, "top 10/20/100/200" lists in magazines are rarely backed up with hard data. (Oftentimes they are constructed by the editor and a group of mates in the pub.) And even when they are, those data should be treated with suspicion by encylopaedists. ("top 10/20/100/200" lists derived from reader polls are self-selected and usually more topical than true. A readers poll of "influential authors" in a blogging magazine is going to yield more than the appropriate share of other bloggers.) <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:02, 2005 Jan 12 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>One of the top 50 bloggers in the world</i> — The article has never said that. <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Where's your reference for that?</a> Are you using <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a>'s inclusion of Joshua Claybourn in <a href="../../../b/l/o/Category%7EBloggers_c891.html" title="Category:Bloggers">Category:Bloggers</a> as the evidence for this?

<li><i>as others noted here, it's in keeping with other blogger profiles</i> — I've noted here that it <i>is not</i> in keeping with the other blogger biographies. The <i>other</i> biographies all mention at least one thing about the person that makes them stand out from the "went to school X, wrote for newspaper Y, runs a web-log, has a home page" crowd. So far, <i>nothing</i> of that ilk has been put forward for Joshua Claybourn.

<li>btw - in the future, perhaps there should be a mechanism to contact copyright holders first, <i>e.g. email</i>? I would think false, or at least <i>not completely researched</i> accusations of copyright violation could be just as damaging to the WikiPedia as the act infringement.</li>

<li>question - is this really an issue of politics I'm seeing here?

<li><b>Delete</b>. I imagine a few bloggers could be notable - if they were caught up in historical events for example. I can't see anything that makes this one notable - not even close on the professor test. We might as well have bio articles on the top 100 Wikipedians. - <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 08:55, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>good idea - I for one would be very interested in both a top 100 Wikipedians<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedian" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedian" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, perhaps the metric being contributions in combination w/bandwidth to said articles ... and similarly for the top 100 bloggers<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, as this form of new media is causing some <i>Rather<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rathergate" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rathergate" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></i> interesting ripples in the political landscape.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not notable enough for my blood, even with the direct e-mail appeal. Merely posting to a blog does not make one notable, unless the blog is itself a unique perspective (<a href="../../../s/a/l/Salam_Pax_59d4.html" title="Salam Pax">Salam Pax</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/n/Wonkette.html" title="Wonkette">Wonkette</a>). While we're at it, though, are we also going to delete Josh Claybourn? - <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJredmond_3335.html" title="User:Jredmond">jredmond</a> 15:29, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>For the record, I too received a direct email appeal. As for Josh Claybourn, I suggest a redirect to Joshua Claybourn, and the same (if any) action taken against that page as against this. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 15:39, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very weak keep</b>, but heavily <a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia%7ECleanup_89e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Cleanup">cleanup</a>. When I got a email from him, I was tempted to vote to delete because I don't really like the tactic. But upon further reflection, it seems like this guy is fairly well-known within the world of blogs and has written some articles for some widely-known publications. This seems to be a very borderline case. However, the page right now sounds like more of a publicity bio rather than a real NPOV article. Someone who is familiar with the blogosphere should rework the article, maybe with some criticisms of his opinions. Also, this whole debate seems to be a good justification for a policy against <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">autobiography</a>.-<a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClipdude_4417.html" title="User:Clipdude">Clipdude</a> 00:01, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
