<p>this is about the jonas brothers and me see i love them!</p>
<p>ok heres some lyics to some of their songs:</p>
<p>underdog: She?s an underdog Lives next door to me She?s always heard you won?t amount to anything And it kills me to watch the agony beyond her eyes Tragic the way people pass her by But now I realize</p>
<p>(Chorus) That everyone sees her But nobody knows her She screams in her pillow For a better tomorrow She hates it But she takes it Watch out for that girl One day she may change the world</p>
<p>(2nd Verse) She?s original Never trying to fit in She?s got a way to always go Against the grain Oh yea! Someday they?ll see how beautiful she really is I know that last will be the first The tables gonna turn cause?</p>
<p>(Chorus) That everyone sees her But nobody knows her She screams in her pillow For a better tomorrow She hates it But she fakes it Watch out for that girl One day she may change the world</p>
<p>(Bridge) Maybe she?ll be in a movie Maybe she?ll be in a song Better pay her some attention Before she?s gone</p>
<p>(Additional Lyrics) She?s an underdog Yea She means the world to me Yea</p>
<p>(Chorus) Everyone sees her But nobody knows her She screams in her pillow For a better tomorrow She hates it But she makes it Watch out for that girl One day she may change the world</p>
<p>(Chorus) Everyone sees her But nobody knows her She screams in her pillow For a better tomorrow She hates it But she makes it Watch out for that girl One day she may change the world</p>
<p><br />
6 minutes: She?s the kinda girl that you see in the movies Seen her in my dreams and now she?s standing next to me Down by the shore first weekend of the summer Gotta take chance and just ask for her number I wish I had a song on MTV Cause in crowded room I?d be the only one shed see She?s looking bored and now I?m running out of time I?ve only got six minutes if I?m gunna make her mine</p>
<p>One minute and the earth begins to shake two minutes and my hearts begins to break Another minute and she makes me feel brand new That?s just three minutes with you Four minutes and she?s everything I see Five minutes and shes that were I wanna be Another 6minutes everything feels so new That?s just six minutes with you I need six minutes</p>
<p>She?s looking at her watch while the dj is spinning This could be the end or its just the beginning She?s the kinda girl that I wanna know better Reaching for her keys so I guess it?s now or never I wish that I was on the radio I?d sing her favorite song she?d be front row at every show This parties lame and now I?m running out of time I?ve only got six minutes if I?m gunna make her mine</p>
<p>One minute and the earth begins to shake Two minutes and my hearts begins to break Another minute and she makes me feel brand new That?s just three minutes with you Four minutes and she?s everything I see Five minutes and that were I wanna be Another minutes everything feels so new I need six minutes with you Six minutes</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like the catcher in the rye Sometimes I wish that I could catch her eye Sometimes I wish that I could be that guy (that guy, that guy, that guy)</p>
<p>Yeah?time is passing by I?m losing my mind I need 1?2?3?4?5?6 minutes with you</p>
<p>One minute and the earth begins to shake Two minutes and my hearts begins to break Another minute and she makes me feel brand new That?s just three minutes with you Four minutes and she?s everything I see Five minutes and that were I wanna be Another minute everything feels so new I need six minutes with you Six minutes</p>
<p><br />
7:05: We had a lot of good times when we were together And I thought we?d last forever, you and I Eyeing for so long I couldn?t wait to get you?re phone call Dreaming&#160;?bout you makes me feel alright Tonight you called me on the phone Said you had to stay at home Is there something I should know?</p>
<p>I was fine till 7:05 Till she walked out the door and right out of my life If you?re gone ill move on But it only would have taken two seconds to say Goodbye (goodbye) Goodbye (goodbye) Goodbye (woahwoo)</p>
<p>The night after you?re phone call me and friends were hanging at the mall I was not believing what I saw (Whoa) holding hands with him and sitting closer then six inches Hoping she?s not gunna kiss him now</p>
<p>How can I call you a friend, you stood me up in the end I know that it?s over</p>
<p>I was fine till 7:05 Till she walked out the door and right out of my life If you?re gone I?ll move on But it only would of taken two seconds to say Goodbye (goodbye) Goodbye (goodbye) Goodbye (woahwoo)</p>
<p>Don?t keep telling me that yore sorry now But let me tell you how much this hurts me too (Yeah ooo)</p>
<p>I was fine till 7:05 Till she walked out the door and right out of my life If you?re gone ill move on But it only would have taken two seconds to say Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye (woahwoo)</p>
<p>I was fine till 7:05 Till she walked out the door and right out of my life If you?re gone ill move on But it only would have taken two seconds to say Goodbye (goodbye) Goodbye (goodbye) Goodbye (woahwoo)</p>
<p>It only would of taken to seconds to say (Good bye goodbye) Good bye (good bye) Good Bye (woo) Goodbye</p>
<p>poor unfortunate souls: I admit that in the past I've been a nasty They weren't kidding when they called me kinda change But you'll find that nowadays I've mended all my ways Repented, seen the light, and made a change And I fortunately know a little secret It's a talent that I always have possessed And dear lady, please don't laugh I use it on behalf Of the miserable, the lonely, and depressed (pathetic)</p>
<p>Poor unfortunate souls In pain In need This one longing to be thinner That one wants to get the girl And do I help them? Yes, indeed! Those poor unfortunate souls So sad So true They come flocking to me crying "Will you help us, pretty please?" And I help them! Yes I do!</p>
<p>The men up there don't like a lot of blabber They think a girl who gossips is a bore! Yes on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word And after all dear, what is idle patter for? They're not all that impressed with conversation True gentlemen avoid it when they can But they dote and swoon and fawn On ladies who withdrawn It's she who holds her tongue who gets a man</p>
<p>Poor unfortunate souls Go ahead! Make your choice! I'm a very busy person and I haven't got all day It won't cost much Just your voice! Those poor unfortunate souls So sad So true If you wanna cross the bridge, my sweet You've got the pay the toll Take a gulp Take a breath Go ahead Sign the scroll Nick and Kevin Now I've got her, boys The boss is on a roll You poor unfortunate souls</p>
<p>In pain In need This one longing to be thinner That one wants to get the girl And do I help them? Yes, indeed! Those poor unfortunate souls So sad So true They come flocking to me crying "Will you help us, pretty please?" And I help them! Yes I do!</p>
<p>Those poor unfortunate souls</p>
